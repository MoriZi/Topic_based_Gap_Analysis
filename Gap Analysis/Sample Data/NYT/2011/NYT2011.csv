Who Could Become the Data Sheriff?,"In an article I wrote for the Week in Review section last Sunday, I noted that no federal laws existed to punish companies when customers' personal information and data were stolen in cyber-attacks, or mishandled by companies. And so punishment in these cases is left up to the states. Yet in many instances, state officials don't have the resources to tackle this problem, and even acknowledge that they don't always understand the technical aspects of breaches. Some government officials, though, are pressing for new federal legislation on this subject. Senator Al Franken, the former comedian and a Democrat from Minnesota, is one of them. As chairman of a new Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy and technology, he held a hearing on Tuesday and questioned Google and Apple executivesabout storing customers' locations without their knowledge on mobile devices. Representatives from Apple and Google defended their data collection practices, noting that location information was anonymous. But Mr. Franken said the problem was that ""these breaches of privacy can have real consequences for real people."" Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and the former attorney general of that state, has also been pressing Congress to adopt new laws that would hold companies accountable for data breaches. Mr. Blumenthal has publicly chided Sony for its slow response to a cyber-attack last month that could have resulted in the theft of private information of 77 million customers. A House subcommittee has also been holding hearings over the past month to question Sony as well as Epsilon, an e-mail marketing company that also suffered a hacking attack resulting in the loss of millions of e-mail addresses. The Securities and Exchange Commission is  being urged by senators to create new rules that would require companies to immediately disclose when they have been the victim of a cyber-attack, specifically when personal information has been compromised. To date, some states require that companies notify customers within seven days of an attack, but these laws are loose and vary per state. But many privacy experts I spoke with said that privacy legislation had been presented to Congress in the past, but never seemed to become law. Some argued that the current discussion in Congress would not result in strict enough rules anyway. ""The government clearly needs better security and data protection rules,"" said Eugene Spafford, a security expert and professor at Purdue University. He suggested that the Federal Trade Commission should set up data protection standards and have the ability to discipline companies that did not comply with those rules. ""The government should be looking at financial institutions who are doing a very good job protecting information online as these companies have a tradition of understanding risk,"" Mr. Spafford suggested. Ken Johnson, senior adviser and spokesman for Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican who is chairwoman of a Congressional privacy subcommittee, said one of the legislative roadblocks in the past had been ""jurisdictional squabbling."" Mr. Johnson said the string of data breaches in recent months would hopefully lead regulators to ""put aside political squabbles, and do what's best for consumers."" One piece of legislation that seems to have bipartisan support was introduced in April by Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona. The bill, the Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2011, would require companies to adopt specific security rules if they decided to store people's private information.   "
Senator Introduces Online Security Bill,"Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced a new bill Thursday that aims to protect citizens' personal information from online data breaches. The bill would also punish companies that are careless with customers'  information. ""The goal of the proposed law is essentially to hold accountable the companies and entities that store personal information and personal data and to deter data breaches,"" Senator Blumenthal said in a phone interview. ""While looking at past data breaches, I've been struck with how many are preventable."" The new bill, called the Personal Data Protection and Breach Accountability Act of 2011, comes at a time when online privacy and security are hot topics in Congress. The White House has also been involved in discussions around new online privacy rules and legislation.  The bill presented by Senator Blumenthal would introduce regulations for companies that store online data for more than 10,000 people. These rules would require companies to follow specific storage guidelines and ensure that personal information is stored and protected correctly. Companies that do not adhere to these security guidelines could be subject to stiff fines.  Senator Blumenthal was a vociferous critic of Sony's handling of an attack on its servers earlier this year, which put data from 77 million customers at risk. At the time, the senator pressed Sony to disclose the extent of the damage and to notify customers who had been affected. If the new bill passes, Senator Blumenthal said, customers would be able to sue companies, like Sony, that do not take adequate precautions. ""The Sony data breach has became a poster child of why we need this law,"" he said. ""We were working on this legislation well before that data breach occurred, but Sony is a good example of why this law should exist.""   "
Who Really Sent That E-Mail?: Stronger rules and better business practices are needed to head off data breaches,"Americans are right to be concerned about a huge data breach at an online marketing company, Epsilon, which resulted in the theft of names and e-mail addresses for customers and employees of some of the nation's largest businesses, including Citibank, Disney and Verizon.  Epsilon issued a statement assuring that no other information was compromised. But millions of consumers could still be vulnerable to sophisticated identity-theft ploys -- ''spear phishing'' -- in which scammers target e-mails to specific people and make it appear as if they came from a company they trust. Familiarity can lure victims into clicking on links, downloading malware, or responding to requests for account numbers or passwords. This is not an isolated case. Last month, at RSA, which produces SecurID tokens, an employee received an e-mail entitled ''2011 Recruitment Plan'' and clicked on its Excel attachment. This released a program that gave hackers access to the company's network and allowed them to lift information about the tokens. Two years ago, the Justice Department charged a 28-year-old from Miami and two Russians with stealing 130 million credit card numbers from one of the world's largest payment processing companies. Last year there were large-scale data breaches at Affinity Health Plan, Lincoln Financial Securities and Ohio State University. Epsilon has provided few details, saying the breach is subject to an investigation. The public and policy makers need to understand how the hack took place to determine how vulnerable sensitive information really is and figure out what further safeguards are needed to protect it. The breach at Epsilon underscores the urgent need for a federal standard of data safety that ensures companies follow adequate policies and procedures to protect consumers' information and determines companies' legal liability for breaches. As Congress debates new data privacy rules, it should put data security at the forefront. Possibilities include imposing maximum periods for retaining personal data and rules about how to protect data that is flowing through corporate networks, stored on corporate servers or, increasingly, on the cloud. It certainly seems risky to have one company handle sensitive information about the customers of so many large firms. Consumers must also be vigilant. For starters, they should be wary about clicking on any e-mail attachment, even if it comes with a seemingly personal greeting from a business they know and trust.  "
Tracking File Found In iPhones,"Apple faced questions on Wednesday about the security of its iPhone and iPad after a report that the devices regularly record their locations in a hidden file. The report came from a technology conference in San Francisco, where two computer programmers presented research showing that the iPhone and 3G versions of the iPad began logging users' locations a year ago, when Apple updated its mobile operating system. After customers upgraded the software, a new hidden file began periodically storing location data, apparently gleaned from nearby cellphone towers and Wi-Fi networks, along with the time.  The data is stored on a person's phone or iPad, but when the device is synced to a computer, the file is copied over to the hard drive, the programmers said. The data is not normally encrypted; although users can encrypt their information when they sync their devices, few do. To some privacy advocates, the storing of the data was a clear breach. ''The secretive collection of location data crosses the privacy line,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy policy organization based in Washington. ''Apple should know better than to track iPhone users in this way.'' Others said the discovery of the hidden file was unlikely to have a major practical impact on privacy and security. ''It is more symbolic than anything else,'' said Tim O'Reilly, a longtime technology pundit and founder of O'Reilly Media. ''It is one more sign of how devices are collecting data about us and potentially sharing it with others. This is the future. We have to figure out how to deal with it.'' Law enforcement officials can already get this type of location information from cellphone companies, Mr. O'Reilly said; there are, however, conflicting rulings in federal courts about whether they need a search warrant. But sitting on a home computer, the data could now be more vulnerable to access by hackers or others, he said. And information about a person's locations over time could be accessible to strangers if a phone or iPad was lost or if it was attacked by malware. The news of what appeared to be a security problem immediately ricocheted across the Internet as bloggers on technology and Apple-centered sites debated the many questions left unanswered by the report. It is unclear, for example, whether Apple is gaining access to the information in any way. It is also unclear how precise the location data is and why it is being stored at all. The programmers said they had asked Apple's product security team about their findings but did not receive a response. Apple also did not respond to a request for comment from The New York Times. The report even attracted attention from political figures, like Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, who sent Apple's chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, a letter asking why Apple was ''secretly compiling'' the data and what it would be used for. Some privacy experts said the issue was not the legality of storing this information but whether Apple was playing fair with its customers. ''Collecting this data is not illegal, but it does matter whether or not this is explicitly spelled out in Apple's terms of use,'' said Christina Gagnier, a lawyer specializing in privacy and copyright. ''Apple constantly changes their privacy policy, and it's questionable whether most users are aware this is happening.'' Apple has an obligation to its customers to allow them to opt out of being tracked, said Ian Glazer of Gartner Research, who is a director in the company's identity and privacy group. ''There is no way to really turn this tracking off,'' he said. ''It needs to be visually obvious, or in the settings, to see that this is happening on your phone.'' Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden presented the paper at the O'Reilly Where 2.0 conference, a gathering of experts on location technology. Mr. Allan said in a blog post that beyond the issue of storing the information is the question of ''how Apple intends to use it -- or not.'' Mr. Allan, who has written books that teach people how to program, also said that the data being collected would be transferred to a new product when customers buy a new phone or iPad, and then sync it. Mr. Warden, a former Apple employee, posted a free downloadable application on his Web site for Mac computers that allows users to see their stored location data on a map. Whatever the privacy implications, the report was a burst of bad publicity for Apple on a day when it again reported stellar earnings results. ''It doesn't matter how Apple explains its way out of this, just the fact that consumers know that their phone is being tracked is a very big deal,'' said Chenxi Wang, a vice president of Forrester Research who specializes in security and risk.  "
Threats to Traveling Data,"With small and fast laptops, powerful smartphones, tablets and readily available Wi-Fi, working on the road -- on planes, in airports and hotel rooms -- has never been easier. But security experts say these conveniences also make the offices away from home more vulnerable to serious security threats. ''It's a huge, huge issue for companies and employees and growing more each day,'' said Bruce McIndoe, president of iJET Intelligent Risk Systems, a travel risk management company. ''It's a ripe environment for hackers and criminals.''  A report released last week by the Symantec Corporation, a security software provider, and the Ponemon Institute, a privacy and information management research firm, found that data breaches showed no sign of leveling off and were increasingly costly. ''As business travelers, we're on the road so much, we psychologically forget that we're in public,'' said Ben Knieff, head of product marketing for fraud at NICE Actimize, a company that focuses on financial crimes in the financial services industry. Mr. Knieff recalled how he was recently boarding a plane and overheard an executive speaking loudly on a cellphone as he booked a hotel, revealing all of his credit card information, including the security code. Laptops and mobile devices have numerous vulnerabilities, starting with loss and theft. McAfee, a security technology company, also noted, in a report last month, a 46 percent increase in the amount of malware created for mobile devices from 2009 to 2010. To limit exposure of particularly sensitive information, some companies switch mobile devices when employees travel, Mr. McIndoe said. ''Older versions could be more vulnerable,'' he said, as criminals have had time to learn how to hack them. And criminal access to mobile networks may be easier in certain foreign countries, because of lax security and corruption. Michael Malin, executive vice president of Mandiant, an information security company, suggested hiding mobile devices when they are unattended. ''We've all seen maids leave hotel room doors open with service carts,'' he said. Someone could easily enter the room and ''infect a computer or extract sensitive data,'' he said. ''We're seeing the use of social networks to gather publicly available information on targets,'' he added. Posting photographs and travel plans can jeopardize personal safety and sensitive business negotiations, experts said. Publicly shared computers at hotels and Internet cafes ''are probably the riskiest,'' Mr. Knieff said. ''Anyone can walk in and sit down,'' he said. Even printing boarding passes can be dangerous. ''Don't leave them in public trash cans either. Anytime you leave data about yourself in a public place, it creates opportunities,'' Mr. Knieff said. Debit card data skimming has also been rising sharply, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia, Mr. Knieff said. He recommended that travelers report their plans to their banks. When using A.T.M.'s, travelers should look for signs of tampering, and use machines only at banks, preferably in protected areas. ''I travel to Southeast Asia frequently, and you hear about how it is a hotbed for credit card fraud,'' said Bryndon Bay, president of Mel Bay Publications, a music publishing company, in Pacific, Mo., who relies on his iPad and iPhone on the road. Both are locked and protected with secure passwords. ''I never go to places where I have to enter frequent-flier numbers, credit card information, or any personal data,'' he said, ''and I always clear off history after I finish because I don't trust who may go on after me.'' ''I just feel I use common sense and it works for me,'' Mr. Bay said. Robert Hamilton, senior product marketing manager for Symantec, recommended avoiding free public Wi-Fi. ''Some look like legitimate hot spots, but they are set up by criminals,'' frequently at airport terminals. If using a wireless connection, he suggested entering it through a smartphone connection, which is much harder to hack. And at hotels, obtain an access key before using the wireless connection, he said, to ensure it is not ''sponsored by the person in the room next door.'' Betsy Page Sigman, a professor of operations and information management at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, said travelers attending conventions should also be aware of the risks. ''You want to be overly cautious, especially if you are around a lot of competitors,'' she said. Bob Austin, president of KoreLogic, an information security consultancy, said, ''If I had a single piece of advice for a business traveler's peace of mind, it is whole disk encryption,'' he said. Used with a robust pass phrase, similar to a password, ''everything on the hard drive is protected from disclosure.'' Many organizations also require their employees to use virtual private networks, which lower the risk of interception when accessing public wireless sites. The V.P.N. sends data through an encrypted tunnel. Tracy Armer, systems manager for the Madison Park Group, a stationery and gift company in Seattle, said sales staff members used both whole disk encryption and V.P.N.'s when traveling, but he discouraged taking laptops unless critical. ''You could be on a business trip, innocently looking up a good place to eat on the Internet, but there is a financial folder open on the desktop,'' he said. ''Someone could potentially browse the contents of your laptop.'' He suggested reading company material on paper while traveling. Unfortunately, he added, ''even with strong precautions, nothing is ever 100 percent secure.''  "
The Most Dangerous Celebrities on the Web,"Heidi Klum is a Victoria's Secret model and the host of the hit reality-TV show ""Project Runway."" But her admirers should beware: Searching online for her name with terms like ""hot pictures"" and ""free downloads"" can bring a cold shower. Ms. Klum is this year's most dangerous celebrity to search for on the Web, according to the security software company McAfee, a unit of Intel. Clicking on links promising sexy pictures or videos of her comes with a nearly one-in-10 chance of contracting a bad case of spyware, adware, phishing scams or other malware. The study uses data from McAfee's free SiteAdvisor product, a tool for the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers that protects users from malicious Web sites.  Cybercriminals often take advantage of people's interest in celebrities to trick them to visit sites that will automatically deposit malware on their PCs.  Security software suites often include browser add-ons that check links that you click on and that use icons to indicate sketchy links on search results pages. Some of these browser tools, like McAfee's SiteAdvisor and AVG's LinkScanner, are available free to anyone.  Hackers aim to infect as many people as possible, so their choice of which celebrities to use as lures are a kind of dark measure of online star power -- and a sign of who the easy targets are.  Men, you are clearly the marks. Ms. Klum unseated 2010's Most Dangerous Celebrity, the actress Cameron Diaz, who dropped to No. 2. Women dominated the list's top 10 and included Jessica Biel, Katherine Heigl, Mila Kunis, Anna Paquin, Adriana Lima and Scarlett Johansson.  The only male celebrities in the top 10 were the CNN host Piers Morgan, who shockingly enough took the No. 3 spot, and the actor and heartthrob Brad Pitt, who tied for No. 10 with the actresses Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. Interestingly, curiosity about sports stars and singers was a lot safer to indulge in. The tennis players Maria Sharapova and Andy Roddick dropped to No. 44 and No. 56, respectively, on this year's list, from Nos. 13 and 14 last year. The siinger Justin Bieber was No. 49, Rihanna and Carrie Underwood were tied at No. 51, and Lady Gaga trailed at No. 58.  And despite enormous publicity, the bad boys Charlie Sheen and Tiger Woods were not considered dangerous by McAfee. ""Male antics was not something that was targeted,"" said Gary J. Davis, director of consumer marketing.  Indeed, you could say they were embraced.   "
Sony Begins Phased Restoration of PlayStation Services,"Sony said on Saturday that it would begin restoring the PlayStation Network for its 77 million users after hackers infiltrated the service and forced it offline almost a month ago. Sony's PlayStation Network and Qriocity Service were incapacitated in the attack after a group of unknown hackers gained access to the company's servers, possibly stealing the personal information and credit card numbers of millions of users. Sony said in a press release that it was relaunching its online products with increased security following the cyberattacks. The company also defended its slow response to restoring services, saying it wanted to make sure its security was up to par before bringing products back online. ""The company has made considerable enhancements to the data security, including updating and adding advanced security technologies, additional software monitoring and penetration and vulnerability testing, and increased levels of encryption and additional firewalls,"" Sony wrote in the release. The company said it will be bringing services back online in a phased relaunch that will take place ""on a country by country basis."" The Sony data breach is one of the largest of its kind and has become the subject of data privacy debate in Congress.  "
VPN for the Masses,"If you've ever worked for a large (or even not so large) company, you may have encountered a virtual private network, or VPN. VPN is a technology that adds a layer of security to outside networks (like the one in your home, the airport, or a hotel room) that may not be as secure as what you have at the office. The short version of what VPN actually does is that it turns normal Internet communications - which can be decoded - into an encrypted jumble of nonsense that would be useless to anyone trying to intercept it. So even if you're on a very ""open"" Wi-Fi network at a coffee shop, your back and forth with the Internet remains as indecipherable as Keith Richards right after oral surgery. But while corporate America has long used VPN to keep its secrets secret, easy-to-use VPN technology has not, oddly, been available for individuals. Part of it may be the still-tepid demand. Many of us are aware that our online communications, including private e-mails and data typed into Web sites, could potentially be ""sniffed"" from the air by some scoundrel nearby. (Software for the purpose is easily available on the Internet.) But it seems rather unlikely, and we don't know what to do about it anyway. So we surf and pray - and maybe take the advice often offered by security experts to avoid shopping or banking online during these moments.  But increasingly there is something we can do about it. VPN products are cropping up for consumers and small businesses, extending to everyone the ability to use the Web privately, safely and anonymously. The prices, while not negligible, are manageable, particularly if you regularly transmit sensitive information on the road.  Among the options are Anonymizer Universal (Windows, Mac and iPhone/iPad; $79.99 a year, 14-day free trial) and Steganos Internet Anonym VPN (Windows; $15.95 a month, $99.95 a year). I also tried a new addition called PrivateWiFi, which was introduced in March by the start-up Private Communication Corporation for Windows and Mac ($9.95 a month or $84.95 a year, three-day free trial). The company is developing apps for iPhone, iPad and Android devices. Once installed, you know it's on if the PrivateWiFi icon is green. On PCs, the icon is located on the lower right in the Systray and, on Macs, in the bar at the top of the screen. Simple enough.  ""You don't have to be a geek to use it,"" says Kent Lawson, chief executive of Private Communication. ""It's protection analogous to antivirus and firewalls, and, in my opinion, it's the third leg.""  Behind PrivateWiFi is the encryption technology OpenVPN, geeky open-source software whose owner, OpenVPN Technologies, sells server software to companies and a hosted service to small businesses. The service ran successfully on my Wi-Fi network for two days. However, in a test at a popular Brooklyn cafe, it shut off twice without warning. I noticed that the icon turned red and clicked to reactivate it. PrivateWiFi inspected my logs and said the problem appeared to have been caused by the hot spot, but conceded it ought to add an alert. In general, you don't need to turn on PrivateWiFi while on a home network that's protected by a password known to only you and yours. With it on, transfer speeds may suffer slightly when downloading large files like movies, and battery life will be a bit shorter, Mr. Lawson says.  However, activating it will let you surf anonymously. Like other VPNs, PrivateWiFi will obscure your location by making it look like you connected to the Internet from wherever the VPN server is located. With its advanced settings, you can even pretend you're in Singapore or the Netherlands. Or if you're abroad and Hulu won't let you watch your favorite show, you could make it look as if you're home by choosing an American server.  "
Sony and Epsilon Agree to Testify Before Congress,"Sony has finally agreed to testify before a Congressional hearing that will be held by Representative Mary Bono Mack, the chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade. The hearing will address the massive data breach that occurred last month on Sony's PlayStation Network and jeopardized millions of customers' personal information. Sony had declined to attend a previous hearing by the same subcommittee, saying at the time that it was currently involved in an ""ongoing intensive investigation and management of this criminal cyberattack."" The previous hearing explored  ""The Threat of Data Theft to American Consumers"" and the lack of privacy legislation to protect Americans. Ken Johnson, senior adviser and spokesman for Ms. Mack, said in an e-mail that the new hearing would focus on data security in the United States. It is scheduled for Thursday, June 2. Epsilon, a company that handles customer e-mails for many major corporations, has also agreed to testify before the subcommittee. A recent data breach at Epsilon exposed millions of people's e-mail addresses and passwords.  ""Both Sony and Epsilon have agreed to testify,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""Representing Sony will be Tim Schaaff, president of Sony Network Entertainment International as well as Epsilon General Counsel Jeanette Fitzgerald."" Sony also finally answered a number of questions asked by the subcommittee in a May 17 letter pertaining to the data breach and the steps Sony took to protect its 77 million customers. Since the huge cyberattack on the PlayStation Network, Sony has become the poster child for data and security reform in Congress. ""While Chairman Bono Mack remains critical of Sony's initial handling of the data breaches, she also is appreciative that the company has now agreed to testify,"" said Mr. Johnson. ""The chairman firmly believes that the lessons learned from both the Sony and Epsilon experiences can be instructive and guide us as we develop comprehensive data protection legislation."" Mr. Johnson said the subcommittee is expected to introduce new data and security legislation in the next few weeks.  "
Germans Condemn Police Use of Spyware,"BERLIN -- A group that calls itself the Chaos Computer Club prompted a public outcry here recently when it discovered that German state investigators were using spying software capable of turning a computer's webcam and microphone into a sophisticated surveillance device. The club, a German hacking organization, announced last Saturday it had analyzed the hard drives of people who had been investigated and discovered that they were infected with a Trojan horse program that gave the police the ability to log keystrokes, capture screenshots and activate cameras and microphones. The software exceeded the powers prescribed to the police by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court.  The public condemnation was swift and strong, renewing a national debate into how far the government can intrude into digital privacy. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a major newspaper, called the revelation a ''worst-case scenario for data security.'' Germany's justice minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, demanded an inquiry into the matter, saying that citizens ''must be protected from snooping with strict state control mechanisms.'' Peter Schaar, the federal commissioner for data protection, called for Parliament to enact legislation to put an end to the ''gray area'' between lawful and unlawful searches and surveillance on computers. ''In my opinion, this kind of infiltration through software is a deeper intrusion and a greater risk than simply listening in on a phone line,'' Mr. Schaar said in an interview. ''The Bundestag has to decide to what extent something like this is allowed and to what extent it is restricted,'' Mr. Schaar said, referring to the German Parliament. Germans are particularly sensitive to questions of privacy and data collection as a result of their experiences under the Nazi dictatorship, where personal details could be a matter of life and death. As a result, the country has some of the strongest data protection laws in the world, elevating an individual's right to privacy above any perceived public right to know. ''Now Germans are beginning to recognize that this is a core problem of all people,'' said Bernd Schlomer, the vice chairman of Germany's Pirate Party, a new party that recently won 8.9 percent of the vote in Berlin's state elections and emphasizes Internet freedom and online privacy issues. He compared the awakening toward the significance of online privacy to the growing awareness of environmental problems in the 1960s and '70s. In 2007, Germany's Interior Ministry announced that it had developed software that could scan the hard drives of terrorism suspects. The Federal Constitutional Court responded the next year with a ruling that limited such incursions and guaranteed ''confidentiality and integrity in information technology systems.'' Federal investigators said that they were not using this software, but several states, including Lower Saxony and Baden-Wurttemberg admitted that they had employed it. ''In essence it is about how we fight crime in a digital age,'' said Dieter Wiefelsputz, an expert on domestic security with the left-leaning Social Democrats. Far-reaching computer surveillance ''shouldn't be used for car thieves but instead for the most serious crimes. That has to be considered in the laws,'' he said. Officials in Bavaria have said they had used the spying software to monitor suspects' e-mails and phone calls over the Internet and have captured tens of thousands of screenshots in cases involving theft, fraud and illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Officials have denied employing the software's capability of seizing control of computers' cameras and microphones, technology that evokes action films. The debate in Germany is evidence of the degree to which technology has permeated everyday lives, where friendships are made and nurtured on social-networking sites, and photographs and diaries are stored on hard drives. Privacy advocates argue that the difference between what authorities can glean from a telephone conversation and what can be discovered on a computer is as broad as the distance between what one says out loud and what one is thinking to oneself. ''Our private data are our stored thoughts,'' Mr. Schlomer said. Security experts say the German debate over police surveillance of computers and the demands for legislation restricting the practice will increasingly be necessary across the globe as the kinds of communication captured through wiretaps shift more and more to encrypted programs like Skype. But the software discovered by the hacker group, dubbed ''State Trojan'' or ''R2D2,'' after a line of code including the Star Wars robot's name, can do more than eavesdrop on phone calls. It was the ability to remotely control computers that led to charges from leading politicians that the state had crossed into Orwellian territory. ''People have some idea of the risks they face online from criminals,'' said Mikko H. Hypponen, the chief research officer at F-Secure Corporation, an Internet security firm based in Helsinki, Finland. ''I don't think they really know exactly the same methods are used against them by governments, that Germany, France, the United States could be doing this.'' Analysts, as well as the hackers who discovered the software, said the programming was amateurish. ''We were surprised by how bad the quality of the code was,'' said Frank Rieger, a spokesman for the Chaos Computer Club. A team of about 10 people analyzed the software for the group before they announced the results. The hackers said that the program also left the computers open to further malicious attacks, the equivalent of the police's leaving the back door of a house open after searching it. Still, the program falls short of what the most sophisticated hackers, organized criminals and other thieves of credit card and banking information have at their disposal.  "
"In a First, F.T.C. Settles With App Developer Over Children's Privacy","The Federal Trade Commission on Monday announced a $50,000 settlement with a developer of mobile applications for children. The developer had been charged with violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting information from children who used the apps without their parent's permission.  The case was the commission's first to involve mobile applications, or apps. The charges included collecting and storing children's e-mail addresses and allowing children to post personal information on public message boards. The company, W3 Innovations, which owns Broken Thumbs Apps, created mobile games and apps for children including Emily's Girl World, Emily's Dress Up and Emily's Runway High Fashion. According to the commission, the apps were downloaded more than 50,000 times by children under 13. In addition to the $50,000 penalty, the company will be required to delete the personal information it collected. In a statement, Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the commission said, ""The F.T.C.'s COPPA Rule requires parental notice and consent before collecting children's personal information online, whether through a Web site or a mobile app. Companies must give parents the opportunity to make smart choices when it comes to their children's sharing of information on smart phones."" The settlement comes at a time when the mobile technology and advertising industry is increasing privacy protections on devices in order to fend off potential federal regulations.  "
Disruptions: Privacy Fades in Facebook Era,"As much as it pains me to say this: privacy is on its deathbed. I came to this sad realization recently when a stranger began leaving comments on photos I had uploaded to Instagram, the iPhone photo-sharing app. After several comments - all of which were nice - I began wondering who this person was. Now the catch here is that she had used only a first name on her Instagram profile. You would think a first name online is enough to conceal your identity. Trust me, it's not. So I set out, innocently and curiously, to figure who she was. I knew this person lived in San Francisco, from her own photos. At first I tried Google, but a first name and city were not enough to narrow it down. Then I went to her photos and looked for people whom she had responded to in the comments. Eventually I found a conversation with someone clearly her friend. I easily found that person's full name, went to the person's Facebook friend list and searched for my commenter's first name. There it was: a full name. With that, I searched Google and before I knew it, I had this person's phone number, home address and place of employment. Creepy, right? I even had a link to a running app that she uses that showed the path of her morning run. This took all of 10 minutes. Nearly everyone has done something like this. Often, you don't even need a first name to find someone. Google, after all, has a feature that allows people to search with an actual image. No words or names required. A friend who works in technology recently told me I would never be able to figure out her age online. She had gone to great lengths to hide it. It took me exactly two minutes. How? I found a photo on Facebook from her birthday party two years earlier. In the photo, on the corner of a table, sat a birthday cake that said ""Happy Birthday,"" and two candles that said ""24."" ""We used to have privacy through obscurity online, so even if people had that information out there, the steps that it would take to aggregate it all were too great,"" said Elizabeth Stark, a lecturer in law at Stanford who teaches about privacy on the Internet. ""Previously you could have searched every photo on the Internet for a photo of Nick Bilton until you eventually found one, but that would take a lifetime. Now, facial recognition software can return more images about someone instantly."" So who is at fault for this lack of privacy protection? Most people are oblivious. The companies won't stop collecting information. And the government is slow to protect consumer privacy. The Federal Trade Commission, set up to protect consumers, didn't act until late last month when it cited Facebook for ""unfair and deceptive"" practices. This is great, but it is more than six years and 800 million users after Facebook began. Maneesha Mithal, the associate director of the Federal Trade Commission's division of privacy and identity protection, acknowledged in a phone interview that technology had moved quicker than the government could act. The F.T.C.'s investigation of Facebook, she said, ""has been a bit of a moving target."" Ms. Stark of Stanford says she doesn't believe that privacy is completely dead. She says people have learned from each privacy debacle. But the companies are not slowing down. The tools that aggregate information are only getting smarter. The government isn't getting faster. And Ms. Mithal said not much could be done about the damage already inflicted. ""Our order only provides protection going forward,"" she said. ""The only real option to protect information going backwards would be to delete your Facebook account."" Now which one of us is going to do that?   "
Data Security Programs,"To the Editor: Re ''Who Really Sent That E-Mail?'' (editorial, April 11):  As Congress debates new data privacy rules, it would be a good idea for it to look closely at existing data security programs. This would reduce the time and cost of industry compliance with personal data protection. For example, decision makers should focus on the standards set by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects the personal identifiable health information of patients. Additionally, the PCI Security Standards Council's comprehensive standards for the major credit card companies like Visa and American Express are helping to protect personal financial data and can be used as a road map for congressional action. An important part of both the federal health law and PCI's standards is that there is a significant financial penalty to those companies and entities that do not comply and experience breaches. Congress may also want to consider the industry standard practice of providing close and continuing credit monitoring for the individuals affected by breaches in personal data security.

Sony's Security Problems Could Take Years to Fix,"It's been a tough couple of months for Sony. The company's PlayStation Network was breached by hackers in late April and now several other units of the company have suffered broad security breaches. In the last week alone, half a dozen Sony Web sites and servers, including some in the United States and Brazil, have been breached. On Monday a group of hackers calling themselves LulzSecposted proprietary Sony source code on file-sharing Web sites. Although the members of LulzSec have gone after other organizations in the past, including Fox.com and PBS.org, the attacks against Sony have been unrelenting. ""These attacks are a combination of Sony's lax security and a number of groups being very vigilant about breaking in to show how powerful they can be,"" explained Frank Kenney, vice president of global security at Ipswitch, a company used to securely transfer files online. ""What Sony has to do is re-examine their entire security system including the type of code they are using and the type of servers; they have to acknowledge that their brand is at stake.""  Mr. Kenney said that no server was impervious to hackers, but a company like Sony, with millions of credit cards and users' personal information on file, had a responsibility to ensure protection ""equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security's servers is in place."" He said that the fact that dozens of Sony Web sites and servers had been breached indicated it was clearly a companywide problem. ""Any type of environment can be breached, but Sony has to come up with a plan that not only protects their infrastructure, but also convinces their customers that their credit cards and personal information is safe,"" Mr. Kenney said. In an interview in New York last month, Howard Stringer, Sony's chief executive, said the company was working with a number of outside security companies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent further attacks. But Sony is definitely up against some untenable foes in this fight. LulzSec doesn't show any signs of easing its attacks on Sony, and the group is not deterred by the F.B.I., even taking up a fight with some of the organization's affiliate groups. LulzSec also said in a Twitter message on Monday that it was receiving thousands of dollars in donations to continue its attacks on Sony. Ron Gula, chief executive of Tenable Network Security, an enterprise security company, said the problems at Sony likely went back years when the company first built its infrastructure. ""A lot of times these problems are more holistic, and that's usually evidence by the fact that Sony has been attacked multiple times,"" he said. Mr. Gula said Sony would be unable to stop the attacks overnight and that it could take years for the company to get sufficient security in place to protect all its servers, databases and Web sites. ""Microsoft used to be the laughing stock of security and now they are now the shining example of good security,"" said Mr. Gula. ""It's going to take a while for Sony to fix this, I think this will take years.""   "
British Police Arrest Man In Hacking Investigation,"The police in Britain have arrested a 19-year-old man in connection with digital attacks on businesses and government agencies ''by a single hacking group,'' the Metropolitan Police said Tuesday in a statement.  The police did not identify the man or the hacking organization. Suspicion immediately fell on two groups: Anonymous, a shadowy international network of computer hackers, and Lulz Security, a group that has claimed responsibility in recent weeks for attacks on the Web sites of the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Senate as well as on Sony and, on Monday, the Web site of a British agency that combats organized crime. The arrest resulted from a joint investigation by a British cybercrime unit, the local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into attacks on ''a number of international business and intelligence agencies,'' the police said, without naming specific targets. British police officials said the man was being questioned in a London police station and was suspected of violating several British computer and fraud laws. After his arrest, they said, officers searched a home in Wickford, about 35 miles north of London, and turned up material that was under examination. They said the search was conducted late Monday night; the time of the arrest was not made clear. Attacks this spring on the Web sites of several companies, including Sony and Bethesda Softworks, a video game developer, exploited holes in Internet security systems that are meant to protect hundreds of thousands of private user accounts. In a letter posted last week, Lulz Security said that it planned to mount further attacks on government and corporate Web sites, and that its attacks were meant to improve privacy protections on the Web by exposing lax security. But the letter also outlined some expanded ambitions. ''Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government information,'' the group wrote, adding that it was now teaming up with Anonymous. ''Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments.'' Lulz Security appeared to dismiss speculation that one of its hackers had been detained, writing in a sarcastic Twitter post that it ''seems the glorious leader of LulzSec got arrested, it's all over now ... wait ... we're all still here!'' Web sites that track hacking news suggested that the suspect might be a disgruntled former member of Anonymous who is known to live in Wickford. Earlier this month, police officials in Spain announced that they had arrested three men, said to be the local leadership of Anonymous, in connection with attacks on government and business Web sites. Those arrests came after hackers who objected to legislation that would increase penalties for illegal downloads briefly took down the Spanish Ministry of Culture's Web site. The police said that one of the Spanish suspects had a computer server in his apartment in the northern port city of Gijon, from which the group is believed to have orchestrated its attacks.  "
"The Cloud Darkens: As online security threats grow, companies and government are scarily unprepared","The Internet is getting scary. In recent weeks, hackers known as Lulz Security attacked the Web sites of Sony, the United States Senate, the C.I.A., PBS, among others. They stole names, e-mail addresses and passwords of millions of users and published them online. Then, last weekend, they regrouped under a new name.  These attacks are among the hundreds of online security breaches this year alone, compromising data of more than 22 million people, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Targets have included Citigroup, Lockheed Martin and even RSA Security, which makes password tokens that big companies use to protect themselves from intrusion. A survey earlier this month by the Ponemon Institute found that 9 out of 10 companies had suffered an online attack in the last 12 months. Companies and the government are unprepared. Citigroup didn't track patterns of activity on its credit card site and failed to notice immediately when hackers took data on more than two million card users, said Avivah Litan, a security expert of Gartner. Sony didn't encrypt the data of users of its PlayStation network -- phone numbers, passwords, e-mail addresses and account histories. Recently, for several hours, Dropbox, a popular service for storing documents and other files in the so-called computing cloud, allowed anyone to log into any of its 25 million user accounts using any password. The company tried to keep the glitch quiet but was exposed by a security researcher. No wonder concern about Internet security from Americans has jumped sharply in the past few months. Technology professionals are getting cold feet about moving more operations onto the cloud when poor corporate security practices are exposing customers to devastating identity theft and fraud. This vulnerability could stymie the Internet economy. There is no fail-safe technology that is immune to hacking. Online security will evolve as hackers and security experts work continuously to outwit each other. Still, current standards are too low. Companies -- and the government -- must devote substantially more resources to security, making it integral to every new application, rather than patching it on as an afterthought. There are some signs of progress. Security experts are deploying a new worldwide system to identify Internet addresses that will make it very difficult to forge or spoof a Web site. In May, the Obama administration proposed legislation with sensible provisions to ensure that companies running critical infrastructure -- like the nation's power grid -- have adequate systems to reduce the risk of an attack online. The proposal would standardize 47 state laws on breach reporting, requiring notification of customers whose accounts were compromised. This could be a powerful incentive for firms to take security more seriously. Other tactics are also needed. The Federal Trade Commission wants rules to force companies to minimize the information they collect from customers and to dispose of such data as soon as possible. The stolen Sony data, for example, had been on dormant servers for years. We are putting our lives in the cloud, as companies and consumers store everything from family photos to corporate business secrets on remote servers. Beefing up online security is of paramount importance.  "
Dutch Officials Widen Inquiry Into Hacking,"The Dutch government said Tuesday that it was widening its investigation into an Internet security breach in an effort to learn whether the private data of Dutch citizens, many of whom file income tax returns online, had been compromised.  The Dutch data protection agency has asked the government security contractor at the center of the controversy, DigiNotar, to report whether the integrity of special digital certificates that guarantee the authenticity of interactions with government computers had been breached. ''We are hoping to receive an answer from DigiNotar within a few days,'' said Harriet Garvelink, a spokeswoman for the agency in The Hague, who said the request was made Friday. The hacking scandal in the Netherlands, one of the most digitally advanced countries in Europe, erupted last week when DigiNotar disclosed that hackers had broken into its systems in July and issued fraudulent digital certificates, which are used to verify the authenticity of Web sites. An independent report released Monday traced the origin of the breach to Iran. ''DigiNotar found evidence on July 28th that rogue certificates were verified by Internet addresses originating from Iran,'' said the report prepared by Fox-IT, a company hired by the government to investigate the breaches. Google said last week that users of its services ''primarily located in Iran'' may have been affected by the use of fraudulent certificates issued by DigiNotar. These could allow a hacker to intercept information moving between a user and a service like Gmail that appeared to be secure. The Fox-IT report said that DigiNotar discovered 333 fraudulent ''rogue certificates'' circulating from July 19 to July 28, many of which were for the sites of major Internet companies. The company subsequently revoked and invalidated the certificates. The Dutch interior minister, Piet Hein Donner, told members of Parliament on Tuesday that the government so far had no evidence that the hackers had used the certificates to obtain the personal information of Dutch citizens from government sites. Vincent van Steen, a spokesman for Mr. Donner, said the interior ministry was working to learn more about how the intrusion occurred and how to prevent a future attack. ''This matter shows us how vulnerable we are,'' Mr. van Steen said. Several security experts have speculated that the Iranian government may have orchestrated the hacking, which would have required the control of an Internet service provider, to spy on dissidents. The Iranian government has not commented on the situation. DigiNotar, a unit of the American company Vasco Data Security International, has been criticized by Dutch lawmakers for not immediately informing the government of the certificate theft. Dutch prosecutors told The Associated Press on Tuesday that they were investigating DigiNotar for possible criminal negligence. Vasco said in a statement that it was cooperating with the Dutch government.  "
Holding Companies Accountable for Privacy Breaches,"It's become almost  a weekly occurrence: Another online company letting customers personal and private information leak because of an Internet breach. Sometimes this sensitive data is stolen by hackers who gain access through  holes in a network that customers unwittingly trust companies to protect. Lately, there are more instances of  companies procuring data without customers' knowledge and using it for - well, who knows what they're using it for? People hand over their names, addresses, passwords, birth dates and sometimes credit card information in exchange for access to online services and technologies that they hope will better their lives or business. In many instances these services do that, but increasingly the companies tend to disregard the importance of protecting personal and sensitive information. Yet there seems to be no real repercussions for these companies when a person's information stored online is exposed. ""Today the only real hit a company takes when these data breaches happen is to the company's image,"" said Alex Halderman, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan who specializes in data privacy. ""It seems that with the frequency these events happen, a simple P.R. hit is not working to force these companies to protect people's privacy."" This week alone, the information of more than 60 million people was compromised through Sony's PlayStation Network after an ""unauthorized person"" obtained user's names, addresses, e-mail addresses and possibly even credit card information. Last month it was a data breach at Epsilon, a company who handled customer e-mails for many major corporations. RSA, a computer security company, was hacked a few weeks earlier. Last year it was AT&T's data of iPad users that was exposed. Apple was also involved in a privacy snafu after researchers found that the iPhone and 3G iPad had been collecting location data on users phones for over a year. Apple said on Wednesday that it was not using the data to track its users and that part of the problem was actually a programming error. Google also admitted it too collects the same kind of location data about its users. And on Tuesday it became clear that Microsoft is collecting user locations too. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group in Washington, said the continual flurry of breaches shows that companies are collecting too much personal information about customers that can too easily fall into the wrong hands. Mr. Rotenberg said in a phone interview on Tuesday that he tells companies, ""If you can't protect it, don't collect it."" Christina Gagnier, a lawyer specializing in privacy and copyright, said in an interview last week that there wasn't enough legislation to protect people online. Ms. Gagnier noted that the government was just starting to take steps to protect consumers online, citing new legislation recently put forth by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator John McCain of Arizona that could hold companies more accountable for the data they collect about people. ""The new privacy legislation doesn't go far enough, failing to focus on location or online privacy issues,"" said Ms. Gagnier. ""Privacy online isn't just about protecting people on a social network."" Mr. Halderman, of the University of Michigan said the problem was only going to get worse as more service moved to the cloud and continually stored and tracked every movement a user made. ""Almost anything you sign up for online these days requires you to hand over your personal information to use it,"" he said. ""Then, every action you take online is logged by these companies - it's that information that really needs to be safeguarded.""   "
A Stronger Net Security System Is Deployed,"A small group of Internet security specialists gathered in Singapore this week to start up a global system to make e-mail and e-commerce more secure, end the proliferation of passwords and raise the bar significantly for Internet scam artists, spies and troublemakers. ''It won't matter where you are in the world or who you are in the world, you're going to be able to authenticate everyone and everything,'' said Dan Kaminsky, an independent network security researcher who is one of the engineers involved in the project.  The Singapore event included an elaborate technical ceremony to create and then securely store numerical keys that will be kept in three hardened data centers there, in Zurich and in San Jose, Calif. The keys and data centers are working parts of a technology known as Secure DNS, or DNSSEC. DNS refers to the Domain Name System, which is a directory that connects names to numerical Internet addresses. Preliminary work on the security system had been going on for more than a year, but this was the first time the system went into operation, even though it is not quite complete. The three centers are fortresses made up of five layers of physical, electronic and cryptographic security, making it virtually impossible to tamper with the system. Four layers are active now. The fifth, a physical barrier, is being built inside the data center. The technology is viewed by many computer security specialists as a ray of hope amid the recent cascade of data thefts, attacks, disruptions and scandals, including break-ins at Citibank, Sony, Lockheed Martin, RSA Security and elsewhere. It allows users to communicate via the Internet with high confidence that the identity of the person or organization they are communicating with is not being spoofed or forged. Internet engineers like Mr. Kaminsky want to counteract three major deficiencies in today's Internet. There is no mechanism for ensuring trust, the quality of software is uneven, and it is difficult to track down bad actors. One reason for these flaws is that from the 1960s through the 1980s the engineers who designed the network's underlying technology were concerned about reliable, rather than secure, communications. That is starting to change with the introduction of Secure DNS by governments and other organizations. The event in Singapore capped a process that began more than a year ago and is expected to be complete after 300 so-called top-level domains have been digitally signed, around the end of the year. Before the Singapore event, 70 countries had adopted the technology, and 14 more were added as part of the event. While large countries are generally doing the technical work to include their own domains in the system, the consortium of Internet security specialists is helping smaller countries and organizations with the process. The United States government was initially divided over the technology. The Department of Homeland Security included the .gov domain early in 2009, while the Department of Commerce initially resisted including the .us domain because some large Internet corporations opposed the deployment of the technology, which is incompatible with some older security protocols. Internet security specialists said the new security protocol would initially affect Web traffic and e-mail. Most users should be mostly protected by the end of the year, but the effectiveness for a user depends on the participation of the government, Internet providers and organizations and businesses visited online. Eventually the system is expected to have a broad effect on all kinds of communications, including voice calls that travel over the Internet, known as voice-over-Internet protocol. ''In the very long term it will be voice-over-I.P. that will benefit the most,'' said Bill Woodcock, research director at the Packet Clearing House, a group based in Berkeley, Calif., that is assisting Icann, the Internet governance organization, in deploying Secure DNS. Secure DNS makes it possible to make phone calls over the Internet secure from eavesdropping and other kinds of snooping, he said. Security specialists are hopeful that the new Secure DNS system will enable a global authentication scheme that will be more impenetrable and less expensive than an earlier system of commercial digital certificates that proved vulnerable in a series of prominent compromises. The first notable case of a compromise of the digital certificates -- electronic documents that establish a user's credentials in business or other transactions on the Web -- occurred a decade ago when VeriSign, a prominent vendor of the certificates, mistakenly issued two of them to a person who falsely claimed to represent Microsoft. Last year, the authors of the Stuxnet computer worm that was used to attack the Iranian uranium processing facility at Natanz were able to steal authentic digital certificates from Taiwanese technology companies. The certificates were used to help the worm evade digital defenses intended to block malware. In March, Comodo, a firm that markets digital certificates, said it had been attacked by a hacker based in Iran who was trying to use the stolen documents to masquerade as companies like Google, Microsoft, Skype and Yahoo. ''At some point the trust gets diluted, and it's just not as good as it used to be,'' said Rick Lamb, the manager of Icann's Secure DNS program. The deployment of Secure DNS will significantly lower the cost of adding a layer of security, making it more likely that services built on the technology will be widely available, according to computer network security specialists. It will also potentially serve as a foundation technology for an ambitious United States government effort begun this spring to create a system to ensure ''trusted identities'' in cyberspace.  "
Facebook Modifies Its Service to Avoid Violations of Privacy Law in Germany,"BERLIN -- Facebook, facing potential fines for violating strict privacy laws in Germany, agreed on Monday to let users in the country better shield their e-mail contacts from unwanted advertisements and solicitations it sends. Facebook, which has more than 10 million users in Germany, agreed to modify its Friend Finder service to let Germans better block its ability to contact people, including non-Facebook users culled from a user's e-mail address books. Tina Kulow, a Facebook spokeswoman in Hamburg, said users in Germany would now be advised that the site could send solicitations to people on their mailing lists, should they choose to upload their address books to Friend Finder.  Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, is the second U.S.-based Internet business to modify its operations to suit German privacy laws, which give individuals extensive control over personal data. Google was the first. Last year, facing fines, Google let Germans exclude photos of their homes and apartments from its Street View photographic map archive before the service went live. Like Google, Facebook decided to change its operation after Johannes Caspar, the data protection supervisor in Hamburg, opened a review of the company's practices. Violations of German privacy law carry penalties up to 300,000, or $410,000, but adverse publicity can be more damaging. Mr. Caspar, during an interview, said his office had received ''many, many complaints'' during the past six months from Germans who had never used Facebook but were still receiving Facebook solicitations because their e-mail addresses had been siphoned from friends. The issue took on political overtones, with Germany's federal data protection commissioner, Peter Schaar, and its consumer protection minister, Ilse Aigner, criticizing Facebook for disregarding German privacy laws. Mr. Caspar opened his administrative review of Facebook last July. His office initially demanded that Facebook deactivate its Friend Finder service in Germany. Meetings were held over the past seven months, he said. In the compromise announced Monday, Facebook agreed to explain the features of Friend Finder prominently and to instruct users on how to limit its ability to gain access to contacts and to store them. Andrew Noyes, a Facebook spokesman in Washington, said the company hoped to continue ''constructive discussions and dialogue'' with Mr. Caspar. ''We are pleased that we have come to a solution with the Hamburg D.P.A. regarding concerns about Friend Finder,'' Mr. Noyes said, referring to the German city's Data Protection Authority. Mr. Caspar said his investigation would remain open until he could see whether the changes ended complaints. Prosecutors in Hamburg are weighing whether to bring charges against Google for its recording of personal data from home WiFi routers. The company's admission that it had collected personal data from unencrypted WiFi routers around the world has sparked many invsestigations, most of which have ended with warnings and apologies on the ground that it was inadvertent. In Germany, after giving residents the ability to opt out in advance, Google introduced Street View in 20 cities last year. The service includes photographs of about eight million households, Mr. Caspar said, but roughly 23 million other households in rural areas and smaller cities have not been added to the archive. Google said it had had to hire workers to process all the requests from Germans wanting to remove photos of their residences from Street View. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Google Faces French Fine for Breach of Privacy,"PARIS -- Google's privacy problems mounted Monday as French regulators fined the company for violating data protection laws and accused it of continuing to flout the rules even though it acknowledged mistakes in collecting data for an online mapping service. The privacy watchdog agency imposed a fine of 100,000 euros ($142,000), saying Google had been insufficiently forthcoming about privacy violations involving its Street View service, which enhances Internet maps with pictures. French officials also said that Google continued to break privacy rules in operating a mobile app called Latitude, which lets users broadcast their location and pinpoint the whereabouts of friends.  Google has admitted, and apologized for, gathering e-mail, computer passwords and other information from private Wi-Fi networks without the owners' knowledge as camera-equipped Street View cars roamed the world's streets. But the French authority said that Google had steadfastly refused to turn over the full source code for software used in gathering the Street View data. And the privacy watchdog said users of Latitude were not informed that Google tracked their movements to enhance its database of Wi-Fi information. ''When they use Latitude, they become a Google agent,'' said Yann Padova, secretary general of the privacy agency, the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms. Mr. Padova said the fine would close the agency's investigation related to Street View. But he added that if Google continued operating Latitude as it does now, it could face additional sanctions. Google has the right to appeal the decision, but did not say on Monday whether it would. The company said that the commission's move to close the inquiry into Street View would allow it to delete the personal data that it had collected from its interception of Wi-Fi communications by Street View cars, and which had been stored as the agency investigated. ''As we have said before, we are profoundly sorry for having mistakenly collected payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks,'' Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, said in a statement. ''As soon as we realized what had happened, we stopped collecting Wi-Fi data from our Street View cars and immediately informed the authorities. Deleting the data has always been our priority.'' Google did not comment on the commission's concerns about Latitude. As a privacy control, the company already requires users of that service to approve the disclosure of their location. Mr. Padova said it would be a ''major improvement'' if Google informed French users that their phones would be used to collect data on Wi-Fi networks. But he said Google had told him it did not need to do so because the information was processed outside France -- an argument that did not satisfy Mr. Padova. ''If a French company goes to America it has to operate under U.S. law,'' he said. ''The big problem is Google doesn't seem to think European law is applicable to its services.'' Privacy officials in more than two dozen countries have been investigating Street View, but the French agency is one of the first to act against Google. In Britain, for example, the Information Commissioner's Office said last November that Google had committed a ''significant breach'' of the law, but did not fine the company. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission dropped an investigation last year, though the Federal Communications Commission has been investigating separately. Joel R. Reidenberg, a Fordham University law professor who studies Internet privacy issues, said the decision sent ''a powerful message'' that the French privacy commission was ''serious about enforcement and is willing to use its enhanced authority.'' The agency, he added, is ''sending a signal to its counterparts in Europe that data protection authorities should step up their enforcement activities, since the same activity occurred elsewhere in Europe.''  "
Finding the Cleanup Crew After a Messy Hack Attack,"In the film ''Pulp Fiction,'' Harvey Keitel plays the Wolf, a fast-talking and meticulous man who is called in to deal with the aftermath of an accidental shooting. In the messy world of computer security breaches, Kevin Mandia is something like the Wolf. Mr. Mandia has spent his entire career cleaning up problems much like the recent breach at Stratfor, the security group based in Austin, Tex., that was hacked over the Christmas weekend. Hackers claiming to be members of the collective known as Anonymous defaced Stratfor's Web site and published over 50,000 of its customers' credit card numbers online. They have threatened to release more card details and a trove of 3.3 million e-mails between Stratfor and its clients, which include Goldman Sachs, the Defense Department, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United Nations.  That means Stratfor is in the position of trying to recover from a potentially devastating attack without knowing whether the worst is over. ''They're in a bad place,'' said Mr. Mandia, who is not involved in the Stratfor case. ''If the attacker is going to release their e-mails, there's no way to shut them down.'' Stratfor joins a list of other hapless prominent organizations that have recently been breached by so-called hacktivists -- hackers whose goal is to embarrass and expose them. Among its predecessors are Sony, the security company HBGary and the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Unlike extortion cases, in which hackers typically demand a fee for not disclosing specific proprietary information, attacks by hacktivists put companies in a potentially more precarious and vulnerable waiting mode. The companies do not know precisely what has been stolen, how destructive its disclosure will be, when it will be dumped online or even whether the hackers are still roaming through their internal networks. All the while, they must reassure anxious clients and try to minimize the inevitable public relations fallout. ''We call it a three-alarm fire,'' said Jamie May, chief investigator at Debix, the identity protection company that was hired by Sony after its breach earlier this year. ''It's easy for companies to get ahead of themselves and rush into bad decisions that make a situation worse,'' she said, ''which is why it is often helpful to work with a company that has done this before.'' The breach at Stratfor, which markets its security expertise, could be particularly embarrassing if hackers can prove their claims that they were able to gain access to the company's sensitive data because it was not encrypted -- a basic first step in data protection. Stratfor has not clarified whether its data was encrypted, and did not respond to requests for comment. With its Web site still down, the company has been using its Facebook page to share updates about matters like its offer of identity-theft protection for customers. But some customers have left comments on the page complaining that they did not hear directly from Stratfor about the breach, and found out that their card information was compromised only when their banks notified them of unauthorized charges. Mr. Mandia's computer security and forensics firm, Mandiant, has responded to breaches, extortion attacks and economic espionage campaigns at 22 companies in the Fortune 100 in the last two years alone, Mr. Mandia said. He calls the first hour he spends with companies ''upchuck hour.'' ''I need to get as much data as I can get. I come in and say 'Get me your firewall logs. Give me your Web logs. Tell me what you know so far. Who do you think might have done this? Give me your e-mails,' '' he said. ''Everybody's vomiting information on a table. It's never pretty and it's always unstructured.'' Time is of the essence. ''Every minute you take to figure this out, you could be losing more e-mails and more credit data,'' he said. The goal is to determine quickly the ''fingerprint'' of the intrusion and its scope, Mr. Mandia said: ''How did the guy break in? What did he take? When did he break in? And, how do I stop this?'' The first thing a forensics team will do is try to get the hackers off the company's network, which entails simultaneously plugging any security holes, removing any back doors into the company's network that the intruders might have installed, and changing all the company's passwords. ''This is something most people fail at,'' Mr. Mandia said. ''It's like removing cancer. You have to remove it all at once. If you only remove the cancer in your leg, but you have it in your arm, you might as well have not had the operation on your leg.'' Likewise, if a company misses one back door or one compromised password, the intruders can immediately come back in. Once the network has been secured, a forensics team will comb through a company's data to determine the impact of the breach, so it can begin notifying affected customers, determine its liability and try to get ahead of the news cycle. But in a hacktivist case like Stratfor's, in which hackers are threatening to disburse more credit card details and sensitive correspondence, Mr. Mandia said there comes a point when ''you just have to sit back and hope.'' ''If anybody was any good at preventing leaks, we would have never seen WikiLeaks,'' Mr. Mandia said. ''The U.S. government would have stopped it and that data would never have been dumped.'' Meanwhile, Stratfor's hackers have taken to Twitter to announce that they plan to release more Stratfor data over the next several days. That may offer at least one possible silver lining. In the world of computer security, experts say, the most dangerous breaches are the quiet ones -- the ones in which hackers make off with a company's intellectual property and leave no trace. ''The hacks that do the most damage,'' Mr. Mandia said, ''don't have Twitter feeds.''  "
"Executives May Be Too Confident on Cybersecurity, Survey Finds","Every week comes a new report warning how vulnerable consumers, companies and government agencies are to hackers bent on breaching computer systems and extracting sensitive data.  This week came a somewhat unusual report, compiled by the global consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. It surveyed more than 9,000 executives in over 130 countries and found them confident in their ability to secure their information systems and bullish about cybersecurity spending. In the survey, released Thursday, 43 percent of respondents said they had confidence in their security protocols and 50 percent said they expected their companies to spend increasing amounts of money on cybersecurity.  Digital hubris can be dangerous, though. PricewaterhouseCoopers parsed the data more closely. They asked the executives about the precautions they were taking. It turned out that only 13 percent of those surveyed had actually done what the consulting firm considered to be adequate -- meaning they had an overall security strategy, they had reviewed the effectiveness of their strategy and they knew precisely the types of breaches that had already hit them over the last 12 months.  Even as the use of social networks has proliferated, barely one in three respondents said their companies had a policy governing their employees' use of tools like Facebook and LinkedIn.  Social media, the report's authors concluded, is a double-edged sword for many companies.  ""It's a great business opportunity,"" Mark Lobel, a principal at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said by phone. ""It's also a terrible avenue for data loss and data leakage.""  Driving the spending on security was the prospect of cyber-espionage, or snooping on sensitive company and government data, everything from blueprints of fighter jets to confidential information about mergers and acquisitions. But only 16 percent of respondents said they were prepared for cyber-espionage. The worries about security were echoed on Tuesday by Gen. Keith B. Alexander, chief of the United States Cyber Command, who warned of the looming threat of a computer attack. Speaking at a conference, General Alexander said he could not predict whether such an attack would be on government institutions or private firms. ""It is a question of time,"" he said, according to a writeup by the Defense Department. ""What we don't know is how far out it is."" He estimated that cyber crimes have cost the global economy a trillion dollars.   "
Netizens Gain Some Privacy,"Pressure by regulators is having an effect on consumer privacy on the Internet. Last week, Google and Mozilla announced new software for their Web browsers that would allow consumers to permanently opt out of the online tracking used by many advertisers to follow online activities, build consumer profiles and deliver tailored ads.  The move follows efforts by some of the largest Internet advertisers and data trackers -- including Google and Yahoo -- to offer consumers an easy way to opt out of tracking on their sites. Microsoft said it would offer a feature (dropped last year) that would allow surfers using Internet Explorer to block some monitoring efforts. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission recommended ways to protect online privacy, including giving consumers a clear, simple way to opt out of data tracking -- something akin to the do-not-call registry. Hoping to pre-empt action from a Congress in which privacy protection is one of the very few items with strong bipartisan support, companies involved in online advertising have rushed to issue their own proposals. The efforts are welcome. The fact that Google and Mozilla get most of their revenue from online advertising is a strong rebuttal to claims that allowing consumers to opt out of tracking would undermine ad-driven businesses and endanger the free Internet. Still, these initiatives fall short of what is ultimately needed. The privacy plug-in for Google's Chrome browser merely lets users opt out permanently from tracking by companies from the coalition of companies that already allow surfers to opt out. It allows them to keep their opt-out settings even if they clear their cookies. Mozilla's feature, which will be added to new versions of its Firefox browser, will broadcast users' preference not to be tracked to the Web sites they visit and the tracking companies that deliver cookies from these sites. But it will be up to these companies to comply with customers' wishes. Many advertising networks that offer opt-outs still track surfing, just not for marketing. To close these loopholes, Congress should require all advertising and tracking companies to offer consumers the choice of whether they want to be followed online to receive tailored ads, and make that option easily chosen on every browser.  "
Industry Tries to Streamline Privacy Policies for Mobile Users,"For many Internet users, online privacy policies are long and difficult to read. Transfer those same policies to a mobile device, where users can find themselves clicking through multiple screens often with tiny type, and the policies can become almost useless to the average consumer. Yet those same policies govern how much user data is collected through mobile applications and how that data is shared with advertisers and other third parties. And with growing concern over data collection, including proposed legislation to more closely protect consumers, one company is trying to make privacy policies that are both easy for consumers to read and easy for mobile application developers to create.  ''Everybody complains that no one reads privacy policies and that privacy policies are too long and too difficult,'' said Jim Brock, the founder of PrivacyChoice, a company that has analyzed and indexed the data in hundreds of privacy policies across the Web. ''The mobile environment requires you to say things very succinctly, and it requires you to say things in layers.'' Using the data collected from hundreds of online privacy policies, Mr. Brock and his team devised a tool to help mobile application developers create basic policies without the help of a lawyer. Developers who want to use the tool can select answers to basic questions about how they collect data, how that data is used and whether it can be deleted. The resulting policy boils complicated policy language down to a few sentences like ''We collect or share your location only with your permission'' or ''We keep personal data until you delete it.'' ''If you have 10 minutes, you can get on the right side of privacy rules,'' said Mr. Brock, who estimates that the vast majority of applications that mobile phone users download don't have privacy policies at all. Policies that do exist can be challenging for users to read without having to click through multiple screens. Adding to the confusion, many application developers are small businesses that make revenue off customized advertising, but don't have a consistent approach to making policy. Morgan Reed, the executive director for the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade organization that supports mobile application developers, said more than 80 percent of developers are small businesses with fewer than 10 employees. Many of the apps they create collect data on users -- including their location -- that can be sent to advertising networks, which in turn show users ads based on the data that has been collected. Without advertising revenue, app developers would have to charge more for their apps -- which typically sell for 99 cents to a few dollars each -- and some might find it difficult to stay in business. ''Solving this privacy problem is absolutely critical for us,'' Mr. Reed said. ''We want to make sure this revenue stream continues.'' The cost for a legal consultation, which can range from a couple of hundred dollars to thousands, can also be a deterrent for small app developers looking to create privacy policies. But Christopher Wolf, a partner at the Hogan Lovells law firm and a co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum, said app developers should not claim cost as an excuse. ''I think it's a cop-out for app developers to say they don't have the budget for it,'' Mr. Wolf said. ''It's an investment for any business that deals in consumer data. They ought to build it into the development cost.'' Andrew Binkowski, a researcher at the University of Chicago and an app developer, said allowing advertising on his baby name app, Stork Drop, doubled his revenue. Mr. Binkowski said the app drew advertisements for items like diapers or cord blood banks (facilities that store umbilical cord blood for future use). As for privacy policies, Mr. Binkowski said he wasn't sure if it was necessary to have one given that his apps did not collect personally identifiable data and in some cases, did not collect any data at all. The cost and expertise needed to create a privacy policy were also a concern. ''I'm still not certain about what needs to go in there,'' he added. Forrester Research predicts that by 2015, 36 percent of consumers in the United States will use mobile Internet services, with spending on mobile advertising expected to increase to $2.8 billion. In June, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law, proposed legislation along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, that would require mobile companies to obtain a user's consent before collecting location-based data and before sharing that data with third parties. Recent efforts to increase the availability of mobile privacy policies, like Mr. Brock's policy generator, ''is a good first step in informing consumers,'' Mr. Franken said in an e-mail. ''But it alone will not address the majority of privacy threats that consumers face on their mobile devices.'' Another tool to manage tracking by advertisers and ad networks is being developed by Evidon, the company that provided the technology behind an icon-based online self-regulatory program supported by the Digital Advertising Alliance. Scott Meyer, the company's chief executive, said work is under way on a tool that would allow users to opt out of being served targeted advertising across multiple providers, similar to the way the icon program works. Mr. Meyer said the company had already signed contracts with multiple ad networks and agencies and expected to announce the new tool by the end of the year. ''The point of this is to build a more trusted environment,'' Mr. Meyer said.  "
Just Give Me The Right to Be Forgotten,"THE marketing pitch came by e-mail: Would you like to make an appointment with your dentist to have your teeth cleaned? And while you're at it, how about recommending him to a friend, or posting a review of your dental care? I had given my e-mail address and mobile phone number to my dentist's office a couple of years ago, for those rare occasions when he might need to communicate with me. Now, here I was receiving what I deemed unwanted promotional e-mail -- and a text message -- about the dentist's services via Demandforce, a firm in San Francisco that handles customer communications for some 11,000 small business including dentists, spas and automotive shops. (Demandforce describes such messages as appointment reminders.)  Of course, some people may not mind receiving automated, unsolicited birthday greetings or thank-you e-mails on behalf of their health care providers. But I felt that the conditions under which I had provided my contact information had been violated. I wanted the dentist's office and Demandforce to erase my information. That proved easy enough -- in this instance. But, as I looked into the matter, I discovered that I, as an American, did not actually have an automatic right to demand that a company erase personal information about me. Even as Congress and agencies like the Federal Trade Commission propose new privacy measures, it turns out that the United States still lags behind Europe in ensuring some controls. And, as my colleague Suzanne Daley recently reported, Europeans are hotly debating whether to do more. Already, under the data protection directive of the European Union, people who have contracted with a company generally have a right to withdraw their permission for it to keep their personal data. Under this ''right to be forgotten,'' Europeans who terminate frequent-flier memberships, for example, can demand that airlines delete their flight and mileage records, says Lukas Feiler, a lawyer who specializes in information technology and privacy law. ''If I withdraw my consent to the storage of my personal data, they would not have the right to store it,'' says Mr. Feiler, an associate at Wolf Theiss, a law firm with headquarters in Vienna. But there are exceptions, he says -- for example, when a company has a legitimate reason to store the data that supersedes an individual user's interest. In the United States, however, personal information about a consumer generally may be kept by the company that processes it -- except for certain regulated industries like credit. Individual companies in many sectors set their own policies on data retention. Some agree to delete information; others don't. ''As a general matter, companies in the United States don't have to recognize your right to be deleted,'' says Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research group in Washington. ''They may choose to accommodate you, but they are not required to.'' Certainly, there are many legitimate reasons for that. Businesses often keep records for tax or auditing purposes. Lawyers' and doctors' offices maintain records for a certain period to protect themselves against malpractice suits. Now, however, some politicians, regulators and companies want to give Americans more control over their personal information -- with limits on data use and retention, says Christopher Wolf, a lawyer who specializes in privacy and the co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum in Washington. ''We need to move more toward that regime in order to empower consumers,'' Mr. Wolf says. But any limits, he emphasizes, would have to carefully balance personal privacy against the right to free speech and public access to information. A bill introduced in the House last May, called the Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011, includes an ''eraser button'' provision for children and parents. It would require companies, when feasible, to allow users to delete publicly available personal information about minors from a Web site. (So far, there is no proposed equivalent covering grown-ups.) But in a preliminary report, the F.T.C. has endorsed a related idea -- that companies collect only the data they need about people and keep it no longer than necessary. If businesses minimize data collection from the get-go, there may be less need for an eraser button later, says Jessica Rich, deputy director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of consumer protection. For now, she suggests that people read company privacy policies and ''figure out ahead of time whether you have the ability to delete your data.'' Mr. Feiler in Vienna says the best hope is market innovation. With people attuned to data proliferation, he says, businesses with enhanced privacy options should prosper. Social networking sites, for instance, could differentiate themselves by offering automatic erasure, giving users the choice to delete their entire records, say, every six months. ''Some consumers would find that very useful,'' Mr. Feiler says. ''Others may want all their data to be available at least as long as they live.'' In the meantime, Americans like me, who would like companies to delete certain personal information, may find themselves depending on the kindness of strangers -- or, at least, acquaintances. My dentist said his office started using updated, automated communications to keep up with increasingly mobile patients who enjoy social networking but often change their contact information. He immediately agreed to delete some of my details from the system, even though I will now be harder to contact. Demandforce, the customer communications company, was equally responsive. Rick Berry, its president, told me that the firm didn't send out unsolicited e-mails; it merely acts like a communications representative of a small business, transmitting digital reminders where a dentist's office might once have mailed postcards. He adds that the firm encrypts user data and adheres to health privacy regulations. If people have privacy concerns, they can easily opt out of further contact. I, however, shouldn't have received a text message in the first place, said Patrick Barry, Demandforce's vice president for marketing, since I didn't give permission for my mobile number to be used that way. The dentist's front office ''should have opted you out of receiving even a welcome text message,'' Mr. Barry said. In a follow-up e-mail, he said Demandforce had deleted my record: ''The system has officially 'forgotten' you.'' But in a data economy where personal information is an increasingly valuable currency, a consumer's automatic access to a delete button remains an exception.  "
A European Debate Over Online Ads and Data Privacy Crosses the Atlantic,"BERLIN -- Watchful European privacy regulators are wielding increasing influence beyond the Continent's borders. Last week, they pressed Google, as they had Apple, to change the way it collected data on cellphone locations worldwide. But there is one area where even European regulators appear stymied -- the tracking of consumer Internet surfing habits by technology companies, advertisers, Internet service providers and Web businesses that focus on consumers on the basis of online behavior. For 18 months, the European Commission has been considering how to put into practice a 2009 law that regulates software cookies, the unique digital markers that Web sites place on visiting computers to identify consumers and deliver ads tailored to individual interests.  This year, a consensus appeared to be building in Brussels for letting the online advertising industry regulate its use of cookies. The main industry group, the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, set up a Web site this summer to let consumers choose not to receive -- ''opt out'' of -- receiving advertisements directed as a result of profiling. The idea was conceived in a series of roundtable meetings this year by Interactive Advertising members and Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner responsible for electronic privacy. The site, called youronlinechoices.eu, is supported by members of Interactive Advertising -- the majority of online advertisers. But regulators representing E.U. member states, backed by consumers' rights groups, are balking at the voluntary arrangement, which they argue does not adequately protect individuals from unwittingly permitting marketers to collect personal data. Last week, they began a drive to require E.U. consumers to ''opt in'' to profiling by clicking on Web icons within ads. Consumer advocates hope to insert an opt-in mandate in the revision of the European Union's Data Protection Directive, the main body of privacy law, which will be considered next year. ''We believe that by having consumers opt in, rather than opt out, they will be better protected and informed about what happens with their information,'' said Kostas Rossoglou, a senior legal officer at the European Consumers' Organization, a Brussels group. An opt-in requirement would be cumbersome, Web advertisers argue, requiring a layer of pop-up windows, and could kill a popular, growing form of online advertising. The opt-out ''fits with the needs of today's Internet users,'' said Stephan Noller, chief executive of a Berlin ad firm, nugg.ad, who heads Interactive Advertising's policy committee. ''Information is provided contextually where relevant and is instantly available. We use the dynamism and interactivity of the Internet to provide pragmatic privacy control.'' According to Interactive Advertising, online advertising generated revenue of --17.7 billion, or $24.4 billion, in Europe in 2010. The bureau has no estimate on how much of that was behavioral ads. But a 2010 survey by AWeber Communications, a company in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, found that two-thirds of merchants intended to use such advertising. On Wednesday, the privacy advisers to the commission, a panel of national regulators called the Article 29 Working Party, held a closed-door meeting with members of Interactive Advertising and other industry groups to discuss concerns about industry self-regulation. After the meeting, the panel reiterated its belief that the opt-out approach violated European privacy law, which requires consent before personal data can be used. A consumer's failure to opt out of behavioral ads, the panel said in its statement, is not a form of implicit consent, which is the position held by the industry. ''Only statements or actions, not mere silence or inaction, constitute valid consent,'' the Article 29 panel said in a statement released after the meeting. The group is planning to make a recommendation this year that may call for more stringent controls. The European commissioner in charge of revising the bloc's data protection law, Viviane Reding, said she was also likely to call for a form of prior consent in her draft of the new data protection legislation, which will not be completed until early next year. ''Companies must obtain prior consent before individuals' data is used,'' Mrs. Reding said in a statement released by her office. The European debate has the potential to influence a parallel discussion on behavioral advertising under way in the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission has also expressed concern about the sufficiency of the opt-out approach. On Wednesday, an international coalition of 80 consumer groups in the United States and Europe called the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue sent letters to the European Commission and members of Congress urging more stringent controls. The letter, sent a day before a hearing on behavioral ads held by the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, urged Congress to follow Europe's lead. ''There is much the United States could learn from other countries about how to address such challenges and the E.U. Data Directive provides a very good starting point,'' according to a copy of the letter obtained by the International Herald Tribune. But consumer advocates face an uphill battle in Washington, where the U.S. advertising industry also opposes an opt-in mandate. In its letter to U.S. Representative Mary Bono Mack, the chairwoman of the subcommittee, the coalition wrote that it was ''somewhat surprised by what appears to be an effort to call into question the purpose and 'burden' of the E.U. data directive.'' The outcome of the debate in Europe, for now, is also uncertain. Kimon Zorbas, the vice president of the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, said most Europeans were not troubled by behavioral advertising, and those who were could simply block them through the industry's Web site. ''Right now, we are starting to hear a lot of people saying they want to stop profiling,'' Mr. Zorbas said in an interview. But if that were to happen, he said, the fastest-growing segment of online advertising would also suffer. ''Customer profiling is a basic to any business, not just online business,'' Mr. Zorbas said. ''If that were to happen, I am afraid it would kill a significant part of the industry.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Europe Plans to Tighten Web Privacy and Apply It to U.S. Companies,"BERLIN -- The European Commission is planning a legal change next year that may prompt U.S. Web giants like Google and Facebook to rethink how they store and process consumer data, raising the prospect of a trans-Atlantic dispute over Internet privacy. The European justice commissioner, Viviane Reding, said she planned to insert wording into a revision of the Continent's main data privacy law that would require non-E.U. companies to abide by Europe's stricter rules on data collection or face fines and prosecution. Mrs. Reding, who has criticized Facebook's practice of storing and retaining logs of personal data, even when a user attempts to delete it, intends to add the tougher sanctions to Europe's revised Data Protection Directive, which she expects to present in January. The European law gives individuals more control over the use of data they enter on free Web services, but it has not been revised since 1995, when the Internet was still in its infancy. The commission's recommendations on how to update the law, and any new fines for violations, must be approved by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers.  In a speech Tuesday to a group of publishers in Brussels, Mrs. Reding signaled her intent to pursue a tougher line on privacy after meeting with Ilse Aigner, the German minister for food, agriculture and consumer protection. Ms. Aigner in September 2011 asked German federal agencies to stop using Facebook for public relations purposes as a way of protesting its policies. ''We both believe that companies who direct their services to European consumers should be subject to E.U. data protection laws. Otherwise, they should not be able to do business on our internal market,'' Mrs. Reding said. ''This also applies to social networks with users in the E.U. We have to make sure that they comply with E.U. law and that E.U. law is enforced, even if it is based in a third country and even if its data are stored in a 'cloud.''' In her speech, Mrs. Reding did not mention Google or Facebook by name. Her proposal is likely to attempt to limit the range of personal information that Web businesses can retain on individuals, as well as enshrine a so-called ''right to be forgotten'' in E.U. law, giving users the right to remove personal data from Web businesses' servers. But one legal expert was skeptical that Europe, even if it did formally adopt tougher sanctions, could enforce a stricter privacy regime on U.S.-based companies. ''The challenge is one of jurisdiction in the Internet age,'' said Ulrich Boerger, a privacy lawyer at the U.S. law firm Latham & Watkins, in Hamburg. ''The Internet is a borderless entity, and in the world of electronic communications, there is no comparable system of customs rules that regulated the commerce of goods in the past.'' Alistair Verney, a Google spokesman in Brussels, said the company declined to comment. Google has said its social network, Google+, gives users the right to permanently delete information and limits communication to user-defined ''circles'' of individuals. Tina Kulow, a Facebook spokeswoman in Hamburg, said the company declined to comment on Mrs. Reding's statements. ''What I can tell -- as we did many times before -- is that Facebook is fully compliant with E.U. data-protection laws,'' Ms. Kulow said. Facebook and Google have signed the Safe Harbor Agreement, a 2000 pact between the United States and the European Union under which U.S. signatories promise to handle the data of European citizens according to E.U. rules. Mr. Boerger said that the Safe Harbor Agreement was increasingly perceived as a voluntary compliance agreement, which lacked controls that would determine whether companies were abiding by E.U. rules. ''A lot of companies I know of now don't even bother with signing the agreement because it is perceived as nonbinding,'' he said. The revisions to Europe's privacy law are being followed by Google, Facebook and other companies whose businesses rely in part on harvesting the data that users enter into the free services. The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union, a business group, submitted a 42-page brief to European lawmakers this year that argued against enacting undue data privacy restrictions that could inhibit the free flow of information. ''AmCham E.U. would like to caution against an attempt to address all the societal challenges of the 'right to be forgotten' exclusively through creation of unjustified obligations on data controllers and processors,'' according to the chamber's document. The brief went on to warn that some E.U. countries were seeking a strict data protection law that ''would inevitably lead to a general obligation to monitor the Internet, undermining the strong foundations on which the Internet was developed in the first place and the basis on which democratic societies operate.'' In Europe, Facebook is being audited by Irish data protection officials for its handling of customer information. Representatives of the Irish Data Protection Commission visited Facebook's offices in Dublin in October to see whether the company was adhering to Irish and E.U. data privacy laws. The agency has said it plans to conclude its audit this year. Data protection officials in Germany, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark have made similar requests to local Facebook affiliates. The Irish investigation is focusing in part on complaints made by an Austrian law student, Max Schrems, who in August filed a series of complaints against the company for retaining data he had entered on his own Facebook page, even after he had deleted it. Mr. Schrems, who is 24 years old and attends the University of Vienna, said he asked Facebook in Ireland, where the company is legally headquartered in Europe, to supply a list of personal data it had collected on him through his account, which he set up in 2008. Facebook sent him a PDF file that included 1,224 pages of information, he said, much of which Mr. Schrems had never entered himself but which Facebook had generated based on his inputs. The data included such information as his physical location in Austria, and his time as an exchange student at the University of Santa Clara in California this spring. Facebook also declined to tell Mr. Schrems whether it had kept a biometrical file of his face, which he said the company was using to identify him in its photo tagging feature. Despite his complaints, Mr. Schrems, in an interview, said he continued to use Facebook. ''I just want to see the company comply with European data protection law,'' he said. ''I think social networking is pretty cool and I'm not against that. I just find it ironic that a company which encourages users to be as transparent as possible is not being transparent.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Stratfor Hackers Claim Another Attack,"Hackers who said they attacked Stratfor Global Intelligence service, a security research group based in Austin, Tex., over the weekend have claimed a second target: Special Forces, a veterans-owned Web site that sells military-inspired merchandise and gives away a portion of profits to charity. The hackers, who claim to be members of the collective known as Anonymous, said they had breached the SpecialForces.com server Tuesday and stolen customers' credit card details and passwords, in what they said was stage two of a ""week long celebration of wreaking utter havoc on global financial systems, militaries and governments."" In a posting online , the hackers said they were able to steal customer credit card information even though the site's data was encrypted, and claimed to have 14,000 passwords and details for 8,000 credit cards belonging to Special Forces' customers. They said they breached the Special Forces' site months ago. By Wednesday, IdentityFinder, a maker of data protection software, confirmed that SpecialForces.com had been compromised and determined that hackers had taken 7,277 unique credit card numbers, 40,854 e-mail addresses and released 36,368 usernames and passwords. In a statement, Special Forces said its servers were hacked by Anonymous last August but added that it had ""no evidence of any further security breaches and we believe that the recent Stratfor incident is being used to bring this old news back into the spotlight.""

"After Suffering Damaging Cyberattack, the Pentagon Takes Defensive Action","WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department suffered one of its worst digital attacks in history in March, when a foreign intelligence service hacked into the computer system of a corporate contractor and obtained 24,000 Pentagon files during a single intrusion, senior officials said Thursday. The disclosure came as the Pentagon released a strategy for military operations in cyberspace, embodying a belief that traditional passive programs for defending military and associated corporate data systems are insufficient in an era when espionage, crime, disruptions and outright attacks are increasingly carried out over the Internet.  In releasing the strategy, William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, disclosed that over the years crucial files stolen from defense and industry data networks have included plans for missile tracking systems, satellite navigation devices, surveillance drones and top-of-the-line jet fighters. ''A great deal of it concerns our most sensitive systems, including aircraft avionics, surveillance technologies, satellite communications systems and network security protocols,'' Mr. Lynn said. Officials declined to identify the military contractor whose data system was compromised in the March attack. They also refused to name the nation they suspected was the culprit, saying that any accusation was a matter of official, and perhaps confidential, diplomatic dialogue. However, when major intrusions against computers operated by the Pentagon, the military or defense industry contractors have occurred in the past, officials have regularly blamed China, and sometimes Russia. The hacking attack in March, which stole important Pentagon files in the computer network of a contractor developing a military system, had not been previously disclosed. Other breaches have been discussed, including earlier this year at Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, and at RSA Security, which produces electronic identification for computer users. ''Current countermeasures have not stopped this outflow of sensitive information,'' Mr. Lynn said during a speech at the National Defense University. ''We need to do more to guard our digital storehouses of design innovation.'' The Pentagon's new strategy, the final piece of an effort by the Obama administration to defend computer networks operated across the government and private sector, calls for what is termed dynamic defense: looking for potential attackers on the Internet rather than waiting for an intruder to attack. It also calls on the Pentagon to build resiliency into its computer networks to help recover if attacked. Mr. Lynn also stressed the importance of cooperation with foreign partners to spot computer network threats overseas, before they compromise systems here. But James Lewis, an expert on computer network warfare at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Pentagon's computer networks were vulnerable to security gaps in the systems of allies with whom the military cooperates. America's allies are ''all over the map'' on cybersecurity issues, Mr. Lewis said. ''Some are very, very capable -- and some are clueless.'' The military's Cyber Command was created to coordinate defensive and offensive operations for Pentagon and military computer networks. Officials speak obliquely of its capabilities for carrying out offensive operations in cyberspace if ordered by the president. And for now, the new strategy is centered on how the United States can defend itself. But Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Pentagon also had to focus on offense -- including the possibility of responding to a cyberattack with military action. ''If it's O.K. to attack me, and I'm not going to do anything other than improve my defenses every time you attack me, it's very difficult to come up with a deterrent strategy,'' General Cartwright told reporters on Thursday. He said that in regard to cyberdefense, American military commanders were now devoting 90 percent of their attention to building better firewalls and only 10 percent to ways of deterring hackers from attacking. He said a better strategy would be the reverse, focusing almost entirely on offense. The Pentagon, he said, needs a strategy ''that says to the attacker, 'If you do this, the price to you is going to go up, and it's going to ever escalate.' '' He added that right now ''we're on a path that is too predictable -- it's purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking right now.'' Officials say the main challenge for the United States in a retaliatory cyberoperation is determining the attacker. The Internet makes it relatively easy for online assailants to mask identities, even if the geographic location where the attack originated can be confirmed. Mr. Lynn said most major efforts to penetrate crucial military computer networks were still undertaken by large rival nations. ''U.S. military power offers a strong deterrent against overtly destructive attacks,'' he said. ''Although attribution in cyberspace can be difficult, the risk of discovery and response for a major nation is still too great to risk launching destructive attacks against the United States.'' However, he warned that the technical expertise needed to carry out harmful Internet raids was certain to migrate to smaller rogue states and to nonstate actors, in particular terrorists. If a terrorist group obtains ''disruptive or destructive cybertools, we have to assume they will strike with little hesitation,'' Mr. Lynn said. The new strategy describes how the military's capabilities would support the Department of Homeland Security and federal law enforcement agencies. And it acknowledges how much the military relies on private sector computer networks for such vital supplies as electricity.  "
Hackers Release More Data From Stratfor," 1:41 p.m. | Updated    After a weeklong holiday hacking spree on Stratfor Global Intelligence, hackers have dumped what they claim are 75,000 names, addresses, credit card numbers and passwords for every customer who has ever paid Stratfor for its services, along with the 860,000 usernames, e-mail addresses and passwords for anyone who has ever registered on the site. The data dump on Thursday night caps off a week of threats by hackers, who claim to be members of the collective Anonymous, to embarrass and expose Stratfor, a security research organization that puts out an influential newsletter on security issues. Earlier, the group released 50,000 credit card numbers of Stratfor customers.  IdentityFinder, a data-protection software maker,  found that in their latest release Stratfor's hackers had dumped a total of 68,063 unique credit card numbers, of which 36,000 were not yet expired. It also confirmed that the hackers had released 859,311 unique email addresses, 860,160 encrypted passwords and 50,569 phone numbers. There could be more stolen data to come. Last Monday, Barrett Brown, an Anonymous spokesman, wrote in a post that the real goal of the breach was to publish 3.3 million e-mails between Stratfor employees and its intelligence sources and clients. Those emails have yet to be published, which leaves Stratfor in the position of trying to recover from the attack without knowing whether the worst is over. The Stratfor breach first surfaced on Saturday, when hackers defaced the group's Web site with their own message. The hackers claimed on Twitter and in online posts that they were able to gain access to the company's sensitive customer data and e-mail correspondence because it was not encrypted. The company has taken to Facebook and YouTube to share updates and offer its paid subscribers identity-theft protection. Some customers have left comments on the Facebook page complaining they did not hear directly from Stratfor about the breach. One voiced a more general concern: ""As a Stratfor reader, I am learning painful lessons. Cyberwar is here. Stratfor and the subscribers are the early victims,"" he wrote. ""It will be some time before the sources of intelligence to Stratfor will rebuild their confidence in the organization. Some of them have more to lose than a credit card transaction.""   "
Using Apple's Find My Mac Feature,"The disappearance of a device is far and away the most serious digital security and privacy risk that owners of Apple laptops and mobile devices face.  With viruses and other malware making only the rarest of appearances, sensitive personal information or valuable company intellectual property is more apt end up in the hands of someone nefarious through the loss or theft of a device itself. If fraud results, an already costly mishap can become painful and expensive indeed. For quite some time, Apple has given iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad owners a way to mitigate this risk by offering them a free app that can locate a lost or stolen device and, if it can't be retrieved, wipe it of its contents remotely. Now, with the introduction of its iCloud service, Apple has brought this capability to its computers with a feature called Find My Mac.  It's especially worth activating on a laptop that you often take on the road, since such things are misplaced at an alarming rate - a 2008 study of 106 airports in the United States by research firm Ponemon Institute found that travelers lost more than 12,200 laptops a week - and they may contain enormous amounts of valuable information.  The main purpose of iCloud is to make all your content available to you on all your devices by storing it in Apple data centers, where it is accessible to each device. (Apple provides security for your data by encrypting it while it's traveling over the Internet and sitting in storage.) But by giving Apple this sort of access to your Mac, a find-and-wipe feature becomes possible. It can locate your Mac when it's on and connected to the Internet, cause it to play a sound or display a message to whoever found it or lock the machine or erase all of its contents. To take advantage of this feature, you will have to turn it on. This is simple. Just make sure the box for enabling Find My Mac is checked when you set up iCloud (or you can go to System Preferences, select iCloud and then enable it there). Note that iCloud requires the use of Lion, the latest version of the Mac operating system. And using Find My Mac means you have to allow Apple to access your Mac's location, something you might not want to do if you (and not just your Mac) are on the run.  You may also want to give Apple the power to jolt your Mac from sleep when you want to find or wipe it. Choose this setting by going to System Preferences and clicking iCloud or Energy Saver and checking the box for ""wake for network access.""  If your laptop goes missing, you simply visit the icloud.com Web site and sign in with your Apple ID and password. If your Mac is on and online, you will be able to see its location on a Google map. The site will also show you where your iPhone and iPad are if you have installed Find apps on them. Click on the circle with an ""i"" inside to open a box, and choose it to make a sound go off, display message, lock it or wipe it. It's the kind of feature you hope you never have to use, but are awfully glad you took the time to set up in that terrible moment when you realize that your laptop has gone missing and may be gone for good.

More Security For Accounts,"We all know there are risks to storing personal information online, yet few of us take even the most basic precautions, like choosing unique and hard-to-guess passwords.  On Thursday, Google will introduce a tool, known as two-step verification, that will make Google accounts more secure and less vulnerable to hackers and phishing scams. Google users who choose to use the tool will still enter their passwords to get to Google accounts like Gmail, Picasa and Google Docs. But they will also need to enter a second verification code, generated on the spot for one-time use and sent to their cellphone through a text message, phone call or app. ''Passwords tend to be the weakest link in the process of securing a Google account,'' said Nishit Shah, a product manager for Google security who worked on the project. ''We wanted to improve the security of the account in a way that is not just something the user knows, the password, but what the user has, the phone.'' The threat is a real one. For instance, a hacker reached personal and business information about Twitter and its executives by breaking into e-mail accounts. And when you get those e-mails that say friends are abroad and in dire need of money, a phishing scheme is to blame. Google's new operating system for laptops, called Chrome OS, stores all of a user's information in the cloud and none of it on a computer hard drive, making strong security even more important. Businesses have used tools that require several passwords to access company systems for years, and Google started offering its business customers the service last year. But consumer Web sites haven't done it, in part because the security hardware that companies give employees, like key fobs, is expensive and inconvenient. Google has tried to overcome that by delivering the codes on cellphones, something most people have with them all the time. Users can provide a backup phone number in case their phone is dead or lost, and receive a list of 10 backup codes to use if they can't get the codes via phone. And people who don't want to enter two codes each time they access their Google account can tell Google to remember the code for 30 days. Google users can find a link to set up two-step verification on the account settings page. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Security Woes Deepen for Sony,"It has been a tough couple of months for Sony. The company's PlayStation Network was breached by hackers in late April, and now several other units of the company have suffered broad security breaches.  In the last two weeks alone, half a dozen Sony Web sites and servers, including some in the United States and Brazil, have been breached. And a group of hackers calling themselves LulzSec posted proprietary Sony source code on file-sharing Web sites. Although the members of LulzSec have gone after other organizations in the past, including Fox and PBS, the attacks against Sony have been unrelenting. ''These attacks are a combination of Sony's lax security and a number of groups being very vigilant about breaking in to show how powerful they can be,'' said Frank Kenney, vice president for global security at Ipswitch, which offers ways to securely transfer files online. ''What Sony has to do is re-examine their entire security system, including the type of code they are using and the type of servers. They have to acknowledge that their brand is at stake.'' Mr. Kenney said that no server was impervious to hackers, but a company like Sony, with millions of credit cards and users' personal information on file, had a responsibility to ensure that protection ''equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security's servers is in place.'' He said that the fact that dozens of Sony Web sites and servers had been breached indicated it was clearly a companywide problem. In an interview in New York last month, Howard Stringer, Sony's chief executive, said the company was working with a number of outside security companies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent further attacks. Ron Gula, chief executive of Tenable Network Security, an enterprise security company, said the problems at Sony most likely went back years to when the company first built its infrastructure. ''A lot of times these problems are more holistic,'' he said. Mr. Gula said that Sony would be unable to stop the attacks overnight, and that it could take years for the company to get sufficient security in place to protect all its servers, databases and Web sites. NICK BILTON COMMENTThey might be able to stop LulzSec, but who will trust them with credit card data in the future? It's pretty appalling. -- J. D., Massachusetts  "
There's No Data Sheriff on the Wild Web,"A company suffers a catastrophic attack on its servers. Gone are names, e-mail addresses, home phone numbers, passwords, credit card numbers. Everything ends up in the hands of hackers. What federal law covers such a breach of consumers' privacy? None.  This lack of federal oversight has incensed privacy advocates for years. But the last several months have been an online consumer's worst nightmare. About two weeks ago, hackers dived into Sony's PlayStation 3 game system, resulting in the loss of up to 77 million customers' personal and private information and over 12 million credit and debit card numbers. Epsilon, an e-mail marketing company, lost millions of customers' e-mail addresses to hackers in early April; Apple, Google and Microsoft have all been quietly collecting location data about mobile customers without their knowledge. And last year, AT&T was attacked through a bug in its iPad software, resulting in the loss of 100,000 customer e-mail addresses. Each company was blamed for failing to properly protect consumer information. But for redress, consumers must rely on states, and serious punishment or fines rarely happen. ''There needs to be new legislation and new laws need to be adopted'' to protect the public, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who has been pressing Sony to answer questions about its data breach and what the company did to avoid it. ''Companies need to be held accountable and need to pay significantly when private and confidential information is imperiled.'' But how? Privacy experts say that Congress should pass legislation regulating companies if they collect certain types of information. If such laws existed today, they say, Sony could be held responsible for failing to properly protect the data by employing up-to-date security on its systems. Or at the very least, companies would be forced to update their security systems. In underground online forums last week, hackers said Sony's servers were severely outdated and infiltrating them was relatively easy. Eugene Spafford, a security expert and professor at Purdue University, told a House subcommittee last week that computer security experts had been aware for months that the PlayStation's Web servers were outdated and that the company's network lacked sufficient security -- which he said Sony must have also known. But Professor Spafford does not see any new legislation in the near future that would force companies to take security more seriously. ''Over the last five years there have been several bills that have been introduced through committees but never made it all the way through Congress,'' he said in an interview. ''Companies tend to fight the bills, saying it would be too expensive or onerous to implement better security.'' Technology also has a way of advancing far ahead of the law. In many instances, the data being collected goes beyond basic personal information. Facebook, for example, logs billions of its users' actions each month, including the photos uploaded, each word of a status update and which friends people connect with on the site. The data is used to deliver highly personalized advertising. It is estimated that the company will serve up over a trillion of the ads this year. And yet no outside oversight exists to monitor the company's use of this data, or its practices to protect it. Christina Gagnier, a lawyer specializing in privacy and copyright, said the privacy bills being discussed by lawmakers addressed some of the data collection by companies like Facebook, but could be outdated before they pass Congress. ''I'm afraid that the legislation on the table right now isn't going to forecast what coming privacy issues are going to look like in the next couple of years,'' she said. ''Mobile, location and data storage will be a big issue in future privacy debates, and I don't think lawmakers are looking forward to what's next.'' Ms. Gagnier also fears that judges would be unable to decipher new laws. She cited a case heard in the Supreme Court last year, involving a police officer in California who was using a department-issued pager. During the hearing, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked how text messaging works. If two messages are sent simultaneously, he asked, does one get a ''busy signal''?  "
Questions About Motives Behind Stratfor Hack," When hackers used the Christmas holiday to attack Stratfor, a security group based in Austin, Tex.,  they initially said they were aiming to steal the credit card numbers of its clients and use them to make $1 million in donations to charity.  But by Tuesday, it was unclear who was actually behind the attack, and whether the real goal was to play Robin Hood or release a trove of Stratfor e-mail correspondence.   On Saturday, hackers claiming to be members of the collective known as Anonymous defaced the Web site of Stratfor, which puts out a newsletter on security and intelligence issues, and posted a file online that they claimed was the organization's confidential client list, along with credit card details, passwords and home addresses for those clients. The clients were affiliated with organizations including Bank of America, the Defense Department, Doctors Without Borders, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United Nations.   The hackers claimed to have obtained 2.7 million e-mails from Stratfor's servers, a number they later increased to 3.3 million.  They said they were able to obtain the e-mail and credit card details because Stratfor had failed to encrypt its data - a basic first step in data protection. IdentityFinder, a data protection software maker, found that hackers had released 47,680 unique e-mail addresses and 50,277 unique credit card numbers - of which 9,651 were not yet expired. Of the 44,188 encrypted passwords, IdentityFinder said 50 percent could be easily cracked.  Stratfor has not clarified whether its data was encrypted, and did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But on Sunday, with its Web site still down, it took to Facebook to respond to the attack. There it said that the published list of ""private clients"" was ""merely a list of some of the members that have purchased our publications and does not comprise a list of individuals or entities that have a relationship with Stratfor beyond their purchase of our subscription based publications.""  By then, hackers had already begun posting receipts online that it said were for donations made with Stratfor subscribers' stolen credit card details to organizations like the Red Cross and CARE.  In an interview on Monday, a Red Cross spokeswoman, Laura Howe, said that because her organization sees an uptick in giving around the holidays, it was difficult to ascertain how much of its weekend donations online were related to the Stratfor breach.  ""We're aware of the issue and our online giving team is looking into it,"" Ms. Howe said. ""If someone believes an unauthorized charge has been made, they need to contact their credit card company and we will work with the credit card companies on refunding the donation."" Contacted Monday,  Brian Feagans, a CARE spokesman, said he had not heard about the Stratfor breach. But on Tuesday he issued this statement: ""We are looking into this matter and will work with any Stratfor hacking victims who did not intend to give to CARE to assure they get reimbursed.""  Computer security experts began weighing in on Stratfor's breach Monday. Mikko Hypponen, an influential  security expert, pointed out in a blog post that the hack was likely to do charities more harm than good. ""When credit card owners see unauthorized charges on their cards, they report them to their bank or credit card company. Credit card companies will do a charge back to the charities, which will have to return the money,"" Mr. Hypponen wrote. ""In some cases, charities could be hit with penalties. At the very least, they will lose time and money in handling the charge backs."" In a statement posted online on Monday, Barrett Brown, an Anonymous spokesman, said that the goal of the Stratfor attack was not to donate money to charities.   ""Rather, the operation was pursued in order to obtain the 2.7 million e-mails that exist on the firm's servers,"" Mr. Brown wrote in a post on the Web site Pastebin. ""This wealth of data includes correspondence with untold thousands of contacts who have spoken to Stratfor's employees off the record over more than a decade."" But by Tuesday, hackers had released only limited e-mail correspondence. They posted one e-mail from Stratfor's chief executive, George Friedman, to a Stratfor senior programmer, thanking him for his help in promoting Mr. Friedman's recent book.  There were also questions as to whether the Stratfor attack was really the work of Anonymous. On Sunday, someone claiming to represent Anonymous posted a message on Pastebin denying responsibility for the attack: ""The Stratfor hack is definitely not the work of Anonymous.""  The confusion escalated Monday night when a separate note on Pastebin claimed that the authors of the first post were Stratfor employees and that the post ""claiming the Stratfor hack is not the work of Anonymous is not the work of Anonymous.""  ""With these sorts of operations, there will always be objections from one quarter or another that it's not really an Anonymous op,"" Mr. Brown said in an e-mail on Monday.  He said that the denial message had been posted by someone ""who has a history of putting up such things under false pretenses.""   "
Citi Data Theft Points Up a Nagging Problem,"Citigroup's revelation that hackers stole personal information from more than 200,000 credit card holders makes it one of the largest direct attacks on a major bank. Even more striking is that similar data breaches have been occurring for years -- and the financial industry has failed to prevent them. Details remain scarce, but the disclosure of the Citigroup breach on Thursday quickly turned into a debate on whether the banks and major credit card companies had invested enough money to safeguard the personal information of their customers. ''They're not at all on top of it,'' said Avivah Litan, a financial security analyst at Gartner Inc. ''It's almost shocking.''  In Washington, the finger-pointing has already begun. Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said on Thursday that she planned to call on some banks to strengthen their authentication procedures when customers log onto online accounts. That's on top of new data security rules that federal regulators are completing. Lawmakers, meanwhile, said they were outraged that Citigroup waited since early May to notify its customers; some are preparing legislation. Representative James R. Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, said he was ''shocked and disappointed'' to learn of Citi's delayed disclosure. ''They knew the customers' data was potentially exposed in May and only now are they telling them about the threat,'' he said. ''Being more forthcoming is essential.'' Consumers, meanwhile, are feeling increasingly vulnerable amid recent reports of data breaches at big companies, like Lockheed Martin, Epsilon and Sony. A. J. Angus, a 25-year-old Google employee, was put in double jeopardy. On Thursday, he learned that his Citi credit card data had been stolen. Only a few weeks earlier, he learned that personal data on his Sony PlayStation 3 was compromised. ''You have to be vigilant,'' he said, adding that he periodically checks his credit report and looks over his transactions almost daily on a personal finance Web site. On Thursday, Citigroup began notifying about half of the 200,000 affected customers that it planned to replace their credit cards after it discovered last month that hackers had gained access to its computer systems. The bank said that the thieves obtained customer names, card numbers, addresses, and e-mail details. Social security numbers, expiration dates and the three-digit code found on the back of most credit cards were not compromised -- a move that security experts say makes the exposed cardholders less likely to become fraud victims. Neither Citigroup's debit card business nor its online banking operations were breached. ''Citi has implemented enhanced procedures to prevent a recurrence of this type of event,'' the company said in a statement. The intrusion is not all that unique. Over the last six years, there have been 288 publicly disclosed breaches at financial services companies that exposed at least 83 million customer records, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. Credit card industry officials say security issues go to the heart of their brands and they are trying to keep up with ever-more sophisticated criminals. ''We're not dealing with 14-year-old hacker kids,'' said Steve Elefant, the chief information officer at Heartland Payment Systems, which overhauled its security measures after the systems it used to process credit and debit card transactions were hacked in 2008. ''We're talking about 21st-century bank robbers -- sophisticated, organized criminal gangs, located mostly in Eastern Europe and the U.S.'' Making matters worse, nearly every step along the payment chain is outsourced from the time a card is swiped to the time a monthly statement arrives, leaving plenty of openings for enterprising thieves. Security is further hampered by a patchwork of data protection laws and regulatory agencies, each with limited mandates. ''We need a uniform national standard for data security and data breach notification,'' said Representative Mary Bono Mack, a California Republican who is pushing for legislation on better consumer safeguards. ''In the meantime, regulators need to do a better job of being a consumer watchdog.'' Big credit card lenders are loath to acknowledge another reason that the breaches keep happening: they are in the business of reducing the financial losses stemming from fraud, not preventing data theft in the first place. As a result, analysts say, they have devoted the bulk of their resources to trying to stop fraudulent transactions from occurring. ''Data breaches are one thing,'' noted David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a payments industry newsletter. ''Acting on that information is another, and the systems in place to catch fraud when it is trying to be perpetrated are extremely good.'' Indeed, while the thieves have gotten more skilled, the amount of money the banks have lost to fraud has actually stayed the same over the last six years -- and has sharply fallen since the early 1990s. Today, fraud costs the banks about 5 cents for every $100 that is charged, compared with 15 cents for every $100 in 1992, according to Nilson data. Merchant advocates, meanwhile, say the banks have little incentive to reduce it more because, in some cases, it can be a source of income. Not only do they take in hefty charge-back fees from merchants -- sometimes $25 or more for each fraudulent purchase -- but in many cases retailers must swallow the cost of the item fraudulently purchased. Preventing data theft from occurring seems to be a lower priority. After the huge credit card data breach of a payment processor in 2005, the major credit card companies banded together to form a set of security standards for the industry. But six years on, compliance with those rules has been mixed. Although virtually all of the 1,000 biggest merchants meet those requirements, far fewer than 60 percent of the millions of mom-and-pop retailers and online merchants do, according to Visa data. Other proactive steps have also fallen by the wayside because of their cost. In Europe and Asia, most credit and debit card issuers have switched to cards that use small chips embedded inside the plastic that do a better job protecting transaction data. In the United States, the banks and card companies have not adopted the technology, reasoning that retailers are unwilling to spend heavily to upgrade their existing card readers. Likewise, some security experts say encrypting data as it flows across the entire payment network would make data far less vulnerable to being extracted by thieves. However, only a tiny fraction of merchants and processors have upgraded their systems. Mr. Elefant said the industry needed to adopt the encryptions technology more quickly. ''Unfortunately, some companies look at breaches as the cost of doing business,'' he said. ''That's not the right way to look at it. You need to be as secure as you possibly can be.'' Others suggest the banks need to do more to enlist their customers, like providing more regular fraud alerts and giving them more control to turn on and off their credit cards. ''What they don't do enough of is engage the identity holder in the war against fraud,'' said James Van Dyke of Javelin Strategy and Research, a payments consulting firm. ''They greatly prefer to wage this battle solo.''  "
"Data Privacy, Put to The Test","BIG OIL. Big Food. Big Pharma. To the catalog of corporate ''bigs'' that worry a lot of us little people, add this: Big Data. It was not a good week for those who guard their privacy. First, we learned that Apple and Google have been using our smartphones to collect location data. Then Sony acknowledged that its PlayStation network had been hacked -- the latest in a string of troubling data breaches. You'd have to be living off the grid not to realize that just about everything there is to know about you -- what you buy, where you go -- is worth something to someone. And the more we live online, the more companies learn about us.  But to what extent do others have a right to share and sell that information? That is the crux of a data-mining case that had arguments last Tuesday before the Supreme Court. The case, Sorrell v. IMS Health, is ostensibly about medical privacy: Vermont passed a law in 2007 that lets each doctor decide whether pharmacies can, for marketing purposes, sell prescription records linking him or her by name to the kinds and amounts of drugs prescribed. State legislators passed the law after the Vermont Medical Society said that such marketing intruded on doctors and could exert too much influence on prescriptions. But three health information firms, including IMS Health and Verispan, along with a pharmaceutical industry trade group, challenged the law, saying it restricted commercial free speech. Access to prescription records, IMS Health says, helps pharmaceutical companies market efficiently to doctors whose patients would most benefit from specific drugs. Now the justices are to decide whether the Vermont law is constitutional. But with the recent headlines about privacy invasion -- the PlayStation hack followed a recent breach at the online marketing company Epsilon that exposed e-mail addresses of customers of Citibank, Walgreens, Target and other companies -- the Vermont case is tapping into a much broader conversation about consumer protection and informed consent. The case raises questions about who is collecting, managing, storing, sharing and selling all that data. Just as important, privacy advocates say, it raises questions about whether data brokers are adequately safeguarding it. People generally don't have much control over who collects and sells information about them. Moreover, says Christopher Calabrese, a legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, they also don't even know the names of the data brokers who compile those electronic profiles. And, so, consumer advocates are setting their sights on Big Data. ''Without government intervention, we may soon find the Internet has been transformed from a library and playground to a fishbowl,'' Mr. Calabrese testified in March during a Senate hearing on consumer privacy, ''and that we have unwittingly ceded core values of privacy and autonomy.'' There are a few laws, like the Video Privacy Protection Act, that prohibit businesses from releasing personally identifiable records, like video rental histories, without customer consent. The Digital Advertising Alliance, a coalition of online marketing groups, introduced a program last year that notifies consumers about online tracking and allows them to opt out of advertising tailored to them. The Vermont law amounts to a kind of do-not-call option for doctors who may welcome visits from pharmaceutical sales reps but don't want drug marketing based on their own prescription records. That marketing practice is possible because pharmacies, which are required by law to collect detailed information about prescriptions they fill, can sell doctor-specific prescription records to data brokers. (According to federal privacy regulations, personal information about patients, like names and addresses, must be removed before the records can be sold for marketing.) Firms like IMS Health then combine the records, and pharmaceutical reps often use them to tailor presentations to individual doctors. The central concern is privacy -- of both doctors and their patients. While pharmacies remove the names of patients before selling the records, those names are replaced with unique codes that track patients over time from doctor to doctor, according to the Vermont complaint. That means data firms could create a profile that includes a person's prescriptions as well as the names of the pharmacies and dates at which the person picked up the medications, says Latanya Sweeney, a visiting professor of computer science at Harvard. ''It ends up building a detailed prescription profile of individuals,'' says Professor Sweeney, whose research on data re-identification was cited by several briefs in the case. ''Those extended profiles tend to be very unique.'' The concern, she says, particularly in a small state like Vermont, is that a nameless prescription record could theoretically be enough to identify someone who might not want others to know that he takes, say, anti-depressants. Moreover, Professor Sweeney argues, data miners could collate those files with public information, like voter registration and hospital discharge records, to link prescriptions to specific people. Federal health privacy regulation, she says, does not protect patient records once they have been de-identified. Nor does the law prohibit re-identification. But IMS Health says it isn't aware of any case of re-identifying patients whose prescription records were de-identified in accordance with federal rules. The company says it doubly encrypts each patient's identity and gives the encryption keys to several third parties -- meaning that no single entity can decode a file by itself, says Kimberly Gray, chief privacy officer at IMS Health. The company typically sells combined reports that show how many patients received a certain drug from a certain doctor, but not the specific drugstores those patients frequent, Ms. Gray says. IMS never uses public information or outside data sets to try to re-identify patients, she says, and when it does provide encoded patient histories to others for research purposes, it prohibits those third parties from making such attempts. ''We would never want to re-identify someone,'' Ms. Gray says. ''No good can come from that.'' Still, it is hard to prevent people from trying to re-identify patients, says Lee Tien, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil liberties group that filed a brief in support of Vermont. It would be easier, he says, if Congress passed a law that went further than Vermont's, giving people the right to consent before their encrypted prescription records were sold for marketing purposes. ''In Vermont, the doctor can decide,'' Mr. Tien says. ''But we'd prefer it if the patient were able to say, 'Don't sell my data.' ''  "
Medical Data Of Thousands Posted Online,"A medical privacy breach led to the public posting on a commercial Web site of data for 20,000 emergency room patients at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., including names and diagnosis codes, the hospital has confirmed. The information stayed online for nearly a year. Since discovering the breach last month, the hospital has been investigating how a detailed spreadsheet made its way from one of its vendors, a billing contractor identified as Multi-Specialty Collection Services, to a Web site called Student of Fortune, which allows students to solicit paid assistance with their schoolwork.  Gary Migdol, a spokesman for Stanford Hospital and Clinics, said the spreadsheet first appeared on the site on Sept. 9, 2010, as an attachment to a question about how to convert the data into a bar graph. Although medical security breaches are not uncommon, the Stanford breach was notable for the length of time that the data remained publicly available without detection. Even as government regulators strengthen oversight by requiring public reporting of breaches and imposing heavy fines, experts on medical security said the Stanford breach spotlighted the persistent vulnerability posed by legions of outside contractors that gain access to private data. The spreadsheet included names, diagnosis codes, account numbers, admission and discharge dates, and billing charges for patients seen at Stanford Hospital's emergency room during a six-month period in 2009, Mr. Migdol said. It did not include Social Security numbers, birth dates, credit-card numbers or other information used to perpetrate identity theft, he said, but the hospital is offering free identity protection services to affected patients. The breach was discovered by a patient and reported to the hospital on Aug. 22, according to a letter written four days later to affected patients by Diane Meyer, Stanford Hospital's chief privacy officer. The hospital took ''aggressive steps,'' and the Web site removed the post the next day, Ms. Meyer wrote. It also notified state and federal agencies, Mr. Migdol said. ''It is clearly disturbing when this information gets public,'' he said. ''It is our intent 100 percent of the time to keep this information confidential and private, and we work hard every day to ensure that.'' Diane Dobson, of Santa Clara, Calif., said her ''jaw dropped'' on Saturday when she intercepted the letter from Ms. Meyer addressed to her 21-year-old son, who she said had received emergency psychiatric treatment at Stanford in 2009. Ms. Dobson said it could have been disastrous if her son, who lives at home, had learned that his name was linked to a mental health diagnosis. ''My son, I can tell you, is fragile and confused enough that this would have sent him over the edge,'' Ms. Dobson said, saying she decided to speak publicly now because of her frustration with the breach. ''Everyone with an electronic medical record is at risk, and that means everyone.'' Records compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services reveal that personal medical data for more than 11 million people have been improperly exposed during the past two years alone. Since passage of the federal stimulus package, which includes provisions requiring prompt public reporting of breaches, the government has received notice of 306 cases from September 2009 to June 2011 that affected at least 500 people apiece. A recent report to Congress tallied 30,000 smaller breaches from September 2009 to December 2010, affecting more than 72,000 people. The major breaches -- a disconcerting log of stolen laptops, hacked networks, unencrypted records, misdirected mailings, missing files and wayward e-mails -- took place in 44 states. One occurred at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford in January 2010, when a desktop computer holding the medical records of 532 patients was stolen from the heart center by an employee. Hospital officials said at the time that no patient information was compromised. But the California Department of Public Health fined the hospital $250,000, the maximum allowed, for failing to report the breach within five days of discovery, as is required under state law. The hospital appealed the fine, and a settlement has been reached but not yet disclosed, a department spokesman said. The Stanford episode reinforces the fear that even the most prestigious medical centers are not immune to risk. Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which trains Harvard medical students, agreed this year to pay a $1 million federal fine after an employee left paper medical records on a subway while commuting to work. The pages included the names of 192 patients, and diagnoses for about a third of them, including diagnoses for H.I.V./AIDS. They were never recovered. The Department of Health and Human Services viewed the breach as a potential violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the 1996 law that requires protection of medical records. Mr. Migdol, the hospital spokesman, said Stanford had concluded that ''there is no employee from Stanford Hospital who has done anything impermissible.'' He said he expected the federal Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own investigation. Susan McAndrew, a deputy director in the department's Office for Civil Rights, said she could not discuss whether an investigation was in progress. The vendor, identified by Mr. Migdol as Multi-Specialty Collection Services L.L.C., based in Los Angeles, is described on its Web site as a subsidiary of Texican Inc. Joe Anthony Reyna, who is listed in state and commercial records as Texican's principal, did not respond to messages left at his office and home. Mr. Migdol said the company created the spreadsheet as part of a billing-and-payment analysis for the hospital. He said the hospital immediately suspended its relationship with the contractor and received written certification that previous files would be destroyed or returned securely. Tina Warner, a vice president at Chegg, an online company that bought Student of Fortune in August, said the site's principals were unaware the data had been posted until informed by the hospital. They then ''took it down within 30 seconds,'' she said. Ms. Warner said the identity of the person who posted the Stanford data could not be determined from the user name. Bryan Cline, a vice president with the Health Information Trust Alliance, a nonprofit company that establishes privacy guidelines for health providers, said nearly 20 percent of breaches involved outside contractors, accounting for more than half of all the records exposed. Dr. Cline said health care providers depend unjustifiably on legal contracts with vendors to protect medical records. ''That just doesn't work, as we can see,'' he said. ''You have to do due diligence, something to assure yourself that the people you're giving your data to can be trusted.''  "
Regulators Say Social Network Violated Child Privacy Law,"Skid-e-Kids describes itself as a Facebook for children ages 7 to 14. It allows them to watch ""age-appropriate"" movies and socialize with their friends, and it stipulates that ""parents are in charge.""  Now the company, which is based in Atlanta, has fallen afoul of a federal law designed to protect the digital privacy of children. On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission announced that Skid-e-Kids had agreed to settle its charges that it had allowed children under the age of 13 to register on the site without their parents' consent, which is against the law. According to the F.T.C., the site collected the first and last names of its 5,600 underage users, their dates of birth -- even the cities in which they lived.  The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting any personal information about a child under 13. The law was enacted over a decade ago; the F.T.C. recently proposed changes to the statute, to reflect advances in smartphone and geolocation technology.   An emotive issue, children's privacy can be particularly difficult to enforce. Case in point: Despite Facebook's official policy barring children under 13 from creating accounts, independent studies have repeatedly shown that millions of children lie about their age in order to register for Facebook, and some do it with help from their parents.  A paper published in the journal First Monday earlier this month argued that age bans are ineffective, given that so many children lie about their age and inadvertently allow a vast trove of data to be collected about them. Over half of the 13-year-olds surveyed for the study said they had signed up for a Facebook account before they turned 13, and more than three-fourths of parents surveyed said they would allow their children to circumvent the age ban, mostly for educational purposes.   ""Rather than providing parents with additional mechanisms to engage with sites honestly and negotiate the proper bounds of data collection about their children, parents are often actively helping their children deceive the sites in order to achieve access to the opportunities they desire,"" wrote Danah Boyd, the lead author of the study and a researcher for Microsoft Research Labs.  Skid-e-Kids says it offers children help with homework and parents a dashboard to keep tabs on what their kids are up to. ""Skid-e-Kids is the only social network that is truly committed to not only keeping our children safe, but also making sure that they are systematically learning while they are having fun,"" the site promises. The F.T.C., however, found that the site allowed children to register without collecting a parent's email address, let alone obtaining their permission. It also charged the site's operator, Jones O. Godwin, with misrepresenting the site's information collection practices.  The settlement requires Mr. Godwin to destroy information he collected from children  and link to online educational material about privacy. It also imposes a $100,000 civil penalty, all but $1,000 of which will be suspended if Mr. Godwin  ""provided truthful information about his financial condition"" and  complies with a requirement that he get proper privacy guidance for any Web site he runs.

Tips for Using Wi-Fi Securely,"When you use a Wi-Fi connection to access the Internet, the data you transmit flies through the air. This allows us to remain blissfully connected while wandering through the house with a laptop, in a hotel with a tablet or in a departure lounge with a smartphone, but it also comes with privacy and security risks.  While you surf, someone with the right software and equipment could snatch your private information from the airwaves, potentially reading e-mails to your boss or collecting the pictures you post to Facebook.  And if left open, a stranger could potentially use your home Wi-Fi network to commit crimes. For instance, in March, an unsuspecting homeowner in Buffalo woke up to F.B.I. agents wielding assault weapons. They were looking for a child pornographer, who lived next door and had been using his neighbor's network. But you can use Wi-Fi securely. Here are tips from the industry group Wi-Fi Alliance on how to keep your data private and your home network creep-free. Turn on the security that comes with your home router. Any Wi-Fi router bought in the last six years includes security technology called Wi-Fi Protected Access version two, or WPA2, which keeps information private and secure by strongly encrypting it while it travels. But you have to turn it on WPA2 to benefit from it.  Check your device manual for directions on how to activate this security technology. Newer devices typically make setup a simple matter, but if you're having trouble you may be able to jump-start the process by pressing a button on your device marked by a symbol with two arrows that reads ""Wi-Fi Protected Setup."" Make sure you're using WPA2, and not WPA -- and certainly not the ancient, 11-year-old WEP, which was broken by hackers long ago. Set up a strong network password. WPA2 also allows you to control who connects to your home network by setting up a password. Wi-Fi Alliance recommends using a password that's at least eight characters long and includes a mixture of upper case and lower case letters, along with a couple symbols or numbers. Avoid including your name, address, router brand name or dictionary words because they can make your password easy to guess or crack. If need be, write your complicated, impossible-to-remember password down and stash it in a locked drawer or somewhere else secure. Use Web sites that encrypt your traffic. When using a Wi-Fi network, whether at home or in a hotel, cafe or any other public place, make sure that sensitive Web sites you use encrypt the data you send and receive. Encryption is occurring if you see HTTPS in the address bar, and almost universally occurs when you make a purchase on a shopping site, bank online or log into a Web-based e-mail service. In recent years some Web services, Google's Gmail service, Microsoft's Hotmail and Facebook among them, allow you to use HTTPS all the time to protect all your private communications from potential snoops nearby. Don't connect automatically to random Wi-Fi hotspots. It's tempting to jump online using an open Wi-Fi network while you're out and about. But not all of the 1.4 million public hotspots in the world are necessarily safe to use. While the chances are probably slim that you'll connect to a rogue hotspot operated by someone nefarious, it's wise to at least take the extra step of selecting which, if any, public network you access. While you're looking at the list of available networks, try to stick to ones that use WPA2.  Use VPN technology to encrypt your activity. If you travel a lot and must transmit sensitive data over public Wi-Fi networks, it's wise to use virtual private network software, which creates an encrypted tunnel for your data to flow through the Internet. Many large companies provide VPN technology to their employees and require them to use it while traveling to protect valuable corporate information. If your company does not provide you with a VPN, there are now a number of user-friendly and affordable consumer VPNs on the market.   "
Whistle-Blower in Phone-Hacking Case Reportedly Found Dead,"Updated | 6:11 p.m. Sean Hoare, a former News of the World journalist who claimed that Andy Coulson, the tabloid's former editor, knew about and encouraged phone hacking, was found dead on Monday, The Guardian reports. According to the newspaper, Mr. Hoare, who ""worked on The Sun and The News of the World with Coulson before being dismissed for drink and drugs problems,"" was ""said to have been found dead at his Watford home."" Police officers in Watford, outside London, refused to confirm the dead man's identity to The Guardian but said in a statement: ""The death is currently being treated as unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious. Police investigations into this incident are ongoing."" Laura Kuenssberg, The BBC's chief political correspondent, reported on Twitter that Mr. Hoare's death was ""confirmed."" Mr. Hoare told The New York Times in 2010 that Mr. Coulson was aware of phone hacking at The Sun and The News of the World, which are both owned by News Corporation's British newspaper division.   Mr. Coulson, who was arrested last week in connection with a new police investigation into misconduct at The News of the World, has always denied that he knew about the phone hacking that went on when he was the tabloid's editor. As my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Graham Bowley reported last September: Sean Hoare, a former reporter and onetime close friend of Coulson's, also recalled discussing hacking. The two men first worked together at The Sun, where, Hoare said, he played tape recordings of hacked messages for Coulson. At News of the World, Hoare said he continued to inform Coulson of his pursuits. Coulson ""actively encouraged me to do it,"" Hoare said. Hoare said he was fired during a period when he was struggling with drugs and alcohol.  In a subsequent interview, Mr. Hoare told The BBC that Mr. Coulson was ""well aware"" of phone hacking and ""to deny it is a lie, is simply a lie."" Just last week, Mr. Hoare told The Times that British police had used illicit cellphone tracking, known to News of the World journalists as ""pinging,"" to help them locate subjects. As my colleagues John Burns and Jo Becker reported: Under British law, the technology involved is restricted to law enforcement and security officials, requires case-by-case authorization and is used mainly for high-profile criminal cases and terrorism investigations, according to a former senior Scotland Yard official who requested anonymity so as to be able to speak candidly. According to Oliver Crofton, a cybersecurity specialist who works to protect high-profile clients from such invasive tactics, cellphones are constantly pinging off relay towers as they search for a network, enabling an individual's location to be located within yards by checking the strength of the signal at three different towers....  A former show-business reporter for The News of the World, Sean Hoare, who was fired in 2005, said that when he worked there, pinging cost the paper nearly $500 on each occasion. He first found out how the practice worked, he said, when he was scrambling to find someone and was told that one of the news desk editors, Greg Miskiw, could help. Mr. Miskiw asked for the person's cellphone number, and returned later with information showing the person's precise location in Scotland, Mr. Hoare said. Mr. Miskiw, who faces questioning by police on a separate matter, did not return calls for comment.  Mr. Hoare also spoke to a Guardian reporter last week and said ""that he had been injured the previous weekend while taking down a marquee erected for a children's party. He said he had broken his nose and badly injured his foot when a relative accidentally struck him with a heavy pole from the marquee."" In March, Mr. Hoare told The BBC that phone hacking was ""endemic"" at The News of the World Nick Davies, the Guardian journalist who first reported in 2009 that phone hacking had been much more widespread than an initial police investigation suggested, wrote of Mr. Hoare on Monday: At a time when the reputation of News of the World journalists is at rock bottom, it needs to be said that the paper's former show business correspondent Sean Hoare, who died on Monday, was a lovely man. In the saga of the phone-hacking scandal, he distinguished himself by being the first former NoW journalist to come out on the record, telling The New York Times last year that his former friend and editor, Andy Coulson, had actively encouraged him to hack into voice mail. That took courage. But he had a particularly powerful motive for speaking. He knew how destructive The News of the World could be, not just for the targets of its exposes, but also for the ordinary journalists who worked there, who got caught up in its remorseless drive for headlines. Explaining why he had spoken out, he told me: ""I want to right a wrong, lift the lid on it, the whole culture. I know, we all know, that the hacking and other stuff is endemic. Because there is so much intimidation. In the newsroom, you have people being fired, breaking down in tears, hitting the bottle."" Marina Hyde, a Guardian columnist who started her career as a secretary on The Sun's show business desk, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Hoare was ""the first journalist to speak to me when I started"" and ""continued to be kind to me until the very end.""

The Early Word: Sticking to Their Principles,"Today's Times While the battle to increase the debt ceiling may look like basic budget haggling, the shots exchanged by both sides this week have made it clear that this is really a debate about the size and role of government, Jackie Calmes writes - and in that argument, each party's principles are only making a compromise tougher to reach. The Defense Department suffered one of the worst breaches of cybersecurity in its history earlier this year, officials revealed on Thursday. The revelation that a foreign intelligence agency had hacked into thousands of Pentagon files came as the department released a military strategy for cyberspace, acknowledging changing digital security demands to protect sensitive technology, Thom Shanker and Elisabeth Bumiller report. Even as lawmakers bicker over tough budget cuts, subsidies for small-town airports and peanut farms have survived, protected by powerful lobbies. Their political staying power is a testament to how difficult it is to cut spending, Ron Nixon says. Minnesotans are on the verge of getting their government back. Monica Davey reports that the governor and the state's Republican lawmakers announced on Thursday that they had, at last, reached a deal on the state's budget, which will bring about what is expected to be a swift reopening of government services.  With the Latino population swelling throughout the United States, redrawing Congressional districts has become even more complicated, Monica Davey reports. It's an effort strained by conflicting opinions on what the laws say and conflicting interests from politicians who may not be so interested in giving Latino voters a stronger voice.Around the Web With talks stalled at the White House, the Congressional ""Gang of Six"" turned ""Five Guys"" has been hard at work on its own debt-reduction agreement, The Hill reports. Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and other Republican presidential candidates are slated to participate in ""the first-ever Tea Party Presidential Debate"" via Twitter on Wednesday, Roll Call reports. Curiously, the enigmatic Tea Party group hosting the event also lists Tim Pawlenty as a participant - but his campaign doesn't even know about the debate.Washington Happenings As the debt ceiling negotiations continue, President Obama will hold an 11 a.m. news conference on Friday. The Consumer Price Index and real earnings data for June are out Friday. One week after the final space shuttle launch, the crew of Atlantis and the International Space Station will field reporters' questions from space. Later, they're scheduled to speak to Mr. Obama.

OneID Aims to Unite Devices to Fight Hackers,"Assume your computer, your cellphone and your iPad are all insecure, subject to hackers. All three of them working together to protect your information -- would that be better? It would, according to OneID, a start-up company in San Jose, Calif., that is trying to promote a new kind of ""single sign-on"" security for the Web. Single sign-on is a kind of holy grail on the Internet, a way of avoiding having to remember separate passwords for every Web site and service a person uses. Like the original grail, lots of people have believed in it and no one has found it. In this case, Microsoft, IBM, Sun Microsystems and long-forgotten companies like Oblix (now part of Oracle) have all tried. Frequently the technology behind one company or another's single sign-on is plausible, but everyone else on the Internet is not comfortable turning their customers' identities over to one big player. Facebook might want to be the one-stop identity company, too, but would face distrust. This may leave an opening for a smaller company with sufficient financing and a novel technology.  Enter OneID, founded by Steve Kirsch, a well-known Silicon Valley multimillionaire who founded, among other companies, the search engine Infoseek. His technology confirms who you are by combining the private security ""keys"" of several devices, which are then encrypted in a ""blob"" in a remote data center. Supposedly your personal information, including your name and address, passwords and credit card data, cannot be obtained there, either. When you want to log on to a Web site, OneID checks the security of the site, then determines who you are by confirming three different digital signatures on different devices. Merchants never see your credit card information but receive a clearance from OneID. (Mr. Kirsch is also somewhat known in the valley for having gone public about his blood cancer, which a few years ago threatened his life. He appears healthy and says he is taking a drug that keeps the condition stable. In addition, he is closely following new therapies, one of which he thinks looks quite promising.) The redundancy in the OneID system, Mr. Kirsch says, is what makes the product effective. ""You have to compromise three different private keys to break into this,"" he says. ""Distributing information across devices makes it safer."" In some cases, the individual digital signatures are stored with other providers, so one step to hacking OneID would involve hacking Apple without a trace. There is usually an added level of security, Mr. Kirsch notes, in that many cellphones and tablets have their own access codes, so a hacker would have to obtain all of a user's devices, break into them and get at the personal information before his target could know that anything was wrong. OneID recently won a ""VC Bait"" contest at a big e-commerce trade show called X.Commerce. Mr. Kirsch is also offering $1 million of his own money, plus his name and one password, to hackers who are willing to try cracking the overall system. The product is set to have its debut in February, but if you register at the company's site now, OneID will give you priority in securing the handle by which you wish to be identified - which could be a valuable thing, if OneID catches on. I recently ran into Mr. Kirsch along Sand Hill Road, the center of the venture capital universe, and he invited me down for a look at the product. It seems easy to use, and graphically very attractive, particularly the control screen for the iPad. This allows you to set higher levels of security for certain places or tasks, allow or shut off access to other devices and deal with browsers you might use at a public computer. Mr. Kirsch has similar interfaces for other devices and has worked on a QR code version of the service, so you could establish your identity at a checkout stand by holding a phone over a scanner. It seemed to work quickly enough, despite all the cross-checking going on in the background. It is all very nice, but as much as the fancy security, the real test of single sign-on is how readily others are willing to use it. As Mr. Kirsch put it at the start of our meeting, ""Hundreds of people have tried this already, so why shouldn't you write my obituary?"" His advantage, he thinks, is in the compelling nature of the technology, his network of connections into big companies that might be interested in such a product and a general dissatisfaction with the current system. ""I have one wife, one car, three kids, one cat, and 352 user names and passwords,"" he says. ""We have plenty of allies who want to move past this."" Facebook has already been somewhat successful as a single sign-on service for social sites, though not yet for financial information. Mr. Kirsch may hope Facebook's size makes others wary, giving him an opening. As for another likely competitor, PayPal, he says, ""They are focused on being a payments company. OneID is an identity company."" In his mind, anyway, payments are just a subset of identity. Can't say the man is thinking small. Mr. Kirsch was clearly in the middle of several demonstrations and negotiations with computer, payments and social media companies, but so far would not say if he had any agreements. He will need a lot, if the company is to get any traction. But then, that was the initial problem for the credit card companies. People were first suspicious of plastic  and accepted it more readily once others did.   "
ID Security In Banking,"Banks can do better at protecting their customers from the risk of identity fraud, a new report from Javelin Strategy & Research finds. The firm's annual Banking Identity Safety Scorecard looked at the consumer-security practices of 25 large banks and credit unions. It found that far too many still rely on customers' Social Security numbers for authentication purposes - for instance, to verify a customer's identity when he or she wants to speak to a bank representative over the telephone or re-set a password.  All banks in the report used some version of the Social Security number as a means of authenticating the customer, Javelin found. The pervasive use of Social Security numbers was surprising, given the importance of Social Security numbers as a tool for identity theft, said Phil Blank, managing director of security, risk and fraud at Javelin. Customers must provide their Social Security number when opening a bank account, he said, but it shouldn't be used routinely for other purposes, because telling people to keep their number private but habitually asking for it sends the wrong message. ''This is something the financial institutions really need to do some work on,'' he said. ''The consumer should not be trained that it's O.K. to give up your Social Security number.'' Even partial numbers should be avoided, the report said, because as they have become more widely used, they have become a common target for phishing. ''Along with the mother's maiden name, a truncated version of the S.S.N. is not an effective means of identifying the consumer,'' the report says. The average score of banks in the report was 56 out of a possible total of 100 points, based on criteria that included steps to prevent, detect and resolve fraud. Banks should also improve their ability to send alerts automatically to customers when crucial changes are made to an account, Mr. Blank said. Nearly three-fourths of the banks in the analysis offered alerts for a change of address, but just 20 percent let customers set up an alert in the event another registered user is added to the account -- even though that technique is one way criminals can gain access to bank accounts. ''That's one of the basic ways account takeovers happen,'' he said. Banks can be proactive with their behind-the-scenes behavior analysis, which helps them detect unusual patterns that might be cause for suspicion and alert the consumer. But the option for automatic alerts is important, he said, because ''no one knows your financial habits better than you do.'' On the plus side, 40 percent of the banks in the report offered free browser security software, Javelin found. Have you recently been asked for your Social Security number when contacting your bank? Does that concern you? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
A New Push To Protect Health Data,"Federal health officials call it the Wall of Shame. It's a government Web page that lists nearly 300 hospitals, doctors and insurance companies that have reported significant breaches of medical privacy in the last couple of years. Such lapses, frightening to consumers, could impede the Obama administration's effort to shift the nation to electronic health care records. ''People need to be assured that their health records are secure and private,'' Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services, said in an interview by phone. ''I feel equally strongly that conversion to electronic health records may be one of the most transformative issues in the delivery of health care, lowering medical errors, reducing costs and helping to improve the quality of outcomes.'' So the administration is making new efforts to enforce existing rules about medical privacy and security. But some health care experts wonder if the current rules are enough or whether stronger laws are needed, for example making it a crime for someone to use information obtained improperly.  ''The consequences of breaches matter,'' conceded Dr. Farzad Mostashari, a former New York public hospitals official who recently became the Obama administration's national coordinator for health information technology. ''People say they are afraid that if their private information becomes known, they may not be able to get health insurance.'' In the last two years, personal medical records of at least 7.8 million people have been improperly exposed, according to the government data. One particularly egregious case involved information about 1.7 million patients, staff members, contractors and suppliers of Bronx hospitals and clinics operated by the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the New York public health agency. Their electronic files were stolen from an unlocked van belonging to a record management company. The affected patients got the disquieting news that their medical and personal information, like Social Security numbers, had been violated when their health care providers notified them under federal rules. Showing just how lax security can be, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services said two weeks ago that the agency had found dozens of vulnerabilities in systems to protect records of patients at seven large hospitals in New York, California, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Georgia and Missouri. Auditors cited such problems as personal information that was not encrypted and was stored on computers that could be easily used by unauthorized users. Auditing teams are now inspecting eight more hospitals, said Lori Pilcher, an assistant inspector general at Health and Human Services. The hospitals are not being identified to avoid alerting hackers, she said. Another big breach was reported in March on the official Web site by Health Net, a California-based insurance company, which notified 1.9 million health plan members that records with their personal information were missing. Health Net said I.B.M., which was managing its information system, told the insurer that the records could not be found. ''The health care industry is not as vigilant as they should be about protecting private information in a patient's medical records,'' said Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican who is co-chairman of the Bipartisan Privacy Caucus in the House. Mr. Barton knows from personal experience. His own records after a heart attack, along with several thousand others from a research project at the National Institutes of Health, were ''on a disk in a laptop in somebody's trunk that disappeared,'' he recalled. ''I was stunned.'' The Obama administration has levied a string of stringent penalties for egregious violations of patient rights under the most commonly cited law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, of 1996. Health information is supposed to stay private under those rules, but research has shown that it is not that difficult to connect names and addresses to nominally anonymous data with Internet searches and computerized matchups. The Office of Civil Rights at Health and Human Services, which took over enforcement of the law, imposed a $1 million fine on Massachusetts General Hospital in March after a hospital employee left paper records of 192 patients on a Boston subway train. The hospital agreed in a settlement, without admitting wrongdoing, to report twice a year on its efforts to tighten patient protections. Earlier this year, the civil rights office fined a Maryland health plan, Cignet Health, $4.3 million, saying that it had denied patients the right to see their own records in violation of HIPAA provisions. It was the first civil penalty levied under the HIPAA law. ''We have ramped up our enforcement,'' said Georgina C. Verdugo, director of the civil rights office. But Dr. David Brailer, a Bush appointee as the first national coordinator of health information technology, is skeptical about whether such efforts will curb security breaches. ''We can't just lock health care data away -- because of its role in lifesaving treatment,'' Dr. Brailer said. He said that even with the best technology it would be hard to make health systems secure. ''It's a huge challenge. Break-ins and hacks are unfortunately going to be part of the landscape,'' he said. One protection, he suggested, would be laws to make it illegal for an insurer or employer to discriminate against a person based on information about health conditions like H.I.V./AIDS, cancer and mental health problems. As a model, he pointed to the antidiscrimination law to prevent the misuse of genetic information that was passed with bipartisan support in the Bush administration. He also said he believed the laws should say ''patients own the data, period, and decide what happens to it. The patient should be able to say to Hospital X: 'send my data to Hospital Y because I'm changing hospitals,' '' he said. Today, the information belongs to whoever possesses it, under ideas inherited from 17th-century English common law, he said. ''If it gets into your database, essentially you own it,'' he added, ''and you can pass it on.'' ''Today HIPAA makes no sense,'' Dr. Brailer added. ''The law didn't anticipate a world where your data passes through many, many hands.'' Wes Rishel, a longtime health care analyst for Gartner, the technology consulting firm, and an adviser to the national coordinator's office, has a similar view. ''Your ability to control access to your information is a horse that is already out of the stable,'' he said. ''What is really needed is legislation that controls use of it.'' On that score, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have shown that at least 30 people and organizations have access to the health data of a typical person with private insurance through an employer. They range from pharmacies and drug companies to an employer's wellness programs and a spouse's self-insured employer. ''Only you, your doctor and hundreds of others know,'' said Latanya Sweeney, a health privacy expert at Harvard and Carnegie Mellon who is also an adviser to the office headed by Dr. Mostashari. Since HIPAA was enacted there has been ''an explosion in data sharing,'' Ms. Sweeney said. ''And after electronic records are widely adopted, there will be another big explosion.''  "
Virtual Realms That Merit More Visits,"So many games; so little time. Amid the towering piles and teetering stacks of video games that arrive every year there are always some that nag: the ones that got away. They are the games I wish I had been able to find more time to play and more time to write about. So, without letting them bother my conscience any longer, here are some of the most interesting games of 2011 that deserved more attention.  RIFT I spent more time playing Rift without writing about it than any other game this year, and for that I apologize. Rift, introduced in March, is the best online fantasy game that is not called World of Warcraft. Back in the spring I spent at least 100 happy hours slinging spells and making new Internet friends as I explored Rift's fantasy kingdom. Rift has sold more than one million copies and has been a worthier competitor to World of Warcraft than other online fantasy pretenders like Warhammer Online and Age of Conan. As the debut game from the heavily financed startup Trion Worlds (whose investors include Time Warner, Comcast and Bertelsmann), Rift has been impressive. The graphics appear more realistic (though not necessarily more attractive) than World of Warcraft's, and the Trion team went beyond WOW in giving players the flexibility to customize their characters' magical and martial abilities. But the real test of a massively multiplayer online game like Rift or World of Warcraft (or a more recent newcomer like Star Wars: The Old Republic) is not how snazzy its new features are when it first appears. The real test is whether its developers and players together create a community and product that can grow for years. Like so many other online games that have dared challenge World of Warcraft, Rift has not seemed able to sustain its initial success. Logging back into the game recently I was disheartened to see that my server (or copy of the game world) had become a practically uninhabited ghost town. Transferring to another server I found a small hardcore band of players, but it was a bit like finding a few survivalists huddling in a vast, otherwise deserted metropolis. A big part of the problem is that Rift and Trion have repeatedly proved themselves vulnerable to hacker attacks. When the game began there appeared to be significant vulnerabilities in Rift's programming and many players' accounts were broken into. And on Thursday Trion announced that hackers had broken into a database that included customer names, dates of birth, e-mail addresses, billing addresses and partial credit-card numbers. I hope that's not the kiss of death for Rift because I know it is a well-designed, involving game. If you're burned out on World of Warcraft and are looking for another top online fantasy game, Rift deserves a shot. DEUS EX: HUMAN REVOLUTION The original Deus Ex, released in 2000, remains one of the top cult hits in game history. We all know how tough it is for sequels to live up to cult hits, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution, published by Square Enix in August, does a reasonably good job. Deus Ex is basically a cyberpunk franchise set in the relatively familiar concept of a near-future Earth defined by rapacious corporations and the widespread social effects of cybernetic enhancement. The key to the series has been in the ways it gives players multiple strategic paths for developing their characters and multiple tactical options for tackling specific situations. Do you blast the enemy guard with a bullet to the face, sweet-talk him, sneak around the back or maybe hack into the security computers? In Deus Ex, each choice should be viable. And they are, which means you can play the game as you choose rather than being forced into a particular play style. I was able to play Human Revolution only a bit and the big question I had was whether my interest in the game's ethically nuanced story line would allow me to sustain interest in the face of the disappointingly plain visual presentation and somewhat clunky combat systems. DARK SOULSDark Souls, however, I know I love. I've just been saving it for the depths of winter. This is a seriously difficult and hardcore fantasy role-playing game released by Namco Bandai in October. After about five hours I knew that I didn't want to rush the more than 100 hours I'm sure it will take to get through this punishing yet rewarding epic. EL SHADDAI: ASCENSION OF THE METATRON Here we have a game based on the tale of Enoch that takes as its title an ancient name for God. You, Enoch, have to save the universe from evil, which is par for the course both for video games and religious stories. I'm sure it is just a coincidence that the game's lead developer, Takeyasu Sawaki, is best known for his previous work on the Devil May Cry series. But given his pedigree it is not a coincidence that El Shaddai has a captivatingly mystical feel and pleasantly intuitive combat controls. I've spent only a short time with El Shaddai since it was released in North America by Ignition Entertainment in August but I will certainly return to it. SAINTS ROW THE THIRD Saints Row is basically trying to be the over-the-top, slightly cheesy low-rent younger brother to the Grand Theft Auto series. More cleavage, more profanity and more explosions are the touchstones here. Had THQ released the game some time other than just before Thanksgiving I would certainly have played it more. MINECRAFT All the other games on this list are made by big companies. Minecraft, which first appeared online in 2009, is a labor of love that became a commercial product only because of the support of its players. (The official version was just released in November.) Basically in Minecraft your character is placed in a low-resolution world and allowed to build whatever you wish. The ultimate digital sandbox, Minecraft is profoundly creative. As with the other games on this list, I just wish I'd had more time to play it. But there's always next year!  "
Security Professionals Say Network Breaches Are Rampant,"There has been a flood of news about hacker break-ins at companies. But how bad is the situation really? Significantly worse than the headlines suggest, and getting worse still, a new study from the research firm Ponemon Institute suggests. The study says breaches are rampant and occurring much more often than is publicized. The firm's survey of 581 security professionals at large companies in the United States, Britain, France and Germany found that 90 percent of them had at least one breach in the last year and 59 percent had two or more. And the costs are mounting; 41 percent of break-ins cost more than half a million dollars. Study participants broadly agreed that cyberattacks were getting more frequent, more severe, and harder to detect and stop. Indeed, hackers are increasingly staging targeted attacks aimed at stealing something specific, said Larry Ponemon, founder of the institute. They study the target, find an opening and then quietly get in and out. Most are mercenaries, members of criminal syndicates or representatives of unfriendly countries, he said, and their attacks ""are much more stealthy and much more difficult to identify.""  About 60 percent of respondents said they were able to identify the source of at least some of the attacks suffered by their organizations. They traced 34 percent of them to China and 19 percent to the Russian Federation. Both countries are known hotbeds of hacking for profit and economic advantage. ""China is prolific and noisy,"" said the former National Security Agency director Mike McConnell, speaking at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York last week. ""They are literally taking terabytes of data"" and focusing on  virtually every sector of the economy. Russian hackers are considered especially skilled and known for taking things undetected, he said. Nearly half of the breached companies surveyed by Ponemon suffered a damaging loss of data, which ""speaks volumes about the mindset of the attacker community,"" said Karim Toubba, vice president of security strategy at Juniper, which sponsored the survey. The large majority are in it for financial gain and don't talk about what they do -- unlike LulzSec and Anonymous, who are hacking for fun and politics and have been loudly bragging about their activities. Victimized companies overwhelmingly prefer to keep quiet, too. When they do talk, it's usually after a loss of consumer information, which is subject to laws requiring disclosure. But most of what is being stolen is corporate information that doesn't have to be disclosed, Mr. Ponemon said, whether it is intellectual property like design documents or financial information. There's certainly little reason to talk when, as the Sony case has shown, news of your vulnerability might make hackers hit you harder, customers lose confidence in you and your stock price drop. As attackers step up their games, defenders are struggling to cope. Security professionals are pessimistic about their ability to prevent hacks; 57 percent said they had little or no confidence in their organizations' ability to prevent a breach. They're coming to believe that ""maybe the bad guys are getting so good -- or so bad -- that maybe it is impossible to meet the security needs of the organization,"" Mr. Ponemon said. Respondents are also concerned about insufficient security budgets and say the complexity of modern networks is a major challenge. Corporate networks are growing more unruly and harder to control as employees use more mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, adopt cloud services and log onto social networks, all of which carry security threats. Meanwhile, I.T. departments must manage a growing array of specialized security technologies that may or may not work together to help security departments detect and halt attacks. ""When you put all of this into one big stew, it's not very tasty,"" Mr. Ponemon said.  "
Lookout Introduces a Security App for iPhones,"Most iPhone users blithely believe that their phones are safe from hackers. Unlike Android phones, which have been the target of a few malicious attacks, iPhones have so far been less vulnerable because Android is growing faster and because, unlike Apple, it does not screens all apps before allowing them in its app store. But Lookout, a start-up that makes security apps for phones, wants iPhone owners to use its product, too. On Tuesday, it plans to introduce an iPhone app that addresses what its founders say are worries unique to iPhone owners. Mobile phone security is not a crisis yet, because hackers are still mostly focused on computers. But smartphones are also computers, and people generally do not think about protecting their phones the same way they protect their laptops, even though phones often have much more sensitive information. Unlike Lookout's Android app, which has 12 million users, the iPhone app will not screen for malware. Instead, it will alert people when their phones are ""jailbroken,"" need software updates, use location services or access unencrypted Wi-Fi networks.  ""We're prioritizing the problems on each platform,"" said Kevin Mahaffey, chief technology officer and co-founder of Lookout. For instance, Lookout will remind iPhone users to plug their phones into their computers to receive software updates, since many go months without doing so. Most Android phones, on the other hand, update automatically. And it will alert people if they are about to enter a password while using one of the unencrypted Wi-Fi networks that iPhones prompt users to join. Lookout eventually plans to make money selling its apps to businesses, which would likely want the highest level of security for employees' phones even if instances of malware have so far been few. Like Lookout's Android app, the iPhone app will back up data on the phone, which can then be transferred to a new iPhone or to Android devices. And it will help users find missing phones by showing them on a map and making phones emit a siren sound. Eventually, it might screen for malware as well. ""I do think that at some point malware will probably affect the iPhone,"" Mr. Mahaffey said. ""There's no magic pixie dust in the iPhone that makes it immune, but it hasn't historically been a publicized problem.""   "
Europe Leads In Pushing For Privacy Of User Data,"BRUSSELS -- As pressure grows for technology companies like Apple and Google to adjust how their phones and devices gather data, Europe seems to be where the new rules are being determined. Last year, Google generated a storm of controversy in Germany when it had to acknowledge it had been recording information from unsecured wireless networks while compiling its Street View mapping service. Then, last week, regulators in France, Germany and Italy said they would examine whether Apple's iPhone and iPad violated privacy rules by tracking the location of users.  Also, reports emerged last month that the Dutch police had obtained information from TomTom, a maker of popular satellite navigation devices, while setting up speed traps, prompting concerns by users and an apology from TomTom. The companies all said there was nothing sinister about their activities, though Apple said it would issue a software update limiting the time that location data was kept to seven days. None of the information, the companies said, is particularly sensitive from the point of view of personal privacy, and they claim it will help them to deliver better services in many cases. To address concerns about data protection, Viviane Reding, the European justice commissioner, said in a speech Tuesday that she would propose extending unionwide rules about breaches of privacy to online banking, video games, shopping and social media. The rules require phone companies and Internet service providers to inform customers of any data breach ''without undue delay.'' ''European citizens care deeply about protecting their privacy and data protection rights,'' Ms. Reding said in a separate statement. ''Any company operating in the E.U. market or any online product that is targeted at E.U. consumers should comply with E.U. rules.'' Ms. Reding made her remarks shortly after Sony apologized for a data theft involving 77 million account holders of the PlayStation Network, and a week after Apple said it would change the software that logs the location of users of its iPhone and iPad tablet computer. ''Seven days is too late,'' Ms. Reding said Tuesday, referring to how long it took Sony to inform account holders. Regarding Apple, she said she understood how the discovery that the iPhone collected location data had eroded ''the trust of our citizens.'' Abraham L. Newman, an assistant professor at Georgetown University and a specialist in European privacy issues, said Europe's spotlight on privacy could offer companies like Apple and Google the chance to reorganize the way they handled policies worldwide, using European standards in their corporate strategy. Alternatively, he said, the companies could develop policies to ensure that data gathered in Europe was sufficiently ''quarantined'' to comply with rules, but limit changes in the rest of the world. ''Apple is entering a political dynamic in Europe which is similar to Google's experience,'' Mr. Newman said. ''Authorities in Europe have decided that consumers better not be duped in a world of unlimited location data where companies know literally every step you take.'' What particularly distinguishes Europe is the strong role played by so-called national data protection authorities in keeping tabs on privacy issues, he said. In the United States, there is no single agency dedicated to privacy, and while the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission can deal with violations of privacy, those agencies are mainly focused on enforcing fair business practices. But Ms. Reding said the differences between Europe and the United States should not overshadow signs of convergence, like the work by the Obama administration and Congress to pass a privacy bill of rights that would stop companies from collecting or sharing personal information without an Internet user's consent. ''Until recently, there was a common belief that the E.U. and U.S. have different approaches on privacy and that it would be difficult to work together,'' Ms. Reding said. ''This can no longer be argued in such simple terms.''  "
California: U.C.L.A. Reports Theft of Patient Data,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA's system of hospitals and clinics warned more than 16,000 patients that their personal information was on a computer hard drive stolen in the burglary of a doctor's home, officials said Friday.  The UCLA Health System sent letters to the 16,288 patients affected, warning them of possible identity theft and giving them contact information for a data security company the system has enlisted for help. Someone using the documents for identity theft was ''very unlikely,'' but there was a possibility, the statement said. ''UCLA's concern for its patients is absolute, and we deeply regret any breach of confidentiality and the stress and concern it might cause,'' it said. The burglary took place Sept. 6 and involved medical records from a four-year period, July 2007 to July 2011. The warning came nearly two months after the theft because it took that long to identify and locate the patients affected by the burglary, officials said. The documents included birth dates, addresses and medical record numbers and medical information, but no Social Security numbers or financial information, and no patient's complete medical records were on the hard drive, officials said. The information was encrypted but the password was on a scrap of paper near the computer that also was missing. Still, officials said there has been no evidence the records have been accessed. The statement says the hospitals records policies were under review to help prevent such thefts. The hospital did not release the name or details about the doctor who was burglarized, but said the person had to maintain the information to perform necessary job duties. The UCLA system includes Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Mattel Children's Hospital, Santa Monica UCLA Medical Center and Orthopedic Hospital, and Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital, along with outpatient clinics. Last year the hospital network agreed to pay an $865,000 settlement for potential violations of federal privacy laws after hospital employees were accused, and some convicted, of crimes for snooping into the medical records of celebrity patients. In 2008, California Department of Public Health officials found that UCLA hospital workers had inappropriately accessed records of more than 1,000 patients since 2003. After the 2010 settlement UCLA said it had taken steps over the years to retrain staff and strengthen the security of its computer systems. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"One on One: Jack Tretton, Sony C.E.O. America","I sat down with Jack Tretton, president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment America, to discuss the company's focus on gaming consoles, as well as mobile gaming and the barrage of hacking attacks on Sony in recent months. The following is an edited version of our conversation: Sony has been hacked repeatedly over the past two months. What are you doing to prevent more data breaches?We have been ever vigilant with everything that has been happening. If you read the newspaper, you realize that there are companies being bombarded with people trying to hack them all the time. Yet, this was a real wakeup call we had to go through. Now we feel our systems are more secure that they have ever been. Did you permanently lose any customers from the attack?We have over 90 percent of our customers back right now - more than 70 million people. We expect you'll see an influx of new people as new games come out this year. Some hackers say Sony wants to deter customers from modifying the PlayStation3. Is that true?No, there's a real misnomer there, we embrace independent game development; if you call that hacking, then we embrace that. We give people tools that let them create new experiences. What I don't think we are in support of is someone trying to hack our device to pirate software and possibly collapse the platform. What are you doing to protect customers after the wave of recent attacks?We have assigned a new position of chief information security officer. We've created this role to really centralize our security efforts around the entire company. Do you know who attacked Sony?No. We still have no insights into who attacked us.  What else are you doing to protect people's data?I'm not a security expert so I have other people working on this. We are doing everything we can to protect our customers. How has Sony focused on mobile gaming? PlayStation Vita launches at the end of the year. Our goal going back to 2004 with the original PlayStation Portable was to give people a full console experience in a mobile device. To do this with Vita, we've added two cameras, one in the front, one in the rear, that will enable augmented reality-style gaming. We've also added GPS to the device. What will you do with GPS in a PlayStationPortable? We are going to create some location-based games, and we plan to connect people with gamers in their immediate vicinity. It's a feature we call ""near."" Can we expect mobile gaming to really become augmented?Yes. You'll see a tremendous amount off this in the near future, where the real world moves into the gaming experience, including your surroundings. How do you expect gaming to transform over the next few years?When we first got into this business, it was 12- to 17-year-old boys who were the target audience. This is a very narrow demographic. Now we're seeing a lot of closet gamers who would never have played before. The entire gaming environment is growing for consumers in numerous ways. Do you worry that the iPod Touch or iPad will steal customers away from the PlayStationPortable?No. The great thing about gamers is that they have tremendous influence over what they want to play. If their parents say I'm getting you an iPad and that's your device, but their friends are playing a dedicated console like a PSP, then the kids will find a way to get a PSP. Would you ever make a game for the iOS platform?No, I don't think that's something we would ever consider. When you've invested millions upon billions of dollars into developing the system - as we have with PlayStation - you really want to put your resources behind that platform. Sony is a believer in 3-D gaming. Will consumers embrace this?I'm completely sold on it. Steven Spielberg recently told me that 3-D offers him a new palette to work with when making movies. Gamers are also leading this charge by playing games that are 3-D enabled. You're really going to see it explode now as more affordable 3-D monitors come out. We are launching a 3-D TV in the fall that will cost $500. Do you think Sony missed the boat with mobile? We have a partnership called Sony Ericsson that puts out smartphones. We also have a product called PlayStation Suite that works on select Android phones. Through Android phones, and the PlayStation tie-ins, we think that we will accomplish our goal. Does Sony have any plans to offer new tablets?Sony is coming out with two tablets this year that will be Google Android devices. Right now, the relationship with these tablets is exclusively with Android. Google has been a good partner to us and we have a mutual interest in this space. So who is your biggest competitor?I think it is people's spare time. There are only 24 hours in a day and seven days in a week. You have to be very, very nimble as a device and game maker, and you have to offer a very rich experience for customers.  "
Internet Activist Charged in M.I.T. Data Theft,"2:19 p.m. | Updated  2:48 p.m. | Updated   4:11 p.m. | Updated   12:31 p.m., July 20 | Updated   Aaron Swartz, a 24-year-old programmer and online political activist, has been indicted  in Boston on charges that he stole more than four million documents from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and JSTOR, an archive of scientific journals and academic papers. (Read the full indictment below.) Mr. Swartz was indicted last Thursday by the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Carmen M. Ortiz, and the indictment was unsealed Tuesday. The charges could result in up to 35 years in prison and a $1 million fine. In a press release, Ms. Ortiz's office said that Mr. Swartz broke into a restricted area of M.I.T. and entered a computer wiring closet. Mr. Swartz apparently then accessed the M.I.T. computer network and took millions of documents from JSTOR.  Mr. Swartz, a well-known figure in Internet academic circles, created a site called Infogami that later merged with the social news site Reddit. He is also a founder and director of the nonprofit group Demand Progress, which calls itself a political action group hoping to change public policy that relates to the Internet. In 2009 Mr. Swartz downloaded 19 million pages of federal court documents from a government database system, acting on the belief that they should be made available free.  Demand Progress said on its site that it appeared Mr. Swartz was ""being charged with allegedly downloading too many scholarly journal articles from the Web."" It quoted the group's executive director, David Segal, as saying, ""It's like trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library."" The charges filed against Mr. Swartz include wire fraud, computer fraud, obtaining information from a protected computer and criminal forfeiture. ""Stealing is stealing whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars,"" said Ms. Ortiz in the press release. The United States Attorney's office in Boston said Mr. Swartz ""surrendered today, was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Boston this morning and pled not guilty to all counts. He was released on $100,000 unsecured bond.  His next court date is September 9, 2011 for a status conference."" Mr. Swartz could not immediately be reached for comment.

U.S. Calls for Global Cybersecurity Strategy,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday proposed creating international computer security standards with penalties for countries and organizations that fell short. While administration officials did not single out any countries in announcing the strategy, several officials said privately that the hope was that the initiative would prod China and Russia into allowing more Internet freedom, cracking down on intellectual property theft and enacting stricter laws to protect computer users' privacy.  ''The effort to build trust in the cyberspace realm is one which should be pushed in capitals around the world,'' said Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, who will soon be taking over as President Obama's ambassador to China. The strategy calls for officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security to work with their counterparts around the world to come up with standards aimed at preventing theft of private information and ensuring Internet freedom. A fact sheet released by the White House also promised that the United States would respond to attempted hacking ''as we would to any other threat to our country.'' Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. called it a ''historic strategy,'' adding that ''the 21st-century threats that we now face to both our national and international security really have no borders.'' Last week the administration released the domestic component of its new computer security strategy, increasing and clarifying the penalties for computer crimes, and giving the domestic security agency a clear mandate for the protection of the government's own networks. That effort was intended to reverse a growing perception that penalties for attacks on government, corporate and personal computers had been relatively small. In addition to giving the Homeland Security Department new authority over federal computer systems, the legislation calls for the agency to work with energy companies, water suppliers and financial institutions to rank the most serious threats and find ways to counter them. The law would also require each business to have an independent commercial auditor assess its plans and, in the case of financial firms, report those plans to the Security and Exchange Commission.

"Lax Security Exposes Voice Mail to Hacking, Study Says","BERLIN -- It may be tempting to view the illegal interception of telephone voice mails, a practice that has roiled Britain and the News Corp. media empire of Rupert Murdoch, as an arcane tool employed by scofflaw journalists with friends in Scotland Yard. But according to a study to be presented Tuesday, cellphone users in Europe and the rest of the world may be just as vulnerable as the actor Hugh Grant and other celebrities to having their personal voice mail hacked -- or worse -- because of outdated mobile network security. In a study of 31 mobile operators in Europe, Morocco and Thailand, Karsten Nohl, a Berlin hacker and mobile security expert, found that many operators provided poor or weak defenses to protect consumers from illicit surveillance and identity theft. Mr. Nohl said he was able to hack into mobile conversations and text messages and could impersonate the account identities of cellphone users in 11 countries using an inexpensive, 7-year-old Motorola cellphone and free decryption software available on the Internet. He has tested each mobile operator more than 100 times, he said, and has ranked the quality of their defenses.  He plans to present his results at a convention of the Chaos Computer Club, a hackers' group, in Berlin, where he will open the project to researchers in other countries. In 2009 Mr. Nohl, who runs a Berlin consulting company, Security Research Labs, published the algorithms used to encrypt voice and data conversations on GSM digital networks, which are used in Europe and elsewhere. In an interview, Mr. Nohl said he had made sure to conduct his latest research to avoid the illegal theft of data and communications by intercepting the phone transmissions of a colleague during field tests. In random tests, he said, he ended interceptions just one or two seconds after they began. The technique he uses focuses on deciphering the predictable, standard electronic ''conversations'' that take place between a cellphone and a mobile network at the beginning of each call. Typically, Mr. Nohl said, as many as 40 packets of coded information are sent back and forth, many just simple commands like, ''I have a call for you,'' or ''Wait.'' Most operators vary little from this set-up procedure, which Mr. Nohl said allowed him to use hacking software to make high-speed, educated guesses to decipher the complex algorithmic keys networks use to encrypt transmissions. Once he derived this key, Mr. Nohl said, he was able to intercept voice and data conversations by impersonating another user to listen to their voice mails or make calls or send text messages on their mobile accounts. Mr. Nohl said operators could easily fix this vulnerability in the GSM system, which is found in older 2G networks used by almost every cellphone, including smartphones, with a simple software patch. His research found that only two operators, T-Mobile in Germany and Swisscom in Switzerland, were already using this enhanced security measure, which involves adding a random digit to the end of each set-up command to thwart decoding. (For example, ''I have a call for you 4.'') ''This is a major vulnerability in most networks we tested, and the irony is that it costs very little, if nothing, to repair,'' Mr. Nohl said. ''Often it is just a question of inertia on the part of operators, or they have other priorities, such as building their networks.'' Philip Lieberman, the chief executive and president of Lieberman Software, a company in Los Angeles that sells identity management software to large businesses and the U.S. government, said much of the digital technology that protects the privacy of cellphone calls had been developed in the 1980s and 1990s and is now ripe for attack. That said, Mr. Lieberman added that the kind of interception being done by researchers like Mr. Nohl demands a level of skill and sophistication that is beyond the abilities of most individuals. ''Your digital mobile calls are generally well protected from people like yourselves, who are not in the position to crack them,'' Mr. Lieberman said in an interview. ''However, the technology to do this type of surveillance, which was once possible only by government intelligence agencies, is rapidly becoming affordable to more and more people.'' In compiling his research, which was conducted from Sept. 1 through the past week, Mr. Nohl measured a network's vulnerability to three attacks: the interception of voice and text messages, the impersonation of a cellphone user's identity to make calls or hear voice mails and the tracking of a cellphone user's location through the Internet and the cell network. He then ranked the operators in the three categories by compiling a risk scale, with 100 percent representing the best possible security and zero representing none. In protecting against the illicit interception of voice and text messages, the operators Orange Switzerland and TDC Sunrise in Switzerland and True Move in Thailand performed most poorly, according to his study. Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile in Germany and Slovakia and Swisscom's Natel in Switzerland had the best security. In preventing the impersonation and use of another's mobile account details for calling, texting or other purposes, Telefonica's O2 network in the Czech Republic, Belgacom Proximus in Belgium and Orange Switzerland provided the least security, while T-Mobile Slovakia, T-Mobile Germany and SFR in France had the best, the study showed. In guarding against the tracking of a cellphone user's geographic position through the Internet and global positioning satellites, T-Mobile Slovakia and two Moroccan operators, Wana and Medi Telecom, had the weakest safeguards, according to the research. Vodafone Italy, T-Mobile Germany and Vodafone Germany had the best security, according to the study. The tracking of cellphone users is not tied to the interception of identities but to a network's ability to be tricked into disclosing the calling cell where the user is located. Many operators who performed poorly in the survey did not respond to requests for comment for this article. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, Alexia Sailer, said the company declined comment because it did not have details. A spokesman for Sunrise Communications in Zurich, Tobias Kistner, said the company would study the research and make any necessary security improvements. France Telecom, the owner of Orange, said ''Orange puts a high priority on customer and network security and invests significantly to ensure our customers are well protected.'' A spokesman for Telefonica in the Czech Republic, Hany Farghali, said the company used the latest security defenses and had experienced no security breaches in its network so far. The GSM Association, a London organization that represents operators, said it also would await details of Mr. Nohl's study, adding that it welcomed research designed to improve GSM technology. ''GSM networks use a range of encryption and authentication technologies and other features to make it difficult for criminals to fraudulently access and/or eavesdrop on customer communications or to identify and locate customers,'' the association said in a statement. Mr. Nohl said he had based the choice of countries for his study on the ability of him and his team to travel. His Berlin firm advises businesses, European governments and mobile operators, he said, on how to erect better digital communication defenses. As consumers begin using cellphones for retail purchases and online banking, the potential damage from theft may increase, he said. Generally, however, the digital security tools used by banks and retailers, Mr. Nohl said, are far superior to those used by mobile operators and should thwart most attacks. But services that let consumers make purchases by text or top up mobile account balances by sending text messages could be vulnerable, he said. While the research was limited mostly to Europe, Mr. Nohl, a German citizen who received a doctorate in computer science at the University of Virginia, said the level of security provided by U.S. network operators was on a par with European operators, meaning there was also room for improvement. In Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, the level of mobile security varies widely and can be much lower. Operators in India and China, Mr. Nohl said, encrypt digital traffic poorly or not at all, either to save on the network's operating costs or to allow government censors unfettered access to communications. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Q&A: Defending Your PC Online,"Q. Does antivirus software protect my PC from hackers?   A. Antivirus software can protect your machine from certain tools that hackers have been known to use, like Trojan horse programs (designed to steal passwords) that you may get in the form of an e-mail attachment. A hacker trying to break directly into your computer over the Internet, however, can thwart an antivirus program.  Antivirus software can stop some types of spyware, but not all of it. Spyware is classified as unwanted programs on your computer (installed with or without your knowledge) that can do a number of things including pestering you with unwanted advertising, or even more sinister actions like blocking your access to certain Web sites.   Adding a dedicated anti-spyware program is another way to strengthen your PC's security. Using a firewall -- software that blocks unauthorized access to your computer from Internet intruders -- is another way to further shore up defenses. Firewalls also come built into broadband routers, and both Windows and Mac OS X include integrated system firewalls.  Most programs labeled as ""Internet security suites"" include antivirus and antispyware programs, as well as a firewall with more configuration options and other features like parental controls. These software packages typically cost $50 or more, but if money is tight, you can find free alternatives around the Web.  Microsoft has free antivirus and antispyware programs and plenty of others are listed on the Gizmo's Freeware site. Sites like onguardonline.gov and getsafeonline.org offer much more information on keeping your computer and your personal information secure.    "
Are You Reading This? That Is So Cool.,"Steve Bodow is co-executive producer and former head writer for ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.'' WHAT'S up, Times readers? Normally right now you'd be nodding off over a very thoughtful prescription for offering Qaddafi an honorable exile at a plastic surgery teaching hospital. But not today, people! Because I deleted that snoozer when I hacked my way in here. That's right. I hacked the Op-Ed page. You're only reading this because I broke into The Times's internal network (''The Old Gray Linux Box'' we call it) and put this piece in the lineup myself.  Surprise, surprise: a dead-tree media company's cyber-security was no tougher to crack than Citibank's or the C.I.A.'s or any of the other institutions my brethren have hacked into in the past few months. You're probably wondering what I want. To be clear: I, along with a large group of my associates, am acting alone. We take orders from no one. Though in the spirit of disclosure, in this one Estonian chat room there's a 9-year-old boy with some surprisingly good ideas. We are completely untraceable, except for my byline, which only just now occurred to me might be a problem. Anyway, I wanted to set right a lot of the misunderstanding about us hackers that has emerged this summer. First, hackers are not criminals. I mean, technically, if you're into a strict reading of the penal code, some of us are. But even the most radical hacktivist groups among us -- even lawless, renegade outfits like Anonymous and LulzSec and News Corp. -- are doing the valuable service of reminding the world that there are no such things as ''total security'' or ''journalistic ethics.'' Which brings me to point 2.0: hacking's a fact of life now. Computer hacking, phone hacking, credit card hacking -- these are but the beginning. We can hack anything. I'm personally sitting on 52,000 T-Mobile account passwords, 14 million Frontier Airlines EarlyReturns points, a thumb drive full of Balenciaga handbag serial numbers, and 200 slightly racy beach-vacation photos of a certain well-known celebrity chef. I'm not making a threat. I'm just saying if a two-top doesn't open up at a certain French fish restaurant next Thursday night, I tweet the Speedo pics. So we're here to stay and only getting closer. This summer, Facebook hired 21-year-old George Hotz, a k a Geohot, famed for hacking into Sony's ''unbreakable'' PlayStation 3 system. The new head of security for Icann, the regulatory body that manages the Internet's foundational structure, is Jeff Moss, a k a Dark Tangent.

SecurID Company Suffers A Breach of Data Security,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The RSA Security division of the EMC Corporation said Thursday that it had suffered a sophisticated data breach, potentially compromising computer security products widely used by corporations and governments. The company, which pioneered an advanced cryptographic system during the 1980s, sells products that offer stronger computer security than simple password protection. Known as multifactor authentication, the technology is typically based on an electronic token carried by a user that repeatedly generates a time-based number that must be appended to a password when a user logs in to a computer system. RSA, which is based in Bedford, Mass., posted an urgent message on its Web site on Thursday referring to an open letter from its chairman, Art Coviello. The letter acknowledged that the company had suffered from an intrusion Mr. Coviello described as an ''advanced persistent threat.''  In recent years a number of United States companies and government agencies have been the victim of this type of attack, in which an intruder either exploits an unknown software vulnerability or in some way compromises the trust of an employee to take command of a computer or an entire network within a company. In 2009, for example, Google fell victim to an attack that it said had originated in China, and it ended commercial operations in the country in response. Mr. Coviello said that the company's investigation had revealed that the intruder successfully stole digital information from the company that was related to RSA's SecurID two-factor authentication products. He did not give precise details about the nature of the information, but said it could potentially reduce the effectiveness of system in the face of a ''broader attack.'' The company said that there was currently no indication that the information had been used to attack its customers. ''We took a variety of aggressive measures against the threat to protect our business and our customers, including further hardening of our I.T. infrastructure,'' Mr. Coviello said. ''We also immediately began an extensive investigation of the attack and are working closely with the appropriate authorities.'' Company officials did not return phone calls seeking comment on Thursday. Despite the lack of detail, several computer security specialists said the breach could pose a real threat to companies and government agencies who rely on the technology. One possibility, said Whitfield Diffie, a computer security specialist who was an inventor of cryptographic systems now widely used in electronic commerce, is that a ''master key'' -- a large secret number used as part of the encryption algorithm -- might have been stolen. The worst case, he said, would be that the intruder could produce cards that duplicate the ones supplied by RSA, making it possible to gain access to corporate networks and computer systems. Mr. Diffie is vice president for information security and cryptography at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. In addition to posting the chairman's letter, the company submitted a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission in which it stated that it did not expect the theft to have a financial impact. RSA was founded in 1982 by a small group of technologists who at times were actively opposed by the National Security Agency, which was trying to limit the spread of sophisticated cryptography technology. In 2009, the company said publicly that its SecurID system was being used by 40 million customers. Last year it said its technology was used to secure the identities and assets of more than 250 million people.  "
Hackers Declare War on Government Agencies,"The Internet may be about to get a little more chaotic than usual. Over the weekend, a group of hackers declared that they are initiating cyber warfare with governments and security companies around the world. The group, Lulz Security, has claimed responsibility for a number of recent data breaches and have already attacked a number of United States government and corporate Web sites. Lulz Security also said it was working closely with another group called Anonymous, a loosely affiliated team of activist computer hackers. Although Anonymous did not put out its own statement about the attacks, the two groups have been communicating regularly on Twitter. In a letter posted on a public Web site, Lulz Security announced its plan to attack more government sites and encouraged other groups and individuals ""to open fire on any government or agency that crosses their path."" The undertaking is called ""Operation Anti-Security."" ""Top priority is to steal and leak any classified government information, including email spools and documentation,"" Lulz Security wrote in the letter. ""Prime targets are banks and other high-ranking establishments."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on the letter. Last week Lulz Security breached the Web server of the United States Senate and briefly brought down the Central Intelligence Agency Web site through a denial-of-service attack. The group has also been responsible for attacks on Sony, Bethesda Softworks, a gaming company, and a string of other sites.  "
Federal Authorities Arrest 14 Members of Anonymous,"6:15 p.m. | Updated  Federal authorities arrested 16 people on Tuesday, 14 of whom are suspected members of the activist hacker group Anonymous, officials said. The other two individuals were arrested on cyber-related charges. Earlier Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed three search warrants in connection with the hacker group, law-enforcement officials said. Two of the raids were executed at homes on Long Island, while the other raid took place in an apartment building in Brooklyn. The authorities said they seized computers in the raid. The United States Department of Justice said in a statement that Tuesday's arrests took place across the United States in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio. The charges, which were brought by federal prosecutors in the Northern District of California in San Jose, allege that Anonymous members performed a distributed denial of service attack against PayPal, the payment Web site, taking the company's Web site offline for four days. The attacks, which took place during December of last year, were in retaliation for PayPal's refusal to process WikiLeaks credit card payments. All of the defendants charged in the case are between the ages of 20 and 33 years old. The defendants are all being charged with several counts of conspiracy and intentional damage to a protected computer. Authorities said they will be arraigned Tuesday in the areas they were arrested. Anonymous has been at the center of the news lately with members of the loosely organized group ramping up attacks on corporate and government Web sites. In recent months the group has started to call its efforts AntiSec, or Anti Security, and says it hopes to expose security flaws online. Anonymous has claimed responsibility in the past for attacking MasterCard and Visa in an effort to assist the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. The group has also attacked sites related to the Church of Scientology.  "
Changed Terms Rile OnStar Users,"A NEW set of terms and conditions for the OnStar service, the General Motors-supported safety and connectivity system, is generating privacy concerns among some subscribers, many of whom have long raised questions about the potential for abuse.  Last week, OnStar sent e-mails notifying customers of changes in the company's policies. Two changes in those terms raised concerns from the standpoint of privacy. The first regards what happens when a customer cancels the service. Until now, when OnStar service stopped, so did the vehicle's two-way communications system. As of Dec. 1, however, that will not necessarily be the case. Vehicles of owners who no longer subscribe could still be monitored through a still-active cellular link. The second policy change concerns the potential use of data collected by OnStar, which includes information like the vehicle's speed and location, seat belt use and air bag deployment. Under the new terms, OnStar reserves the right to share that information with other companies and organizations -- even when culled from motorists who no longer subscribe. ''But the customer has a choice,'' Vijay Iyer, an OnStar spokesman, said in a telephone interview. Under the new terms, a canceling subscriber can request that the two-way connection be shut off, he said. Customers who have already canceled the service are no longer connected, he confirmed. As a default position, however, OnStar maintains the cellular connection after the subscription is canceled, a practice intended to collect data that could be useful to municipalities, for example, trying to improve traffic flow or to first responders trying to determine the severity of a crash. OnStar has not started selling data that it collects, Mr. Iyer said. Under the new terms, data would be made anonymous and aggregated to allay privacy concerns. However, the open-ended language in the terms suggests that OnStar could, without reproach, sell the information. Jonathan Zdziarski, a forensic scientist, canceled his subscription based on the changes in terms. His concerns include unwanted marketing and unintended security breaches. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies could issue subpoenas to acquire data from an OnStar subscriber under investigation, a practice that is already commonplace for portable navigation devices and cellphones. The OnStar issue is the latest in a growing list of privacy-related concerns brought about by advances in onboard telematics systems. A Nissan Leaf owner recently uncovered a security hole that allowed anyone to tap into a vehicle's speed and location information. Researchers at iSec Partners, a cybersecurity consultancy, have shown how a car's wireless connections can be exploited, using a technique known as war texting, to break into a vehicle.  "
Hackers Say They Hit Another Military Contractor,"A group of hackers intensified its assault on government-related targets Monday, claiming to have infiltrated the computer network of Booz Allen Hamilton, a top technology contractor to the United States military and many federal government agencies, and boldly threatening more attacks. The group, an arm of the hacking collective Anonymous that includes members of the defunct group Lulz Security, published online what it said was a file of 90,000 military e-mail addresses and passwords. It said it found the information on a Booz Allen server ""that basically had no security measures in place.""  The firm provides cybersecurity consulting, among other technology services, and has on its staff  the former director of the National Security Agency, Michael McConnell. The company said on Twitter that as part of its security policy, ""we generally do not comment on specific threats or actions taken against our systems.""  The attack was part of a continuing campaign that the hacker group calls AntiSec, a fight against what it deems to be corrupt corporations and governments. In the gleeful language it has become known for, the group dubbed the day #MilitaryMeltdownMonday. On Friday, it released internal documents it claimed to have stolen from IRC Federal, another federal contractor. In recent weeks, it has also targeted the Arizona state police as well as federal and local governments in Australia, Anguilla, Brazil and Zimbabwe.  In an online statement, the hackers claimed to have been able to move around inside Booz Allen's network. While inside, they deleted some software source code they found and stole some data, they said. They also said they filched ""maps and keys for various other treasure chests buried on the islands of government agencies, federal contractors and shady whitehat [security] companies,"" which it planned to share with black hat, or malicious, hackers. They also said that Anonymous has been ""investigating"" Booz Allen for some time, and has uncovered ""shady practices by the company, including potentially illegal surveillance systems, corruption between company and government officials, warrantless wiretapping, and several other questionable surveillance projects."" In a post to Twitter, the apparent leader of the Anonymous arm, known as Sabu, warned the intelligence community that the Booz Allen hack was ""just the beginning.""  "
Security Firm Is Vague on Its Compromised Devices,"SAN FRANCISCO -- More than a day after RSA security posted an ''urgent'' alert warning that a sophisticated intruder might have initiated a ''broad attack'' on a password device used by millions of customers, the announcement and its meaning remain shrouded in mystery. RSA, a division of the data management company EMC Corporation, will not say how its system was compromised and what specific kinds of threats its customers are facing. But from its extremely limited disclosure on Thursday afternoon about what might have been taken, customers and computer security specialists are scratching their heads about what the risks may actually be.  There was wide bewilderment about the company's claim that the intruder was ''extremely sophisticated,'' as it suggested that one of the nation's premier security firms had no better security than dozens of companies that have fallen victim to a computer break-in that deceives employees and exploits unknown software vulnerabilities. On Friday, a spokesman for RSA said it was briefing its customers individually but added that its executives were declining to speak publicly about the breach. The announcement touched off intense speculation about whether RSA's popular SecurID tokens, which are carried on key chains and in wallets of millions of corporate and government users, have been significantly compromised. ''It's a weird situation,'' said Dan Kaminsky, an independent Internet security specialist. Referring to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, he said, ''It's like the Tepco situation in Japan, but here everyone is freaking out'' and ''nobody has Geiger counters.'' The system is intended to provide additional security beyond a simple user name and password by requiring users to append a unique number generated by the token each time they connect to their corporate or government network. A potential weakness that could be exploited involves a factory-installed key called a seed. Typically 16 characters, it is different for each token and is stored on a corresponding computer server program, which authenticates the session each time a user connects to a secure network. If the database containing customers seeds was taken, the intruder might still not know which user had which seed, but cryptographers said it would be possible to use a reverse-engineered version of the RSA algorithm to determine that information by simply capturing a single log-in session. That would be a potentially serious vulnerability that could be exploited by a sophisticated attacker. A technical expert in New York whose financial services firm uses the SecurID system said that even after listening to a telephone briefing on Thursday evening, he was uncertain about which potential threats he should be concerned about. The company offered only extremely general ''belt and suspenders'' advice, the expert said. A copy of the company's terse ''RSA Securcare Online Note'' posted on the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site on Thursday offers such advice as ''Focus on security for social media applications'' and ''We recommend customers re-educate employees on the importance of avoiding suspicious e-mails.'' RSA notified the federal government, whose agencies widely use the tokens to guard access to its networks, some time before the public announcement was made. On Wednesday, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team in the Department of Homeland Security posted a ''Technical Information Paper'' on its Web site describing a set of security practices meant to limit vulnerability to attacks based on the stolen information, according to a person close to the organization. ''We have notified all of the federal agency chief information officers to take remediation steps,'' said a government official who declined to be identified because he had not been authorized to speak about the breach. What the actual risk is and what precautions a user of the key fobs and wallet-size cards depends on what was taken in the theft. ''I'm speculating, but I'm pretty confident that somebody has the root seed file,'' said a former RSA employee, referring to the master file at the company, which is based in Bedford, Mass. He asked not to be identified because he still has a business relationship with the firm. The worst case, many security consultants say, is that the vulnerability created by the theft might require companies to replace the secure tokens, which, according to analysts, cost $15 a year or more to maintain. The vulnerability might also force RSA to rethink the design of its SecurID system. ''They may have to change their security model to one where a third party does not hold the keys to your devices,'' said Paul Kocher, president of Cryptography Inc., a San Francisco computer security consulting firm.

"Go Online, Beat a Puzzle, And Become A British Spy","LONDON -- Psst! Wanna be a spy? Back in the cloak-and-dagger days of secret intelligence work, Britain's espionage agencies liked to recruit in the ivied colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, even if that brought them some of the most notorious turncoats of the 20th century, men like Kim Philby and other Cambridge spies who handed atom bomb secrets to the Soviet Union in the 1940s and 1950s before defecting to Moscow. In the Internet age, the spy catchers have been forced to go digital, democratic and, old-timers might say, outright pop. Their latest whiz, causing a buzz on the Internet -- and stirring a torrent of Web chat among people identifying themselves as hackers -- is an online cryptographic puzzle that promises a fast track to recruitment as spies for those who solve it before the challenge expires on Dec. 11. According to traffic on Twitter, Facebook and scores of other Web sites, at least 50 people have solved the puzzle since it was posted unobtrusively last month. To all but practiced cryptographers, it looks baffling: a rectangular display of 160 letters and numbers, grouped in twos in blue against a black background, under the overline, ''Can you crack it?'' Beneath it, a digital clock ticks down the seconds left until the competition closes.  The agency that posted the puzzle at www.canyoucrackit.co.uk is one of the oldest, and, espionage experts say, most successful eavesdropping organizations anywhere, Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, located in a vast doughnut-shaped building surrounded by huge satellite dishes in parkland near Cheltenham, 120 miles west of London. Helped by a hand-in-glove relationship with its American counterpart, the National Security Agency, which provides access to data downloaded from a pervasive network of American spy satellites, GCHQ can hack into phone calls, e-mails and computers virtually anywhere in the world. With language experts speaking everything from Amharic to Kazakh and 70 tongues besides, it has played a crucial role in cracking some of the biggest terror plots against the West in recent years. Once decrypted, the agency's online puzzle, through a process experts call steganography, yields a hidden message in the form of a keyword. Those who enter the keyword are led to a Web address, where they are greeted with a congratulatory note. It is signed by a group calling itself Cyber Security Specialists, a newly formed unit within the British agency that is responsible for combating the cyberespionage threat that British officials have listed alongside terrorism, organized crime, and drug and weapons smuggling among the nation's biggest security threats. ''So you did it,'' says the congratulatory message. ''Now this is where it gets interesting. Could you use your skills and ingenuity to combat terrorism and cyberthreats? As one of our experts, you'll help protect our nation's security and the lives of thousands.'' Those interested are then invited to submit a formal job application, leading to interviews for a total of 35 jobs next spring. Some skeptics, believing there is nothing particularly innovative in the new world of spycraft beyond updated technologies, have noted that recruiting techniques used by the World War II code-breaking agency that was GCHQ's predecessor included presenting candidates, many of them from Oxford and Cambridge, with cryptographic crossword puzzles. Other skeptics on the Internet have dismissed the GCHQ puzzle as too easy. One cyberenthusiast, Dave Neal, writing on the Web site theinquirer.net, dismissed the puzzle as ''not cool, and not very professional.'' He said that he and others working with him at the Web site ''asked GCHQ if this was a hoax.'' The spy agency has insisted it is not. A spokesman described the puzzle as a follow-up on unusual methods it has used in the past to reach potential computer-age recruits who might escape traditional methods, which have included discreet advertisements in high-end magazines and newspapers. The newer tactics have included posting video content and downloadable information about the agency on the Web, and cyberpuzzles on popular video games like Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed. ''Code-cracking skills are vital to secure the very best talent and to support the GCHQ mission in its fight against cyberthreats,'' the spokesman told The Daily Telegraph. ''Our target audience is not typically attracted to traditional advertising methods. Their skills may be ideally suited to our work, and yet they may not understand how they could apply them to the working environment.'' Many computer experts writing for British newspapers and Web sites suggested that the spy agency's message, at least implicitly, was that it was looking for accomplished hackers, a community that has been bruised lately in the backwash from the scandal enveloping Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire. The agency, in listing the qualifications it requires of recruits, said it would accept only British citizens and would rule out anyone who had engaged in illegal hacking. But some of its other specifications suggested that it might not look askance at candidates who have trodden close to the legal line. While saying it was looking for ''good people'' with a strong sense of fairmindedness, it also emphasized the value of a buccaneering spirit. ''In a game where our adversaries operate with no known rules and unknown boundary lines, you will be exploring the possibilities and inventing the seemingly impossible,'' the agency said on its Web site. Those pressing the agency to lift its game have included Prime Minister David Cameron, whose government has noted GCHQ's past inability to recruit and retain ''a suitable cadre of Internet specialists,'' partly because its entry salaries -- averaging about $48,000, far less than what private companies offer for the same skills -- are uncompetitive. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said recently that the government was the target of as many as 600 attacks on its computer systems every day. But judging by the response to the spy agency's puzzle, the government faces an uphill struggle, partly because in the community of hackers, government itself is uncool, if not the enemy. One hacker going by the name Ady who entered a comment on the BBC's Web site urged the agency to ''stick to employing upper-class twits from Oxford and Cambridge.'' Hackers, called ''hobbyists'' in the post, know that ''governments are not really the sort of people you want to get involved with,'' Ady said. Another contributor put the government's problem -- finding hackers to combat hackers -- in a nutshell. ''Hire Gary McKinnon,'' the person wrote, referring to a Scottish hacker accused of intruding into nearly 100 Pentagon computer networks a decade ago. He is fighting extradition to the United States for what American officials have described as ''the biggest military computer hack of all time.''  "
Call It Your Online Driver's License,"WHO'S afraid of Internet fraud? Consumers who still pay bills via snail mail. Hospitals leery of making treatment records available online to their patients. Some state motor vehicle registries that require car owners to appear in person -- or to mail back license plates -- in order to transfer vehicle ownership. But the White House is out to fight cyberphobia with an initiative intended to bolster confidence in e-commerce.  The plan, called the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace and introduced earlier this year, encourages the private-sector development and public adoption of online user authentication systems. Think of it as a driver's license for the Internet. The idea is that if people have a simple, easy way to prove who they are online with more than a flimsy password, they'll naturally do more business on the Web. And companies and government agencies, like Social Security or the I.R.S., could offer those consumers faster, more secure online services without having to come up with their own individual vetting systems. ''What if states had a better way to authenticate your identity online, so that you didn't have to make a trip to the D.M.V.?'' says Jeremy Grant, the senior executive adviser for identity management at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency overseeing the initiative. But authentication proponents and privacy advocates disagree about whether Internet IDs would actually heighten consumer protection -- or end up increasing consumer exposure to online surveillance and identity theft. If the plan works, consumers who opt in might soon be able to choose among trusted third parties -- such as banks, technology companies or cellphone service providers -- that could verify certain personal information about them and issue them secure credentials to use in online transactions. Industry experts expect that each authentication technology would rely on at least two different ID confirmation methods. Those might include embedding an encryption chip in people's phones, issuing smart cards or using one-time passwords or biometric identifiers like fingerprints to confirm substantial transactions. Banks already use two-factor authentication, confirming people's identities when they open accounts and then issuing depositors with A.T.M. cards, says Kaliya Hamlin, an online identity expert known by the name of her Web site, Identity Woman. The system would allow Internet users to use the same secure credential on many Web sites, says Mr. Grant, and it might increase privacy. In practical terms, for example, people could have their identity authenticator automatically confirm that they are old enough to sign up for Pandora on their own, without having to share their year of birth with the music site. The Open Identity Exchange, a group of companies including AT&T, Google, Paypal, Symantec and Verizon, is helping to develop certification standards for online identity authentication; it believes that industry can address privacy issues through self-regulation. The government has pledged to be an early adopter of the cyber IDs. But privacy advocates say that in the absence of stringent safeguards, widespread identity verification online could actually make consumers more vulnerable. If people start entrusting their most sensitive information to a few third-party verifiers and use the ID credentials for a variety of transactions, these advocates say, authentication companies would become honey pots for hackers. ''Look at it this way: You can have one key that opens every lock for everything you might need online in your daily life,'' says Lillie Coney, the associate director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington. ''Or, would you rather have a key ring that would allow you to open some things but not others?'' Even leading industry experts foresee challenges in instituting across-the-board privacy protections for consumers and companies. For example, people may not want the banks they might use as their authenticators to know which government sites they visit, says Kim Cameron, whose title is distinguished engineer at Microsoft, a leading player in identity technology. Banks, meanwhile, may not want their rivals to have access to data profiles about their clients. But both situations could arise if identity authenticators assigned each user with an individual name, number, e-mail address or code, allowing companies to follow people around the Web and amass detailed profiles on their transactions. ''The whole thing is fraught with the potential for doing things wrong,'' Mr. Cameron says. But next-generation software could solve part of the problem by allowing authentication systems to verify certain claims about a person, like age or citizenship, without needing to know their identities. Microsoft bought one brand of user-blind software, called U-Prove, in 2008 and has made it available as an open-source platform for developers. Google, meanwhile, already has a free system, called the ''Google Identity Toolkit,'' for Web site operators who want to shift users from passwords to third-party authentication. It's the kind of platform that makes Google poised to become a major player in identity authentication. But privacy advocates like Lee Tien, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, say the government would need new privacy laws or regulations to prohibit identity verifiers from selling user data or sharing it with law enforcement officials without a warrant. And what would happen if, say, people lost devices containing their ID chips or smart cards? ''It took us decades to realize that we shouldn't carry our Social Security cards around in our wallets,'' says Aaron Titus, the chief privacy officer at Identity Finder, a company that helps users locate and quarantine personal information on their computers. Carrying around cyber IDs seems even riskier than Social Security cards, Mr. Titus says, because they could let people complete even bigger transactions, like buying a house online. ''What happens when you leave your phone at a bar?'' he asks. ''Could someone take it and use it to commit a form of hyper identity theft?'' For the government's part, Mr. Grant acknowledges that no system is invulnerable. But better online identity authentication would certainly improve the current situation -- in which many people use the same one or two passwords for a dozen or more of their e-mail, e-tail, online banking and social network accounts, he says. Mr. Grant likens that kind of weak security to flimsy locks on bathroom doors. ''If we can get everyone to use a strong deadbolt instead of a flimsy bathroom door lock,'' he says, ''you significantly improve the kind of security we have.'' But not if the keys can be compromised.  "
When Secrets Aren't Safe With Journalists,"Christopher Soghoian, a fellow at the Open Society Foundations, is a doctoral candidate in security informatics at Indiana University. Washington BRAVE journalists have defied court orders and have even been jailed rather than compromise their ethical duty to protect sources. But as governments increasingly record their citizens' every communication -- even wiretapping journalists and searching their computers -- the safety of anonymous sources will depend not only on journalists' ethics, but on their computer skills. Sadly, operational computer security is still not taught in most journalism schools, and poor data security practices remain widespread in news organizations. Confidential information is sent over regular phone lines and via text messages and e-mail, all of which are easy to intercept. Few journalists use secure-communication tools, even ones that are widely available and easy to use.  Government officials often attempt to get journalists to reveal their sources by obtaining subpoenas and compelling testimony and the required telecommunications records. But sometimes that's not even necessary, because sources have already been exposed by their own lax communications. And then there is illicit monitoring -- I believe that American journalists should assume that their communications are being monitored by their government -- and possibly other governments as well. As an expert on privacy and government surveillance, I regularly speak with journalists at major news organizations, here and abroad. Of the hundreds of conversations I've had with journalists over the past few years, I can count on one hand the number who mentioned using some kind of intercept-resistant encrypted communication tools. Even when journalists try to do the right thing, they still make dangerous mistakes, like relying on Skype. Skype is slightly more secure than phones but is by no means safe from snooping -- which can be done with commercially available interception software. Last month, France's interior minister, Claude Gueant, admitted that intelligence agencies had obtained detailed lists of calls made by a journalist at Le Monde. This enabled them to identify a government whistle-blower who had revealed sensitive information about a legal investigation into the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt. Yet the ensuing controversy has focused on the government's abuse of its powers, rather than the responsibility of journalists to use more secure communication. Journalists aren't completely to blame for their lack of computer security expertise -- after all, journalism schools have taught them to write, not to play ''Spy v. Spy.'' The blame also lies with universities that don't teach these skills, and with news organizations that invest their tight technology budgets in fancy Web sites but not security training. The newspaper you are reading isn't exempt from my criticism. In June 2010, Bill Keller, then the executive editor of The New York Times, and Alan Rusbridger, editor of The Guardian, discussed WikiLeaks's cache of classified cables over an unencrypted international telephone line, as Mr. Keller has recounted. That The Times did not have a readily available means of secure telecommunications is troubling, given that whistle-blowers have, over the past decade, helped The Times expose numerous classified intelligence operations, including the fact that the N.S.A. had illegally snooped on the international phone calls of thousands of Americans. In one known case, F.B.I. agents in 2004 improperly obtained the phone records of Times journalists based in Indonesia (inadvertently, the authorities said). Shortly after The Wall Street Journal introduced a Web site for secure leaks in May, privacy advocates discovered critical security problems, including poorly chosen encryption algorithms, vulnerability to interception, and a privacy policy that reserved the right to disclose information about the source ''to law enforcement authorities or to a requesting third party, without notice.'' Many major media organizations have distanced themselves from WikiLeaks, which, they tell us, is reckless, and does not engage in real journalism. The announcement this week by WikiLeaks's founder, Julian Assange, that it might close because companies like MasterCard and Visa will no longer process donations to the group, highlights the threat the group faces. But if the hallmark of quality journalism is the ability to protect confidential sources, then WikiLeaks should, in fact, be seen as a beacon of best practices. In contrast to the shameful practices of most journalists, WikiLeaks has spectacular operational security: encrypted instant messages are used for all real-time communications, strong encryption technology is used to protect files as they are passed between individuals, and servers are hidden using the Tor Project, a popular privacy tool that enables anonymous communication. Whatever one thinks of Mr. Assange, he is a skilled data security expert. He knows an awful lot more about information security than even the most tech-savvy journalist. His platform appears to have worked: none of WikiLeaks's confidential sources have ever been exposed by the organization. (Bradley E. Manning, the detained Army private who has been accused of the leak, was exposed by an acquaintance.) Until journalists take their security obligations seriously, it will be safer to leak something to WikiLeaks -- or groups like it -- than to the mainstream press.  "

Daily Report: F.T.C. Settles With Facebook on Privacy Policies,"The federal government on Tuesday accused Facebook of engaging in ""unfair and deceptive"" practices and announced a broad settlement that requires the company to respect the privacy wishes of its users and subjects it to regular privacy audits for the next 20 years, reports Somini Sengupta in the New York Times. The reaction to the news was immediate and mixed. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, wrote in a lengthy blog post that the company had made ""a bunch of mistakes,"" but said it had already fixed several of the issues cited by the commission. A commenter on the article in The Times, Daniel in Connecticut, thought that the $16,000-a-day fine for future transgressions ""is hardly a deterrent to a multi-billion dollar corporation."" He wrote, ""That's nothing for giving away our information."" Elsewhere on the Web, the Electronic Frontier Foundation commented, ""It's good to see the FTC and Facebook reach an agreement that will help uphold the rights of users in ways we've long recommended."" All Things D offered a retrospective of Facebook excuses for privacy violations: ""Launch new stuff that pushes the boundaries of what people consider comfortable. Apologize and assure users that they control their information, but rarely pull back entirely.""   "
New Jersey Nearly Sold Confidential Data at Auction,"Files on abused children. Employee evaluations. Tax returns. A list of computer passwords. Names, addresses, birth dates and other information on hundreds of foster children and abused children. And, of course, Social Security numbers. The information could hardly have been more sensitive -- the raw material of identity theft and invasion of privacy -- yet the State of New Jersey was about to turn it over to the highest bidder, the state comptroller, Matthew A. Boxer, reported on Wednesday. After the comptroller's office reviewed computer equipment that the state was preparing to auction to the public last year, it found that 46 out of 58 hard drives, or 79 percent, still had data on them, much of it confidential. Mr. Boxer's investigation stopped that sale, but it points to the near-certainty that the state had already inadvertently released privileged information on thousands of people. The state sells or gives away hundreds of computers annually at several auctions, and Mr. Boxer said that as far as he knew, no outside agency had looked into the handling of the equipment before his office did.  ''What happened before our auditors got there is obviously an issue of concern,'' he said. ''The risk here is enormous.'' His report said that one agency had a device that magnetically erased computer drives, but that employees did not like to use it because it was noisy. ''I find that offensive,'' Mr. Boxer said. Informed of the security breach, the State Treasury Department, which manages surplus equipment, stopped auctioning computers last year. It is working on a new set of practices for handling them. Reports of the exposure of private data have become common, each one leading to a round of warnings about identity theft. Computers are lost or stolen, people accidentally post information online, and people are tricked into revealing their secrets. The Privacy Rights Clearing House, a nonprofit group, keeps a database of 2,380 such episodes over the past six years, including 453 releases by government. ''Public-agency breaches are disheartening because they have so much data, and much of it is sensitive,'' said Beth Givens, director of the group. ''Data stewardship should be the top priority for them.'' State offices send used equipment to a warehouse in Hamilton, near Trenton, which is supposed to notify every state agency that it is available. Anything unclaimed after 30 days is given to local governments or nonprofit groups, or is sold at auction. But the comptroller's office found that the warehouse staff often failed to follow the rules for notification, steering computers, cellphones and other equipment to favored people in and out of state government. The investigation stemmed from a 2007 inquiry into auction-rigging, theft and other violations at that warehouse, which led to the conviction of four employees. Thirty-two of the hard drives Mr. Boxer's team examined held information that should not be made public. Six of the drives had Social Security numbers, including those contained in personnel reviews found in an e-mail archive. The computers came from the judiciary branch, the Department of Children and Families, the Department of Health and Senior Services, and the Office of Administrative Law. In some cases, no attempt had been made to erase files. In others, investigators were able to recover deleted files using commonly available software. One laptop had apparently been used by a judge, and contained confidential memos the judge had written about possible misconduct by two lawyers, and the emotional problems of a third. The computer also had extensive personal financial information on the judge, including tax returns. Another drive had been used by a high-ranking official under a previous governor -- the report did not say which one -- and included private contact information for other top officials. A list of children supervised by the state included their birth dates and Medicaid numbers. Another gave their immunization records. And there were files on more than 230 investigations into reports of endangered or abused children, including their names and addresses.  "
A Tool to Help Secure Your Browser,"Web browsers are top targets for hackers. They're abused in more than 90 percent of attacks designed to hit random Internet users (vs. more targeted strikes), according to Kaspersky Labs. And more than half of those attacks exploit flaws in browser software and seek to install dangerous malware on our computers.  Why all the attention? Because browsers are an easy target. Computer users perennially ignore update reminders and run old versions with well-known security holes. They also use ancient browser plug-ins, which aren't as easy to update, that are rich with known vulnerabilities. As a result, a whopping 80 percent of computers run outdated, unsecure browsers or plug-ins, according to Qualys, a firm that helps companies manage software vulnerabilities.  To say we make ourselves low-hanging and abundant fruit for hackers is an understatement. But with the help of a new free tool for consumers from Qualys called BrowserCheck you can, with relative ease, make yourself significantly less available for the picking.  BrowserCheck works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux machines and will identify weak spots in the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera browsers, and help you fix them. It can be especially useful for staying on top of oft-abused plug-ins.  I first used the service in April on my Mac to check my Safari and Firefox browsers. It showed that Safari was one version out of date - not a surprise, since Apple had just released an update that included a fix related to the Comodo imbroglio. To my shame, I had been hitting ""Not Now"" on an Apple update alert for a couple days. It also found that my Adobe Flash software was also a bit old. I had the same issues with Firefox, along with one item with a non-security-related update available.  I tackled Flash first, since Adobe products have become favorite targets of attackers in the last couple of years (Sun's Java has also gotten popular recently). From the Safari report, I hit the ""Fix It"" button, which took me to the relevant Adobe page for updating Flash Player, where I downloaded the latest version. Restarting my browsers and running scans again showed that Flash was now up-to-date for both my Safari and Firefox browsers.  I have run BrowserCheck more recently and it has, again, alerted me to unsecure Adobe software, suggesting giving this tool a spin periodically is a good idea even for people who are generally good about downloading most updates. I also updated Firefox, though thanks to Firefox's automatic updating, I didn't have significant problems there. Firefox will automatically check for updates and download minor ones in the background whenever you restart your browser. If it has waited more than 24 hours, it will show a pop-up message asking you to restart Firefox and install the update. Mozilla says Firefox 4 will also help you keep add-ons up-to-date, but not plug-ins like Adobe Flash. Users can go here to check and update plug-ins.  I also used BrowserCheck to update Safari, though that was unnecessary. I still had to download the Apple update I had postponed to get some non-Safari fixes.  This kind of maintenance work is vital for everyone's safe surfing today, but especially so for Windows users, who are attacked the most by far.  Qualys' tool can help them, too-particularly with those pesky plug-ins. Easy and painless updates for Windows and other Microsoft software, including Internet Explorer, are available through Microsoft's automatic Windows Update service. Go to the Microsoft Update Web site to turn on the free service or see if it's already activated. Then Microsoft updates can literally happen in your sleep.  "
Hacker Group Claims Responsibility for New Sony Break-In,"A hacker group calling itself LulzSec claimed responsibility on Thursday for breaking into a Sony Web site and stealing personal information of about 52,000 customers. The group, which claimed this week to have hacked sites belonging to PBS, said it had used a ""simple"" attack on a ""primitive"" security hole that gave it full access to the Sony Pictures internal database. Jim Kennedy, a Sony Pictures Entertainment spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement that the company was ""looking into these claims."" Claims of the attack appeared to be credible, security experts said. The attack follows a devastating security breach of Sony's PlayStation Network, which forced it offline in late April for more than a month. Hackers in that incident took personal data from tens of millions of user accounts, including credit card numbers.In mid-May, Kazuo Hirai, Sony's corporate executive officer and executive vice president, said the PlayStation attack and several others afterward had prompted the company to strengthen security across its products . But the break-in at Sony Pictures, while apparently less serious, suggested that the company still had considerable work to do to fully secure its computer systems. ""Why do you put such faith in a company that allows itself to become open to these simple attacks?"" the LulzSec group mused in an online message it posted to Pastebin and several other Web sites Thursday. LulzSec, a group of anonymous hackers, claimed it had infiltrated SonyPictures.com and gained access to a database that contained personal information belonging to more than one million customers, including passwords, e-mail addresses, home addresses and dates of birth, none of which was encrypted. It also said it found 75,000 ""music codes"" and 3.5 million ""music coupons."" LulzSec also claimed to have broken into a database for Sony Music's Japanese site on May 23. Its attack on PBS.org was an expression of anger with the media organization's coverage of Wikileaks. And its May 10 attack on Fox.com divulged personal information about potential contestants on the X-Factor reality show, because ""We don't like you very much."" To prove it had pulled off the latest stunt, LulzSec disclosed how its attack on Sony Pictures worked. The group said it used a technique known as an SQL injection, in which a hacker exploits a software vulnerability and enters commands that cause a database to produce its contents. Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, which specializes in securing corporate Web sites, said the stolen data that the group revealed appeared to be real. He said the attack the group described would have allowed it to download large amounts of data, he said. ""SQL injection is the attack of the day. It's extremely easy, extremely pervasive and it works.""   "
Thieves Found Citigroup Site An Easy Entry,"Think of it as a mansion with a high-tech security system -- but the front door wasn't locked tight. Using the Citigroup customer Web site as a gateway to bypass traditional safeguards and impersonate actual credit card holders, a team of sophisticated thieves cracked into the bank's vast reservoir of personal financial data, until they were detected in a routine check in early May. That allowed them to capture the names, account numbers, e-mail addresses and transaction histories of more than 200,000 Citi customers, security experts said, revealing for the first time details of one of the most brazen bank hacking attacks in recent years.  The case illustrates the threat posed by the rising demand for private financial information from the world of foreign hackers. In the Citi breach, the data thieves were able to penetrate the bank's defenses by first logging on to the site reserved for its credit card customers. Once inside, they leapfrogged between the accounts of different Citi customers by inserting vari-ous account numbers into a string of text located in the browser's address bar. The hackers' code systems automatically repeated this exercise tens of thousands of times -- allowing them to capture the confidential private data. The method is seemingly simple, but the fact that the thieves knew to focus on this particular vulnerability marks the Citigroup attack as especially ingenious, security experts said. One security expert familiar with the investigation wondered how the hackers could have known to breach security by focusing on the vulnerability in the browser. ''It would have been hard to prepare for this type of vulnerability,'' he said. The security expert insisted on anonymity because the inquiry was at an early stage. The financial damage to Citigroup and its customers is not yet clear. Sean Kevelighan, a bank spokesman, declined to comment on the details of the breach, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. In a statement, he said that Citigroup discovered the breach in early May and the problem was ''rectified immediately.'' He added that the bank had initiated internal fraud alerts and stepped up its account monitoring. The expertise behind the attack, according to law enforcement officials and security experts, is a sign of what is likely to be a wave of more and more sophisticated breaches by high-tech thieves hungry for credit card numbers and other confidential information. That is because demand for the data is on the rise. In 2008, the underground market for the data was flooded with more than 360 million stolen personal records, most of them credit and debit files. That compared with 3.8 million records stolen in 2010, according to a report by Verizon and the Secret Service, which investigates credit card fraud along with other law enforcement agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Now, as credit cards that were compromised in the vast 2008 thefts expire, thieves are stepping up efforts to find new accounts. As a result, prices for basic credit card information could rise to several dollars from their current level of only pennies. ''If you think financially motivated breaches are huge now, just wait another year,'' said Bryan Sartin, who conducts forensic investigations for Verizon's consulting arm. The kind of information the thieves are able to glean is shared in online forums that are a veritable marketplace for criminals. Networks that three years ago numbered several thousands users have expanded to include tens of thousands of hackers. ''These are online bazaars,'' said Pablo Martinez, deputy special agent in charge of the Secret Service's criminal investigation division. ''They are growing exponentially and we have seen the entire process become more professional.'' For example, some hackers specialize in prying out customer names, account numbers and other confidential information, Mr. Martinez said. Brokers then sell that information in the Internet bazaars. Criminals use it to impersonate customers and buy merchandise. Finally, ''money mules'' wire home the profits through outlets like Western Union or MoneyGram. ''It's like 'Mission Impossible' when they select the teams,'' said Mark Rasch, a former prosecutor who is now with CSC, an information technology services firm. ''And they don't know each other, except by hacker handle and reputation.'' In the Citi attack, the hackers did not obtain expiration dates or the three-digit security code on the back of the card, which will make it harder for thieves to use the information to commit fraud. Not every breach results in a crime. But identify theft has ranked first among complaints to the Federal Trade Commission for 11 consecutive years, with 1.34 million in 2010, twice as many as the next category, which is debt collection. Many of these attacks have their origins in Eastern Europe, including Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Romania. In fact, the security expert familiar with the Citi breach said it originated in the region, though he would not specify the country. In Russia, Xakep.ru, is one of the larger forums for Eastern European hackers today, with nearly 13,300 registered members, according to Cyveillance. HackZone.ru is larger, and has more than 58,000 members. In addition, attacks by Romanian hackers have grown noticeably more advanced recently, according to security experts. On HackZone, one seller who called himself ''zoloto'' promised ''all cards valid 100%'' and that they would be sold only one time. Underscoring the multinational nature of these rings, American law-enforcement agencies have also been putting more investigators overseas. ''The only way to address a global issue is to address it globally with your partners,'' said Gordon M. Snow, assistant director of the F.B.I.'s Cyber Division. The Secret Service established a presence in Tallinn, Estonia, last month, and has embedded agents with Ukrainian authorities since the beginning of the year. The F.B.I. has embedded agents in the Netherlands, Estonia, Ukraine and Romania, and works closely with its counterparts in Australia, Germany and Britain. But even officials at these agencies acknowledge that as fast as they move, the hackers' strategies are evolving at Silicon Valley speed. ''With every takedown, they regroup,'' said J. Keith Mularski, a supervisory special agent with the F.B.I.  "
Apple Issues Fix to Combat Virus,"Apple issued a security update on Tuesday to address persistent attacks that is taking aim at Mac users with a fake antivirus program. The update removes known versions of the ""scareware"" program, which is known as MacDefender. The update also adds detection capabilities to Apple' s built-in malware monitoring feature to try to stop users from downloading the fake program in the first place. If the updated software sees an attack, it will cause a pop-up warning with a big red stop sign and white exclamation point. The update is available for only the most recent 10.6 versions of the Mac OS X computer and server operating systems. Users can get the update immediately by clicking on the Apple icon on the top left of their screen and selecting ""Software Update."" Apple said in an advisory that its removal and blocking tools will be updated daily to catch any new versions of the scareware. And it looks like it will need to. Within hours of issuing its security update, a new version of MacDefender was spotted that evaded the new defenses, ZDNet reported. And antivirus company F-Secure said it was seeing a ""significant"" attack on American and British users ofFacebook that was able to hit both Macs and Windows PCs. The Facebook attack was spreading virally using the site's ""Like"" feature and lures users with a promise of salacious videos, including of Dominique Strauss-Khan's alleged rape attempt. MacDefender has been targeting Mac users for the last month using malicious Web pages. These pages use tactics that are commonly used by the online-marketing industry and malicious attackers alike. The most recent versions of the program have been able to install on Macs without users needing to enter their password, a layer of defense that helped slow earlier versions. MacDefender attempts to trick people into thinking their computer is infected with a virus and then tries to sell them security software, which is also fake. Mac users are pressured to supply their credit-card numbers and pay for licenses that cost $60 to $80. Apple provides instructions on how to manually remove the scareware on another page on its Web site. The spate of attacks has started debate about whether things are now bad enough that Mac users need to use antivirus software. Macs are theoretically as vulnerable to malware as other computers, but a smaller marketshare has long made going after the machines less fruitful and interesting for attackers. However, the rising popularity of Macs and other Apple products could be changing that. ""Apple is loosing its security-by-obscurity luster,"" said Paul Henry, principle at consultancy vNet Security and a security and forensic analyst for Lumension Security. It helps that Apple provides its own antivirus protection, though its tool has been very basic to date. A number of companies offer security software for Macs. F-Secure sells a product for 32 euros a year ($46), Mac specialist Intego charges $50 and Sophos provides a free product.  "
Hackers Hit Arizona Police Again,"Hackers continued to plague the Arizona state police, releasing online yet another trove of stolen data and defacing eight police Web sites in what the hackers called ""the third knockout blow.""  The latest digital dump, which occurred late Thursday, included documents, e-mail messages and a ""master list"" of account passwords and other personal information for more than 1,200 officers, the hacker group said in a statement. The hackers, associated with the AntiSec or anti-security movement, appeared to have obtained the data by breaking into systems belonging to the Arizona Fraternal Order of Police, which said it was looking into how it occurred. The release follows two others: one last week that included data stolen from the Arizona Department of Public Safety's e-mail system and a second earlier this week that included contents of officers' private online accounts.  A spokesman for the department, Captain Steve Harrison, said the hackers may have taken advantage of some officers' use of the same usernames and passwords for multiple accounts to jump from account to account. He said the department was still investigating how its e-mail system was initially compromised and was working with multiple law enforcement agencies on a criminal probe. The hacker group, which is part of the hacking collective Anonymous and contains members of the group formerly known as LulzSec, said its attacks were motivated by opposition to ""the racist Arizona police state"" and a belief in the anarchist goal of ""a world free from police, prisons and politicians altogether.""  The release was part of an ""operation"" called AntiSec targeting governments and corporations. ""Let this third and crushing blow against Arizona police send a strong message to the ruling class around the world. You will no longer be able to operate your campaign of terror against immigrants and working people in secrecy: we will find you, expose you, and knock you off the internet,"" it said. The stash included e-mails with anti-Muslim content, including jokes about torturing ""ragheads,"" as well as crude jokes about President Obama, according to the group.  John Ortolano, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said the racist label was ""very disturbing"" to him and his fellow officers, the majority of whom are not white, adding that it ""couldn't be further from the truth.""  But the officers' persecution appears to be far from over. The hackers said they have been sharing passwords for the officers' online accounts with other malicious hackers, and have issued a public call to sympathizers to help them dig through their e-mail ""to retrieve and expose their secrets."" They also said they had shared their digital back doors into the police's computer systems with other hackers. And document leaks of all kinds by hackers may only increase. A subgroup of Anonymous known as the People's Liberation Front has launched two new Wikileaks-type sites for hackers called LocalLeaks.tk and HackerLeaks.tk. The same group has taken credit for attacks on sites associated with Orlando. The sites are a response to a lack of significant leaks since Wikileaks' release of State Department cables last year, Anonymous said. ""Instead of waiting for insider whistleblowers, the hacker movement Anonymous hopes that a few outside intruders might start the leaks flowing.""  "
An Attack Sheds Light on Internet Security Holes,"The Comodo Group, an Internet security company, has been attacked in the last month by a talkative and professed patriotic Iranian hacker who infiltrated several of the company's partners and used them to threaten the security of myriad big-name Web sites. But the case is a problem for not only Comodo, which initially believed the attack was the work of the Iranian government. It has also cast a spotlight on the global system that supposedly secures communications and commerce on the Web.  The encryption used by many Web sites to prevent eavesdropping on their interactions with visitors is not very secure. This technology is in use when Web addresses start with ''https'' (in which ''s'' stands for secure) and a closed lock icon appears on Web browsers. These sites rely on third-party organizations, like Comodo, to provide ''certificates'' that guarantee sites' authenticity to Web browsers. But many security experts say the problems start with the proliferation of organizations permitted to issue certificates. Browser makers like Microsoft, Mozilla, Google and Apple have authorized a large and growing number of entities around the world -- both private companies and government bodies -- to create them. Many private ''certificate authorities'' have, in turn, worked with resellers and deputized other unknown companies to issue certificates in a ''chain of trust'' that now involves many hundreds of players, any of which may in fact be a weak link. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group, has explored the Internet in an attempt to map this nebulous system. As of December, 676 organizations were signing certificates, it found. Other security experts suspect that the scan missed many and that the number is much higher. Making matters worse, entities that issue certificates, though required to seek authorization from site owners, can technically issue certificates for any Web site. This means that governments that control certificate authorities and hackers who break into their systems can issue certificates for any site at will. Experts say that both the certificate system and the technology it employs have long been in need of an overhaul, but that the technology industry has not been able to muster the will to do it. ''It hasn't been perceived to be a big enough problem that needs to be fixed,'' said Stephen Schultze, associate director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton. ''This is a wake-up call. This is a small leak that is evidence of a much more fundamental structural problem.'' In the Comodo case, the hacker infiltrated an Italian computer reseller and used its access to Comodo's systems to automatically create certificates for Web sites operated by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Skype and Mozilla. With the certificates, the hacker could set up servers that appear to work for those sites and try to view the unscrambled e-mail of millions of people, experts say. In a series of online messages teeming with bravado, the hacker described himself as a software-engineering student and cryptography expert and said he worked alone. He suggested he was avenging the Stuxnet computer worm, which was directed at Iranian nuclear installations last year. And he indicated that he intended to use the certificates he created to snoop on opponents of the Iranian regime. ''As I live, you don't have privacy in Internet, you don't have security in digital world,'' he warned. Comodo's chief executive, Melih Abdulhayoglu, said that ''the system we have has been serving us well,'' though it could be improved. His firm's processes were adequate based on the known threats, but have now been tightened, he said. The certificate system was created at the dawn of e-commerce in the early 1990s before security was a major issue. Security experts say the system is not up to the challenge of today's immense, commercial and much-attacked Internet. It was designed primarily to let businesses take credit card payments online, and less to confirm the authenticity of Web sites. The crucial tool available to Comodo and the browser makers -- revocation -- is ineffective, security experts say. After the Comodo case, Google, Mozilla and Microsoft rushed out patches so their browsers would recognize and reject the bad certificates. But this solution requires many millions of Internet users to update their browser software, which many people never do. Moreover, because certificate authorities' servers are seen as unreliable, most browser makers allow users to proceed to an alternative site, and hackers can exploit this weakness, security experts say. Browser makers have another problem: Faced with a suspicious certificate authority, there is little they can do shy of rescinding it. But if they did that, millions of Web users might encounter troubling error warnings when they visited sites with certificates from that company, causing a cascade of problems for users and site owners. Cutting out a large player like Comodo, which controls at least 95,100 certificates, could effectively ''break the Web,'' said Dan Kaminsky, chief scientist at the security firm DKH. They are effectively ''too big to fail,'' said Christopher Soghoian, a former Federal Trade Commission technologist who is now a graduate fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University. ''The problem is that the browser vendors don't have a small stick, they only have a big stick.'' Microsoft and Mozilla said that they would consider removing certificate authority if it was in the best interest of Internet users, and that they remained in talks with Comodo about its security practices. ''Participation in Mozilla's root program is a privilege, not a right,'' the company, the nonprofit maker of Firefox, said. Apple, maker of the Safari browser, declined to comment. (Google's Chrome browser defers to the choices of operating system makers like Microsoft and Apple about which certificate authorities are accepted.) Mozilla, Microsoft and Google said they would work together and with certificate authorities and the security community on improvements to the system. One approach proposed by Comodo and Google engineers in January would allow Web site owners to specify which certificate authorities may issue certificates for their sites. An initiative preferred by security experts would overhaul the system more radically. It would give Web sites similar control while securing their certificates within a new encrypted version of the domain name system, the central directory of the Web, making it the de facto central certificate authority through which Web sites could generate their own certificates.  "
Changes to OnStar's Privacy Terms Rile Some Users,"A new set of terms and conditions for OnStar, the General Motors-supported safety and connectivity system, is generating privacy concerns among some subscribers, many of whom have long raised questions about the potential for abuse. For years, some G.M. car and truck owners have posted elaborate instructions to Internet forums and user groups detailing how to disable built-in OnStar equipment to prevent any tracking of their vehicles. Last week, OnStar sent e-mails notifying customers of changes in the company's policies. Some customers say two changes in those terms were of particular concern from the standpoint of privacy.  The first regards what happens when a customer cancels the service. Until now, when OnStar service stopped, so did the vehicle's two-way communications system. As of Dec. 1, however, that will not necessarily be the case. Vehicles of owners who no longer subscribe could still be monitored via the system's still-active two-way cellular link. The second policy change concerns the potential use of the data collected by OnStar, which includes information like the vehicle's speed and location, current odometer reading, driver seat-belt use and air-bag deployment. Under the new terms, OnStar reserves the right to share that information with other companies and organizations, even data culled from motorists who no longer subscribe to the service but who have left the two-way communications connection open. ""But the customer has a choice,"" Vijay Iyer, an OnStar spokesman, said in a telephone interview. Under the new terms, a canceling subscriber can request that the two-way connection be shut off, he said. Customers who have already canceled the service are no longer connected via the two-way link, he confirmed. As a default position, however, OnStar maintains the cellular connection after the subscription is canceled, a practice intended to collect data that could be useful to municipalities, for example, trying to improve traffic flow or to first responders attempting to determine the severity of a crash before arriving at the scene. Mr. Iyer said that there were related services that OnStar could offer in the future, like remote vehicle diagnostics. OnStar has not started selling data that it collects, Mr. Iyer said. Under the new terms, data would be made anonymous and aggregated to allay privacy concerns. However, the open-ended language in the terms suggests that OnStar could, without reproach, sell the information to local governments, to companies offering location-based services and to marketers interested in directing messages to specific groups of drivers. Jonathan Zdziarski, a forensic scientist, canceled his subscription based on the change in terms. His and other subscribers' concerns range from invasive marketing techniques to unintended security breaches. Hackers, meanwhile, have proved how anonymous, aggregated data can be cross-referenced with other databases, for example, to identify individual users. Furthermore, law enforcement could issue subpoenas to grab data from an OnStar subscriber under investigation, a practice that is already commonplace with regard to portable navigation devices and cellphones. The OnStar issue is the latest in a growing list of privacy-related concerns brought about by advances in onboard telematics systems. A Nissan Leaf owner recently uncovered a security hole that allowed anyone to tap into a vehicle's speed and location information. Researchers at iSec Partners, a cybersecurity consultancy, have shown how a car's wireless connections can be exploited, using a technique known as war texting, to break into a vehicle. Continuing to gather information about a car and maintain a two-way connection, some might argue, may leave owners vulnerable to new threats. For OnStar, the issue is one of how to monetize this new world of customer data and services. The company is under increasing pressure from a new wave of free car-related apps for smartphones that mimic much of what has differentiated OnStar in the past. For its part, OnStar has not said to whom it would sell this information or how the data would be rendered anonymous, but as the backlash from customers has demonstrated, it must move carefully.   "
Pirates' Strong Showing in Regional Elections Surprises Even Them,"BERLIN -- With laptops open like shields against the encroaching cameramen, the young men resembled Peter Pan's Lost Boys more than Captain Hook's buccaneers when they were introduced Monday as Berlin's newest legislators: They are the members of the Pirate Party. Asked if they were just some chaotic troop of troublemakers, Christopher Lauer, newly voted in as a state lawmaker for the district of Pankow, replied with no lack of confidence, ''You ought to wait for the first session in the house of representatives.'' By winning 8.9 percent of the vote in Sunday's election in this city-state, these political pirates surpassed -- blew away, really -- every expectation for what was supposed to be a fringe, one-issue party promoting Internet freedom. The Pirates so outstripped expectations that all 15 candidates on their list won seats -- seats are doled out based in part on votes for a party rather than for an individual. Normally parties list far more candidates than could ever make it, because if they win more than they nominate, the seat must remain unfilled.  These men in their 20s and 30s, who turned up at the imposing former Prussian state parliament building, some wearing hooded sweatshirts, and one a T-shirt of the comic book hero Captain America, were no longer merely madcap campaigners and gadflies. They had become the people's elected representatives. The question that members of Germany's political establishment are now asking after the insurgent party stormed the statehouse is this: Are the Pirates merely the punch line to a joke, a focus of protest, a reflection of electoral disgust with all established political parties -- or an exciting experiment in a new form of online democracy? ''They are absolutely not a joke party,'' said Christoph Bieber, a professor of political science at the University of Duisburg-Essen. While there was certainly an element of protest in the unexpectedly large share of the votes the Pirates won, they were filling a real need for voters outside the political mainstream who felt unrepresented. ''In the Internet, they have really found an underexploited theme that the other political parties are not dealing with,'' Mr. Bieber said. The state election in Berlin on Sunday was full of surprising results. The pro-business Free Democrats, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition partners in the federal Parliament, crashed and burned, again, receiving less than 2 percent of the vote. That is well below the 5 percent needed to remain in the statehouse. The Green Party continued to build on its recent successes and may well become one of the governing parties in Berlin. While issues like online privacy and data protection may seem incredibly narrow, even irrelevant, to older voters, for young people who often spend half their waking hours online, much of it on social networking sites where they share their most intimate moments, it is anything but a small issue. And the Pirates' call for complete transparency in politics resonates powerfully with a generation disillusioned by the American case for war in Iraq and galvanized by WikiLeaks' promise to put an end to secrecy. The Pirates' surprisingly strong showing came as further evidence of voter dissatisfaction in Germany with the established parties, and what many see as their inability to look beyond self-interest and focus instead on the needs of their constituents. The Pirates have promised to use online tools to give party members unprecedented power to propose policies and determine stances, in what they call ''liquid democracy,'' a form of participation that goes beyond simply voting in elections. The party has broadened its initial platform, which focused on file sharing, censorship and data protection to include other social issues, advocating the Internet as a tool to empower the electorate and engage it in the political -- and legislative -- process. ''Today's cadre of politicians is missing out on asking some very relevant questions about the future,'' said Rick Falkvinge, founder of the first Pirate Party, which he started in Sweden in 2006. He was celebrating with his German colleagues at Sunday night's election party in a room filled with disco balls and disassembled mannequins in the Kreuzberg nightclub Ritter Butzke. Thanks to the interactive nature of the Internet, ''you don't have to take these laws being read to you,'' he said. ''You can stand up, stand tall and write the laws yourself.'' Mr. Falkvinge summed up the significance of the Berlin election for the nascent movement in terms members would understand: ''German Pirates have the high score now.'' Sebastian Schneider, who asked to be called Schmiddie ''or no one will know who you're talking about,'' a member of the party and one of the people celebrating Sunday night, said that there was no other party he could envision voting for. ''In my opinion, the Greens are a conservative party by now,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''They were not quite sure if they wanted to join the dark side of the force or not,'' by which he said that he meant forming a coalition to govern Berlin with Mrs. Merkel's Christian Democrats. There were plenty of young people, many with dreadlocks or beards and a few with both, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and sipping beer. Others wore jackets with CCC written on the back, short for the Chaos Computer Club, a hackers' collective that got its start in Berlin and has an overlap in membership with the Pirates. A stand-up comedian working in classic Berlin cabaret style poked fun at the influx of tourists and the recent rent increases that became major issues in the election campaign, saying: ''There are no more buildings to occupy. Next we'll have to start occupying five-star hotels.'' Mayor Klaus Wowereit of Berlin, whose Social Democrats won the most votes on Sunday, assuring him a third term as the city's mayor, may have paid the young party the highest compliment of all, taking it seriously enough to attack the day after the election. He raised a prickly problem for young men who spend their evenings writing computer code: There were next to no women in their group. ''Gender politics has not arrived for the Pirates yet, and that is not a step forward but a step backward,'' Mr. Wowereit told reporters Monday. Indeed, at Monday's news conference only young, white men sat at the conference table representing the party. Mr. Lauer, himself wearing a sports jacket, said that the mostly scruffy people were ''not a representative slice of this society,'' and that it was a problem that the party was working on. The Pirates could be disarmingly honest, and were unfailingly polite to security guards, cameramen and anyone else they came across. Transparency in politics means ''also being able to admit when we don't know something,'' said Andreas Baum, the party's lead candidate in the election. Asked what kind of real change a small party in a state legislature could really bring about, Mr. Baum replied, ''The very fact that these other parties are now asking themselves how we won these votes is already progress.''

New Hacking Tools Pose Bigger Threats to Wi-Fi Users,"You may think the only people capable of snooping on your Internet activity are government intelligence agents or possibly a talented teenage hacker holed up in his parents' basement. But some simple software lets just about anyone sitting next to you at your local coffee shop watch you browse the Web and even assume your identity online. ''Like it or not, we are now living in a cyberpunk novel,'' said Darren Kitchen, a systems administrator for an aerospace company in Richmond, Calif., and the host of Hak5, a video podcast about computer hacking and security. ''When people find out how trivial and easy it is to see and even modify what you do online, they are shocked.'' Until recently, only determined and knowledgeable hackers with fancy tools and lots of time on their hands could spy while you used your laptop or smartphone at Wi-Fi hot spots. But a free program called Firesheep, released in October, has made it simple to see what other users of an unsecured Wi-Fi network are doing and then log on as them at the sites they visited.  Without issuing any warnings of the possible threat, Web site administrators have since been scrambling to provide added protections. ''I released Firesheep to show that a core and widespread issue in Web site security is being ignored,'' said Eric Butler, a freelance software developer in Seattle who created the program. ''It points out the lack of end-to-end encryption.'' What he means is that while the password you initially enter on Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Amazon, eBay and The New York Times is encrypted, the Web browser's cookie, a bit of code that that identifies your computer, your settings on the site or other private information, is often not encrypted. Firesheep grabs that cookie, allowing nosy or malicious users to, in essence, be you on the site and have full access to your account. More than a million people have downloaded the program in the last three months (including this reporter, who is not exactly a computer genius). And it is easy to use. The only sites that are safe from snoopers are those that employ the cryptographic protocol Transport Layer Security or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer, throughout your session. PayPal and many banks do this, but a startling number of sites that people trust to safeguard their privacy do not. You know you are shielded from prying eyes if a little lock appears in the corner of your browser or the Web address starts with ''https'' rather than ''http.'' ''The usual reason Web sites give for not encrypting all communication is that it will slow down the site and would be a huge engineering expense,'' said Chris Palmer, technology director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an electronic rights advocacy group based in San Francisco. ''Yes, there are operational hurdles, but they are solvable.'' Indeed, Gmail made end-to-end encryption its default mode in January 2010. Facebook began to offer the same protection as an opt-in security feature last month, though it is so far available only to a small percentage of users and has limitations. For example, it doesn't work with many third-party applications. ''It's worth noting that Facebook took this step, but it's too early to congratulate them,'' said Mr. Butler, who is frustrated that ''https'' is not the site's default setting. ''Most people aren't going to know about it or won't think it's important or won't want to use it when they find out that it disables major applications.'' Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Facebook, said the company was engaged in a ''deliberative rollout process,'' to access and address any unforeseen difficulties. ''We hope to have it available for all users in the next several weeks,'' he said, adding that the company was also working to address problems with third-party applications and to make ''https'' the default setting. Many Web sites offer some support for encryption via ''https,'' but they make it difficult to use. To address these problems, the Electronic Frontier Foundation in collaboration with the Tor Project, another group concerned with Internet privacy, released in June an add-on to the browser Firefox, called Https Everywhere. The extension, which can be downloaded at eff.org/https-everywhere, makes ''https'' the stubbornly unchangeable default on all sites that support it. Since not all Web sites have ''https'' capability, Bill Pennington, chief strategy officer with the Web site risk management firm WhiteHat Security in Santa Clara, Calif., said: ''I tell people that if you're doing things with sensitive data, don't do it at a Wi-Fi hot spot. Do it at home.'' But home wireless networks may not be all that safe either, because of free and widely available Wi-Fi cracking programs like Gerix WiFi Cracker, Aircrack-ng and Wifite. The programs work by faking legitimate user activity to collect a series of so-called weak keys or clues to the password. The process is wholly automated, said Mr. Kitchen at Hak5, allowing even techno-ignoramuses to recover a wireless router's password in a matter of seconds. ''I've yet to find a WEP-protected network not susceptible to this kind of attack,'' Mr. Kitchen said. A WEP-encrypted password (for wired equivalent privacy) is not as strong as a WPA (or Wi-Fi protected access) password, so it's best to use a WPA password instead. Even so, hackers can use the same free software programs to get on WPA password-protected networks as well. It just takes much longer (think weeks) and more computer expertise. Using such programs along with high-powered Wi-Fi antennas that cost less than $90, hackers can pull in signals from home networks two to three miles away. There are also some computerized cracking devices with built-in antennas on the market, like WifiRobin ($156). But experts said they were not as fast or effective as the latest free cracking programs, because the devices worked only on WEP-protected networks. To protect yourself, changing the Service Set Identifier or SSID of your wireless network from the default name of your router (like Linksys or Netgear) to something less predictable helps, as does choosing a lengthy and complicated alphanumeric password. Setting up a virtual private network, or V.P.N., which encrypts all communications you transmit wirelessly whether on your home network or at a hot spot, is even more secure. The data looks like gibberish to a snooper as it travels from your computer to a secure server before it is blasted onto the Internet. Popular V.P.N. providers include VyprVPN, HotSpotVPN and LogMeIn Hamachi. Some are free; others are as much as $18 a month, depending on how much data is encrypted. Free versions tend to encrypt only Web activity and not e-mail exchanges. However, Mr. Palmer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation blames poorly designed Web sites, not vulnerable Wi-Fi connections, for security lapses. ''Many popular sites were not designed for security from the beginning, and now we are suffering the consequences,'' he said. ''People need to demand 'https' so Web sites will do the painful integration work that needs to be done.''  "
Firms Warn of E-Mail Fraud After a Breach," SAN FRANCISCO -- Security experts said Monday that millions of people were at increased risk of e-mail swindles after a giant security breach at an online marketing firm. The breach exposed the e-mail addresses of customers of some of the nation's largest companies, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Target and Walgreens. In some cases customer names were also stolen. While the number of people affected is unknown, security experts say that based on the businesses involved, the breach may be among the largest ever. And it could lead to a surge in phishing attacks -- e-mails that purport to be from a legitimate business but are intended to steal information like account numbers or passwords. ''It is clearly a massive hemorrhage,'' said Michael Kleeman, a network security expert at the University of California, San Diego.  The marketing firm that suffered the breach, Epsilon, which handles e-mail marketing lists for hundreds of clients, disclosed the problem in a brief statement on Friday. But its sheer scale became clear over the weekend and on Monday, as banks, retailers and others began alerting their customers to be on the lookout for fraudulent e-mails. While e-mail addresses may not seem particularly vulnerable, experts say that if criminals can associate addresses with names and a business like a bank, they can devise highly customized attacks to trick people into disclosing more confidential information, a technique known as ''spear phishing.'' ''Any time you have an organization that loses the contact information of customers for some of the biggest banks in the world, that's a big deal,'' said Brian Krebs, editor of Krebs on Security, a Web site that specializes in online security and crime. ''You've just given the bad guys a road map between the banks and their customers.'' In traditional phishing attacks, criminals e-mail millions of people with a message that appears to be from a bank or other real business, hoping that some of the recipients will be customers of that business and will follow instructions to, for example, ''update your account information.'' A spear-phishing e-mail is far more dangerous because it can include a person's name and is sent only to people who are known to be customers of a certain business, greatly increasing the likelihood that the targets will be duped. Phishing has remained a major challenge, especially for banks and other financial institutions, which want to encourage customers to do business with them online. The Anti-Phishing Working Group, an organization that tries to prevent Internet crime, received reports of more than 33,000 phishing attacks worldwide last June, the most recent month for which data is available. Roughly 70 percent of the attacks were in the financial services and online payment industries. With the information stolen from Epsilon, thieves could send customers of a particular bank an e-mail that appeared to be from the bank, complete with their names, said Mark Seiden, an information security consultant in Silicon Valley. If the criminals cross-check a name with the property records of mortgage holders, they could even include the customer's address in the e-mail, he said. ''Something that is that customized and has the right graphical elements, people will fall for it,'' Mr. Seiden said. The companies that alerted customers or acknowledged being affected also include Barclays Bank, U.S. Bancorp, Walt Disney, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Best Buy, L. L. Bean, Home Shopping Network, TiVo and the College Board. In e-mails to their customers, the companies asked them to be cautious but also sought to reassure them that the hackers had obtained only e-mail addresses and in some cases names, not passwords, account numbers, credit card information or other more confidential data. ''Your account and any other personally identifiable information were not at risk,'' the clothing retailer New York & Company told its customers in an e-mail. ''Please note, it is possible you may receive spam e-mail messages as a result. We want to urge you to be cautious when opening links or attachments from unknown third parties. We also want to remind you that we will never ask you for your personal information in an e-mail.'' Ron Baldwin, a technology consultant in Laguna Niguel, Calif., said that over the weekend he received an e-mail alerting him to the security breach from U.S. Bank, where he is a customer. He said he was particularly upset that the bank, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, would entrust his information to another company. ''They shared my information with a third party unbeknownst to me,'' Mr. Baldwin said. ''I don't know Epsilon from some guy walking down the street.'' Mr. Baldwin said that when he contacted the bank, he was told that he had given permission to share information with suppliers. Jessica Simon, a spokeswoman for Epsilon, which is based in Irving, Tex., said in an interview: ''We are currently working with authorities and are conducting a full investigation. We are limited in what we can share.'' Epsilon is a unit of Alliance Data and has some 2,500 clients, though not all of them use its e-mail marketing services. The company said that about 2 percent of its clients were affected. It declined to say how the hack had occurred or why the e-mail addresses had not been encrypted. ''Epsilon has some explaining to do about the numbers, how it was penetrated and what they have done to protect the information they have,'' said Mr. Kleeman, the security expert. Mary Landesman, a senior security researcher at Cisco Systems, said that because e-mail addresses were not considered of great value in the criminal underground, she suspected the attack on Epsilon began as something random. Hackers often scan the Internet looking for machines that have a certain vulnerability or misconfiguration and then, once they hit upon something, look further to see if the victim interests them. Ms. Landesman speculated that the attackers had found themselves on Epsilon's system, realized what they had and then worked to acquire their customer lists. The breach points out the significant risks for companies that outsource even seemingly low-risk activities like e-mail marketing, said Avivah Litan, an analyst focused on online fraud at the research firm Gartner. It also highlights the lack of regulation on security when it comes to consumer data that is not directly tied to financial accounts, which are subject to industry standards, Ms. Litan said. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about a major security breach at the online marketing firm Epsilon misstated the information that was exposed from three of Epsilon's clients: JPMorgan Chase, Target and Walgreen. Only e-mail addresses were exposed, those companies said -- not customer names. (Many Epsilon clients reported the exposure of both e-mail addresses and names.) A picture caption with the article repeated the error about one client, JPMorgan Chase.  "
Hackers Claim to Breach Senate's Web Site,"Presenting our Bethesda & Senate.gov double surprise release: http://t.co/9GsZRA0 May the lulz flow through you!Mon Jun 13 19:19:35  via webThe Lulz BoatLulzSec 5:31 p.m. | Updated Adding comment from the United States Senate; updated response from the F.B.I.; corrected spelling of Bethesda Softworks. Lulz Security, a group of hackers who have claimed responsibility for a number of recent online data breaches, claimed two more victims on Monday, including Bethesda Softworks, a video game company, and the Web site of the United States Senate. The hackers claim that they breached Bethesda Softworks' servers over two months ago, but just released server data Monday. The group also said it has over 200,000 gamer usernames and passwords that it took from the site. The group said it has not yet decided whether it will release this information to the public. Bethesda Softworks did not respond to a request for comment about the data breach. Lulz Security also said on Twitter that it had successfully attacked the United States Senate Web site.  In a release issued on the hacker's Web site, the group said they were releasing a ""small"" amount of data from senate.gov ""in an attempt to help them fix their issues."" The files released are relatively harmless and only show a thin layer of internal data on the government Web site. Martina Bradford, the deputy sergeant-at-arms of the Senate,  said in a statement Monday that security staff at senate.gov became aware of the attacks over the weekend. The statement noted that the hackers did not infiltrate any Senate computers, or the government firewall, but were able to breach the public Web site's files and file structures of its servers. ""As always, we continue to work with our federal cyber security and law enforcement partners to enhance the security of federal government Web sites,"" the statement said. ""We are also initiating a review of all the sites hosted on senate.gov, urging the individuals responsible for those sites to conduct their own review, and continuing to take other actions to safeguard the Senate's public Web presence."" Lulz Security has claimed responsibility for hacking a number of other sites and organizations over the past two months, including PBS.org, Sonypictures.com and an Web site associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A press officer or the F.B.I. declined to comment about the latest attacks.  "
RSA Gets a Security Chief,"RSA, the computer security unit of EMC that was hacked, has named Edward Schwartz as chief security officer, promoting him from the same role at NetWitness, a firm it recently acquired. Chief security officers are typically in charge of an organization's security, both physical and digital. As such, it appears it will be Mr. Schwartz's job to make sure RSA, which companies entrust for their computer security,  does not again fall victim to hackers. RSA's computer systems were breached in March and sensitive information was stolen about its flagship SecurID product, a system that is used by millions of companies to provide employees and customers with secure access to their own networks through one-time passcodes, which typically display on a keychain token or card. After playing down the danger to its customers for more than a month, RSA said this week that the hack appeared to have been part of an effort to infiltrate military companies and that Lockheed Martin was successfully attacked in May. It offered to replace most of its customers' devices.  Mr. Schwartz is well respected and liked in the security field, and possesses an expertise in intrusions that will be valuable to RSA and its customers at a time of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated hacker attacks, said Ed Skoudis, an instructor at the SANS Institute, an organization for security professionals, who formerly worked for Mr. Schwartz. NetWitness, whose tools are designed to detect malicious attacks and data leaks, was credited with spotting the break-in at RSA. Soon after the incident, RSA went from customer to owner. It acquired the firm on April 1 for an undisclosed sum in a deal had been already been in the works. Mr. Schwartz appears to be RSA's first chief security officer. However, EMC does have a security executive who oversees the entire company, Dave Martin, who has been chief security officer since January 2010 and joined the company in 2004. Mr. Schwartz confirmed his promotion in several postings on Twitter Wednesday, and said he was ready for what will undoubtedly be a high-pressure job. RSA declined to comment on his role, citing a policy against discussing personnel matters.  The hacking incident has darkened RSA's reputation. Customers and security professionals have been up in arms about its tightlipped response to the attack, which many have said compromised their ability to properly defend themselves. Mr. Schwartz has presented regularly at security industry events on how to cope with so-called advanced persistent threats, stealthy targeted attacks of the type RSA says it suffered. Prior to NetWitness, Mr. Schwartz held executive positions at several other security companies, most recently chief technology officer at ManTech Security Technologies, a unit of ManTech International, which serves defense and intelligence agencies and spun out NetWitness in 2006. He also worked for the security firms Guardent and Predictive Systems, was chief information security officer at Nationwide Insurance, and served as a foreign service officer for the Department of State.   "
Hacked Chamber of Commerce Opposed Cybersecurity Law,"The United States Chamber of Commerce has confirmed Chinese hackers last year broke into internal networks. The breach is, in some ways, a twist of fate for the Chamber. It has been one of the more vocal critics of cybersecurity legislation. In an internal draft document circulated earlier this year, the Chamber criticized the White House's legislative proposals on cybersecurity as ""regulatory overreach"" and cautioned that ""layering new regulations on critical infrastructure will harm public-private partnerships."" ""This happens all the time,"" says Tom Kellermann, chief technology officer at AirPatrol Corp. and a member of a Center for Strategic International Studies panel set up to advise President Obama on cybersecurity. ""This is essentially the modus operandi of China's economic espionage campaign. Hackers use a trade group as a beachhead to compromise the constituency. What intellectual property does the Chamber have? They don't. But they're trusted."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation was the first to alert the business lobbying group that servers in China were accessing the Chamber's internal network early last year. A subsequent internal investigation found the hackers had zeroed in on four of the lobbying group's Asia policy experts and that at least six week's worth of e-mails had been pilfered. The Chamber shut down the operation in May 2010. J.P. Fielder, a Chamber spokesman, emphasized that the breach was ""limited in scope"" to the four employees, though an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal  suggested that the breach had been going on for over a year before it was discovered and that more than 300 Internet addresses may have been compromised. The F.B.I. did not return calls seeking comment.  The Chamber represents businesses and trade groups in Washington and the breach may affect its trusted relationship with its three million members, which include some of the nation's largest corporations.  ""Businesses are already worried about the cyber theft of their internal trade secrets.  Now they have to worry that the sensitive information they've shared with the Chamber is compromised,"" says Jacob Olcott, a principal with Good Harbor Consulting's cybersecurity team. The Chamber says it has taken greater steps to secure itself in the wake of the breach. Mr. Fielder, the Chamber spokesman, said the Chamber had installed more sophisticated detection equipment and updated its policies which now include ""barring employees from taking portable devices with them to certain countries,"" including China. Despite these measures, the Chamber still shows signs of infiltration. The Journal reported that the Chamber recently discovered a thermostat in a Chamber-owned apartment was communicating with an Internet address in China and that last March, one of its printers randomly started printing documents containing Chinese characters. An earlier version of this post referred imprecisely to a cybersecurity committee that Tom Kellermann is a member of. The panel was set up by a private policy research organization, the Center for Strategic International Studies, to advise President Obama. It is not a presidential commission.    "
Data Breach at Security Firm Linked to Attack on Lockheed,"Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, has battled disruptions in its computer networks this week that might be tied to a hacking attack on a vendor that supplies coded security tokens to millions of users, security officials said on Friday. The SecurID electronic tokens, which are used to gain access to computer networks by corporate employees and government officials from outside their offices, are supplied by the RSA Security division of the EMC Corporation.  RSA acknowledged in March that it had sustained a data breach that could have compromised some of its security products. Executives in the military industry said Friday that Lockheed's problems appeared to stem from that data breach and could be the first public signs of damage from it. The March intrusion reverberated through the computer security community. The RSA technology is used by most Fortune 500 companies and federal agencies to provide an extra layer of security when employees use their networks from customer offices, hotels or their homes. Many of RSA's customers have taken extra measures since the intrusion was discovered, either by adding security measures, finding alternative solutions or simply shutting off remote access. Security experts said it was possible that companies other than Lockheed had faced attacks, whether they realized it or not. ''The issue is whether all of the security controls are compromised,'' said James A. Lewis, a senior fellow and a specialist in computer security issues at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy group in Washington. ''That's the assumption people are making.'' Neither RSA, which is based in Bedford, Mass., nor Lockheed would discuss the problems on Friday. Officials in the military industry, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter, said Lockheed had detected an intruder trying to break into its networks last Sunday. It shut down much of its remote access and has been providing new tokens and passwords to many workers, company employees said. Lockheed makes fighter planes, spy satellites and other confidential equipment. It also sells cybersecurity services to military and intelligence agencies, and some experts said its failure to take greater precautions with its own systems could be embarrassing. ''We don't know what they went after at Lockheed,'' Mr. Lewis said, referring to the hackers behind the intrusion attempt. ''One possibility is that it's a state actor, but it could also be criminals who are trying to exploit the company's customers.'' Industry officials said military contractors, who are bombarded daily by hacking attempts, typically do not keep classified data on computers that can be entered remotely. Federal authorities have said that China, Russia and other countries sponsor hackers trying to ferret out American military and corporate secrets. Raytheon, another large military contractor, issued a statement on Friday saying that it took ''immediate companywide actions'' when the RSA breach was disclosed in March. ''As a result of these actions,'' the company said, ''we prevented a widespread disruption of our network.'' General Dynamics said it had not had any problems related to the breach. Other giant military contractors, like Northrop Grumman and Boeing, declined to comment. Jeffery Adams, a spokesman for Lockheed, said the company would not publicly discuss specific threats or its responses. ''However, to counter any threats, we regularly take actions to increase the security of our systems and to protect our employee, customer and program data,'' he said in a statement. ''We have policies and procedures in place to mitigate the cyberthreats to our business, and we remain confident in the integrity of our robust, multilayered information systems security.'' Security experts said companies in many industries had increased network monitoring or changed passwords and PINs for the tokens since the RSA breach. But some of the specialists said that until more details were known, it remained possible that the attempted intrusion at Lockheed was not tied to the RSA breach. The RSA tokens provide security beyond a user name or password by requiring users to append a unique number generated by the token each time they connect to their corporate or government networks. Soon after the breach in March, RSA's chairman, Art Coviello, said the company's investigation had revealed that the intruder successfully stole digital information from the company that was related to RSA's SecurID products. He did not give precise details about the nature of the information but said it could potentially reduce the effectiveness of the system in the face of a ''broader attack.'' The company said then that there was no indication that the information had been used to attack its customers. Some computer security specialists said at the time that the compromised information was a file of master keys -- long numbers -- that are a part of the RSA encryption system. If the intruder did gain those numbers, it would make it possible to fashion an attack based on independently generating the keys used by individual customers. RSA officials have said that the intrusion was only partly successful. Mr. Lewis, the security specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the intruders had been detected as they were trying to transfer data by security software provided by the NetWitness Corporation, a company that provides network monitoring software. In April, NetWitness was acquired by RSA's parent company, EMC.  "
Your Voice Mail May Be Even Less Secure Than You Thought,"For all of the palace intrigue recently about who in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation kingdom knew what about phone hacking when, one fundamental question about the scandal has gone mostly unanswered: Just how vulnerable are everyday United States residents to similarly determined snoops? The answer is, more than you might think. AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile do not require cellphone customers to use a password on their voice mail boxes, and plenty of people never bother to set one up. But if you don't, people using a service colloquially known as caller ID spoofing could disguise their phone as yours and get access to your messages. This is possible because voice mail systems often grant access to callers who appear to be phoning from their own number. Meanwhile, as Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate who founded ConsumerWorld.org, discovered recently, someone armed with just a bit of personal information about a target can also gain access to the automated phone systems for Bank of America and Chase credit card holders.  Once those systems recognize the phone number of the incoming call and those bits of personal information, they offer up the latest on the cardholder's debts, late payments and credit limits. Bank of America's computer will even read off a list of dozens of recent charges, including names of doctors and other businesses the cardholder might have patronized. There are additional steps that the mobile phone companies and the card issuers could take to stop this sort of thing from ever happening. The fact that many of them don't, however, makes this your problem to solve. These sorts of breaches wouldn't happen without spoofing, and surprisingly enough, it's an activity that turns out to be perfectly legal, up to a point. Commercial spoofing operations, which began offering services to individuals about seven years ago, are easy to find and cost $10 or so for 60 minutes of calling time. A Google search on ''caller ID spoofing'' leads to many providers with names like SpoofCard, whose slogan is ''Be Who You Want to Be.'' Registered users call an access number (or use a form on a Web site) and enter the phone number they are calling and the phone number they want to show up on the caller ID display of the person they are calling. Then the service puts the call through. Late last year, President Obama signed the Truth in Caller ID Act, which prohibits knowingly using spoofing services to defraud, cause harm or wrongfully obtain anything of value. The fine is up to $10,000 for a single incident. The new law, however, is not much of a disincentive for people already engaged in illegal activity. After all, for years, even before commercial services were available, hacker thieves were manipulating caller ID information to convince consumers that a bank was phoning. Unwitting recipients of these calls would hand over their Social Security numbers and become identity theft victims. Another common tactic was the jury duty fraud, in which thieves would program their phones to make it appear that they were calling from a local courthouse. Then they'd tell recipients that they'd missed their jury duty assignment and needed to pay a fine by credit card over the phone to avoid arrest. Once the thieves had the card numbers, they'd go on a spending spree. Given all of this, it's hard to imagine a legitimate use for caller ID spoofing, but there are at least a few. People who have been victims of domestic violence may not want anyone to know where they are calling from. Doctors use it when calling patients from cellphones to keep patients from getting the number and pestering them later. Parents sometimes use the service as well, if they have children who tend to ignore their calls. Using spoofing services to listen to someone's voice mail is probably not a legitimate use. That said, mobile phone voice mail systems would be more spoof-proof if they required passwords every time a user called in, no matter what phone someone was calling from. Only Verizon Wireless does this, though. After a recent article in The Boston Globe showing how vulnerable voice mail was to spoofing, AT&T Wireless improved its security a bit. While it still lets users choose whether to require a password each time they call their voice mail, the default is to have them use one -- the opposite of the previous practice. Sprint is similar to AT&T in this regard, while T-Mobile allows users to require a password every time they call in for voice mail, but doesn't default to that option. Why didn't AT&T force all customers to use a password? ''We take the position that customers should have the information and tools available to make the right decision for them,'' said Mark Siegel, a spokesman. Mr. Dworsky of ConsumerWorld, a former consumer protection lawyer for the state of Massachusetts, read the Globe article and wondered whether some credit card companies' phone systems recognized callers if they were phoning in from a particular number. He set about testing a number of major credit card issuers' phone systems and found that with a couple of pieces of easily obtainable data -- I'm not going to say what exactly -- he could obtain access to a person's credit card account information at Chase and Bank of America. Chase's phone system gives out individual purchase data by category, letting a caller know that there was a $12 purchase at a drug store. Bank of America's phone system often reads off each transaction along with the name of the merchant, say a specific doctor or Web site or store. In my tests and Mr. Dworsky's, most spoofing services put through calls placed to banks, though some seemed to have those numbers blocked. When the calls went through, spoofing services were successful in gaining access to Chase's systems 100 percent of the time. Bank of America blocked calls that we placed from some spoofing services while letting others through. Neither bank seems to allow callers to use these systems in ways that could actually draw on a cardholder's credit -- like ordering new cards or requesting cash advances -- without asking for more information or speaking to a representative. Chase and Bank of America could close these holes by asking for a bit more information on the phone -- say, the last four digits of a Social Security number. But Bank of America doesn't want to, because officials there don't think their customers want them to. ''One of the top reasons customers use the automated system is because they want to quickly check basic account status and transaction information,'' said Betty Riess, a Bank of America spokeswoman, in an e-mail statement. ''Our objective is to balance customers' need for convenience and quick access to general information with industry-best protection of their accounts.'' Somehow I doubt that customers feel strongly about where banks ought to strike that balance, though. Has Bank of America attracted scores of credit card customers because it doesn't ask for the last four digits of a Social Security number when they call? And would it really drive many people away if it started asking for the full card number each time people called the automated system? A Chase spokesman, Paul Hartwick, declined to discuss the bank's security in much detail but said that the risks from spoofing in this instance were ''minimal.'' Mr. Dworsky did not find either bank's response satisfying. ''I think it's alarming that virtually anyone can get access to your payment and purchase information,'' he said. ''But it's even worse that these two big banks seemingly care so little about customers' privacy that they're unwilling to prevent this type of invasion, which they could do so easily.'' Until banks start asking for a bit more information, you are on your own here. If you're in a personal or professional situation where someone might be interested in what you're spending and where, don't spend it on a Chase or Bank of America credit card. Also, if you're in the habit of throwing out credit card receipts, shred them instead, since some of the data there can be useful to people looking to exploit the card issuers' automated systems. As for your cellphone, if you're not a Verizon user, set up a voice mail password and use it, simple as that. With each passing year, technology brings more convenience and delight to all of us. But it also creates vulnerabilities. Fortunately, spoofing is pretty easy to combat once you know that people are doing it. Meanwhile, it's too bad that some service providers don't seem to want to help by making customers take a few extra seconds to shield themselves.  "
'Do Not Track' Privacy Bill Appears in Congress,"And the privacy legislation just keeps on coming. On Friday, two bills were introduced in Washington in support of a Do Not Track mechanism that would give users control over how much of their data was collected by advertisers and other online companies. The first was from the office of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Mr. Rockefeller said he would introduce the Do Not Track Online Act of 2011 to Congress next week. ""Consumers have a right to know when and how their personal and sensitive information is being used online-and most importantly to be able to say 'no thanks' when companies seek to gather that information without their approval,"" he said in a statement announcing the legislation.  ""This bill will offer a simple, straightforward way for people to stop companies from tracking their every move on the Internet."" The legislation supports a mandatory browser-based Do Not Track mechanism that would allow users to opt out of having their information collected online. After a Federal Trade Commission report in December called for a similar mechanism, a number of major browser vendors including Google, Mozilla and Microsoft have created similar tools for opting out of online data collection. The bill would allow the Federal Trade Commission to pursue action against companies that violated the law. It would also limit the amount of time a company could keep data and then require it to destroy the data or make it anonymous. The announcement was followed by the release of a discussion draft of bipartisan legislation from  Representatives Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Joe Barton of Texas that would amend the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 by adding protections for children and teenagers who use mobile devices. ""We have reached a troubling point in the state of business when companies that conduct business online are so eager to make a buck, they resort to targeting our children,"" Mr. Barton said in a statement issued on Friday. ""I strongly believe that information should not be collected on children and used for commercial purposes."" The Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011 would require companies to explain the type of information being collected and how that information was being used and would require parental consent before the collection of a child's information. Advertisers would also be prohibited from aiming at children and teens online. The bill also calls for a ""digital marketing bill of rights for teens"" that limits data collection, including geolocation data from mobile devices and the creation of an ""eraser button"" that would let users eliminate information online. The two bills come on the heels of another piece of bipartisan legislation that was introduced in April by Senator John Kerry and Senator John McCain. The Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2011 required users to opt in to the collection of sensitive information like religious affiliation or medical condition, but did not call for a do not track mechanism.   "
Facebook Changes Privacy Settings to Enable Facial Recognition,"Facebook is pushing the privacy line once again, according to a new report from a security and antivirus company. According to the report, from Sophos, Facebook recently began changing its users' privacy settings to automatically turn on a facial recognition feature that detects a user's face in an image. Once the person's face is detected, the Web site then encourages Facebook friends to tag them. Facebook introduced this feature last year for its North American users; it is now rolling it out globally. Facebook also doesn't give users the option to avoid being tagged in a photo; instead, people who don't want their name attached to an image must untag themselves after the fact. In response to a reporter's inquiry, posted on a Facebook blog, the company said, ""We should have been more clear with people during the roll-out process when this became available to them.""  The post continued: ""We launched Tag Suggestions to help people add tags of their friends in photos; something that's currently done more than 100 million times a day.  Tag Suggestions are only made to people when they add new photos to the site, and only friends are suggested. If for any reason someone doesn't want their name to be suggested, they can disable the feature in their Privacy Settings.""  You can change the privacy settings relating to the facial recognition feature, but it is a little confusing. If you want to disable the feature, go your account privacy settings and click ""customize settings"" at the bottom of the page. Once in this area, scroll down to a list of options called ""things others share,"" and then click on the button that says ""suggest photos of me to friends."" You will then be given the option to disable the facial recognition feature. Facebook has come under repeated criticism in the past few years for automatically opting users into new product releases without their knowledge or consent. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has defended this decision in the past, noting that most users would not experience the full effects of Facebook without the new features that are continuously rolled out. Privacy experts and some Facebook users disagree, saying the company should introduce new products by asking users if they would like to join, rather than automatically signing them up without their knowledge.   "
LinkedIn's Social-Ad Misstep,"Move over Facebook. It's time to pay attention to privacy on LinkedIn.  That was is the message of last week's mini controversy over LinkedIn's quiet effort to introduce a new type of advertising on the site that would commandeer users' names and pictures for product endorsements. LinkedIn first announced the new ""social ads"" in an upbeat blog post in late June. The ads would include the names and photos of people's LinkedIn contacts if they were connected to the advertiser in some way and the company had changed its privacy policy. At the end, it mentioned that users may opt-out of the ads.  The social network said it believed people would find job ads more interesting if they were reminded that they know a few people at the company. And they might find an ad for, say, VistaPrint business cards more ""relevant"" if they were made aware that someone in their network cares enough to ""follow"" VistaPrint. No doubt, the newly public company also calculated that advertisers would pay more money for such ads.  But LinkedIn might have guessed that putting people's photos in ads would be a red line. After all, Facebook had to douse a user firestorm two years ago when a third-party app maker, against to Facebook policy, used people's profile pictures in ads it showed on the site. Facebook also displays ""social ads"" that include names -- but not photos -- of friends who ""like"" the advertiser. Still, the line crossing went largely unnoticed until last week, when people who saw the new ads grew alarmed and the emotional Richter scale of the online Universe ticked up as bloggers took up their cause. Branding consultant Steve Woodruff, writing last Wednesday, said he was alerted to the ads by a friend, urged readers to opt-out and groaned about a ""Facebook deja vu.""  Rik Ferguson of security firm Trend Micro said Thursday on his Countermeasures blog that he was ""angry"" about the change, which he came across during a periodic settings check. LinkedIn ""opted all their 120 million users in without any form of notification,"" he said. He called the U.K. Information Commissioner to ask if LinkedIn had crossed a legal line, and was told yes. Meanwhile, Dutch members of Parliament were asking similar questions in their country. LinkedIn said it did notify users by showing everyone a banner message alerting them that its privacy policy had changed. The message included nary a word about social ads or a new use for member's photos. I'm betting click-through rate was rock bottom. The drums soon beat louder1, and by Friday LinkedIn was backpedling. In a new blog post it said would alter the ads so they showed only a link to contacts with advertiser connections, rather than display their names and photos. ""We hear you loud and clear,"" wrote Ryan Roslansky, director of product management at LinkedIn. If you are not assuaged by the ads' new design, it's on you to opt out. Get your mouse ready: First, hover it over your name in blue in the top right corner of any page and click ""Settings."" Then click ""Account"" at the bottom left. Look for ""Privacy Controls"" and click the first choice, ""Manage Social Advertising."" In the pop-up window that appears, uncheck the box beside ""LinkedIn may use my name, photo in social advertising"" and hit ""Save."" Likewise, if you don't want to participate in Facebook's version of social ads, click the ""Account"" drop-down menu at the top right of any page, then click ""Facebook Ads"" in the menu on the left, and then ""Edit social ads settings."" You'll see a line in bold reading ""Pair my social actions with ads for"" and a drop-down menu where you can select ""No one."" Then click ""Save Changes.""   "
Privacy Groups Ask F.T.C. to Review New Facebook Features,"If you listen to Lionel Richie several times a week, do you want that popping up on your Facebook page for all the world to see? What if you click on a glowing obituary of Osama bin Laden? How about details of where you like to jog daily at twilight? That kind of information-sharing is at the crux of a new privacy challenge facing Facebook. A consortium of privacy watchdog groups, led by the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, has asked the federal government to investigate Facebook for a series of features that prompt its users to broadcast a range of new information about themselves. The request comes as Facebook undergoes a fairly radical makeover. At its annual conference last week, Facebook announced a number of partnerships with media companies, including the music streaming service Spotify, the video-streaming service Hulu, Yahoo News and The Washington Post. Those partnerships will allow Facebook users to gain access to a range of information and entertainment on the Facebook platform and in turn allow Facebook and its partners to capture a treasure trove of data about behavior. Some services ask users if they wish to share, but others assume that their users want to share. As a result, the music they listen to, the news they read or the books they recommend are visible to their Facebook ""friends"" on a new feature called Ticker. That information could also be made available to marketing companies for use in focusing advertisements, and potentially to government agencies interested in tracking people's behavior.  The company refers to this sharing mode as ""frictionless,"" meaning that users do not have to choose to post Facebook updates when they use one of the many entertainment services on the Facebook platform. Instead, the updates are automatic. Another feature being rolled out over the next few weeks, called Timeline, allows Facebook users to post what the company calls highlights of their lives. It too will capture valuable behavioral and biographical data. ""These changes in business practices give the company far greater ability to disclose the personal information of its users to its business partners than in the past,"" the privacy advocates said in a letter sent Thursday to the Federal Trade Commission. Other groups that endorsed the letter include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Digital Democracy and Consumer Action. ""Frictionless sharing creates several privacy and security problems for users,"" the letter added. Facebook fired back by saying its users can control who sees what. ""Some groups believe people shouldn't have the option to easily share the songs they are listening to or other content with their friends,"" Andrew Noyes, a company spokesman based in Washington, said by e-mail. ""We couldn't disagree more and have built a system that people can choose to use, and we hope people will give it a try. If not, they can simply continue listening and reading as they always have."" This week Spotify told its users, some of whom were disgruntled about what seemed like compulsory sharing, that it was ""entirely up to you what you decide to share and what you keep private."" But it added a new feature to its software that lets users ""hide their occasional guilty pleasures"" by temporarily switching to ""private listening"" mode. Part of Facebook's challenge is its very success. More than seven million apps and Web sites are ""integrated"" with Facebook. Several of those partner Web sites already allow people to log in with their Facebook user name and password, meaning that a Facebook identity becomes a kind of key that unlocks many other things. Some of Facebook's partners - Spotify, most famously - now insist that you log in only with your Facebook account. New users will no longer be able to create a Spotify-specific user name and password. The privacy groups' letter to the F.T.C. also cited a problem highlighted recentlyby an Australian blogger named Nik Cubrilovic: that Facebook had followed the movement of its users on the Web even after they had left the Facebook site. Facebook has since said its technology had inadvertently captured some personally identifiable information about logged-out users but had not stored it or used it to track them. As a matter of policy, the F.T.C. does not comment on whether it is investigating any company unless it has some results to release.   "
Finding the Unique in You to Build a Better Password,"Sophisticated hackers can now crack into an account in one second. Using automated password-cracking software, hackers can crack 1,000 accounts in 17 minutes, according to Imperva, a data security firm. That's hardly surprising when you stop to consider the passwords that stand in their way. Last July, Daniel Amitay, an iOS developer, wrote a creepy line of code that anonymously surveyed passwords for some 204,508 iPhones and found ""1234"" was by far the most common.  The runner-up: 0000. In Saturday's New York Times, my colleague Somini Sengupta reported about efforts by security researchers to supplement, and perhaps one day get rid of, the old-fashioned password. Their work is urgent. For now, hackers are still focused on computers. But as more people store sensitive data like bank account and credit card information on their smartphones, mobile devices are poised to become a magnet for hacks, security experts say. And with millions more smartphones making their way into consumer hands, technology companies and the government are beginning to second-guess the way we log on. ""It's an exciting time in authentication,"" said Brendon J. Wilson, an authentication researcher at Symantec, the computer security firm. ""There's a lot going on under the covers to figure out whether a person really is who they say they are."" In its recent forecast for 2012, I.B.M. predicts that we may never need a password again: ""Biometric data - facial definitions, retinal scans and voice files - will be composited through software to build your DNA unique online password,"" the company said in a blog post. Retina scan authentication for smartphones is not so far off. Dozens of police departments across the country already use a smartphone-based iris scanning technology made by B12 Technologies, a biometrics outfit based in Plymouth Mass., to match suspects with a criminal database. For now, privacy concerns and the iris scanning technology's $3,000 price tag has kept it from going mainstream. But biometric authentication is by no means foolproof. Google's new Android 4.0 software, the Ice Cream Sandwich, inadvertently exposed its vulnerabilities. Ice Cream Sandwich uses facial recognition technology to match users to their devices, but clever hackers have already found a way to unlock the phones using a photo. Likewise voice recognition can always be compromised if a hacker records a victim's voice and replays it for a machine. The most serious problem with biometrics, said Tal Be'ery, a senior Web researcher at Imperva, is that ""once your digital biometric signature is compromised, you cannot even replace it."" This may explain why the government is beginning to take a more behavioral approach to authentication. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, is developing ways to identify device owners and account holders using unique behaviors like hand gestures and typing styles. ""My house key will get you into my house, but the dog in my living room knows you're not me,"" Richard Guidorizzi, a Darpa program manager, stated in a press release. ""No amount of holding up my key and saying you're me is going to convince my dog you're who you say you are. My dog knows you don't look like me, smell like me or act like me. What we want out of this program is to find those things that are unique to you, and not some single aspect of computer security that an adversary can use to compromise your system."" Last week, Microsoft introduced a behavioral password system for its new Windows 8 operating system. Its so-called picture password has three parts. In addition to a usual password, Windows asks users to upload a personal photo and make three or more touch-screen gestures on top of it. Because smudges risk giving gestures away, Windows remembers not only where the user gestured but how they gestured. Which gesture did they make first? Did they move their finger left to right or right to left? Did they draw a circle clockwise or counter-clockwise? ""When the types, ordering and directionality are all correct, we take a look at how far off each gesture was from the ones we've seen before, and decide if it's close enough to authenticate you,"" Microsoft's product manager, Zach Pace, wrote in a blog post.  He said Microsoft's three-gesture password was as secure as a randomly generated six-digit PIN - and much easier to remember. Mr. Wilson of Symantec cautioned that every authentication system had its drawbacks. ""It's always best to use a number of authentication mechanisms,"" he said. ""Every single one of these solutions has its vulnerabilities."" An earlier version of this story incorrectly labeled the iris scanning technology from B12 Technologies.   "
The False Promise of Biometrics,"NEW DELHI - Earlier this month, just two days after my grandfather and I received a summons to register for India's national unique identification (UID) program, a sweeping initiative launched with much fanfare, a parliamentary committee ordered a review of the project, effectively freezing it.  When the UID program was created in 2009, the idea was to assign a unique 12-digit number to 200 million of India's poorest citizens based on their biometric information. The goal was to ensure that welfare entitlements would be delivered to their intended recipients rather than siphoned off by corrupt middlemen. The project was subsequently expanded to cover India's entire billion-plus population and serve as the basis for issuing cellphone connections and bank accounts.  But in its report calling for a review of the UID, the parliamentary committee noted that in the absence of a legal framework to collect and protect all that personal information, the database could be abused.  You might think that the freeze would come as a victory to those who have feared that the UID project would create a state-controlled panopticon under the guise of curbing corruption - except that the measure was suspended in favor of the National Population Register (NPR), an older effort to gather the same information that has far more questionable objectives.  The NPR has its roots in ""Operation Pushback,"" a 1992 government policy launched under pressure from xenophobic groups in order to identify and deport undocumented Bangladeshi immigrants from Delhi. It seeks to gather the biometric data of every single Indian citizen exclusively to assist law enforcement. The idea gained traction in 2003, while the right-wing Bhartiya Janta Party was in power.  The Indian government hopes to eventually integrate the UID and the NPR to create the world's largest biometric database. But it is unclear that either project can deliver on its promises, and both have the potential to do much harm. Lacking the documents to prove that they are entitled to government schemes, a large percentage of India's poor are currently forced to bribe officials to obtain benefits. Theoretically, the UID could fix this problem, but as the parliamentary review committee noted, there are hurdles.  The biometric identification of manual laborers fails in 15 percent of cases, for instance: it seems that working with your hands blurs your fingerprints. This means that a significant number of workers could find themselves locked out of their welfare accounts. UID officials have said that they expect contingency plans to address such failures as they occur, but in India, contingency plans have a way of becoming standard operating procedures that enable unscrupulous officials to subvert the system. Designed as a tool of inclusion, the UID could thus become a means of exclusion. The problems with the NPR are even worse. In 2003, the Delhi High Court tasked the city police with arresting and deporting at least 100 undocumented Bangladeshi immigrants every day. Officers started rounding up impoverished Bengali-speaking Muslims who couldn't furnish enough evidence of their Indianness. At least 40,000 individuals were deported between 2003 and 2006, according to government figures, and many of them, according to NGOs, were Indian citizens. If a malfunctioning UID could deny you entitlements, a missing entry in the NPR could get you deported. Proponents of the databases insist that technology can help make the Indian state more transparent and more accountable to its citizens. I am not convinced. Technology may eliminate certain kinds of corruption by reducing the potential for human interference in the disbursement of entitlements. But administrators will still wield inordinate power as the gatekeepers of these vast and opaque information banks.  Why put our biometrics, faith and freedom in the hands who those who have done little to gain our trust so far?   "
Sony Defends Security Actions,"Last Tuesday, Sony's top managers defended their response to the attack that forced them to shut down the PlayStation Network for almost a month. The network went back online on May 14, but some said the company's reaction to the attack was too slow.  In an interview at the company's New York offices, Howard Stringer, below, Sony's chief executive, argued that Sony had responded to the attack in a timely manner, and said that as executives learned about the extent of the attack, they regularly shared information with customers. When asked why Sony had waited almost a week to notify customers that personal information and credit card data had possibly been stolen in the attack, Mr. Stringer said, ''We reported quickly.'' Mr. Stringer said that the attack had been the largest of its kind on a company, and that ''we still have a lot of investigation to do to find out how this happened, but we're not there yet.'' Kazuo Hirai, Sony's corporate executive and executive vice president, joined the interview on a teleconference from Japan, saying that Sony had rebuilt its security network and added stronger defenses to its servers. He also said the company had created new managerial-level security positions. The responsibility of the people in those new jobs ''is to set up a system to avoid this type of event again -- putting a new system in place,'' Mr. Hirai said. Mr. Stringer said the attacks on Sony had prompted the company to strengthen security across all of its products. ''In every level of the company we are examining security,'' he said, ''from televisions to e-books, and onwards.'' The Sony attacks have inspired privacy advocates and members of Congress to push for new laws that would better protect personal information online. Mr. Stringer said he welcomed such laws. Sony was recently asked to have a representative testify before a Congressional subcommittee about the attacks but declined, saying that it was working with law enforcement to investigate the breach. When asked if the company would have a representative testify if asked again by lawmakers, Mr. Stringer said, ''We'll wait to see what Congress has to offer.'' NICK BILTON COMMENTI read about the breach on tech blogs before I received notification from Sony. That's a bit ridiculous. -- Neil, Haverhill, Mass., May 17  "
Lulz Security Says It Hacked News Corporation Sites,"7:18 p.m. | Updated  Adding more details of the attacks. 7:47 p.m. | Updated  Adding e-mail warning to News of the World staff members at the end. The hacking group Lulz Security claimed responsibility for planting a fake article about the death of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, on one of the company's Web sites Monday. The article appeared on a page at the site new-times.co.uk, which had apparently been used to inform readers about a new design for the site of The Times of London. It said Mr. Murdoch had died from a drug overdose. Mr. Murdoch's company is facing a sweeping scandal in Britain, set off by revelations that journalists at his newspapers hacked into voicemail accounts in search of news.  After posting the fake article, LulzSec apparently altered the Web site of The Sun, another Murdoch paper, so that it sent site visitors to the article. Soon after, the Sun site instead forwarded visitors to the LulzSec Twitter page. When News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation, posted what appeared to be a statement about the hacking of The Sun's site on its corporate site, those who tried to read the statement were also sent to the Twitter page. The sites of News International, The Sun and The Times were all unreachable later in the evening. LulzSec said last month that it was closing up shop and would discontinue a hacking spree, but the group seems to have reorganized and is now active again. The group has claimed responsibility for hacking a number of sites over the last two months, including those of PBS, the United States Senate, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the Web site of a company associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.     As the hacking was unfolding online, LulzSec said on its Twitter feed that it had gained access to News Corporation networks and taken internal e-mail. It said it planned to release more information in the coming days.        Members of Anonymous, another hacking group that is intertwined with Lulz Security, also chimed in and began posting Twitter messages with mobile phone numbers and e-mail passwords that it said belonged to editors at News of the World, the now-closed newspaper at the center of the hacking scandal. Former employees of News of the World received an e-mail late Monday in response to the attacks, warning them to change their e-mail passwords. Company representatives were not immediately available for comment.  "
Court Weighs Whether Corporations Have Personal Privacy Rights,"WASHINGTON -- The claim that corporations have personal privacy rights met with widespread skepticism on Wednesday during a lively Supreme Courtargument. A year ago, the court ruled in the Citizens United decision that corporations and unions had a First Amendment right to spend money in candidate elections. But that decision, which involved a question of constitutional law, did not come up at the argument on Wednesday, which considered the quite different issue of what Congress meant when it exempted some files from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The exemption at issue in the case, Federal Communications Commission v. AT&T Inc., No. 09-1279, protects information that ''could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''  AT&T invoked the exemption in seeking to block the release of documents it had provided to the F.C.C., which conducted an investigation into claims of overcharges by the company in a program to provide equipment and services to schools. The documents were sought by a trade association representing some of the company's competitors. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, had ruled for the company, relying in part on a definition of ''person'' in the law that included corporations. But several justices said it was too much of a leap to go from saying that corporations might be ''persons'' for some purposes to saying that their ''personal privacy'' could be invaded. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he could think of many instances ''where the adjective was very different from the root noun.'' ''You have craft and crafty,'' he said. ''Totally different. Crafty doesn't have much to do with craft. Squirrel, squirrelly. Right?'' ''Pastor and pastoral,'' he went on. ''Same root, totally different.'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether the fact that state, local and foreign government also fell under the statutory definition of persons meant that they, too, had personal privacy rights. Geoffrey M. Klineberg, a lawyer for AT&T, said yes. In 1981, Justice Antonin Scalia, then a law professor, told a Senate committee that the exemption did not apply to corporations. It was plain on Wednesday that the intervening years had not caused him to change his mind. ''Can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the personal privacy of a corporation?'' Justice Scalia asked Mr. Klineberg. ''Do you have any examples from The New York Times, from, you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to the interests of a corporation as the 'personal privacy' of General Motors?'' Mr. Klineberg said he was not aware of such a use of the phrase ''certainly in any statutory context.'' Justice Scalia offered the lawyer for the government, Anthony A. Yang, more help than he seemed to want, saying that exemptions in the freedom of information law should be read narrowly. Mr. Yang said he did not want to win on that ground, as the government often resists requests under the law. ''We do not embrace that principle,'' Mr. Yang said. ''Well,'' Justice Scalia responded, ''I'm not going to help the government's position if the government doesn't want to be helped.'' Mr. Klineberg said it would be a mistake to allow the law ''to be a tool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access to harmful or embarrassing documents'' that do not inform the public about the government's activities. For instance, he said, corporations have reputational interests in not having their disparaging remarks about regulators or customers disclosed to competitors. A ruling against AT&T, he said, could require disclosure of documents concerning, say, ''an environmental nonprofit organization talking about their political strategies for defeating an amendment to the Clean Air Act.'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer asked for real-world examples of such disclosures, and Mr. Klineberg said he was aware of none. Mr. Yang, seeming confident of victory, concluded his argument with a brief summary and sat down early. ''AT&T can provide no example of any problems that have arisen in over 35 years of the government's consistent administration of this provision,'' he said. ''In fact, all indications point in simply one direction. Personal privacy applies only to individuals.''  "
Justices' Ruling Is Wrapped in an English Lesson," WASHINGTON -- In a lively decision that relied as much on dictionaries, grammar and usage as it did on legal analysis, the Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled unanimously that corporations have no personal privacy rights for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act. AT&T, the plaintiff in the case, had sought to block the release of documents it had provided to the government. It argued that the documents should be withheld under an exemption to the law that applied to records that ''could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.''  The company's strongest argument was that the statutory definition of the noun ''person'' specifically included corporations and other entities. It followed, the company said, that the adjective ''personal'' must also apply to corporations. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the court, was having none of that. ''Adjectives typically reflect the meaning of corresponding nouns,'' he wrote, ''but not always.'' He gave examples. ''The noun 'crab' refers variously to a crustacean and a type of apple, while the related adjective 'crabbed' can refer to handwriting that is 'difficult to read,' '' he wrote, quoting a dictionary. '' 'Corny,''' he went on, ''has little to do with 'corn.' '' Chief Justice Roberts had used similar examples at the argument of the case in January. ''You have 'craft' and 'crafty','' he said. ''Totally different. 'Crafty' doesn't have much to do with 'craft.' 'Squirrel,' 'squirrelly.' Right?'' '' 'Pastor' and 'pastoral','' he continued. ''Same root, totally different.'' Common usage cut against AT&T's argument as well, the chief justice wrote in Tuesday's decision. ''We do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence, personal influence or personal tragedy as referring to corporations and other artificial entities,'' he wrote. ''Responding to a request for information, an individual might say, 'that's personal','' Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ''A company spokeswoman, when asked for information about the company, would not. ''In fact, we often use the word 'personal' to mean precisely the opposite of business-related: We speak of personal expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company's view.'' In addition to considering dictionary definitions for and the common usage of the word ''personal'' standing alone, Chief Justice Roberts said the word should also be considered in the context of the phrase ''personal privacy.'' Here, too, he said, ''AT&T's effort to attribute a special legal meaning to the word 'personal' in this particular context is wholly unpersuasive.'' ''Two words together may assume a more particular meaning than those words in isolation,'' he wrote, adding that ''personal privacy'' suggests ''a kind of privacy evocative of human concerns.'' The chief justice had examples here, too. ''We understand a golden cup to be a cup made of or resembling gold,'' he wrote. ''A golden boy, on the other hand, is one who is charming, lucky and talented. A golden opportunity is one not to be missed.'' In January 2010, the court ruled in the Citizens United decision that corporations have a First Amendment right to spend money in candidate elections. But that decision involved a question of constitutional law, while Tuesday's decision in AT&T v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 09-1279, considered only the meaning of a statute. AT&T had provided documents to the F.C.C. in connection with its investigation into claims of overcharges by the company in a program to provide equipment and services to schools. The documents were then sought by a trade association representing some of the company's competitors. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, had ruled for the company, saying that ''corporations, like human beings, face public embarrassment, harassment and stigma'' because of their involvement in law enforcement investigations. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in Tuesday's Supreme Court decision, having worked on it as United States solicitor general. The decision was otherwise comprehensively dismissive of AT&T's arguments, and Chief Justice Roberts could not resist a parting shot in ruling against the company ''We trust that AT&T will not take it personally,'' he wrote. Online Correction: March 1, 2011, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the title of John Roberts. He is chief justice of the United States, not chief justice of the Supreme Court.  "
"Question for Justices: If Privacy Act Is Violated, When Is the Government Liable?","WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Courtheard arguments on Wednesday in a case brought by a pilot whose H.I.V. status was disclosed in violation of a federal law that protects private information. The case involved, as a lower court judge put it, the collision of ''a good many laudable public policies,'' including ones ''to ensure the safety of the nation's airways, to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the Social Security system and to secure personal privacy of citizens.'' By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, though, it had boiled down to a single issue: What did Congress mean when it said people could sue for the ''actual damages'' suffered as a consequence of violations of the Privacy Act of 1974?  The question for the justices was whether that term referred only to monetary losses -- medical bills, say -- or also to emotional distress that did not give rise to out-of-pocket expenses. The plaintiff, Stanmore C. Cooper, a private pilot, conceded that he had not lost any money because one government agency told another that he was infected with H.I.V. But he said the disclosure had caused him acute emotional distress, including ''sleeplessness, loss of appetite, physical tension, agitation, isolation from friends and anxiety.'' Mr. Cooper's most vocal ally on the Supreme Court was Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who said Congress must have contemplated allowing suits for emotional distress since that is the kind of harm most characteristic of privacy violations. ''The person who is subject to this, to this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have out-of-pocket costs, but is terribly distressed, nervous, anxious, and all the rest,'' she said. Eric J. Feigin, a lawyer for the government, said the law should be read narrowly. The term ''actual damages'' is ambiguous, he said. But that ambiguity, he went on, should count in favor of the government under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which bars lawsuits for money against the government without its consent. Such consent must be specific, he said, and ambiguous consent is not consent. Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to embrace that argument. ''Once you establish that it isn't clear,'' he said of the statutory language, ''then you trigger the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity will not be considered to have any scope except that scope which is clear.'' Justice Scalia also questioned whether disclosures between government agencies should subject the government to lawsuits based on claims of emotional distress. A lawyer for Mr. Cooper, Raymond A. Cardozo, responded that the court's interpretation of the term ''actual damages'' will apply in all sorts of settings, including government attempts to silence whistleblowers by leaking information about them to the press. Mr. Cooper's case arose from an investigation by the Department of Transportation and the Social Security Administration called ''Operation Safe Pilot.'' It cross-referenced information held by government agencies concerning about 45,000 pilots in Northern California. The investigators discovered that in 1996 Mr. Cooper had applied for Social Security disability benefits, complaining of severe symptoms of H.I.V. infection. He received benefits for several months until his health improved. In the years that followed, Mr. Cooper failed to tell the Federal Aviation Administration about his H.I.V. status on a form that prospective pilots are required to complete. When the omissions were discovered, Mr. Cooper pleaded guilty to the crime of making false statements to the government, paying a $1,000 fine. Mr. Cooper then sued the government for violating the Privacy Act, which was enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandal. ''Congress passed this act to restore the citizens' faith in their government,'' Mr. Cardozo told the justices on Wednesday, ''and it made a solemn promise to the American citizens that in cases of intentional and willful violation, the United States shall be liable for actual damages. Today, the government is proposing that 'actual damages' be read in a way that renders this act virtually irrelevant. That makes a mockery of that solemn promise.'' Only eight members of the court heard the case, Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper, No. 10-1024. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate, presumably because she had worked on it as United States solicitor general.  "
Sony Changes Gaming Policy to Thwart Future Lawsuits,"Sony quietly updated its PlayStation Network terms of service agreement on Thursday, adding a new section that will prevent users from joining future class-action lawsuits against the company. The update, which has been titled ""Section 15,"" was buried in the company's 10,869-word agreement and was not publicly announced by Sony. The new section requires users to agree that they will not join any class-action suits against Sony in the future, and that if they do file a suit against the company, it will be done only on an individual basis. People who do not want to agree to the new section must send Sony a written letter in the next 30 days requesting not to be included in the agreement.  When asked why the company had added the new legal rule to the site and about its fairness, a Sony spokesman responded that the updated language was ""designed to benefit both the consumer and the company by ensuring that there is adequate time and procedures to resolve disputes."" Users on game forums and gaming blogs were not impressed by the company's decision to add the new class-action section, with many saying that they felt it benefited the company more than customers. Sony said in the update that the new terms of service agreement will cover only new class-action suits filed against the company; anything filed before Aug. 20, 2011, will not covered. Earlier this year Sony was subject to a number of lawsuits, include some class-action filings, after the PlayStation Network was attacked by hackers.   "
Deploying New Tools To Stop the Hackers,"Trying to secure a computer network is much like trying to secure a building -- the challenge is trying to screen out real threats without impeding the normal traffic that needs to go in and out. And as the recent hacking attacks against Citigroup, RSA Security and Lockheed Martin show, even sophisticated security systems can be breached. ''We're seeing an inflection point where the attackers are extremely smart, and they are using completely new techniques,'' said Nir Zuk, the chief technology officer at Palo Alto Networks, a firewall company based in Santa Clara, Calif. ''Every piece of content that you receive can attack you.'' Historically, the first line of computer defense, the firewall, is like the guard desk at a building. It scrutinizes the traffic going in and out of the system, looking for obviously suspicious characters.  Virtually every company also has antivirus software, which typically keeps an eye out for anything on a ''black list'' of well-known malware and prevents it from entering the computer system or causing havoc once inside. A more rare type of security grants access only to programs on a ''white list'' of safe software-- the equivalent of allowing employees with ID cards to come and go as they please but preventing anyone else from entering. But as hackers unleash ever-sneakier attacks, big corporations and government agencies are scrambling to deploy new tools and procedures to deal with all the delicate gray areas in between -- the cool-looking new smartphone app, the funny Facebook link, the unknown foreign Web site. The flood of malicious software is also prompting renewed debate over how to balance access and protection. ''Right now, if an application is not known, we let it run,'' said Peter Firstbrook, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm, referring to the prevailing view in most companies. ''That's the wrong thing to do.'' Companies like Symantec, the giant Internet security firm, are introducing services that assess the ''reputation'' of software, weighing factors like how old it is and how widely it is used to decide if it is safe. Other vendors are selling enhanced firewalls and products that can sniff out impersonators by detecting unusual file-usage patterns. Nearly everyone agrees that a mix of defenses is vital, and that even so, some hackers will still slip through. Experts also say that the proliferation of smartphones, the growing workplace use of Facebook and other social media tools, and the shift toward storing more data in a computing cloud are providing new avenues for attackers. Symantec's chief executive, Enrique Salem, acknowledged at a conference in February that traditional antivirus scans ''long ago failed to keep up.'' As points of entry into corporate and government networks ''proliferate on this seemingly insane trajectory,'' he added, ''so do the threats they attract.'' The growth in malicious software has been staggering, as criminal organizations seek to ferret out credit card numbers and other ways to make money and hackers in China and Russia are believed to be seeking national security secrets. Last year, Symantec discovered 286 million new and unique threats from malicious software, or about nine per second, up from 240 million in 2009. The company said that the amount of harmful software in the world passed the amount of beneficial software in 2007, and as many as one of every 10 downloads from the Web includes harmful programs. Unlike past blitzes of spam with clunky sales pitches, today's attacks often rely on a familiar face and are extremely difficult to stop. In a practice known as spear phishing, hackers send e-mails that seem to come from co-workers or friends and include attachments that can release malware to steal passwords and other sensitive data. In other cases, malware can be activated when a Web link is clicked. Some security experts say companies can better protect themselves against such attacks by expanding the use of ''white lists,'' which are currently in place in only 10 to 20 percent of the computers in large organizations. Bit9, a Massachusetts company that offers such a white-list service, says it has millions of approved applications in its registry. Federal agencies, retailers, Wall Street firms and technology companies use its real-time monitoring services, which can be set to block unknown software or simply issue alerts about it. Harry Sverdlove, Bit9's chief technology officer, said its monitoring system stopped an attack on a national defense laboratory in March that was almost identical to the hacking that month at RSA Security, which eventually compromised the electronic security tokens that RSA sells to Lockheed and other corporations around the world. Mr. Sverdlove said the attack on the lab came via an e-mail attachment with a heading implying that it was from the human resources department. He said a malicious file was embedded in the attachment, but the monitoring system stopped it when it noticed unauthorized activity. Another strategy used to deflect attacks is to rate software based on its reputation. The technique, championed by Symantec, is supposed to be more flexible than strict white or black lists. Symantec's strategy is to rate software based on a number of factors including the file's age and source. The company also checks data it collects from users about the kind of software they have on their computers. Software used by 100,000 people is more likely to be good, while a file that no one else has is more likely to be bad. ''You probably don't want to be the guinea pig,'' said Carey Nachenberg, a fellow with Symantec. Reputational technology is available in Symantec's consumer products and will be deployed for corporate customers sometime later this year. The software, when used in conjunction with other techniques like black lists and monitoring for unusual activity, is 99 percent effective, Mr. Nachenberg said. But security vendors like Mr. Zuk of Palo Alto Networks say that in real life, people are being bombarded with all kinds of links, and a security threat can be hidden in any one of them. ''It's about clicking on a link or a presentation about how to improve your golf play,'' he said. New security technology should protect against all sources of malicious files, whether they come in by old-fashioned e-mail, a LinkedIn feed or a Twitter link, Mr. Zuk said. He said stronger firewalls, which monitor computer networks for suspicious traffic, could also help. Security experts say companies must also adapt their security systems to protect against attacks through smartphones and tablet computers. Although such mobile devices increase convenience for workers, they essentially a create a new door into the network, which then needs its own security watchdogs. Mr. Firstbrook, the Gartner analyst, said that devices that run Google's Android software, which is open to all applications, were riskier than Apple iPhones and iPads, in which every application is screened by the company before it is allowed into the App Store. And humans remain a prime weakness in all computer networks that no security system can completely offset, said Mark Hatton, chief executive of Core Security Technologies, a company based in Boston that tests corporate networks for security holes. ''You tell the guy not to click on the link to the free iPad, and he still always clicks on the link to the free iPad,'' he said.  "
"Saying It's Disbanding, Hacker Group Urges New Cyberattacks","Facing increasing pressure from law enforcement agencies over its brazen computer attacks, the small group of hackers known as Lulz Security announced over the weekend that it would disband. But security experts said on Sunday that the dissolution of the group might not signal an end to the attacks, which have hit dozens of Web sites, including those of prominent targets like the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States Senate, the Arizona state police and Sony. Indeed, in its farewell message posted on Saturday, the group, also known as LulzSec, urged other hackers to join the ''revolution'' aimed at governments and corporations that it started recently with Anonymous, a much larger collective of politically minded hackers from which many of the LulzSec members sprung.  ''It looks like these sort of 'hacktivist' ideas are spreading and gaining popularity,'' said Dino A. Dai Zovi, a prominent independent security consultant. He said that LulzSec appeared to be trying to inspire others to join a sprawling, if fragmented, array of local groups, which could feed more attacks. In recent weeks, LulzSec has become a target itself, as global law enforcement authorities and rival hackers have gone after the group. One man associated with LulzSec, Ryan Cleary, was arrested last week in Britain. Meanwhile, a growing assemblage of rival hackers has been working to unmask the core half-dozen LulzSec members and feed information on them to the authorities. American officials on Sunday characterized the attacks carried out by LulzSec as ''nuisances'' rather than real security threats. One government official said that LulzSec had never penetrated government servers or stolen any classified information. ''What we are really worried about is people getting access to our systems, or putting malware on it,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official said that even though it was possible that LulzSec had disbanded, hackers tended to operate in a world of shifting alliances and it would be easy for a new group copying LulzSec's techniques to appear in the future. ''All it takes is one guy in his basement to do this, not an organized group,'' the official said. On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security plans to introduce a system to help institutions eliminate common programming errors that allow hackers to easily infiltrate databases and steal user names and passwords. The agency's hope is that the program, which is voluntary, will make it easier for companies and agencies to better secure their corners of the Internet, thus contributing to a safer global network. Some security experts and hackers were skeptical of LulzSec's sudden about-face and said they believed the group intended to continue its activities. The latest announcement could be just another ploy for attention, rival hackers said on Twitter and on private online message boards. Over the last several weeks, LulzSec had said repeatedly on its Twitter feed that it planned to continue attacking governments and financial institutions indefinitely. Members of LulzSec did not respond to phone calls and e-mails on Sunday. Whatever happens to LulzSec, the brash and public brand of hacking that it embraced and defined may be here to stay, some experts say. The group's attacks on prominent targets, accompanied by raucous bragging on social networks and chat rooms, helped it amass more than 280,000 followers on Twitter. It has used that megaphone, as well as chat rooms, to try to recruit more hackers to its ranks. Some of LulzSec's activities had a political tinge. For example, it said its theft and public disclosure of Arizona law enforcement records was in response to the state's tough laws aimed at illegal immigrants. But the group claimed that its hacking was primarily a celebration of the ''lulz,'' or laughs, and the members seemed to lap up the media attention they generated. But if LulzSec had continued, it would have faced an increasing risk that its members would be captured, said Chris Wysopal, the chief technology officer of the security firm Veracode. ''By stopping now and regrouping, I think they will live to hack another day,'' he said. ''If anything, there will be more people hacking in their footsteps.'' Mr. Wysopal added, ''Until they're arrested -- if they ever do get arrested -- I don't think anything will slow down.'' The recent flurry of hacking done for notoriety rather than financial gain ''feels like a kind of return to a period in the past,'' said Gabriella Coleman, an assistant professor at New York University who is studying groups like LulzSec and Anonymous. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of hacker groups brazenly attacked some major institutions. That wave was largely squelched after a crackdown in which well-known hackers, including Kevin Mitnick, were caught and given heavy punishments, Ms. Coleman said. After that, hackers began working more quietly, and many joined the security industry, where there was a safer place to employ their skills. Meanwhile, organized crime began moving online, following the money that was flowing through Web-based commerce and banking systems. The return of more public hacking has been inspired by WikiLeaks, whose disclosure of reams of United States government documents showed hackers and the computer adept that they could use their skills to participate in a new way in the public sphere, Ms. Coleman said. That notion was fed by Anonymous, a large collective of online hackers that opposed the Church of Scientology, championed freedom on the Internet and came to the defense of WikiLeaks by attacking the Web sites of companies like MasterCard and PayPal, which had refused to process donations to WikiLeaks after it disclosed confidential diplomatic cables. More recently, Anonymous has gotten behind an array of international political causes, from the democratic uprisings in the Middle East to anticorruption protests in India. LulzSec began as a splinter group from Anonymous, and LulzSec's members now seem to be focusing on operating through that larger network. To judge from purported discussions between LulzSec members that were posted online by a rival hacker known as the Jester, the internal operations of LulzSec seem as chaotic as the anarchistic behavior online. The messages show continual infighting among group members as pressure from law enforcement agencies has increased, and some members have reportedly quit. But publicly, LulzSec insisted that its 50 days of online pandemonium had come to an end, its members would continue attacks on governments and corporations, either as part of a different group or acting individually. Perhaps to win allies, it called the new effort ''AntiSec'' in an apparent effort to tap an older, similarly named movement among malicious hackers known as ''black hats'' that opposed working cooperatively with software makers and the security industry to fix security vulnerabilities.  "
Sony Struggling With Online Attack and a TV Defect,"TOKYO -- Sony said Wednesday that it had locked almost 100,000 user accounts on its PlayStation Network and other online services after detecting a spike in unauthorized log-in attempts. It was the latest in a series of online attacks on the company that have threatened to undermine user confidence in its Web-based offerings. Also Wednesday, Sony said it had discovered defective parts used in 1.6 million Bravia flat-panel televisions that could cause the televisions to melt. The company is offering free repairs worldwide.  The Bravia defect is a blow to Sony's struggling television business, which has long prided itself on quality while trying to keep up with lower-cost rivals. In a statement Wednesday, Sony said it suspected that hackers had obtained log-in data from other Web sites or sources and used those to try to gain access to Sony accounts. Access was thought to have been gained to only a handful of accounts, and no credit card or other sensitive data was stolen, Sony said. The hackers appear to have tried to log in to Sony's networks between Friday and Monday, the company said. Because many Web users use the same names and passwords for many sites and services, about 93,000 combinations matched. The company detected an unusual number of log-in attempts from particular Internet protocol addresses and decided to freeze the accounts involved. Sony has e-mailed account owners to notify them of a possible breach and to ask them to reset their passwords. ''We were able to move swiftly, and we believe very few accounts were actually accessed,'' said Satoshi Fukuoka, a spokesman for Sony. The company was stepping up its vigilance against similar attacks, Mr. Fukuoka said, but he also urged users to make a habit of changing their passwords frequently for Sony and other online services. New trouble at Sony's electronics and entertainment divisions adds to problems for the Japanese technology leader. Sony has been contending with heightened competition from nimbler rivals, as well as a punishingly strong yen that has eroded its competitive edge and profitability in important overseas markets. Sony, the largest Japanese exporter of consumer electronics, had to halt work at six plants after the earthquake and tsunami that struck northeastern Japan in March. In July, Sony cut its forecast for annual profit 25 percent to 60 billion yen ($782 million), after sinking to a first-quarter loss of 15.5 billion yen. The attack follows a large data breach starting in April that compromised data for more than 100 million online game and entertainment accounts, including credit card information, and forced Sony to shut down the PlayStation Network. It took Sony more than two months to fully restore the network, and its slow handling of the breach led to widespread criticism of its online security. The company has since promised to overhaul its Web defenses and created the position of chief information security officer. Sony said that the latest attacks -- which targeted the PlayStation Network and other online services offering digital content -- did not suggest a security weakness on its part. Sony has been eager to expand its network offerings to combine its gadgets better with content from its movie, music and video game businesses. The PlayStation Network allows users to download video games onto Sony game consoles, while the Sony Entertainment Network offers music and movies for a range of Sony products, including its Bravia televisions, Xperia smartphones and Sony Tablets. But in the online sphere, Sony has fallen behind Apple, whose iTunes and App Store services have helped increase sales of both content, like music and games, and gadgets, like iPhones and iPads. In June, Apple said there were 225 million registered iTunes and App Store accounts, compared with a combined 138 million accounts on Sony's main online entertainment networks. Meanwhile, the defective parts discovered in Sony's televisions affect 1.6 million liquid-crystal-display units, the company said in a separate statement. A defect in an inverter transformer used for LCD backlights could cause overheating, smoke and melting parts, it said. The company said it would repair the Bravia sets worldwide, including 400,000 TVs in North America, 600,000 in Europe and 189,000 in Japan. It might also announce further repair programs for other markets, Sony said. Sony, which has lost money on TVs for seven consecutive years, said in August that it was preparing to overhaul the business to reduce costs and compete better against rivals, including Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the market leader. A push into 3-D TVs, as well as Internet-ready models developed with Google, have failed to stem Sony's slide in global market share, which stood at 11.7 percent in the second quarter of 2011, according to DisplaySearch.  "
Lockheed Strengthens Network Security After Hacker Attack,"Lockheed Martin said on Sunday that it had stepped up its investigation into a sophisticated hacking attack on its computer networks and bolstered security measures for gaining remote access to its systems.  Lockheed and RSA Security, which supplies coded access tokens to millions of corporate users and government officials, said they were still trying to determine whether the attack had relied on any data that hackers had stolen from RSA in March or if it had exploited another weakness. Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., said on Saturday night that the attack, which occurred on May 21, was ''significant and tenacious.'' Lockheed officials said they had stopped the attack shortly after hackers got into a system, adding that no customer or company data was compromised. Sondra Barbour, Lockheed's chief information officer, sent a memo to the company's employees on Sunday, saying that its systems remained secure. She said Lockheed had quickly shut down remote access to its network after the attack began. Still, the attack was significant enough that it was described in briefing materials provided to President Obama, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said on Sunday. He said the damage was ''fairly minimal.'' Government officials have said Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, and other military companies face frequent attacks from hackers seeking national security data. Officials at Lockheed and RSA Security, a division of the EMC Corporation that provides the SecurID brand of electronic access tokens, said they were working with federal officials to investigate how the attack occurred and who was behind it. Ms. Barbour said Lockheed also had accelerated a plan to increase network security. The company has upgraded the SecurID tokens supplied by RSA and is resetting all user passwords. Lockheed also switched to eight-digit access codes from four-digit codes, which are randomly generated by the tokens. Lockheed officials said on Friday that the attack on its systems might have been linked to one on the RSA network in March. At the time, RSA said it had sustained a data breach that could have compromised some of its security products. Its announcement shocked computer security experts, particularly because its systems are widely used. Shortly after RSA announced that breach, Lockheed, like many other large companies, said it had added an additional password to the process employees used to connect to its system from remote locations. One Lockheed executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security issues, said on Sunday that investigators ''cannot rule out'' a connection between the attacks on the RSA and Lockheed networks. EMC said in a statement on Sunday that it was ''premature to speculate'' on the cause of the Lockheed attack. Some blog items and articles have suggested that customers would back away from using RSA's SecurID tokens. But Lockheed said it planned to continue using them, and EMC said it remained confident in the tokens.  "
U.S. Guidelines Aim to Bolster Software Security,"The Homeland Security Department unveiled a new system of guidance on Monday intended to help make the software behind Web sites, power grids and other services less susceptible to hacking. The system includes an updated list of the top 25 programming errors that enable today's most serious hacks. It adds new tools to help software programmers eliminate the most dangerous types of mistakes and enable organizations to demand and buy more secure products. The effort to improve software security has been three years in the making, according to Robert A. Martin, principal engineer at Mitre, a technology nonprofit organization that conducts federal research in systems engineering.  The costs of flaws or omissions that make software susceptible to attack was highlighted by a number of recent attacks that resulted in the theft of credit card information, user names and passwords from government and banking sites. During an online news conference, government officials pointed out that a wide range of stakeholders had an interest in seeing the top 25 errors addressed, and they stressed the need for better training and education for people writing software. Officials also noted that organizations are under ''persistent'' attack. The Homeland Security Department's hope is that the program, which is voluntary, will make it easier for companies and agencies to better secure their corners of cyberspace and contribute to building safer global networks. ''We're going after root cause issues,'' said a senior department official, who declined to be named because he was speaking before the announcement had been made. ''You can make your enterprise more resilient from the people who would attack you.'' The guidance could spur a long-awaited shift in the technology industry's approach to computer security, which puts software security at the heart, in the place of network security, said Jeremiah Grossman, chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, a firm that helps companies secure their Web sites. Many organizations do not recognize that software security should be the focus, he said, ''which is why you see the bulk of the security dollars spent on defense flowing to firewall and antivirus products, and precisely why the current wave of breaches keep happening.'' Alan Paller, director of research at the SANS Institute, a nonprofit research and education organization, emphasized during the presentation on Monday that it was a ''first step'' and much work still needed to be done, especially with training. The top 25 list was created by SANS and Mitre with the help of top software security experts in the United States and Europe. It includes programming errors that have been used in a number of recent hacking attacks. No. 1 on the list is a programming mistake that allows so-called SQL-injection attacks on Web sites, which were successfully used by the hacker group LulzSec. That group was able to use the flaws to cause databases to spit out user names and passwords from Web sites, including one associated with the F.B.I.'s InfraGard program and NATO's online bookstore. The list also warns about the type of error that allowed hackers to steal several hundred thousand credit card numbers from a Citigroup site recently. The guidance framework will include ''vignettes'' for industries like e-commerce, banking and manufacturing, and will highlight for them which programming errors are of greatest concern in the types of technologies they use. Companies that make tools to test software for dangerous programming mistakes are already beginning to incorporate the framework into their products, Mr. Paller said before the presentation. And eventually there will be services that help businesses evaluate whether the software they are considering has stood up to scrutiny. Avoiding common programming mistakes is vital to fending off today's worst attacks, Mr. Paller said. ''This is the only way to get around 'zero days,' '' he said, referring to attacks that make use of software vulnerabilities that are unknown and, therefore, cannot be fixed quickly with patches. ''The only possible defense is to stop the error from being in the software in the first place.''  "
An Infection That Produces A Glazed Look,"WORM The First Digital World War By Mark Bowden 245 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $25. Mark Bowden's ''Worm'' is about the potentially diabolical piece of computer malware known as Conficker and the efforts of cybersecurity experts to hunt it down. This book is also about its author's efforts to tell the Conficker story in both technical terms and common parlance. The hype is easy: ''Worm'' can toss around alarmist terms like ''Cybarmageddon'' and ''digital Pearl Harbor'' to convey a sufficient sense of catastrophic threat. But ''Worm'' also needs chapters with titles like ''MS08-067'' and ''Remote Thread Injection'' to explain what the Conficker scare has really been about.  Mr. Bowden, the author of such muscular nonfiction narratives as ''Black Hawk Down'' and ''Guests of the Ayatollah,'' writes about technology issues as a semi-civilian. He sounds more like a generalist who has armed himself with research than a natural cybergeek. (He cites science-fiction classics, fascinatingly obscure data and one actual techie poem in which ''poor little Conficker'' is a character.) In any case, he begins his book with an effort to explain the basics of worm warfare, acknowledging that this is an uphill battle. ''The Glaze,'' the blank look encountered by technology experts trying to explain themselves to amateurs (translation: ''Look, dude, spare me the details, just fix it!''), captures the general Web user's command of Internet problems. The Glaze notwithstanding, ''Worm'' runs through the basics of computer viruses and worms. It explains the computer-code ''robots,'' or ''bots,'' that can be made to infiltrate and link large networks of unsuspecting computers. And it illustrates why strategically well-placed bots can be used as weapons. But ''those who specialize in cybersecurity face a wall of incomprehension and disbelief when they sound an alarm,'' Mr. Bowden writes. ''It is as if this dangerous weapon pointed at the vitals of the digital world is something only they can see.'' Conficker had an Internet protocol address from Argentina, but could have originated anywhere. It reflected close familiarity with encryption codes developed at M.I.T. It started small in 2008, attacking 250 new computers a day, only to connect from one to another at rapid speed. It was quickly able to expand 179,000 unique addresses into 83 million possible contacts. Its long-range purpose remained unknown. ''Worm'' also ticks off a kind of Golden Oldies list of Conficker's antecedents -- Gimmiv, Creeper, Bagle and Melissa, which was named for a hacker's favorite lap dancer -- to set the stage for its evil wizardry. Conficker invaded computers in a particularly sneaky way and appeared to use very little bandwidth, making it even harder to detect. ''When Conficker debuted on Nov. 20, 2008, it stood on the shoulders of two decades of research and development, trial and error,'' Mr. Bowden writes. ''It was as much a product of evolution as anything in nature.'' This is about as far as ''Worm'' gets into the engineering of Conficker. Instead of digging deeper, Mr. Bowden switches gears and turns it into a much broader book. He introduces a group of experts who, despite the unstructured nature of the Internet and the absence of a strong federal government effort to regulate it, banded together ad hoc to fight a potential terrorist threat. (A note on copy-editing: spelling the first name of the president of the United States ''Barrack'' does not increase the credibility of anti-government complaints.) ''Worm'' also takes a flying leap into the world of Marvel Comics. ''The white hats in this struggle were locked in the old and eternal battle of good versus evil, Satan versus God,'' Mr. Bowden writes, apparently in all seriousness. ''Game on.'' The participants in the anti-Conficker effort may or may not have seen themselves as caped superheroes. But Mr. Bowden had access to them, which is one of the book's selling points. And they had him to supply the theatrics. ''They went about their day jobs as unassuming techies, men whose conversation was guaranteed to produce the Glaze,'' he writes, ''but out here in the cyberworld they were nothing less than the Anointed, the Guardians, the Special Ones .... '' And on and on. Readers may sympathize with Mr. Bowden's writerly predicament. Among the real-world events he was describing was a meeting at a Holiday Inn where members of what came to be known as the Conficker Cabal sat at tables arranged in a horseshoe, ''covered with starched white linen, with bowls of hard candy set at intervals.'' The fantasy realm looks good by comparison. And some important steps toward thwarting Conficker were relatively pedestrian. The worm hit a vast number of domain names; did the security experts need to purchase all those names to protect them? One man's birthday was almost ruined by the news that Conficker had expanded its reach and become something even worse. But the biggest problem that ''Worm'' faces is that Conficker did not (or has not yet) fulfilled the worm-fighters' most creative doomsday fantasies. They still aren't sure what it has accomplished or what precedents it has secretly established. So the book's main drama takes the form of intramural e-mail squabbling among cabal members. Some of it is reprinted here. ''Rick's a very bright guy, smarter than me, but also perhaps a little more prone to getting into fights in bars than I am,'' one wrote. And another: ''Dude, do you know what your boy is doing?'' And, even more relevantly to the disappointing slightness of ''Worm'': ''Be clear, post some statistics or shut up.''  "
China's Party Newspaper Belittles Google's Hacking Claim,"BEIJING -- China's official Communist Party newspaper issued a caustic response on Monday to Google's charge that Chinese hackers had taken aim at influential users of its Gmail service, calling the accusations ''political gaming'' aimed at fomenting new discord between the Beijing and Washington governments. The newspaper, People's Daily, published a front-page editorial in Monday's international editions that also suggested that Google's actions could cost it credibility in the business world.  ''Many international bystanders believe that Google's charge is thickly tainted with political colors, and one can't dismiss the fact that Google is taking advantage and provoking new Sino-American Internet security disputes with sinister intentions,'' the editorial stated. ''Today's Google really makes one wring one's hands. What was once a model of leading Internet innovation has now become a political tool for slandering other countries.'' ''Once the international winds change,'' the editorial later added, ''Google might become a political sacrifice and might be discarded by the market.'' Google declined to officially comment on the editorial, but a spokesman responded to the article's headline: ''Google, What Do You Want?'' What Google wanted, he said, was to protect its users and help them stay safe online, which is why it went public with the hacking allegations. ''We think users should be aware of this disturbing campaign,'' he said. Google officials had said last Wednesday that hackers in Jinan, a coastal city in eastern China's Shandong Province, had sought to gain access to the Gmail accounts of hundreds of American government officials, Chinese political activists, military personnel, journalists and Asian officials. The attacks used a polished version of a rudimentary technique, called spear phishing, to trick recipients into revealing their e-mail passwords. American officials said they had no evidence that any confidential information was breached, or even that many people fell for the attack. In January 2010, Google tied hackers in the same city to a more sophisticated and wide-ranging assault on its computer systems. The company has not suggested that the Chinese government was behind those attacks, though speculation to that effect has been widespread, particularly since the company's services have been plagued with unexplained disruptions. In the days after Google's latest accusation, Chinese users of Gmail and the popular Google Maps service have seen connections slow to a crawl, while the same services used through private networks have remained trouble-free. Chinese officials have attributed Google's service problems to technical issues that do not involve the government, and they have denied any government role in hacking Google computers or e-mail accounts. On Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson called hacking a criminal activity and said that China also suffered attacks by hackers. Google has lost significant share of the market over the last few years, as it suffered both hacking attacks and government censorship of its Web searches. The company moved its search operations last year to uncensored servers in Hong Kong. After commanding more than a third of China's market for online searches in 2009, Google saw its share decline by the first three months of 2011 to 19.2 percent, a 2 percent drop from the last quarter of 2010, according to the Chinese research firm Analysys International. The biggest beneficiary of Google's losses appeared to be Baidu, a Chinese Internet portal. China's state-owned mobile-telecommunications companies also have dropped Google's mobile search service for competing products. Google nevertheless has said that its revenues from mainland China operations are increasing year over year. The company considers its biggest opportunity in China to be display advertising and selling ads to Chinese companies that appear on Web sites outside China. The company has more than 500 employees in China and hundreds of business partners.  "
China State TV Deletes Video Implying Hacking of Western Sites,"BEIJING -- The main Chinese state television network has deleted from the Internet a video that some foreign military and Internet security analysts say implies China has engaged in hacking attacks on Web sites in the West.  The video was the July 16 episode of a program on China Central Television 7 called ''Military Science and Technology.'' The episode, called ''The Internet Storm is Coming,'' was about cyberwarfare. This week Western analysts began publicly scrutinizing a sequence that a narrator on the program says shows ''many Internet attack methods.'' There is then a demonstration of one method: on the screen, what appears to be a human-operated cursor chooses a target Web site address, then hits a button that says ''attack.'' Using a software application on screen, the cursor chooses a target Web site under a pull-down menu for ''Falun Gong Web sites in North America.'' Falun Gong is a spiritual group that underwent persecution in the late 1990s in China and is now outlawed in the country. In the CCTV program, the cursor selects an IP address of 138.26.72.17 as a target. It is a defunct IP address at the University of Alabama. But a screenshot of the page linked to that address that was archived on the Internet in 2000 shows an informational page associated with the Falun Gong. It is unclear who set up the page. An online article published on China SignPost on Wednesday by two military analysts, Andrew Erickson and Gabe Collins, said there were questions as to whether the television program was using a mock-up to demonstrate cyberwarfare, or whether it revealed real hacking software and an actual attack. The technology shown was at least a decade old, the authors wrote. But ''it is significant that an official Chinese state television channel showed even a symbolic representation of a cyberattack, particularly one on entities clearly located in a foreign sovereign nation,'' they wrote. Chinese officials deny repeated assertions by foreign Web security experts and foreign governments that China is the source for many prominent and ambitious attacks. The discussion among Western analysts over the July 16 episode and its significance began this week when links to screenshots of the episode circulated on the Internet. By Friday, a video of that episode had been removed from a CCTV Web site that still has other recent episodes of ''Military Science and Technology.'' CCTV has declined to comment. There has been at least one notable example of the network's using fake footage in a report on the military: In January, it tried to pass off a scene of a fighter jet getting blown to bits in the 1986 movie ''Top Gun'' as images of a military training exercise done by the People's Liberation Army.

Israel Denies Hackers Knocked Government Sites Offline,"Several Israeli government Web sites, including those of the country's military and security services, crashed on Sunday, just hours after a statement issued in the name of the hackers who call themselves Anonymous had threatened to target the country in retaliation for its blockade of Gaza. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Israel's prime minister who communicates with Arab media organizations, insisted on Sunday that the Web sites had gone offline ""because of a server malfunction, not as a result of a cyberattack."" Mr. Gendelman added on Monday, ""All of the Israeli government Web sites which were down yesterday are now back up.""  As the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported, a government department responsible for managing the official sites said in a statement: ""A thorough investigation was conducted and the source of the malfunction was found to be I.B.M.-manufactured storage component."" The department which oversees Israel's ""E-Government Project"" added that the problem had been resolved during Sunday night. I.B.M. refused to comment on Monday. Barrett Brown, who has spoken to the news media on behalf of Anonymous, said Monday that members of the group had carried out ""a planned attack"" on the Web sites in question. He said he did not have any direct evidence that the attack had brought down the sites, but called the Israeli government's claim of a coincidental hardware failure ""absurd."" Nitzan Miron, a former member of the Israeli military's cybersecurity division, told The Guardian that a hardware failure was possible, since all of the Web sites were run from a single data center, which made it possible for ""a chain reaction"" to knock them all offline at once without a cyberattack. He added that it was ""just the front-end sites"" for the security services Shin Bet and Mossad, which crashed and those contain no ""actual classified information."" Anonymous is a deliberately leaderless and nebulous group -- its only criterion for membership is to claim membership -- so it can be hard to say which threats are credible. Its operations against organizations that it feels are unjust sometimes feature significant numbers of motivated activists in determined attacks, but on other occasions are nothing more than a handful of people agitating on social networking sites like Twitter and YouTube.  When the freewheeling online campaign movement starts its attacks using specialized software and thousands of volunteers, it can overwhelm the public Web sites of its targets. Previous attacks have crashed the Web sites of financial companies and government institutions. The video message threatening Israel was uploaded to YouTube on Friday and announced on a new Twitter account, @AnonymousMMV, set up later the same day. Unlike other Twitter accounts established in the group's name, which have posted thousands of messages to tens of thousands of followers, the new account has released just 17 messages to 117 followers since Friday.  The video statement warned that the hackers would retaliate against Israel for stopping two Gaza-bound ships that sought to challenge a blockade of the Palestinian territory last week. The message called Israel's blockade ""illegal"" and said that the interception of the boats was ""against democracy, human rights, international and maritime laws."" It also made reference to a deadly commando raid on another Gaza-bound flotilla, last May, which left nine activists dead. Anonymous, the statement said, would ""strike back, again and again, until you stop."" Like the Twitter account that announced it, the YouTube channel the video was uploaded to is also new. It was set up last month, and contains just one previous video -- another statement in the group's name claiming that ""rumors of an impending attack on Facebook by Anonymous"" were false. Slim Amamou, a Tunisian Internet activist who has supported Anonymous campaigns in the past, appeared to hail the operation on Twitter. But a chat Web site named ""OpIsrael,"" of the type that Anonymous often uses to plan such operations, was closed on Monday.  Israel promotes itself as a particularly wired society, but its range of government Web sites are frequent targets for attack by opponents of the state. According to Haaretz, Israel's defense ministry Web site is subjected to 80,000 attacks a day.    "
Security Firm Sees Global Cyberspying,"SHANGHAI -- An American cybersecurity company issued a report on Wednesday saying that it had identified a single perpetrator of cyberattacks that lasted up to five years on a wide range of governments, American corporations and even United Nations groups, and that the pattern of targets suggested the attacker was a ''state actor.'' However, as with a number of other alarming recent reports on computer spying, the study offered few details that would allow independent verification, and it was difficult to immediately assess the damage done. It did not identify the location of the attacking computer system, say what kinds of documents or information were stolen, or offer any direct evidence of a state's involvement.  The company, McAfee, said it had identified 72 targets -- 49 of them American, including 14 federal, state and county agencies and 11 defense contractors -- and also informed law enforcement agencies, which it said were investigating. The White House referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security. At a news conference on other matters, that department's secretary, Janet Napolitano, said: ''We became aware of the McAfee report, I think, today, which is when it was released to the press, as well. We obviously will evaluate it, look at it and pursue what needs to be pursued in terms of its contents.'' One of the few named organizations, the World Anti-Doping Agency, cast doubt on the report's assertion that the agency had been subject to a 14-month attack that began in August 2009. In a statement, the director general, David Howman, acknowledged that the agency had experienced an e-mail breach in February 2008, but that ''at this stage, W.A.D.A. has no evidence from its security experts of the intrusions as listed by McAfee and the agency has yet to be convinced that they took place.'' McAfee, which was recently acquired by Intel, said it released the report to coincide with the start on Wednesday of the annual Black Hat technical security conference in Las Vegas. Briefings were scheduled to be delivered at the conference. Details of the study were first published on the Web site of Vanity Fair. Asked why McAfee decided not to identify most of the corporations that were targets in the attacks, the company said that the corporations were worried about being identified and alarming shareholders or customers. Cybersecurity is now a major international concern, with hackers gaining access to sensitive corporate and military secrets, including intellectual property. The report comes after high-profile computer network attacks aimed at the International Monetary Fund, Sony and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, America's largest military contractor. Concern over attacks being carried out by nation-states is rising sharply, particularly after Google said last year that Chinese hackers stole some of the company's source code. Many security experts say the Chinese government has built up a sophisticated cyberwarfare unit and that the government might be partnering with professional hackers. But the list of entities, government or private, suspected of hacking campaigns, is a long one. Jeff Moss, an Internet security expert who founded the Black Hat Conference, said it would be hard to narrow down the suspects in a broad campaign. ''China is a pretty convenient punching bag,'' he said. The company's 14-page report, written by Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee's vice president for threat research, traced the attacks to at least 2006 and said they peaked in 2009. It calls the attacks highly sophisticated and said targets included governments, companies, and organizations in Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Switzerland and Britain. ''After painstaking analysis of the logs, even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,'' the report said. McAfee said it identified a single perpetrator in March, when it discovered detailed logs of attacks while reviewing the contents of a server it had discovered in 2009 as part of an investigation into security breaches at defense companies. Joris Evers, a spokesman for McAfee, said the server was in a Western country but that he could not be more specific. McAfee called the attacks Operation Shady RAT -- RAT stands for remote access tool, a type of software used to control networked computers. The duration of the attacks ranged from a month to what McAfee said was a sustained 28-month attack against an Olympic committee of an unidentified Asian nation. What was done with the data ''is still largely an open question,'' Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the report. ''However, if even a fraction of it is used to build better competing products or beat a competitor at a key negotiation (due to having stolen the other team's playbook), the loss represents a massive economic threat.'' Mr. Moss said subjects of attacks should be more forthcoming. ''Companies do the public a disservice by not revealing when these things happen,'' he said. In mid-May, the Obama administration proposed creating international computer security standards with penalties for countries and organizations that fell short. The strategy calls for officials from the State Department, the Pentagon, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security to work with their counterparts around the world to come up with international standards. Obama administration officials said privately at the time that the hope was that the initiative would prod China and Russia into allowing more Internet freedom, cracking down on intellectual property theft and enacting stricter laws to protect computer users' privacy. In February, a Canadian federal cabinet minister said hackers, perhaps from China, had compromised computers in two Canadian government departments in early January, leaving bureaucrats with little or no Internet access for nearly two months. The minister, Stockwell B. Day Jr., the president of the Treasury Board, called the attack a ''significant one'' that went after financial records. Also in February, McAfee released a report saying that at least five multinational oil and gas companies had suffered computer network attacks by a group of hackers based in China. Beijing has strongly denied any role in computer network attacks, and insisted it has been a frequent victim of such attacks itself. On Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the latest McAfee report. But last month, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said, ''The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.'' He added: ''Hacking is an international issue, with which China also falls victim. China is willing to conduct international cooperation in this regard. We are dissatisfied with some people's irresponsible remarks that link hacker attacks with the Chinese government.''  "
U.S. Expresses Concern About New Cyberattacks in Japan,"TOKYO -- The United States gave a stern warning on Wednesday over recent cyberattacks on Japan's biggest defense contractors, the latest in a series of security breaches that have fueled concern about Tokyo's ability to handle delicate information. An online assault on defense contractors including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which builds F-15 fighter jets and other American-designed weapons for Japan's Self-Defense Forces, began in August, but only came to light this week, prompting rebukes from Japanese officials over the timing of the disclosure. The IHI Corporation, a military contractor that supplies engine parts for fighter jets, may have also been a target, the Nikkei business daily reported.  The breach came less than two weeks after a Japanese air traffic controller was questioned for posting secret American flight information on his blog. The data including detailed flight plans for Air Force One last November, as well as data on an American military reconnaissance drone, officials said. The breaches threaten to undermine any progress made by Japan, an important American ally, in bolstering cybersecurity in recent years. The Japanese government had promised to revamp its security procedures after a Japanese Navy officer was arrested in 2007 over the leak of classified data on the United States Navy's advanced Aegis combat radar system, which is also used on Japanese warships. ''We are concerned by news reports of cyberattacks on select Japanese companies and will continue to monitor the issue,'' said Karen Kelley, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Tokyo. ''For every country, these kinds of intrusions have the potential for long-term negative impact and must be taken seriously,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''This is why cybersecurity must be a public sector priority in close collaboration with the private sector.'' Mitsubishi Heavy Industries said Monday that its computer systems had been hacked and that some network information may have been compromised. According to the company, 83 computers and servers at 11 locations, including its Tokyo headquarters, factories, and a research and development center were accessed in the attack. Details of the breach were still unclear, a company spokesman said Wednesday. Defense Minister Yasuo Ichikawa has said that he had not received reports that any classified information had been compromised. It also remained unclear where the attacks originated, he said. But an investigation by a security company has revealed that connections were made to 14 overseas sites, including at least 20 servers in China, Hong Kong, the United States and India, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily. China, especially, has vehemently denied that the attack originated from within its borders. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has built F-15 fighter jet and missile systems, including Patriot batteries, and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles, that were designed in the United States. The company builds some of that equipment with American contractors, including Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries won 215 contracts worth $3.4 billion from Japan's Defense Ministry in the year ending last March, or a quarter of the ministry's spending that year, according to Reuters. It has previously experienced breaches in security, including the loss of data on nuclear reactor tests in 2006 and on its fighter jets in 2003. American military contractors have also endured serious security breaches. This year, Lockheed Martin was the victim of a sophisticated hacking attack. A Japanese defense white paper last month urged its defense community to better protect its computer systems against cyberattacks after that breach.  "
White House Upgrades Computer Safety,"WASHINGTON -- The White House plans to issue an executive order on Friday to replace a flawed patchwork of computer security safeguards exposed by the disclosure of hundreds of thousands of classified government documents to WikiLeaks last year. The order by President Obama culminates a seven-month governmentwide review of policies and procedures involving the handling of classified information, and recommendations on how to reduce the risk of breaches. The directive enshrines many stopgap fixes that the Pentagon, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency made immediately after the initial WikiLeaks disclosures last November. Since then, for instance, the military has disabled 87 percent of its computers to prevent people from downloading classified data onto memory sticks, CDs or DVDs.  The Pentagon has also developed procedures to monitor and detect suspicious behavior on classified computer systems. And the State Department stopped distributing its diplomatic cables over a classified e-mail system used by many in the military, including Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, who is accused of leaking the classified documents to WikiLeaks. Computer security analysts say these safeguards, as well as others in the executive order aimed at bringing greater consistency and accountability to information sharing and protection policies, are long overdue, and lag behind what is routine in the private sector. ''The real surprise continues to be that relatively elementary procedures should have been in place and were not,'' said Ravi Sandhu, executive director of the Institute for Cyber Security at the University of Texas at San Antonio. In addition to these immediate measures, Mr. Obama's order creates a task force led by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to combat leaks from government workers, or what the White House calls an ''insider threat.'' The directive also establishes a special government committee that must submit a report to the president within 90 days, and then at least once a year after that, assessing federal successes and failures in protecting classified information on government computer networks. According to government prosecutors, the three big WikiLeaks document dumps were disguised as a Lady Gaga CD and smuggled out of a military intelligence office in Iraq by Private Manning. Computer security analysts say the case revealed major lapses in securing classified data in war zones. Now, virtually every Defense Department computer is blocked from downloading classified information onto memory sticks or CDs, except for explicitly authorized ''mission essential'' exceptions. The Pentagon has issued a cyber identity credential to anyone using unclassified networks and has started a similar program for personnel using classified networks. These credentials allow supervisors to track what users are working on. And the military is accelerating the analysis of logs from computers on the classified networks to detect large transfers of data or the use of data that is unrelated to an individual's job duties. ''It's an additional tool to provide indicators that flag anomalous behavior, much as credit card companies monitor credit card use and a user's profile,'' said Teri Takai, the Defense Department's chief information officer. The WikiLeaks disclosure also revealed disparities in the use of security safeguards by various federal agencies and even within agencies. Under the new order, each federal agency will designate a senior official to oversee procedures for safeguarding classified data that also protect user privacy and civil liberties. ''As technology changes, we hope to be ahead of the curve, seeing where technology is going and being able to respond before it's necessary,'' said Patrick F. Kennedy, the under secretary for management at the State Department. Despite the changes and continuing review, administration officials say the new policies and procedures are relatively untested. ''I don't think we'll ever be able to guarantee this won't happen again, but this greatly enhances our chances of preventing it or catching it in the process,'' said Monte Hawkins, the director for identity management and biometrics policy at the National Security Council.

"Skype Can Expose Your Location, Researchers Say"," Remember when a prankster could make himself a general nuisance by calling your home phone and quickly hanging up? The equivalent of a prank call on Skype, the popular voice-over-Internet-Protocol service, can be much more than a nuisance. If you are logged in to Skype, a prankster - or thief or spy - can effectively track where you are and in some circumstances, what you do and even what you download, according to an experiment led by Keith Ross, a computer science professor at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University in Brooklyn. Mr. Ross, along with his collaborators at the French computer research institute, Inria, followed 10,000 randomly selected Skype users over 16 days. If a user's Skype application was running, the researchers could call inconspicuously and, in the process of placing the call, glean the user's Internet Protocol address. Every hour, the researchers logged an I.P. address for each user. That address could in turn be used to determine the user's geographic location - in some cases, right down to the ZIP code. The researchers then winnowed the large sample to a handful of volunteers who agreed to let themselves be tracked. In one example, one Skype user was seen logging in to Skype from the network of a New York City university, followed by a visit to Chicago, a return to the university and then to his home in France. Those whose Skype handles are identical or similar to their real names are that much more visible. The researchers could potentially find much more about them on a variety of social networks. ""If we had followed the mobility of the Facebook friends of this user as well, we likely would have determined who he was visiting and when,"" the researchers said. It is not enough to refuse a Skype call from a stranger. In a peer-to-peer network, just establishing a connection between two peers is enough to reveal an I.P. address. That I.P. address can then also be used to look for what large files have been downloaded to that device using BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer system that is most commonly used to share pirated movies and music. Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, said it was aware of the issue. ""We value the privacy of our users and are committed to making our products as secure as possible,"" Adrian Asher, the company's chief information security officer, said in a statement. ""Just as with typical Internet communications software, Skype users who are connected may be able to determine each other's IP address. Through research and development, we will continue to make advances in this area and improvements to our software."" Mr. Ross, the computer science professor, suggested the following precautionary measures to avid Skype users. It's probably best not to leave your Skype application running all the time, just when you are planning to make or receive a call. Users are also slightly more protected if they choose a Skype handle that is different from their real name.   "
Programmer Raises Concerns About Phone-Monitoring Software," 7:18 p.m. | Updated   8:00 p.m. | Updated   10:42 p.m. | Updated    A viral Internet video has raised privacy concerns about an obscure piece of data-collection software that is embedded in millions of cellphones.  In his video, Trevor Eckhart, a 25-year-old programmer, indicates that a software utility called Carrier IQ may be quietly logging much of a phone user's activity, including keystrokes, numbers dialed, encrypted Web searches and the contents of text messages. ""Every button that you press in the dialer, before you even call, already gets sent off to the IQ application here,"" Mr. Eckhart says in the video, which was posted on Monday. The video has reopened a discussion of whether phone companies and their partners are collecting more data about customers than necessary to provide their services.  Carrier IQ says its software was designed to let carriers get information about things like dropped calls or text-messaging failures so they can improve their services and networks. The company's Web site has a live counter that shows that its software is installed on over 141 million devices. When asked by Wired News last month whether Carrier IQ could read text messages from phones if it wanted to, a company marketing manager answered, ""Probably yes."" But in a statement Thursday evening, Carrier IQ denied that its software recorded keystrokes and insisted that it only measured and summarized cellphone performance.  ""While a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, e-mail, photographs, audio or video,"" the company said. ""For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen."" When Mr. Eckhart published some of his research last month and posted copies of Carrier IQ training manuals, the company  responded  with a letter demanding that he remove the manuals and ""unsubstantiated allegations.""  Mr. Eckhart was ultimately backed by legal counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which said his publication of the manuals was protected by fair use under the Copyright Act. Carrier IQ then backed away from its legal threats. So far there has apparently been no independent confirmation of Mr. Eckhart's findings. Dan Rosenberg, a senior security consultant for Virtual Security Research, said in an interview that he had thoroughly examined the Carrier IQ software and found no evidence that the company was recording and sending out data to its own servers or to its carrier customers. To conduct his research, Mr. Rosenberg said he found the Carrier IQ program on multiple Android devices, pulled out the code and then reverse-engineered it to look under its hood. He said the software was ""listening"" for keystrokes in order to detect when specific button sequences are pressed. These can be used by the carriers to change settings in the phone or to troubleshoot it. He said that listening for specific keystrokes is not the same as recording and sharing user activity. ""It does know when keystrokes are pressed,"" Mr. Rosenberg said of Carrier IQ, ""but it has nothing to do with logging and storing the data."" Mustaque Ahamad, a computer science professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who said he had not examined the software, said it remained unclear what data about a customer was being sent out from the phone. If it was raw data about keystrokes and phone calls, rather than aggregate data, it would be unnecessary, he said. ""Personally,"" Professor Ahamad said in an e-mail, ""I feel that capturing and shipping detailed information about user activity is not kosher."" AT&T, which is a client of Carrier IQ, said it used the software only for diagnostic purposes. ""In line with our privacy policy, we solely use CIQ software data to improve wireless network and service performance,"" a spokesman said in an interview. He declined to comment further.  Sprint has also said that the software is used only to improve its network. ""We collect enough information to understand the customer experience with devices on our network and how to address any connection problems, but we do not and cannot look at the contents of messages, photos, videos, etc., using this tool,"" a company spokesman told WirelessWeek. ""The information collected is not sold and we don't provide a direct feed of this data to anyone outside of Sprint."" A Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, Brenda Raney, said the company ""does not add Carrier IQ to our phones, and the reports we have seen about Verizon using Carrier IQ are false."" In a statement, Apple said that it had stopped using Carrier IQ in most of its products when it introduced iOS 5, the latest version of its mobile operating system, ""and will remove it completely in a future software update."" It added: ""With any diagnostic data sent to Apple, customers must actively opt-in to share this information, and if they do, the data is sent in an anonymous and encrypted form and does not include any personal information. We never recorded keystrokes, messages or any other personal information for diagnostic data and have no plans to ever do so."" Nokia says its devices do not support Carrier IQ. The European carriers Vodafone and Orange say they also are not Carrier IQ clients, according to MocoNews. The controversy provoked a response from Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, who has focused on mobile privacy issues. In a statement published Thursday, Mr. Franken demanded that Carrier IQ disclose the information it records, its methodology and whether the data is shared with third parties.     "
U.S. Agencies Plan a Public Forum on Location Services,"Location-based services, the mobile-phone applications that make use of a person's geographic location, are attracting growing attention in Washington following reports that phone and software companies might have been sharing location information with third parties. To try to help consumers understand and navigate the services and their privacy implications, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission will conduct a public education forum on June 28 at F.C.C. headquarters in Washington, the agencies said on Tuesday. Location-based services can be used to find, for example, a nearby restaurant, or to compare sale prices for an item with those at nearby stores. The technology is also being developed for use by public safety entities for emergency response. But regulators fear that privacy concerns might stunt the adoption and use of the services. Representatives from consumer advocacy groups, mobile-phone companies, technology companies and equipment makers are scheduled to attend the forum to discuss how location-based services work, their benefits and risks, industry best practices and things consumers and parents need to know about their own or their children's use of the technology.  Public comments can be submitted electronically before the meeting on the F.C.C.'s Web site or by mail; there will also be a short question-and-answer session at the event, an agency spokeswoman said. The forum follows several Congressional hearings on privacy and mobile-phone data. Another one scheduled for Thursday by the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection will feature an F.T.C.  official and executives from Apple, Google and Facebook, among others.  "
Why Parents Lie to Let Kids Join Facebook,"It's been clear for a while that parents lie about their children's ages so they can join Facebook. A  published in June found that there were 7.5 million users under age 13 (the site's lower limit); more than five million were under 10. Over the year leading up to the report, a million children said they were harassed or threatened on the site.  But cyber-bullying is not why kids are supposed to stay away. The legal reason for the age limit is to protect children's privacy. Facebook collects personal data from its users - lots of it. The site's whole purpose is to erode the concept of privacy, to make public everything about you, not only for the benefit of your 622 BFFs, but to customize your advertising or use your endorsement of a product (through the ""like"" button) to sell it to a friend. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was designed to protect children from that kind of exposure. Enacted by Congress in 1998, it limits the amount of information any site can collect from kids under 12. Among other things, it requires verifiable parental consent before collecting personal data; mandates the posting of a policy describing how that information will be used; and requires the maintenance of ""confidentiality, security and integrity of information they collect from children."" The parents of 7.5 million kids have given that idea a collective shrug.  Should the responsibility for policing pint-sized pretenders fall to Facebook? Well, that's not going to happen. Mark Zuckerberg, the social network's founder and hardly an advocate of privacy, openly opposes the COPPA regulations. His reasoning - that there is something educational to be gained on the site - is a little self-serving, but his conclusion may not be entirely wrong. A survey published on Tuesday by the Internet journal First Monday asked 1,007 parents of children between the ages of 10 and 14 how they feel about Internet-age restrictions. They found: * Parents of 13- and 14-year-olds report that, on average, their child joined Facebook at age 12.* More than half of parents of 12-year-olds said their child had a Facebook account; 82 percent of those parents knew when their child signed up; 76 percent assisted their 12-year-old in creating the account.* More than three-quarters of parents said it is acceptable for their child to violate minimum-age restrictions on online services. Given those numbers, COPPA clearly isn't working. The authors argue that while parents want to protect their children's privacy, they don't want limitations imposed regarding which sites their kids can access. Rather, they preferred to join up honestly, then have mechanisms provided through which they could control the information gathered about their children as well as what they could see or do. Which sounds good, I suppose - if you believe Facebook would do it, that the site has the interests of parents and kids at heart. What do you think? Is it time to dismantle COPPA? Take another look at it? Are you willing to give up your child's privacy for access to online fun and connection? Should preteens be on Facebook? Finally, a coda to my earlier post on siblings: My oldest brother, David, reminds me that he used to regularly hold me down while singing a jingle from a hair product commercial (""Dippity-do: holds and holds"") and threatening to hock a loogie on my forehead. He thought that I had forgotten - ha! Actually, I'd meant to include that in the post. So in the interests of full disclosure, and because revenge is a dish best served cold, I'm here to tell you that David teased me until I cried nearly every day for 11 years, until he went to college. And I love him now as much as I hated him then. So parents of siblings who are at one another's throats all day - take heart. Things can change.   "
Note to Self: Read Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,"John Keker, named this year by Best Lawyers magazine as one of the country's top  litigators, appeared before a judge in February to try to quash a federal government demand to Twitter for information about certain customers.  The government sought from Twitter the Internet protocol address of Mr. Keker's client, Jacob Appelbaum, whom the Justice Department is investigating for possible links to WikiLeaks. Mr. Keker argued that the information was private and that the government could not extract it from Twitter without a search warrant based on probable cause. Mr. Keker's back and forth with Theresa Carroll Buchanan, a Federal District Court magistrate,  is instructive to every person who registers on Web sites of all kinds, whether communications platforms like Twitter or online retailers hawking discounted boots. Each site has rules of engagement, including privacy policies that, generally speaking, are not as pithy as my blog posts. Those policies spell out many things, including, for instance, that Twitter (or any site that wants to know who its users are) stores its users' Internet Protocol address, the identifying digits of the computer from which you log on to the Web.   This conversation was chronicled in a decision Thursday by a second federal judge, Liam O'Grady, in Alexandria, Va. He ruled against Mr. Keker's client. He said Twitter must turn over to the federal government the information that it demands. His decision was based, among other things, on the exchange from February.  In effect, Judge O'Grady said Mr. Appelbaum and his co-defendants must have known that Twitter would have collected their Internet protocol address and that they agreed to the terms of the company's privacy policy.  The conversation between Mr. Keker and Judge Buchanan went as follows: Mr. Keker said: ""The vast majority of people have no idea that Twitter collects the information about their whereabouts."" ""Well,"" Judge Buchanan said, ""your clients seem like pretty knowledgeable people and they did agree to Twitter's privacy policy, did they not?"" ""I have had those things pop up on my screen every time I get a new program,"" the lawyer responded. ""So you don't read them?"" asked the judge.  ""I have never read the whole thing,"" the lawyer replied. ""So saying that they agreed to it, it was jammed down their throat. Yes, it appeared on their screen. There's no question about that."" The judge asked again, albeit rhetorically. ""Well, it would be a condition of creating a Twitter account, would it not?"" ""Correct, that's true,"" the lawyer replied.  ""Okay. And they agreed to that, correct?"" the judge asked again.  ""They created a Twitter account. That's certainly true,"" the lawyer said.  ""All right. Subject to that,"" the judge said. ""O.K.""  Twitter's privacy policy, in short, says the company can turn over information if necessary by law or to prevent fraud or keep the site secure.   "
Marketers Celebrate Glimmers of Recovery,"AUSTIN, Tex. AFTER a few years of struggling, the advertising industry is finally willing to believe some good news. Nancy Hill, chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, or the Four A's, kicked off the group's annual conference here on Monday bearing what she called ''hard-core, positive, yes-our-industry-has-survived-and-is-robust news.'' The statistics Ms. Hill provided were probably enough to inspire more than a few advertisers to get back to the planning board. According to Nielsen, in February 111 million people watched the Super Bowl -- one of the largest opportunities for advertisers. Ms. Hill said that chief marketing officers were seeing revenue gains, with brands like Procter & Gamble and Kraft increasing spending. She said a 30-second ad slot during the Oscars telecast this year was the most expensive in the history of the awards. ''That which does not kill us makes us stronger,'' she said. ''Maybe Charlie Sheen should take a note from us.''  It is advertising, it would appear from Ms. Hill's remarks, and not Mr. Sheen who is in fact winning. Here are some highlights from the conference, which ended Wednesday. KINKY LAUGHS The second morning of the conference began with off-color comedic relief from the author, musician, sometime politician and longtime Texan Kinky Friedman. After earning a few muffled laughs from the crowd, many of whom were still grabbing cups of coffee, yogurt and pastries, Mr. Friedman offered to sign copies of one of his books. ''I'll sign anything but bad legislation,'' said Mr. Friedman, who ran for governor of Texas in 2006. DATA RULES Content may be king in media, but in advertising it is data. Most of the vendor booths at the event were focused on data analytics, media management and back-office technology for advertisers. The technologies can help advertisers track consumers on the Web and understand which ads are most effective for certain audiences. Other technologies were geared to helping agencies buy digital advertising or manage their accounts online more efficiently. PRIVACY All of that digital data comes at a price. A theme echoing throughout the conference was data privacy. In her opening remarks Ms. Hill urged the audience ''to actively participate in this discussion, because without self-regulation our creativity will be increasingly threatened.'' In recent months, the Federal Trade Commission and the Commerce Department have both issued reports about online privacy and digital advertising, while industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau have supported self-regulation. David Vladeck, the F.T.C.'s director of consumer protection, was at the event to help explain the commission's proposal for a ''do-not-track'' mechanism that would allow consumers to opt out of being tracked by advertisers and shown targeted advertising. Mr. Vladeck said that the commission recognized the benefits of behavioral advertising for consumers -- they see more useful and relevant ads -- but that data collection still raised ''serious privacy concerns.'' Mr. Vladeck added that while the commission did not recommend legislation and was encouraged by some of the recent progress made in self-regulation by industry groups, there was more to be done. ''It's not just the F.T.C. looking over your shoulder, folks,'' he said. ''So is Congress.'' On Wednesday, the day after Mr. Vladeck spoke, a panel of advertising agency representatives tackled the issue of privacy and responded to Mr. Vladeck's speech and to the overall issues affecting the industry. Bob Liodice, chief executive of the Association of National Advertisers, said the industry was ''gratified'' by Mr. Vladeck's remarks but expressed concern about what it considered mixed messages by the F.T.C., including the lack of a clear definition of tracking, collection or first-party marketing. Carla Michelotti, executive vice president and chief legal, government and corporate affairs officer at Leo Burnett Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, said Mr. Vladeck's remarks were a sign that the commission was ''extending an olive branch after a very harsh approach in the report.'' All of the panelists encouraged advertisers, agencies and publishers to regulate themselves or risk being regulated by the government. HELP WANTED Agencies are taking a close look at their hiring practices. A star-studded panel of advertising executives underscored the challenges they faced in recruiting a diverse staff, being more aggressive in recruiting talent, and rewarding and training current employees. ''No one wakes up in the morning and says, 'You know what? I want to be in the advertising business,' '' said Michael I. Roth, chief executive of the Interpublic Group of Companies. ''The real issue is getting new talent interested in our industry, and frankly we do a lousy job at it.'' Martin Sorrell, chief of WPP, said, ''The criminal neglect in our industry is that we do not recruit good people consistently.'' John D. Wren, chief executive of the Omnicom Group, added: ''It's neglect. We've gotten a lot more comfortable poaching, if you will, our own people.'' RUBBER DUCKS AND COOKIES The number of sponsors at the conference increased to 38 this year from 34 in 2010. Attendance was also on the rise, with a little more than 1,000 participants, up from 970 in 2010. Technology and media companies were the main sponsors. There was free Wi-Fi sponsored by Bloomberg and AOL. Google sponsored coffee breaks. Bloomberg and AOL also competed with gifts in attendees' hotel rooms. AOL gave door hangers with miniature bottles of Moet Champagne, and plastic devil rubber ducks. Bloomberg left cookies from Tiff's Treats, a local bake shop. At dinner on Monday night, Microsoft gave out bottles of Tabasco sauce with wrappers that said, ''Spice up your next campaign with Microsoft advertising'' and ''Give your advertising some kick.''  "
A New Internet Privacy Law?,"Considering how much information we entrust to the Internet every day, it is hard to believe there is no general law to protect people's privacy online. Companies harvest data about people as they surf the Net, assemble it into detailed profiles and sell it to advertisers or others without ever asking permission.  So it is good to see a groundswell of support emerging for minimum standards of privacy, online and off. This week, the Obama administration called for legislation to protect consumers' privacy. In the Senate, John Kerry is trying to draft a privacy bill of rights with the across-the-aisle support of John McCain. Microsoft, which runs one of the biggest Internet advertising networks, said it supports a broad-based privacy law. It has just introduced a version of its Explorer browser that allows surfers to block some tools advertisers use to track consumers' activities online. It is crucial that lawmakers get this right. There is strong pressure from the advertising industry to water down rules aimed at limiting the data companies can collect and what they can do with it. Most oppose a sensible proposal by the Federal Trade Commission for a do-not-track option -- likely embedded in Web browsers. They have proposed self-regulation instead, and we applaud their desire to do that, but the zeal to self-regulate tends to wane when it is not backed by government rules and enforcement. Senator Kerry has not yet proposed specific legislation, but he has laid out sound principles. Companies that track people's activities online must obtain people's consent first. They must specify what data they are collecting and how they will use it. They need consumers' go-ahead to use data for any new purpose. They are responsible for the data's integrity. And consumers should have the right to sever their relationship with data collectors and ask for their file to be deleted. But there are potential areas of concern. Senator Kerry so far has not called for a do-not-track option. He would allow companies to write their own privacy plans and submit them to the F.T.C. for approval. That would give companies flexibility to adapt their solutions as technology evolved, but it lacks the simplicity and universality of a do-not-track feature. It could yield a dizzying array of solutions that would confuse consumers about their rights and options and make it more difficult to enforce clear standards. Moreover, it would make it tougher for consumers to keep track of how their information is used and to whom it is sold. Advertising firms still argue that privacy protections could undermine the free Internet, depriving it of ad revenue by reducing advertisers' ability to target consumers. This is overstated. Advertisers will still need to advertise. If many people opt out of behavioral targeting, the firms will find other ways to do it. Privacy protections are long overdue. We hope the swell of support will lead to significant legislation.  "
Senators Propose Bill to Ensure Internet Privacy,"Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator John McCain of Arizona on Tuesday made a bipartisan call for new legislation to protect consumer privacy on the Internet. In introducing the Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2011, Mr. Kerry cited the 107 trillion e-mails that were sent last year and the nearly 600 million Facebook users as proof of how much consumers used the Internet.  ''Every single day each of us produces a staggering amount of personal information on the Internet,'' Mr. Kerry said in a news conference with reporters. ''That journey can be tracked, it can be stored and it can be shared on an almost unimaginable scale.'' The privacy ''rights'' would ensure that companies that collected data implemented security measures to protect that data. It would also require companies to provide consumers with notice about what data were being collected and allow them to opt-out if they chose.The legislation also would require consumers to opt-in to the collection of sensitive information like their medical condition or religious affiliation. Users would also be able to access and correct the information that had been collected about them or request that companies cease to use or distribute that information. The bill also seeks to limit the amount of data that can be collected on any one consumer by requiring that companies only gather what is needed to perform a specific transaction for a specific amount of time. The proposed legislation received mixed reaction from advertisers, technology companies and consumer advocates, many who were still sorting through the details on Tuesday. While consumer advocacy organizations like the Consumer's Union and the Consumer Federation of American supported the proposal, a separate contingent of consumer privacy advocates -- including Consumer Watchdog and the Center for Digital Democracy -- applauded the bipartisan effort, but said more could be done. In a letter to the senators, the advocates said the bill should require and enforce a ''do not track'' mechanism and place stronger controls on social networking sites like Facebook. Mr. Kerry said ''do not track,'' which also was advocated by the Federal Trade Commission in a December report on privacy, ''didn't seem to fit into our ability to get the balance between consumer support and industry support that we were able to get.'' As the bill makes the rounds, ''it may well be one of the amendments that we continue to talk about,'' he said. One issue of concern to both the Direct Marketing Association and the Interactive Advertising Bureau was allowing consumers to access and correct their data from marketing databases. ''In order to allow access and correction you probably need more privacy controls rather than fewer,'' said Linda Woolley, the executive vice president of Washington operations at the Direct Marketing Association. Accessing and correcting data would be expensive and would require a user to authenticate who they were almost as if they were logging into a bank account, she said. Mike Zaneis, senior vice president and general counsel at of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, called that level of access for consumers problematic, ''requiring possibly 1.1 million Web sites to comply with an unnecessary provision would be unduly expensive and wasteful.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
A Fight Over How Drugs Are Pitched,"Before pharmaceutical company marketers call on a doctor, they do their homework. These salespeople typically pore over electronic profiles bought from data brokers, dossiers that detail the brands and amounts of drugs a particular doctor has prescribed. It is a marketing practice that some health care professionals have come to hate. ''It's very powerful data and it's easy to understand why drug companies want it,'' said Dr. Norman S. Ward, a family physician in Burlington, Vt. ''If they know the prescribing patterns of physicians, it could be very powerful information in trying to sway their behavior -- like, why are you prescribing a lot of my competitor's drug and not mine?'' Marketing to doctors using prescription records bearing their names is an increasingly contentious practice, with three states, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, in the vanguard of enacting laws to limit the uses of a doctor's prescription records for marketing.  On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case, Sorrell v. IMS Health, that tests whether Vermont's prescription confidentiality law violates the free speech protections of the First Amendment. The case is being closely watched not only by drug makers and data collection firms, but also by health regulators, doctors and consumer advocates who say the decision will have profound implications for doctors' control over their prescription histories, and for information privacy, medical decision-making and health care costs. Vermont's attorney general, William H. Sorrell, petitioned the court to review the case after three leading data collection firms including IMS Health, a health information company, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a drug industry trade group, challenged the state statute. Although the federal district court in Vermont originally upheld the law, an appellate court reversed the decision last November. The federal government, the attorneys general of several dozen states, AARP, professional medical associations, privacy groups and the New England Journal of Medicine have filed briefs in support of Vermont's law. The National Association of Chain Drugstores,the Association of National Advertisers and news organizations like Bloomberg and The Associated Press have filed briefs aligning themselves with the data firms. The concern over marketing based on doctor-specific prescription records revolves around the argument that it makes commercial use of private health treatment decisions -- initiated in nonpublic consultations between doctor and patient, and completed in government-regulated transactions with pharmacists. The data has become more available because pharmacies, which are required by law to collect and maintain detailed files about each prescription filled, can sell records containing a doctor's name and address, along with the amount of the drug prescribed, to data brokers. (The records are shorn of patient names and certain other personal details covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as H.I.P.A.A., the federal legislation governing a patient's privacy.) Data brokers in turn aggregate the records for use in medical research and marketing. Drug makers spent about $6.3 billion on marketing visits to doctors in 2009, the last year that such figures were available, according to IMS Health. Access to a doctor's prescription history, drug makers say, helps ensure that information about the latest prescription drug options quickly reaches specialists who treat particular conditions. But some federal regulators and medical societies argue that drug makers are simply mining the data to identify and go after the doctors who would be most likely to prescribe the latest, most expensive brand-name medicines -- driving up health care costs and exposing patients to newer drugs whose side effects may not yet be fully known. Vermont enacted its prescription confidentiality law with the idea that drug makers do not have an inherent right to a doctor's identifiable prescription information for use in marketing because the data originated in highly government-regulated, nonpublic health care transactions, said Mr. Sorrell, the Vermont attorney general. ''Does 'Ajax Incorporated' have a constitutional unfettered right to the data for commercial purposes,'' Mr. Sorrell said, ''or is it legitimate to give the doctor who is writing the prescription a say over whether that information should be used for marketing?'' Although the state law does not inhibit pharmaceutical sales representatives from marketing to doctors in their offices, he said, it does give doctors the right to consent before their prescribing information may be sold and used for marketing. If a doctor does not agree, he said, pharmacies must remove or encrypt the doctor's name, just as they do for patients, before they sell this type of record for promotional use. Even if the Supreme Court were to find that the law infringes on free speech, Mr. Sorrell added, the justices could still uphold the law on the grounds that the state has a legitimate interest in containing the higher medical costs and safety risks that can be associated with the newest drugs. But industry representatives contend that Vermont should not be allowed to cherry-pick certain approved uses for the records in question while restricting those that conflict with what the law's opponents say is the state's apparent agenda: promoting less expensive generic drugs in an effort to lower health care costs. Vermont allows those records to be used in research and by law enforcement, said Thomas C. Goldstein, a lawyer representing IMS Health. Moreover, he said, drug makers are allowed to buy the very same records so they can identify doctors whose patients might be good candidates for clinical trials or communicate drug safety updates. ''The one exception is that drug companies cannot use the data to combat the insurers' and the state's messages about their products,'' Mr. Goldstein argued. He added that pharmacies obtain the information through business transactions that are no different than any other, making the physician records no more private than stock quotes or commodity prices. ''It's all data,'' he said, ''and it's all protected by the First Amendment.'' Moreover, such laws reduce the ability of drug makers to quickly communicate with specialists about new drugs for rare diseases, a situation that could make it prohibitive for, say, a small biotechnology company with a tiny sales force to market a breakthrough medication, said Randy Frankel, the vice president for external affairs at IMS Health. ''Without the data, you might visit 1,000 physicians to identify the 10 whose patients might most benefit,'' Mr. Frankel said. ''With the data, you would go to the 10.'' But some consumer advocates say the real issue in the case is the confidentiality of information that people submit in government-regulated transactions that they would not otherwise make public. ''If the court is not going to protect personal and confidential health records,'' said Wells Wilkinson, a staff lawyer at Community Catalyst, a nonprofit group that filed a brief in support of Vermont, ''how could any consumer transaction be protected?''  "
"Jobs Concedes Apple's Mistakes, and Promises a Fix, on Location Data Practice","SAN FRANCISCO -- Hoping to put to rest a growing controversy over privacy, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, took the unusual step of personally explaining that while Apple had made mistakes in how it handled location data on its mobile devices, it had not used the iPhone and iPad to keep tabs on the whereabouts of its customers. ''We haven't been tracking anybody,'' Mr. Jobs said in an interview on Wednesday. ''Never have. Never will.''  Mr. Jobs said that Apple would fix the mistakes in a free software update that it would release in the next few weeks. Mr. Jobs, who is currently on medical leave, addressed the issue along with two Apple executives -- Philip W. Schiller, the senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, and Scott Forstall, the senior vice president of iPhone software. A week ago, two researchers reported that they had discovered a file in Apple's devices containing what appeared to be data of the locations visited by users over the previous 12 months. The discovery raised fears that Apple was tracking its users and prompted investigations by various European governments and demands for explanations from United States lawmakers. Earlier on Wednesday, Apple posted a statement on its Web site explaining how its system used the file to pinpoint a phone's location. Mr. Jobs defended the timing of Apple's response to the controversy, saying that ''rather than run to the P.R. department,'' it set out to determine exactly what happened. ''The first thing we always do when a problem is brought to us is we try to isolate it and find out if it is real,'' he said. ''It took us about a week to do an investigation and write a response, which is fairly quick for something this technically complicated.'' He added, ''Scott and Phil and myself were all involved in writing the response because we think it is that important.'' Some privacy advocates who were harshly critical of Apple last week praised the company's response, saying it was a step in the right direction. ''Apple acknowledged a mistake and they fixed it,'' Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said in an interview. ''That's a good thing.'' Confirming speculation from some security researchers, Apple said in the statement posted on its Web site that the file in people's iPhones was not a log of their locations but rather ''the locations of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers surrounding the iPhone's location, which can be more than one hundred miles away from the iPhone.'' Apple said it used the data, which it called a cache, to calculate a device's location more quickly than through GPS satellites. But Apple acknowledged that it had made mistakes, which it attributed to programming errors, in storing the data for a long time, keeping the file unencrypted and storing the data even when users had chosen to turn off location services. ''The system is incredibly complex,'' Mr. Forstall said. ''We test this carefully but in such a complex system there are sometimes places where we could do better.'' Apple said it would reduce the location cache on the iPhone to no more than seven days. The company also said it would stop backing up the cache onto people's computers and would delete the cache entirely when users turned off location services. Apple also said that it updated its database of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers by using its customers' phones as sensors. But it said that it could not locate users based on the file on the phone, and that it collected the information in an anonymous and encrypted form. The company cannot identify the phone user from the data, it said. While some security experts have known about the existence of the file for some time, the issue made headlines last week after the researchers reported their findings at a technology conference in San Francisco. Apple came under heavy criticism for its silence after the discovery. The location report attracted attention from some government officials, including Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, who sent a stern letter to Apple asking why it was ''secretly compiling'' the data and what it would be used for. Congressman Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, also sent letters to Apple asking for an explanation of the issue. Google acknowledged last week that it, too, collected data about the location of Wi-Fi hot spots and cell towers from its users. Apple's statement contained a tidbit about possible future product plans. The company said it also was collecting traffic data from its phones and tablets to build a crowd-sourced traffic database. That would enable Apple to provide real-time traffic information along with navigation advice. Google already uses Android phones to collect real-time traffic information. Mr. Jobs declined to answer questions about his health or about any plans to return to Apple. Last week, during the company's quarterly financial report, Timothy D. Cook, the chief operating officer, said, ''He continues to be involved in major strategic decisions, and I know he wants to be back full time.''  "
Shift to Cloud Computing Picks Up Pace in Europe,"BERLIN -- When the founders of Shutl, a British courier service that makes deliveries in 90 minutes in busy London, decided to set up a business that ran exclusively on cloud computing, they needed to get creative. Data privacy laws in Europe restrict the transfer of information about individuals outside the 27-country European Union. That had prevented many companies on the Continent from moving to the cloud, where data may be stored on remote servers in Asia, the United States or elsewhere at a lower cost than what a company would pay for its own servers. Yet despite the tricky legal landscape, Shutl, now a two-year-old start-up, has become one of Europe's most avid users of cloud technology. The company carries out more than 1,000 deliveries a day over a cloud network operated by Amazon, the U.S. Web retailer.  Amazon.com, one of the world's largest sellers of cloud services, helped clinch deals with Shutl and other European businesses, like the French railroad company S.N.C.F. and Bankinter, a Spanish bank, by effectively moving the cloud to Europe by setting up a data center in Dublin. Tom Allason, the Shutl founder and chief executive, said that the company planned to expand from London to all of Britain and Ireland. ''Cloud computing helped make Shutl possible,'' he said. While cloud computing remains the exception, not the rule, in Europe, the trend is gaining momentum. According to Gartner, the research firm, annual sales of cloud services in Europe will rise 4.3 percent, to $29.5 billion, in 2015 from $24.7 billion this year. Sales will still be only roughly half the level of revenue in North America, where remote computing was developed and its biggest sellers -- Amazon, Salesforce.com and Microsoft -- are leading an industry that Gartner says will generate $60 billion in sales this year. But in Europe, the willingness of smaller companies like Shutl, and bigger clients like the European Space Agency and the Fraunhofer Institute of Germany, both Amazon clients, to use the cloud are signs that the outsourcing trend is reaching Europe's shores. ''This is a tectonic shift in computing that is going to take many years to unfold,'' said Adam Selipsky, a vice president at Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of the online retailer. ''Despite the challenges, on the ground, the cloud is happening in Europe.'' Europe is embracing the cloud despite the complexities of the bloc's data protection laws. In addition to forbidding the transfer of data on European citizens outside the Union, there are many different versions of what is considered private information and how it is supposed to be handled. That makes it a legal headache to develop standards that satisfy all member states. For European businesses, cost savings are the cloud's biggest attraction. Cloud data centers are typically vast collections of computer servers and supporting equipment run by businesses that specialize in wholesale data processing. The centers are designed to provide the most efficient use of all storage and computing power, avoiding costly downtime and lulls typical of smaller businesses. Mr. Selipsky said that Amazon customers typically saved 25 percent to 30 percent of costs by using its global cloud network instead of maintaining their own computing systems. Amazon allows its clients to store their information at any of its global data centers. Mr. Allason, the Shutl founder, said that using Amazon's cloud services had saved him from having to spend $:100,000, or $160,000, to set up an internal computing system. He said he had used the savings to build his business, which aggregates and links delivery orders from British retailers like Argos and Oasis to hundreds of local courier services. Cloud computing could get a lift soon from Brussels, where lawmakers are reviewing the European Union's data protection directive, which governs how personal information travels within and outside the 27-nation bloc. Viviane Reding, the European commissioner overseeing the revisions, plans to make a proposal this autumn. Ms. Reding, in an interview, said that businesses and consumers would both benefit from revisions in her proposal, which must be approved by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, which is made up of officials designated by each country to represent its interests. The process is not expected to conclude until next year. The Union's existing data protection directive was adopted in 1995. ''The rules are still valid, but the application of the rules must be modified to reflect the realities of the Internet age,'' Ms. Reding said. Businesses with a stake in the cloud, which include newcomers like Oracle, Cisco Systems, SAP, Apple and Google, are all lobbying lawmakers to streamline the Continent's fragmented national data protection laws. In January, Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, spoke to the lower house of the French Parliament, the National Assembly, urging lawmakers to streamline French law to lower cloud barriers. Ron Zink, the chief operating officer for E.U. affairs at Microsoft, said businesses needed legal certainty and harmonized rules to expand the sale of cloud services across the bloc. The rules from 1995 are too rigid and inflexible to accommodate the reality of modern data flows, he said. ''Cloud computing is a really cost-effective way of getting a lot more computing power and data storage without buying a lot of new equipment yourself,'' Mr. Zink said. Microsoft, like Amazon, also operates a data center for European cloud clients in Dublin. Karl Deacon, the chief technology officer for infrastructure services at Capgemini, a Paris-based company that assists businesses on technology matters, said that Europe needed to revise its data laws to permit more European technology companies to sell cloud services. Most of the major suppliers, Mr. Deacon said, are U.S.-based tech companies. ''The legal landscape is not conducive to cloud computing in Europe,'' Mr. Deacon said. ''Cloud computing is already dominated by the Western tech firms out of America. There is not much European excellence there.'' Mr. Deacon said standards organizations like the Open Data Center Alliance, a group developing an open-standards platform for cloud data centers, could give European companies a new way to break into the cloud services market. In the absence of legal reforms, companies like Amazon and Microsoft will continue to set up local data centers to comply with European law, said Ben Pring, an analyst at Gartner in Boston. That may help spur sales locally but could also increase costs by duplicating computing nodes, which will make cloud computing a more expensive proposition in Europe. A continued prohibition on foreign cloud centers could pose challenges for smaller companies like Newtek Business Services, a New York seller of cloud services under the brand name the Small Business Authority. Yet Barry Sloane, the Newtek chief executive, said he was confident that the cloud model would eventually take hold in Europe. ''The cloud is going to spread globally,'' Mr. Sloane said. ''The cloud makes sense. It is more cost effective and more efficient as well. The biggest driver today is dollars.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"On Its Own, Europe Backs Web Privacy Fights","MADRID -- All 90 people wanted information deleted from the Web. Among them was a victim of domestic violence who discovered that her address could easily be found through Google. Another, well into middle age now, thought it was unfair that a few computer key strokes could unearth an account of her arrest in her college days. They might not have received much of a hearing in the United States, where Google is based. But here, as elsewhere in Europe, an idea has taken hold --individuals should have a ''right to be forgotten'' on the Web. Spain's government is now championing this cause. It has ordered Google to stop indexing information about 90 citizens who filed formal complaints with its Data Protection Agency. The case is now in court and being watched closely across Europe for how it might affect the control citizens will have over information they posted, or which was posted about them, on the Web.  Whatever the ruling in the Spanish case, the European Union is also expected to weigh in with new ''right to be forgotten'' regulations this fall. Viviane Reding, the European Union's justice commissioner, has offered few details of what she has in mind. But she has made clear she is determined to give privacy watchdogs greater power. ''I cannot accept that individuals have no say over their data once it has been launched into cyberspace,'' she said last month. She said she had heard the argument that more control was impossible, and that Europeans should ''get over it.'' But, Ms. Reding said, ''I don't agree.'' On this issue, experts say, Europe and the United States have largely parted company. ''What you really have here is a trans-Atlantic clash,'' said Franz Werro, who was born and raised in Switzerland and is now a law professor at Georgetown University. ''The two cultures really aren't going in the same direction when it comes to privacy rights. '' For instance, in the United States, Mr. Werro said, courts have consistently found that the right to publish the truth about someone's past supersedes any right to privacy. Europeans, he said, see things differently: ''In Europe you don't have the right to say anything about anybody, even if it is true.'' Mr. Werro says Europe sees the need to balance freedom of speech and the right to know against a person's right to privacy or dignity, concepts often enshrined in European laws. The European perspective was shaped by the way information was collected and used against individuals under dictators like Franco and Hitler and under Communism. Government agencies routinely compiled dossiers on citizens as a means of control. Court cases over these issues have popped up in many corners of Europe. In Germany, for instance, Wolfgang Werle and Manfred Lauber, who became infamous for killing a German actor in 1990, are suing Wikipedia to drop the entry about them. German privacy laws allow suppression of criminal identities in news accounts once people have paid their debt to society. The lawyer for the two killers argues that criminals have a right to privacy too, and a right to be left alone. Google has also faced suits in several countries, including Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, over its efforts to collect street-by-street photographs for its Street View feature. In Germany, where courts found that Street View was legal, Google allowed individuals and businesses to opt out, and about 250,000 have. The issue, however, has had no traction in the United States, where anyone has the right to take pictures of anything in plain sight from the street. Google declined to discuss the Spanish cases, instead issuing a statement saying that requiring search engines to ignore some data ''would have a profound chilling effect on free expression without protecting people's privacy.'' In a blog post this year, Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, discussed the subject under the headline, ''Foggy thinking about the Right to Oblivion.'' The blog post made clear that he was speaking for himself, not Google. But he left little doubt that he considered Europe's efforts to forge new privacy rights poorly defined and misguided, raising complex legal and technical questions. In fact, the phrase ''right to be forgotten'' is being used to cover a batch of issues, ranging from those in the Spanish case to the behavior of companies seeking to make money from private information that can be collected on the Web. Some European experts feel that new rules of play need to be drawn up anyway. Mr. Werro says many Europeans, including himself, are broadly uncomfortable with the way personal information is found by search engines and used for commerce. When ads pop up on his screen, clearly linked to subjects that are of interest to him, he says he finds it Orwellian. A recent poll conducted by the European Union found that most Europeans agree. Three out of four said they were worried about how Internet companies used their information and wanted the right to delete personal data at any time. Ninety percent wanted the European Union to take action on the right to be forgotten. Spain's Data Protection Agency, created in the 1990s to protect individual rights, believes that search engines have altered the process by which most data ends up forgotten -- and therefore adjustments need to be made. The deputy director of the agency, Jesus Rubi, pointed to the official government gazette, which used to publish every weekday, including bankruptcy auctions, official pardons, and who passed the civil service exams. Usually 220 pages of fine print, it quickly ended up gathering dust on various backroom shelves. The information was still there, but not easily accessible. Then two years ago, the 350-year-old publication went online, making it possible for embarrassing information -- no matter how old -- to be obtained easily. Mr. Rubi said he doubted that anyone meant for the information to haunt citizens forever: ''The law obliges us to put this info in the gazette. But I am sure that if the law was written today, lawmakers would say O.K., publish this, but it should not be accessible by a search engine.'' The publisher of the government publication, Fernando Perez, said it was meant to foster transparency. Lists of scholarship winners, for instance, make it hard for the government officials to steer all the money to their own children. ''But maybe,'' he said, ''there is information that has a life cycle and only has value for a certain time.'' Experts say that Google and other search engines see some of these court cases as an assault on a principle of law already established -- that search engines are essentially not responsible for the information they corral from the Web, and hope the Spanish court agrees. The companies believe if there are privacy issues, the complainants should address those who posted the material on the Web. But some experts in Europe believe that search engines should probably be reined in. ''They say they are not publishing, so you should address yourself elsewhere,'' said Javier de la Cueva, a Madrid lawyer specializing in the relationship between law and technology. ''But they are the ones that are spreading the word. Without them no one would find these things.''  "
Update Urged on Children's Online Privacy,"Aiming to catch up with fast-churning technology that touches children's lives every day, the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday proposed long-awaited changes to regulations covering online privacy for children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa, was enacted over a decade ago, long before the advent of social media and smartphones. It requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting any personal information about a child under the age of 13. The proposed revisions expand the definition of ''personal information'' to include a child's location, along with any personal data collected through the use of cookies for the purposes of targeted advertising. It also covers facial recognition technology. Web sites that collect a child's information would be required to ensure that they can protect it, hold onto it ''for only as long as is reasonably necessary,'' and then delete the information safely.  The F.T.C. also suggested that parental consent should no longer be obtained through a two-step e-mail and authorization process, but through alternate methods, like getting scanned versions of signed consent forms and videoconferencing. The commission said revisions to the law were required in light of ''an explosion in children's use of mobile devices, the proliferation of online social networking and interactive gaming.'' Its chairman, Jon Leibowitz, described children as ''tech-savvy, but judgment-poor.'' The collecting of information on children is an emotional issue that often attracts political attention. The F.T.C. has called for comments on its proposals and is expected to finalize them next year. It can put them into effect without Congressional approval. Coppa represents one of the most explicit protections regarding online privacy in American law. The F.T.C. is expected to release its final recommendations for broader online privacy regulations in the coming months. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington and a privacy advocate who helped draft the original law, said he was especially heartened that the rules addressed new technology that allows for location-tracking and facial recognition. ''It's a forward-looking effort to update Internet privacy law,'' he said. Common Sense Media, an advocacy group based in San Francisco, lauded the proposed changes, saying parents ''should absolutely remain the gatekeepers when it comes to their children's online privacy.'' Whether the changes will affect the way Internet companies do business is not clear. Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University, said that because of the existing law, many firms, especially start-ups, avoid dealing with children under 13 anyway. ''The requirements of complying with Coppa are onerous and expensive, and the payoffs from having under-13 kids on the site are rarely worth the financial investment,'' he said. ''The revisions do nothing to change the basic economics of complying with the statute.'' Enforcement is another issue. Facebook says its policy is to not allow children under 13 to use its site, but that it is fraught with difficulty because children lie about their age. Research by Consumer Reports this year found that 7.5 million American children under the age of 13 were using the site. The Pew Research Center in 2009 found that 38 percent of American 12-year-olds were using social networks. A Facebook official who is not authorized to speak to the media because of the sensitivity of the subject called on parents to advise their children about being safe online. ''We believe it is time to focus on how to keep kids safe online and on Facebook, rather than on how to keep them off,'' he said. Company officials said they are reviewing the F.T.C.'s proposals. The F.T.C. this year imposed a $50,000 fine on W3 Innovations, a company that produces mobile phone apps, for collecting personal information on children without proper parental consent.  "
The Young And The Friended,"In May, Consumer Reports announced that 7.5 million kids age 12 and younger are on Facebook. The magazine called this ''troubling news,'' in no small part because their presence is at odds with federal law, which bars Web sites from collecting personal data about kids under 13 without permission from their parents. ''Clearly, using Facebook presents children and their friends and families with safety, security and privacy risks,'' Consumer Reports concluded. Within weeks of the Consumer Reports news, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, called for challenging the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (Coppa), which prevents Facebook from signing up young kids legally. ''That will be a fight we take on at some point,'' Zuckerberg said at the NewSchools Summit in California. And indeed, with the Federal Trade Commission poised to tighten Coppa's regulations, Facebook has tripled its spending on lobbying, formed a political action committee and hired former Bush and Obama officials to push for its agenda.  We don't really know yet how joining Facebook at a tender age affects kids socially and emotionally. There's the fun and freedom of Facebook, and then there's the Consumer Reports finding that the site exposed a million teenagers to bullying and harassment last year. What is clear is that Facebook thinks it needs access to kids' lives in order to continue to dominate its industry. The younger the child, the greater the opportunity to build brand loyalty that might transcend the next social-media trend. And crucially, signing up kids early can accustom them to ''sharing'' with the big audiences that are at their small fingertips. Increasingly, Facebook is staking its future relevance and profits on this idea of sharing, which it made ''frictionless'' in late September. With certain apps on Facebook, like Spotify, you can choose to enable a feature where everyone can see what you're listening to or viewing, without your hitting another key. Before rolling out frictionless sharing, Facebook emphasized that it is now easier to see what your default settings are. But the company refuses to change those settings so that the default would establish more privacy, no doubt because it affects Facebook's bottom line. The more people you're connected to on the site and the more ''likes'' you post, the more ads can be personalized -- hey, buy these shoes because your three friends did! -- and the more potential advertising dollars can be generated. Facebook encourages widespread sharing by making the default settings for an adult's Facebook page public to all. The site has made a concession when it comes to teenagers: the default setting allows basic personal information (name, networks, photo) to be public, while posts are shared with Facebook friends and also the friends of those friends. My son is too young to be on Facebook, but imagine that after his bar mitzvah, he posts photos of it. Along with the 300 people he knows, he could have an audience of 1,000 or more friends of friends he doesn't. As Zuckerberg put it in a radio interview: ''We help you share information, and when you do that, you're more engaged on the site, and then there are ads on the side of the page. The more you're sharing, the more -- the model all just works out.'' Default settings are particularly important to this vision because most people (and especially teenagers) never change them. A recent Columbia University study of 65 college students found that 94 percent were sharing personal information on Facebook that they had not intended to make public. It's true that Facebook has taken action against the graver dangers of sharing. For example, the site is using a new technology to find and remove child pornography, and it's a partner in the police's Amber alert system for missing children. In September, Facebook started testing a special e-mail address with a small group of principals and guidance counselors that gives schools an inside track for urgent reports on bullying and fighting. These steps on behalf of kids are all good. They also don't get in the way of all the sharing that makes Facebook prosper. Changing privacy settings for teenagers would. For Zuckerberg and others in Silicon Valley, the assumption is that nonstop sharing, at every age, is inevitable. A week or so after Zuckerberg said he was ready to fight Coppa, Larry Magid, a co-director of the nonprofit ConnectSafely, seconded the idea in a blog post called ''Facebook Ought to Allow Children Under 13.'' Magid argued that given the millions of young kids already on Facebook despite the law, we're better off letting them on legally and then hoping Facebook comes up with stricter privacy controls. Stephen Balkam, who runs another nonprofit, the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), similarly inveighed against ''techno-pessimists'' in his blog on The Huffington Post when Facebook's geolocation service, called Places, met with a wave of criticism over privacy last year. Magid and Balkam's groups are both on what Facebook calls its ''safety advisory board,'' which the company has said is ''independent.'' Yet they also receive financing from Facebook as well as from other media companies. (FOSI receives $30,000 from each of 15 of its corporate sponsors, including Facebook; Magid did not disclose how much his group receives from Facebook and 15 other sponsors.) In September, Facebook held a reception on Capitol Hill at which the safety board members stood alongside Facebook reps promoting the company's work on privacy, and Balkam lauded Facebook's ''remarkable maturity.'' As a commentator on a CBS radio show and a columnist for The San Jose Mercury News, Magid sometimes criticizes the company but has defended it at key moments. (Headlines: ''Online Privacy Concerns Often Misplaced'' and ''Facebook Privacy Lawsuit a Jumbled Mess.'') Magid discloses his financial link to the company because, he says, he can understand a potential conflict. On his Huffington Post blog, Balkam does not. Facebook stresses that Google and others also finance many of the same organizations, which is true. This is a cozy corner of the online world. It is not frictionless, however. Last fall, Common Sense Media, an advocacy group for kids online that reviews movies, games and apps, left Facebook's advisory board because, the C.E.O. James Steyer says, he and his staff saw Facebook's approach to teenager privacy as worsening over time and insisted on saying so publicly. ''When we disagreed with them on privacy, they wanted us to keep it quiet,'' Steyer says. Facebook says it respects Common Sense Media's decision. Meanwhile, in Washington the F.T.C. wants to require Web sites to get parents' permission before they can track the online movements of kids under 13 for marketing purposes. A bill recently introduced in Congress would go a step further. Called Do Not Track Kids, the legislation would bar Web sites outright from using kids' data to target ads to them until they are 17. In a rare show of bipartisanship, Republicans and Democrats in the House have come out in favor of Do Not Track Kids. Facebook, needless to say, has not.  "
F.T.C. Said to Be Near Facebook Privacy Deal,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission are nearing a settlement over deceptive practices related to several Facebook features, including its privacy settings, according to two people briefed on the settlement. Under the agreement, Facebook would agree to privacy audits for 20 years, one of the people said. It would also prohibit Facebook from making public a piece of information that a user had originally shared privately on the site without express permission, the person said. The individuals spoke on condition of anonymity because the F.T.C. commissioners have not yet approved the settlement. But Facebook would not be required to ask users if they would like to participate in all sharing features on the site, including tools that it builds in the future.  A Facebook spokesman, Andrew Noyes, and an F.T.C. spokeswoman, Claudia Farrell, declined to comment. The settlement is part of the F.T.C.'s effort to protect consumer privacy online. In March, Google and the F.T.C. agreed to 20 years of privacy audits and other measures after an investigation into deceptive privacy practices related to Buzz, its ill-fated social networking tool. It was the first time the F.T.C. had charged a company with such violations and imposed such regulations. Last year, after an F.T.C. investigation into two security breaches, Twitter agreed to establish a privacy program. For Facebook, which has said it has voluntarily made its privacy settings simpler in the last 18 months, the settlement is occurring as it tries to smooth the path toward an initial public offering. ''This is part of the balancing act Facebook has to do,'' said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. ''It also needs to settle the privacy complaints in the United States and Europe before its I.P.O.'' But Mr. Chester expressed doubts that the settlement would appease critics of Facebook's data-collection practices. ''The real test of the F.T.C.'s Facebook deal will be whether a user actually has control over their own information, or will this be a tiny digital bump on the road that does nothing to derail Mark Zuckerberg's voracious appetite to swallow up our data,'' he said. Users, privacy specialists and politicians have attacked Facebook for automatically signing people up for new features on the site, instead of asking them first. For a year and a half, the F.T.C. has pushed Facebook to offer granular privacy controls so people can choose to share or make private specific information they post on the site, according to a person involved in the talks. Facebook has since added tools, like one for sharing with small groups of Facebook friends. The settlement addresses several complaints that the F.T.C. has received from organizations like the Electronic Privacy Information Center. It focuses on privacy changes that Facebook made in December 2009. Although the company said at the time that the changes would simplify settings users found confusing, they exposed information that could previously be made private, including profile photos, gender, friend lists and current city. Facebook also removed the ability to opt out of some features. After a public outcry, Facebook in May 2010 limited the amount of information users were required to make public, and restored the ability to opt out of certain tools. The settlement also addresses other Facebook features that the F.T.C. said were deceptive, including a program for giving applications from outside programmers the Facebook seal of approval that ended in December 2009, one of the people said. Several people briefed on the settlement, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, said it was unclear how long it would take to complete the deal.  "
"Twitter Must Provide Data On 3 Users, Judge Rules","SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Thursday ruled that Twitter, the popular microblogging platform, must reveal information about three of its account holders who are under investigation for their possible links to the WikiLeaks whistle-blower site.  The case has become a flash point for online privacy and speech, in part because the Justice Department sought the information without a search warrant last year. Instead, on the basis of a 1994 law called the Stored Communications Act, the government demanded that Twitter provide the Internet protocol addresses of three of its users, among other things. An Internet protocol address identifies and gives the location of a computer used to log onto the Internet. The three people came to the Justice Department's attention because it believed they were associated with WikiLeaks. Twitter informed the three people -- Jacob Appelbaum, an American computer security expert, along with Rop Gonggrijp, a Dutch citizen, and Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of Iceland's Parliament -- of the government's demand for information earlier this year. The petitioners argued in federal court that their Internet protocol addresses should be considered private information and that the demand for information was too broad and unrelated to WikiLeaks. They also argued that the order suppressed their right to free speech. The court disagreed. Judge Liam O'Grady, from the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., wrote in his opinion that ''the information sought was clearly material to establishing key facts related to an ongoing investigation and would have assisted a grand jury in conducting an inquiry into the particular matters under investigation.'' The judge said that because Twitter users ''voluntarily'' turned over the Internet protocol addresses when they signed up for an account, they relinquished an expectation of privacy. ''Petitioners knew or should have known that their I.P. information was subject to examination by Twitter, so they had a lessened expectation of privacy in that information, particularly in light of their apparent consent to the Twitter terms of service and privacy policy,'' Judge O'Grady wrote. The court also dismissed a petition to unseal the Justice Department's explanation for why it sought the account information. Neither the Justice Department nor Twitter company officials responded to e-mail and telephone requests for comment. The petitioners themselves spoke up on Twitter. ''I would do it again,'' Ms. Jonsdottir posted. ''Today is one of those 'losing faith in the justice system' kind of days,'' Mr. Appelbaum wrote on Twitter. Lawyers for one of the petitioners said they were still reviewing the judge's order and could not yet say what the next steps were.  "
Put It on My Marquee: I Just Watched 'Creepshow 2',"IF Netflix has its way, Facebook members in the United States may soon be able to see which of their friends and family members have just video-streamed ''Paranormal Activity'' or ''Boys Don't Cry.'' Netflix is backing a bill in Congress that would amend the Video Privacy Protection Act, a 1988 law that requires a video services company to get a customer's written consent when it seeks to disclose that client's personal information, such as rental history. The new bill, passed by the House last Tuesday, would allow consumers to give one-time blanket consent online for a company to share their viewing habits continuously. In a social networking ecosystem where sharing information about personal activities is already ubiquitous, the bill may seem to be a no-brainer. After all, Foursquare already shares its members' locations. Spotify already shares the titles of songs its members are playing with their Facebook cohorts. And Facebook publishes links to articles that its members' friends have read. So, Netflix executives argue, it's high time for a bill that would give members of video services the same option to divulge their personal details.  ''It really is meant to empower the consumer to be able to share with their friends,'' says David Hyman, the general counsel of Netflix. He says the bill simply updates an outmoded law so that it matches the way we live now. ''It really kind of levels the playing field in social media.'' But some privacy scholars and advocates are warning that the bill actually diminishes a person's ability to select what to share -- and with whom -- on a case-by-case basis. If the Senate passes the bill as currently written, they say, the revised law would undermine consumers' control over information collected about them even as it empowers companies to create and share more detailed customer profiles. Netflix isn't lobbying for a mere amendment, they argue; it wants Congress to dismantle a gold standard among privacy statutes. ''They are not trying to modernize the law,'' says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research group in Washington. ''They are trying to gut the law.'' At stake, he argues, is not the ostensible sharing of a person's video viewing history, but rather the larger issue of meaningful consent. The Video Privacy Protection Act came about under unusual circumstances. In 1987, the Washington City Paper, a weekly newspaper, published the video rental records of Judge Robert H. Bork, who at the time was a nominee to the Supreme Court. One of the paper's reporters had obtained the records from Potomac Video, a local rental store. Judge Bork's choice of movies -- he rented a number of classic feature films starring Cary Grant -- may have seemed innocuous. But the disclosure of Judge Bork's cultural consumption so alarmed Congress that it quickly passed a law giving individuals the power to consent to have their records shared. The statute, nicknamed the ''Bork law,'' also made video services companies liable for damages if they divulged consumers' records outside the course of ordinary business. To proponents of the new amendment, the law looks like a relic. Members of social networks today, they say, don't want to be asked, each time they've watched another installment of ''The Office,'' whether that information can be shared with their friends. People prefer frictionless sharing, a convenience hindered by the current law, says Christopher Wolf, a lawyer who is co-chairman of the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington research group that receives financing from Google, Facebook and other digital media companies. Moreover, Mr. Wolf says, the law restricts video services that seek to integrate with social networks like Facebook even as some music sites have already introduced sharing. ''Companies should not be exposed to hundreds of millions in damages just because particular hoops weren't jumped through,'' he says. ''If people can share what they are listening to on Spotify, why shouldn't they be able to share what videos they are watching?'' Still, video viewing remains a delicate area for many people because movie choices may open a window to a person's religious or sexual preferences. ''Do you want your conservative friends to know that you watched a hyperviolent ''Saw'' movie or movies about the gay experience like 'Brokeback Mountain'?'' says Kevin Bankston, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights group in San Francisco. ''Do you want your liberal friends to know you watch an enormous amount of religious movies?'' Any amendment, he argues, should preserve a person's ability to choose what to share, case by case, rather than ceding control by giving a general waiver to a company. ''You should have the option to decide what goes on your wall,'' he says. But Netflix argues that the marketplace should dictate consumers' level of control. Mr. Hyman, Netflix's general counsel, says the bill lets people opt in to continual sharing by giving their affirmative consent -- or to choose not to share at all. Netflix, he adds, has already introduced a feature for its subscribers in Canada and Latin America who want to share the movies and TV shows they watch with their friends on the video site and on Facebook. Netflix gives these subscribers a choice of opting out of sharing an individual film or show. ''If it is determined that consumers want more control over what they share on a granular basis,'' Mr. Hyman says, ''you will see that being offered as opposed to it being legislated.'' To advance its agenda, Netflix has increased its presence in Washington. It spent $325,000 on lobbying in the first three quarters of this year, versus $30,000 in the same period in 2009, according to a report from the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks political spending. Last week, some legislators complained that proponents of the bill rushed it through the House without a hearing or a full-scale debate. The bill is likely to face tougher scrutiny in the Senate. Privacy advocates say they expect Senator Al Franken, the Minnesota Democrat who is chairman of the privacy, technology and law subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to hold a hearing on the amendment early next year. And the Judiciary Committee, which has often opposed amending laws for the primary benefit of one company, may decide to strengthen the Bork law -- by clarifying that it covers online video streaming, not just the old-fashioned rental of physical videos. (Hulu, a streaming video service, has already introduced a sharing option on Facebook.) In an interview last week, Judge Bork, a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute, said he was glad Congress had remedied the unauthorized disclosure of video rental records with a law. But, he added, the amendment seemed to call for further public discussion. ''If you are going to enact change to a statute,'' Judge Bork said, ''you have to debate the question of whether the costs outweigh the benefits.'' E-mail: slipstream@nytimes.com  "
"Computer Virus at U.S. Drone Fleet Base Nothing to Worry About, Air Force Says","The Air Force acknowledged for the first time this week that a computer virus has infected a network at a base in Nevada where pilots operate armed drones in the skies over Afghanistan by remote control. After initially declining to discuss the infection, Air Force Space Command issued a statement late Wednesday that said the malware had been detected ""on a stand-alone mission support network,"" at Creech Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, but never affected the critical flight-control system that allows pilots to steer the drone aircraft and launch missile strikes overseas. The statement added that the virus was discovered on ""portable hard drives approved for transferring information between systems"" at the base last month. Col. Kathleen Cook, a spokeswoman for Air Force Space Command. said the military wanted ""to ensure the public understands that the detected and quarantined virus posed no threat to our operational mission and that control of our remotely piloted aircraft was never in question."" The problem was first revealed last week by security specialists at the base who told the editor of Wired's Danger Room blog, Noah Shachtman, that they had spent the previous two weeks fighting the infection. ""We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back,"" a source familiar with the network infection told Mr. Shachtman. ""We think it's benign. But we just don't know.""  Mr. Shachtman, who has previously spent time at the base observing pilots as they operate drones, reported on Friday: Military network security specialists aren't sure whether the virus and its so-called ""keylogger"" payload were introduced intentionally or by accident; it may be a common piece of malware that just happened to make its way into these sensitive networks. The specialists don't know exactly how far the virus has spread. But they're sure that the infection has hit both classified and unclassified machines at Creech. That raises the possibility, at least, that secret data may have been captured by the keylogger, and then transmitted over the public internet to someone outside the military chain of command. According to the new Air Force statement, though The malware in question is a credential stealer, not a keylogger, found routinely on computer networks and is considered more of a nuisance than an operational threat. It is not designed to transmit data or video, nor is it designed to corrupt data, files or programs on the infected computer. Our tools and processes detect this type of malware as soon as it appears on the system, preventing further reach. Citing a defense official who insisted on anonymity, The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the malware in question ""is routinely used to steal log-in and password data from people who gamble or play games like 'Mafia Wars' online.""  Since observers have previously suggested that the Air Force pilots who sit in their flight suits at the base in Nevada, using joysticks to control drones flying over remote war zones, are doing something akin to playing a video game, the implication that they might actually be playing a video game in their off-hours is not surprising. Let's hope, though, that they are not like many people with more mundane jobs, playing games or gambling on their office computers.   "
Chinese Magazine Says Reporter's E-Mail Was Hacked,"The independent Chinese magazine Caixin has said that unidentified hackers broke into the private Gmail account of one of its investigative reporters following the publication of articles that accused local government officials of taking part in child-trafficking.  The Caixin reporter, Zhao Hejuan, recently contributed to a series of investigative reports on child-trafficking, and the apparent complicity of officials in Hunan Province's Longhui County. Last week, she began to suspect that someone was accessing her e-mail. As the magazine explained in a statement on Friday: Zhao learned of the attacks July 21 after receiving a Gmail security alert. Caixin's I.T. department later uncovered evidence that the hacks into Zhao's account went as far back as July 19. Based on Gmail's I.P. history, the hackers had logged on to Zhao's Gmail account every day since July 19. Zhao and Caixin's legal affairs consultant reported the incident to district police in Beijing on July 22. The magazine, one of China's most respected publications, condemned the attack, as well as ""any form of illegal interference,"" but said that it was confident ""that Beijing police, in accordance to Chinese law, will bring the case to light.""  The apparent hacking incident, which struck the e-mail service relied upon by many Chinese reporters and overseas dissidents for safe communications, comes less than two months after Google acknowledged that many journalists, government officials and advocates may have had their passwords stolen. In early June, Google said hundreds of Chinese Gmail users had been the targets of a broad, if unsophisticated, attack from inside China aimed at stealing passwords to monitor the e-mail of a highly selective group of government officials, political activists and journalists.  While that attack relied on a simple phishing program intended to trick users into handing over personal information, hackers inside China also mounted a more complicated invasion of Google's computer systems last year. That strike lead to a severe break in the company's relations with China, and the decision to stop cooperating with its censorship requests.  A spokesman for Google said that the company does not comment on individual user accounts, but added that Gmail has provided users with alerts for suspicious activity for over a year to counter ""account hijacking.""  Journalists and dissident bloggers, including those based in the United States who have pushed for a street protest movement in China, said they rely on Google and its technicians to provide a safe space for their sensitive communications. ""If Google falls, we would worry about our safety, but we believe that Google has better engineers than the Chinese government,"" one pseudonymous blogger, Hua Ge or Gaius Gracchus, told The Times in April. The seeming precariousness of Internet security and the sensitivity of some writers' work has also led to some false alarms. When Google's Blogger platform went down for many hours in May -- but before the company officially acknowledged any problems with its service -- Gracchus said he immediately suspected the Chinese government of orchestrating an attack on his blog, which erased all of its content. Google later said the outage had been caused by problems during planned technical maintenance of the site. The Chinese government has strenuously dismissed suggestions that it is behind any of the reported incidents of hacking.  In the case of Ms. Zhao, her e-mail account was accessed from an I.P. address that the magazine said it had traced back to the area of Hunan Province that was at the center of her reporting. While the intention of the illegal breach remains unclear, the magazine said ""the attacks have targeted Caixin Media's confidential business information."" But the series on child abductions Ms. Zhao worked on has shocked China and embarrassed local officials. The articles appeared to throw a harsh spotlight on alleged human trafficking by officials at the local family planning agency, prompting an investigation by the provincial government. One report, ""In Hunan, Family Planning Turns to Plunder,"" said that local officials had seized, and then apparently sold, children of families who had violated the countries one-child policy.  Indeed, a Caixin investigation found that children in many parts of Hunan have been sold in recent years and wound up, sometimes with help from document forgers and complacent authorities, being raised by overseas families who think they adopted Chinese orphans. But a local official in charge of the investigation told a government newspaper this month that the reports were baseless. ""The stories of missing children being abducted and trafficked to foreigners do not align with the truth,"" Zeng Dingbao, the official leading the investigation, told the state-run People's Daily, Caixin reported.  A final report on the investigation has yet to be released, and the magazine appears to be standing by its reporting, although it has not published any reply to Mr. Zeng's statement. The first reported incident of e-mail hacking against Caixin occurred several days after Mr. Zeng's comments.  "
Latvians Arrested in Scareware Scam,"5:20 p.m. | Updated  Adding that an F.B.I. raid earlier this week was related to this investigation. Federal authorities have broken up two Latvian crime rings that they say placed malware in online ads that would infect victims' computers with messages to buy fake antivirus software. One group sold $72 million of the phony software over three years, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The other caused at least $2 million in damages. Its victims included The Minneapolis Star Tribune, which sold online ad space to the group. The suspects distributed what is known as ""scareware,"" malicious software that victims sometimes unwittingly download through online ads. The victims' computer screens are taken over by ominous messages saying that their equipment is infected with a variety of viruses and that they need to buy the security software, which is in fact fraudulent. Many people fell for the ruse by giving their credit card information to buy software for up to $129.      An F.B.I. raid earlier this week on a data center in Reston, Va., was related to the scareware investigation, said a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity. The F.B.I. confiscated some servers that were unrelated to the investigation, interfering with Web sites and services including Instapaper, whose founder blogged about the situation on Thursday.  The first Latvian criminal group, which used Web pages showing phony  virus scans, among other scams, infected hundreds of thousands of computers, according to federal officials. The second group bought online ads on The Minneapolis Star Tribune's Web site to distribute their malware. To help make their scheme appear legitimate to the newspaper, they created a false  advertising agency that claimed to represent the Best Western motel chain. Initially, the accused sent ads that worked normally. After getting clearance from the newspaper staff to run the ads, the accused adjusted the computer code in the ads so that they would infect the computers of the newspaper's visitors, the Justice Department said. The defendants, Peteris Sahurovs, and Marina Maslobojeva, were arrested on Tuesday in Latvia on the charges filed in United States  District Court in Minneapolis. ""Today's operation targets cybercrime rings that stole millions of dollars from unsuspecting computer users,"" said the assistant attorney general, Lanny A. Breuer, of the Justice Department's criminal division. ""These criminal enterprises infected the computers of innocent victims with malicious scareware, and then duped them into purchasing fake anti-virus software."" He continued: ""Cybercrime is profitable, and can prey upon American consumers and companies from nearly any corner of the globe. We will continue to be aggressive and innovative in our approach to combating this international threat. At the same time, computer users must be vigilant in educating themselves about cybersecurity and taking the appropriate steps to prevent dangerous and costly intrusions."" The F.B.I. and the Justice Department worked with law enforcement in a number of countries on the investigation including Latvia, France and United Kingdom. In all, they confiscated 47 computers. During the investigation, Latvian authorities searched at least five bank accounts that were apparently used by the scam artists. The New York Times fell victim to a similar scareware scam in 2009. Eileen Murphy, a Times spokeswoman, said the scams identified on Wednesday appeared to be similar, but that  they were so common that it was difficult to know if there was a link.  "
Insurance Against Cyber Attacks Expected to Boom," Dec. 29, 11:50 a.m. | Updated    Sony is still awaiting the final tally for losses related to its data breaches earlier this year. At last count, it had 100 million compromised customer accounts, and Sony anticipated the debacle would cost $200 million. With 58 class-action suits in the works, that may be wishful thinking. But what about Sony's insurance coverage?  In a lawsuit filed in July, Sony's insurer, the Zurich American Insurance Company, said the company did not have a cyber insurance policy. It said Sony's policy only covered tangible losses like property damage, not cyber incidents. Jim Kennedy, a Sony spokesman, said that Sony has coverage for ""significant portions"" of the losses from the data breaches. ""Sony's coverage includes multiple cyber insurance policies for operations around the world, traditional general liability policies, and property insurance policies that contain express provisions covering damage or disruption to electronic data,"" Mr. Kennedy said in a statement. ""Sony has already received payments from some of its insurers, and is actively pursuing claims for additional payments."" But despite high-profile cyber attacks at Sony, Google, Epsilon, RSA and others this year, only a third of companies surveyed by Advisen, a research group, say they have purchased a cyber insurance policy. ""That's cyber insurance in a nut shell,"" said Jacob Olcott, a principal with Good Harbor Consulting's cybersecurity team. ""Everybody needs it, and most companies don't realize they don't have it until it's too late."" Experts say that more companies will buy policies in the coming year because of new Security and Exchange Commission requirements. Last October, the S.E.C. issued a new guidance requiring that companies disclose ""material"" cyber attacks and their costs to shareholders. The guidance specifically requires companies to disclose a ""description of relevant insurance coverage."" That one S.E.C. bullet point could be a boon to the cyber insurance industry. Cyber insurance has been around since the Clinton administration, but most companies tended to ""self insure"" against cyber attacks, says Robert Ackerman, a venture capitalist at Allegis Capital who specializes in cybersecurity. ""Companies don't want to talk about cyber attacks,"" Mr. Ackerman says. ""All of a sudden, breaches are now going to be more visible and people are going to have to start estimating their costs."" There are no statistics on the size of the cyber insurance industry, but Peter Foster, a senior vice president at Willis North America, an insurance broker, estimates there may be $750 million worth of premiums placed. With the recent S.E.C. measure and the frequency and severity of cyber attacks growing, Mr. Foster predicts that figure could grow by 50 percent over the next 12 to 18 months. The average cost of a data breach hit $7.2 million last year and cost companies $214 per compromised data record, according to the Ponemon Institute. And that's just for a data breach. If a company's intellectual property is stolen, it could decimate an organization. ""It is now possible to suck all the information out of a company,"" said Scott Borg, chief executive of the nonprofit United States Cyber Consequences Unit. A comprehensive cyber insurance policy should cover intellectual property theft, said Emily Freeman, a cyber insurance broker at Lockton. Most policies, Ms. Freeman said, cover the ""twin risks of privacy and security,"" which include the cost of lost business, notification costs, credit-monitoring services, public relations and legal and investigation expenses. It may also cover class-action lawsuits, regulatory investigations, civil fines and even extortion demands. ""There's no one size fits all. It depends on the size of the company and their exposure,"" Ms. Freeman said. ""I've seen companies buy a million dollars of this coverage with a small deductible. Others have bought $100 million of coverage for a rainy day - the kind of rainy day you might have to disclose to the S.E.C.""    "
Suspicions About Former Editor in Battle Over Story Complicate Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- On Dec. 21 last year, The Daily Telegraph was preparing to publish a blockbuster exclusive: Vince Cable, the government's business secretary, had been caught on tape boasting that he had ''declared war'' on Rupert Murdoch and would find a convenient legal excuse to block the News Corporation's bid for British Sky Broadcasting, Britain's most lucrative satellite television network. But the day before The Telegraph was to run the article, the paper was scooped by Robert Peston, the business editor of the BBC. Mr. Peston reported that ''a whistle-blower'' had provided him with a secretly recorded conversation between The Telegraph's undercover reporters and Mr. Cable. Senior editors at The Telegraph, furious that Mr. Peston had somehow beat them on their own story, suspected they were the victims of corporate espionage.  As the editors saw it, the person who stole the audiotape of Mr. Cable was either an enemy of the newspaper or someone with a motive to see Mr. Cable replaced by an official more willing to push forward the Murdochs' bid for BSkyB, as the network is known. Or, perhaps, the perpetrator was someone who fit both bills. The editors said they instantly suspected the hidden hand of William Lewis, the newspaper's former editor in chief, who was dismissed from the Telegraph Media Group in May 2010 after a dispute with company executives. Mr. Lewis was now working at News International, the British subsidiary of the News Corporation. The editors' suspicions grew when a computer technician at The Telegraph, Jim Robinson, left in January to work for Mr. Lewis at News International. The two celebrated the appointment over pints at a pub. The episode is significant because in recent weeks Mr. Lewis, 42, has emerged as a leader of the News Corporation's campaign to clean up the phone-hacking and police bribery scandal that has engulfed the company and raised questions about the judgment of its top executives. He is a member of the News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee. The tale of the tape is yet another twist in a scandal that has ricocheted between the people making the news and those reporting it. Those in the anything-goes British press corps had already been suspicious of one another's methods and motives. Now, every ''splash'' -- a tabloid's Page 1 story -- is assumed to have been ''nicked,'' or stolen, by a hacked phone or other illicit means. Within days of Mr. Peston's scoop last December, The Telegraph hired Kroll, the security firm, to try to determine whether the newspaper was the victim of computer hacking or outright theft of the audio recording, and to identify who might have been responsible. ''It is a matter of record that Kroll was commissioned to investigate the unauthorized removal in December 2010 of an audio recording from Telegraph Media Group,'' a Telegraph spokesman said Friday. ''They concluded that the removal of the recording was, in all probability, an act of theft orchestrated by an external organization.'' Kroll found circumstantial evidence that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Robinson were behind the episode, according to a summary of its work, though it stressed in its report that investigators had not found direct proof of the link. Mr. Lewis declined to answer questions about the episode but released a statement through a spokesman. ''This is a clear attempt to undermine the strong working relationship between News Corp.'s Management and Standards Committee and the Metropolitan Police Service,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Nothing will prevent us from continuing to cooperate fully with Operation Weeting,'' the police investigation into illegal phone hacking at The News of the World, a Murdoch newspaper, now defunct, at the heart of the scandal. A News International spokesman said Mr. Robinson had declined to comment. Neither Mr. Peston nor the BBC would answer questions on how he had obtained the interview. Kroll also declined to be interviewed for this article, saying it does not remark on matters concerning clients. The Telegraph spokesman declined to comment further or to identify remedies it might have put in place to prevent such an episode from recurring. The New York Times has pieced together a detailed account of Kroll's internal inquiry through interviews with executives at The Telegraph and a review of Kroll's executive summary of its work, which was completed last March. Kroll found that a tight circle of former employees had ''strong motivations to damage The Telegraph,'' and that they included Mr. Lewis. Kroll investigators concluded that as The Telegraph was preparing its article in December, Mr. Lewis learned about it from a former colleague at the newspaper. Kroll wrote in its report that it suspected that Mr. Lewis was ''involved in orchestrating the leak of the information.'' Kroll concluded that the leak was ''a result of unauthorized access to'' the newspaper's computer systems, ''most probably from within the organization and by someone with access to it.'' Investigators then tried to determine who on the newspaper's technology staff had access to the audio file of the Cable interview. They found about 15 people, but quickly focused on Mr. Robinson, the head of the technical support desk. Shortly after the leak, Mr. Robinson resigned to join News International ''on unusually favorable terms,'' the Kroll report said. Kroll found that before departing The Telegraph, Mr. Robinson reformatted his iPad, erasing all the data, and cut up the SIM card to his iPhone. ''As such it has been impossible to conclude whether there had been incriminating evidence on the devices,'' Kroll said. A senior executive at The Telegraph said that although the paper could not prove that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Robinson were involved, ''they had all the motive to do this.'' ''You can see how this would impress Will Lewis's new masters,'' said the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''The scoop was taken from us and given to Peston for maximum impact. And it was portrayed as if we had sat on a scoop. This would give Will Lewis big credibility in the eyes of his new bosses. And he had another motive -- revenge against us. He wanted to make this organization look silly.'' The consequences of the BBC report were enormous. Mr. Cable, a Liberal Democrat, handed over the BSkyB review portfolio to Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative culture secretary, who proceeded to greenlight Mr. Murdoch's acquisition. (The deal ultimately did not survive the hacking scandal.) The transfer was seen as a major coup by executives inside News International. At the same time, editors at The Telegraph were questioned by others in the press about why they had not yet published the comments Mr. Cable had made against Mr. Murdoch. The episode also sheds light on the close relationship between Mr. Lewis and Mr. Peston, the BBC business editor. Both men hail from north London, and have known each other for two decades. Mr. Lewis was hired in 1994 by Mr. Peston to join an investigations team at The Financial Times, where they worked together closely. Mr. Lewis went on to the New York bureau of the paper and eventually became the main news editor there. He joined The Telegraph in 2005. In recent weeks, Mr. Peston has landed several scoops about sensitive information that was passed by News International to the Metropolitan Police Service. The reports concerned police officers who were alleged to have accepted bribes from reporters at The News of the World. Many of those leaks appeared to be intended to shift the focus from News International's current leadership to Scotland Yard and Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in phone hacking and of bribing police officers. According to several executives at the News Corporation, the leaks most likely came from within the company. They prompted the Metropolitan Police to release an extraordinary statement saying it was ''extremely concerned'' about the release of selected information that was known only ''by a small number of people.'' The police said the leaks ''could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.'' On the BBC Thursday night, Mr. Peston reported that the standards committee run by Mr. Lewis had fired an editor at The Sun for ''previous work'' he had done at The News of the World. Shortly after, Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament, accused Mr. Peston on Twitter of ''distracting'' readers from questions that were raised earlier in the day about the veracity of James Murdoch's testimony at a Parliamentary committee hearing. Mr. Watson, who had questioned the Murdochs at the session on Tuesday, told Mr. Peston that ''you are being spoon-fed stories'' and accused him of being ''a patsy'' for News International. Mr. Peston dismissed Mr. Watson's accusations, saying on Twitter that they did not dignify a reply.  "
"Robert Morris, 78; Was a Pioneer in Computer Security","Robert Morris, a cryptographer who helped develop the Unix computer operating system, which controls an increasing number of the world's computers and touches almost every aspect of modern life, died on Sunday in Lebanon, N.H. He was 78. The cause was complications of dementia, his wife, Anne Farlow Morris, said.  Known as an original thinker in the computer science world, Mr. Morris also played an important clandestine role in planning what was probably the nation's first cyberwar: the electronic attacks on Saddam Hussein's government in the months leading up to the Persian Gulf war of 1991. Although details are still classified, the attacks, along with laser-guided bombs, are believed to have largely destroyed Iraq's military command and control capability before the war began. Begun as a research effort at AT&T's Bell Laboratories in the 1960s, Unix became one of the world's leading operating systems, along with Microsoft's Windows. Variations of the original Unix software, for example, now provide the foundation for Apple's iPhone iOS and Macintosh OSX as well as Google's Android operating systems. As chief scientist of the National Security Agency's National Computer Security Center, Mr. Morris gained unwanted national attention in 1988 after his son, Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student in computer science at Cornell University, wrote a computer worm -- a software program -- that was able to propel itself through the Internet, then a brand-new entity. Although it was intended to hide in the network as a bit of Kilroy-was-here digital graffiti, the program, because of a design error, spread wildly out of control, jamming more than 10 percent of the roughly 50,000 computers that made up the network at the time. After realizing his error, the younger Mr. Morris fled to his parents' home in Arnold, Md., before turning himself in to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was convicted under an early federal computer crime law, sentenced to probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and perform community service. He later received a computer science doctorate at Harvard University and is now a member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science faculty. Robert Morris was born in Boston on July 25, 1932, the son of Walter W. Morris, a salesman, and Helen Kelly Morris. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's in applied mathematics from Harvard. At Bell Laboratories he initially worked on the design of specialized software tools known as compilers, which convert programmers' instructions into machine-readable language that can be directly executed by computers. Beginning in 1970, he worked with the Unix research group at Bell Laboratories, where he was a major contributor in both the numerical functions of the operating system and its security capabilities, including the password system and encryption functions. His interest in computer security deepened in the late 1970s as he continued to explore cryptography, the study and practice of protecting information by converting it into code. With another researcher, he began working on an academic paper that unraveled an early German encryption device. Before the paper could be published, however, he received an unexpected call from the National Security Agency. The agency invited him to visit, and when he met with officials, they asked him not to publish the paper because of what it might reveal about the vulnerabilities of modern cryptographic systems. He complied, and in 1986 went to work for the agency in protecting government computers and in projects involving electronic surveillance and online warfare. Although little is known about his classified work for the government, Mr. Morris told a reporter that on occasion he would help the F.B.I. by decoding encrypted evidence. In 1994, he retired to Etna, N.H., where he was living at his death. In addition to his wife and his son Robert, of Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Morris is survived by a daughter, Meredith Morris, of Washington; another son, Benjamin, of Chester, N.J.; and two grandchildren.

Hackers' Clash With Security Firm Spotlights Inquiries to Discredit Rivals,"WASHINGTON -- A fight between a group of pro-WikiLeaks hackers and a California-based Internet security business has opened a window onto the secretive world of private companies that offer to help corporations investigate and discredit their critics. This week, hackers said they had penetrated the computers of HBGary Federal, a security company that sells investigative services to corporations, and posted tens of thousands of what appear to be its internal company e-mails on the Internet.  The documents appear to include pitches for unseemly ways to undermine adversaries of Bank of America and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, like doing background research on their critics and then distributing fake documents to embarrass them. The bank and the chamber do not appear to have directly solicited the spylike services of HBGary. Rather, HBGary offered to do the work for Hunton & Williams, a corporate law firm that has represented them. A Hunton & Williams spokesman did not comment. But spokesmen for Bank of America and the chamber said Friday that they had not known about the presentations and that HBGary was never hired on their behalf. A chamber spokesman characterized the proposal as ''abhorrent.'' Since the hacked e-mails appeared on a file-sharing network several days ago, a broad range of bloggers and journalists have been scouring them and discussing highlights on the Internet. The New York Times also obtained a copy of the archive. One document that has received particular attention is a PowerPoint presentation that said a trio of data-related companies -- HBGary, Palantir Technologies and Berico Technologies -- could help attack WikiLeaks, which is rumored to be preparing to release internal e-mails from Bank of America. One idea was to submit fake documents covertly to WikiLeaks, and then expose them as forgeries to discredit the group. It also suggested pressuring WikiLeaks' supporters -- notably Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com -- by threatening their careers. ''Without the support of people like Glenn, WikiLeaks would fold,'' the presentation said. Another set of documents proposed similar ways to embarrass adversaries of the Chamber of Commerce for an initial fee of $200,000 and $2 million later. The e-mails include what appears to be an exchange on Nov. 9, 2010, between Aaron Barr, HBGary Federal's chief executive, and John W. Woods, a Hunton & Williams partner who focuses on corporate investigations. Mr. Barr recounted biographical tidbits about the family of a one-time employee of a union-backed group that had challenged the chamber's opposition to Obama administration initiatives like health care legislation. ''They go to a Jewish church in DC,'' Mr. Barr apparently wrote. ''They have 2 kids, son and daughter.'' A week later, Mr. Barr submitted a detailed plan to Hunton & Williams for an extensive investigation into U.S. Chamber Watch and other critics of the chamber, including the possible creation of ''in-depth target dossiers'' and the identification of vulnerabilities in their computer networks that might be exploited. Another PowerPoint presentation prepared for Hunton & Williams said the research that HBGary and its partners could do for the law firm on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce would ''mitigate effect of adversarial groups'' like U.S. Chamber Watch. The presentation discussed the alleged criminal record of one leader of an antichamber group, and said the goal of its research would be to ''discredit, confuse, shame, combat, infiltrate, fracture'' the antichamber organizations. HBGary acknowledged Tuesday in a statement that it had been the victim of a ''criminal cyberattack,'' but suggested that documents placed in the public domain might be ''falsified.'' The other two businesses referred to in the apparent proposals as planned partners in the corporate investigations put out statements that distanced themselves from HBGary but did not say the documents were fake. The co-founders of Berico, Guy Filippelli and Nick Hallam, confirmed that Berico had been ''asked to develop a proposal to support a law firm'' that was helping companies ''analyze internal information security and public relations challenges,'' but said their proposal had been limited to ''analyzing publicly available information.'' They called efforts to target people ''reprehensible'' and said they were breaking all ties to HBGary, a move that Palantir executives also said they were making. The episode traces back to a dispute in December, when corporations including MasterCard, Visa and PayPal severed ties to WikiLeaks, temporarily cutting off its ability to accept donations. WikiLeaks had just begun releasing leaked State Department cables in conjunction with a consortium of news organizations, including The New York Times. Calling the companies' severing of such ties an affront to Internet freedom, a loose-knit group of computer users named Anonymous coordinated attacks on the Web sites of such companies. Mr. Barr apparently began trying to uncover the identities of those involved with Anonymous. But after he boasted of his efforts in a newspaper article, hackers attacked his company's Web site and made public the e-mails. Jonathan E. Turner, who runs a Tennessee-based business that gathers intelligence for corporate clients, said that companies nationwide relied on investigators to gather potentially damaging information on possible business partners or rivals. ''Information is power,'' said Mr. Turner, former chairman of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. He estimated that the ''competitive intelligence'' industry had 9,700 companies offering these services, with an annual market of more than $2 billion, but said there were limits to what tactics should be used. Bank of America and the Chamber of Commerce distanced themselves on Friday from any effort to embarrass or collect disparaging information about their critics. ''We have not engaged in, nor do we have any plans to engage in, the practices discussed in this alleged presentation by HBGary,'' said Lawrence DiRita, a Bank of America spokesman. Tom Collamore, a chamber spokesman, said, ''The leaked e-mails appear to show that HBGary was willing to propose questionable actions in an attempt to drum up business, but the chamber was not aware of these proposals until HBGary's e-mails leaked.''

"In Cyberattack, Virus Infects 40 Web Sites In South Korea","SEOUL, South Korea -- Forty Web sites in South Korea were attacked by a computer virus on Friday, including the official sites of the presidential Blue House, the Foreign Ministry, the country's biggest bank, the country's two largest search engines, a major online auction house and some American and Korean military sites.  It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but the National Police Agency is investigating the assault, which was discovered by AhnLab, an Internet security firm in Seoul. Computer analysts said the problems amounted to a so-called denial of service attack, in which multiple computers infected by a software virus try to access targeted Web sites simultaneously. That can overwhelm the sites with a surge of traffic that crashes their servers. WordPress, one of the largest blog-hosting sites on the Internet, was attacked this way on Thursday, the company said. A South Korean government official said Friday that there had been ''no major damage at all'' to computer systems at the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of South Korea's president. ''We were attacked, but it was defended,'' the official said, noting that the Blue House and other agencies had installed security countermeasures after a major cyberattack on South Korean government sites in July 2009. He said the effect of that attack had been ''quite chaotic.'' An AhnLab spokesman, Song Chang-min, said the two attacks had similarities, including the targeted sites. AhnLab discovered the virus on Thursday and quickly distributed a free antivirus solution for downloading. ''This wasn't as serious as 2009, but it still makes servers go down,'' Mr. Song said. ''Some Web sites going down for even a minute or two, especially commercial sites, can be a big problem. It can be critical.''  "
"For Activists, Tips on Safe Use Of Social Media","FROM Cairo to Madison, Wis., much has been made about the positive role technology has played in helping galvanize and organize populist movements. The downside? Like the dreaded telescreen in George Orwell's ''1984,'' technologies like the Internet and cellphones are proving just as useful for spying as they are for communicating, making the choice to hit ''call'' or ''send'' an increasingly risky one.  But several groups of free information advocates have emerged to help educate the latest generation of activists. To that end, one such group, Access, just released its guide to maintaining online and mobile phone security, with versions in Arabic and English. Brett Solomon, the executive director of Access, said that the guide was created in part from recognition that people often lose sight of security concerns amid the collective euphoria that can accompany swift, large-scale democratization movements like the ones in Egypt and Tunisia. ''The eye gets focused on the goal and not the process,'' he said, ''and during that time, they put their own personal security and their network security at risk.'' But it's not just the fog of enthusiasm that renders people vulnerable; it's lack of experience. ''There's actually a whole new group of people who have emerged from being citizens to becoming activists, some of them reluctantly,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''They're not necessarily aware of the dangers that are associated with being active online.'' Those dangers have become increasingly apparent in recent months. Facebook accounts were hacked in Tunisia. In Egypt, authorities shut down the Internet and cellphones, and employed technology that turned mobile phones into furtive listening devices, according to the guide. The Access guide provides tips for keeping communications safer in such a climate. It recommends Gmail, for example, because it uses a secure connection by default, known as HTTPS, like at banking Web sites; Hotmail provides HTTPS as an option, and Facebook began offering it in January. The guide also explains how to disguise browsing histories and how to gain access to banned sites. Security isn't just a concern in Middle East autocracies, or for would-be revolutionaries. Mobile phone surveillance, for example, is tough to escape for cellphone users anywhere, said Ethan Zuckerman, senior researcher at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, and a founder of Global Voices, a worldwide group of bloggers and interpreters that has produced similarly themed guides. Mr. Zuckerman regularly advises Access, as do Chris Hughes, one of Facebook's founders; the rock musician Peter Gabriel, and the MoveOn.org board president Eli Pariser. ''In general, most users aren't aware of the extent to which mobile phones can be monitored by telcos in cooperation with governments,'' Mr. Zuckerman said, referring to telecommunications companies. ''If the guide reminds people that mobile phones are inherently insecure and that we're trading off privacy and convenience in using the devices, it would be a useful outcome from the work,'' he said.

Sony Names New Management for Global PlayStation Unit,"TOKYO -- Sony said on Wednesday that it would shuffle the management of its video game unit, two months after an extensive hacking attack forced the company to shut down its popular PlayStation Network.  Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief executive of the unit, Sony Computer Entertainment, will be succeeded by Andrew House, the current head of the unit's European business, Sony said in a statement. The changes are effective Sept. 1, the company said. Mr. House will lead the company's PlayStation strategy, especially the release of the PlayStation Vita, its next-generation hand-held game machine. Vita's release comes at a time when portable gaming devices must compete with phones and other gadgets that are luring players away with inexpensive downloadable games. Mr. House must also contend with a growing threat from hackers, who have staged a flurry of attacks on Web sites and services in recent months, including several run by Sony. In mid-April, the company was forced to shut down its PlayStation Network, which lets users download games or play online, after hackers compromised personal information from up to 100 million accounts. After a monthlong scramble by Sony to bolster its online security, the network was restarted in most countries. Sony has estimated that the recovery from the breach will cost about 14 billion yen, or $173 million. Mr. House, who joined Sony in 1990, has worked in corporate communications and marketing and worked on the introduction of Sony's original PlayStation game console. He has been president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment's European unit since May 2009. Mr. Hirai is seen as a front-runner to eventually succeed Sony's chief executive, Howard Stringer, who is in his seventh year at the helm of the company. Mr. Hirai, who has been chief executive of the video game unit since December 2006, will continue to oversee the gaming business as the unit's chairman, Sony said. He will also retain his post as executive deputy president of the entire Sony group, where he is in charge of Sony's many consumer electronics lines, including its Bravia TVs and Cyber-shot digital cameras.

Enhancing Online Security,"To the Editor: ''The Cloud Darkens'' (editorial, June 30) rightly advocates for increasing online security, but doesn't mention a key component missing from most proposals to thwart cyberattacks: increased disclosure from hacked companies regarding the impact on customer data.  The revelation that the online document-storage service Dropbox tried to hide a glitch in its network that allowed any user to log into any account is but one of several examples of companies failing to adequately disclose vital information about customer data, how it is being used and what steps are being taken to mitigate the effects of cyberattacks. The need for greater disclosure is clear: cyberattacks represent one of the greatest challenges facing modern businesses and are costly to economies and society alike. According to a 2004 report by the Congressional Research Service, targeted companies suffer an average loss in stock market valuation of between $50 million and $200 million, with total consumer and business losses estimated at more than $200 billion a year. We may never be able to eradicate the pernicious effects of cyberattacks. But we can ensure that the public is not victimized twice, by pushing for more timely and transparent disclosure from affected companies. Anything less allows the hackers to win, while the public continues to lose. ROSANNA M. FISKE Chairwoman and Chief Executive Public Relations Society of America New York, June 30, 2011  "
Hacking in the Netherlands Took Aim at Internet Giants,"AMSTERDAM (AP) -- Attackers who hacked into a Dutch Web security firm have issued hundreds of fraudulent security certificates for intelligence agency Web sites, including the C.I.A., as well as for Internet giants like Google, Microsoft and Twitter, the Dutch government said on Monday.  Experts say they suspect the hacker -- or hackers -- operated with the cooperation of the Iranian government, perhaps in attempts to spy on dissidents. The latest versions of browsers including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox are now rejecting certificates issued by the firm that was hacked, DigiNotar. But in a statement on Monday, the Dutch Justice Ministry published a list of the fraudulent certificates that greatly expands the scope of the July hacking attack that DigiNotar acknowledged only last week. The list also includes certificates that were sent to sites operated by Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft, Skype, AOL, the Tor Project, WordPress, and by intelligence agencies like Israel's Mossad and Britain's MI6. DigiNotar is one of many companies that sell the security certificates widely used to authenticate Web sites and guarantee that communications between a user's browser and a site are secure. In theory, a fraudulent certificate can be used to trick a user into visiting a fake version of a Web site, or used to monitor communications with the real sites without users noticing. But in order to pass off a fake certificate, a hacker must be able to steer his target's Internet traffic through a server that he controls. That is something only an Internet service provider, or a government that commands one, can easily do. Technology experts cite a number of reasons to believe the attack is connected to Iran. Notably, several of the certificates contain nationalist slogans in Farsi, the language spoken by most Iranians. ''This, in combination with messages the hacker left behind on DigiNotar's Web site, definitely suggests that Iran was involved,'' said Ot van Daalen, director of Bits of Freedom, an online civil liberties group. So far, only a handful of users in Iran is known to have been affected. The attack on DigiNotar closely resembles one in March of the United States security firm Comodo Inc., which was also attributed to an Iranian. Although no users in the Netherlands are known to have been victimized directly, the breach has caused a major headache for the Dutch government, which relied on DigiNotar to authenticate most of its Web sites. In a news conference on Saturday, the Dutch justice minister, Piet Hein Donner, said the safety of Web sites -- including the country's social security agency, police and tax authorities -- could no longer be guaranteed. He advised users who wanted to be certain of secure communication with the government to use pen and paper. The Dutch government took over management of DigiNotar, a subsidiary of Vasco Inc., which is based in Chicago, but kept the Web sites operating as it scrambled to find replacement security providers.

"For Hackers, The Next Lock To Pick","SAN FRANCISCO -- Hackers have broken into the cellphones of celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Prince William. But what about the rest of us, who might not have particularly salacious photos or voice messages stored in our phones, but nonetheless have e-mails, credit card numbers and records of our locations? A growing number of companies, including start-ups and big names in computer security like McAfee, Symantec, Sophos and AVG, see a business opportunity in mobile security -- protecting cellphones from hacks and malware that could read text messages, store location information or add charges directly to mobile phone bills. On Tuesday, McAfee introduced a service for consumers to protect their smartphones, tablets and computers at once, and last week the company introduced a mobile security system for businesses. Last month, AT&T partnered with Juniper Networks to build mobile security apps for consumers and businesses. The Defense Department has called for companies and universities to come up with ways to protect Android devices from malware.  In an indication of investor interest, one start-up, Lookout, last week raised $40 million from venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, bringing its total to $76.5 million. The company makes an app that scans other apps that people download to their phones, looking for malware and viruses. It automatically tracks 700,000 mobile apps and updates Lookout whenever it finds a threat. Still, in some ways, it's an industry ahead of its time. Experts in mobile security agree that mobile hackers are not yet much of a threat. But that is poised to change quickly, they say, especially as people increasingly use their phones to exchange money, by mobile shopping or using digital wallets like Google Wallet. ''Unlike PCs, the chance of running into something in the wild for your phone is quite low,'' said Charlie Miller, a researcher at Accuvant, a security consulting company, and a hacker who has revealed weaknesses in iPhones. ''That's partly because it's more secure but mostly because the bad guys haven't gotten around to it yet. But the bad guys are going to slowly follow the money over to your phones.'' Most consumers, though they protect their computers, are unaware that they need to secure their phones, he said, ''but the smartphones people have are computers, and the same thing that can happen on your computer can happen on your phone.'' Cellphone users are more likely than computer users to click on dangerous links or download sketchy apps because they are often distracted, experts say. Phones can be more vulnerable because they connect to wireless networks at the gym or the coffee shop, and hackers can surreptitiously charge consumers for a purchase. There have already been harmful attacks, most of which have originated in China, said John Hering, co-founder and chief executive of Lookout. For example, this year, the Android market was hit by malware called DroidDream. Hackers pirated 80 applications, added malicious code and tricked users into downloading them from the Android Market. Google said 260,000 devices were attacked. Also this year, people unwittingly downloaded other malware, called GGTracker, by clicking on links in ads, and on the Web site to which the links led. The malware signed them up, without their consent, for text message subscription services that charged $10 to $50. Lookout says that up to a million people were afflicted by mobile malware in the first half of the year, and that the threat for Android users is two and a half times higher than it was just six months ago. Still, other experts caution that fear is profitable for the security industry, and that consumers should be realistic about the small size of the threat at this point. AdaptiveMobile, which sells mobile security tools, found that 6 percent of smartphone users said they had received a virus, but that the actual number of confirmed viruses had not topped 2 percent. Lookout's founders are hackers themselves, though they say they are the good kind, who break into phones and computers to expose the risks but not to steal information or behave maliciously. ''It's very James Bond-type stuff,'' Mr. Hering said. A few years ago, he stood with a backpack filled with hacking gear near the Academy Awards red carpet and discovered that up to 100 of the stars carried, in their bejeweled clutches and tuxedo pockets, cellphones that he could break into. He did not break into the phones, but publicized his ability to do so. He started Lookout in 2007, along with Kevin Mahaffey and James Burgess, to prevent such intrusions. It has free apps for Android, BlackBerry and Windows phones, but not for iPhones. They are less vulnerable to attacks, security experts say, because Apple's app store, unlike Android's, screens every app before accepting it. Also, Android is the fastest-growing mobile platform, so it is more attractive to hackers. Google says it regularly scans apps in the Android Market for malware and can rapidly remove malicious apps from the market and from people's phones. It prevents Android apps from accessing other apps and alerts users if an app accesses its contact list or location, for instance. Lookout also sells a paid version for $3 a month, which scans apps for privacy intrusions like accessing a user's contact list, alerts users if they visit unsafe mobile Web sites or click on unsafe links in text messages, backs up a phone's call history and photos, and lets people lock or delete information from lost devices. T-Mobile builds Lookout into its Android phones, Verizon uses its technology to screen apps in its app store and Sprint markets the app to customers. The cellphone carriers and Lookout share the revenue when a user upgrades to the paid version. ''In mobile security circles, you never wait on it to become a problem and it's too late,'' said Fared Adib, vice president of product development at Sprint. Meanwhile, because mobile phone attacks are still relatively rare, Lookout's free app includes tools, including a way to back up a user's contacts and a feature that enables users to turn on an alarm on their phone when it is lost. ''You're way more likely to just leave it in a cab than you are going to be attacked by a hacker,'' said Mr. Miller, the security researcher. And in addition to collecting money from paying subscribers, Lookout plans to sell the service to businesses. It has a chance because consumers are increasingly bringing their own technologies into the workplace, and Lookout's app is consumer-friendly, said Chenxi Wang, a security analyst at Forrester Research. ''It's something a lot of I.T. guys are worried about because they have no control over what consumers are doing and what these apps are doing,'' Ms. Wang said. Giovanni Vigna, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara who studies security and malware, said it was only a matter of time before mobile security was as second nature to consumers as computer security. ''The moment malware starts using text messages and expensive minutes people have to pay for, things will move a lot faster,'' he said.  "
Detective in Phone Hacking Inquiry Is Arrested,"LONDON -- A Scotland Yard detective has been arrested on suspicion of leaking details about the phone hacking case to the news media, the police said on Friday. The detective, described as a 51-year-old man, was arrested at work on Thursday ''on suspicion of misconduct in a public office relating to an unauthorized disclosure of information,'' the police said. He has not been charged, but was released and ordered to report back for further questioning on Sept. 29. He has been suspended from his job. The police would not identify the detective, but said he was assigned to Operation Weeting, which is looking into allegations of phone hacking at the now-defunct tabloid The News of the World and other newspapers.  Leaking to the news media is technically a criminal offense. But such disclosures have long been common practice for some police officers who work frequently with the news media, and it is highly unusual for an officer to be arrested on suspicion of merely leaking information. A second investigation is looking at charges that some reporters and editors paid the police for information, but no officers have been arrested in that case. A person close to the investigation said it was likely that the Operation Weeting leaks at issue in Thursday's arrest were recent ones, perhaps having to do with the disclosure of the names of people arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking. The police typically do not name suspects until they have been formally charged, identifying them instead by gender and age. The arrest of the suspected leaker seems designed to send a signal that the leader of the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, is angry about the disclosures and is determined to keep details of the investigation out of the public domain. ''I made it very clear when I took on this investigation the need for operational and information security,'' Commissioner Akers said in a statement. ''It is hugely disappointing that this may not have been adhered to.'' She added that the police department ''takes the unauthorized disclosure of information extremely seriously and has acted swiftly in making this arrest.'' A former Scotland Yard official with knowledge of the inquiry said it was both surprising and unusual that the first arrest of an officer was for reportedly leaking information to the news media about the phone hacking investigation rather than selling information to The News of the World. A separate Metropolitan Police inquiry is investigating e-mails that suggest police officers sold classified contact information about public figures, including members of the royal family, to reporters and editors at The News of the World. The police also said that a second man was arrested on Friday as part of Operation Weeting, bringing to 14 the number of people arrested so far on suspicion of phone hacking or illegally accessing voice mail messages. With the recent addition of 20 new officers, there are now 65 investigators working full time on the case. The man, 35, was named by Sky News as Dan Evans, a former reporter for The News of the World. The newspaper suspended Mr. Evans in the spring of 2010 after his name emerged as part of a civil suit brought against it by the interior designer Kelly Hoppen. Ms. Hoppen, the stepmother of the actress Sienna Miller, claimed that her phone had been hacked into. Ms. Hoppen's case began with information seized by the police in 2006, when the first phone hacking case -- involving Clive Goodman, the former royal reporter for The News of the World, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired by the paper -- came to light. At the time, the police seized 12,000 pages of documentation from Mr. Mulcaire that included lists of cellphone numbers, PINs and names of people whose messages he might have illegally intercepted. Both Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Goodman were convicted in 2007; each served several months in jail. But this arrest seems to stem from a more recent episode. If that is the case, it would contradict assertions at the time by the paper's parent company, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, that after the arrests The News of the World cracked down, putting a stop to phone hacking. Until last winter, the company said that the hacking had been limited to one ''rogue'' reporter -- Mr. Goodman. According to Sky, the detective arrested on Thursday is suspected of leaking information to the newspaper The Guardian, which has consistently revealed more details than its competitors about the hacking arrests. On its Web site, The Guardian said it would not comment on the allegations, merely saying, ''We note the arrest.'' The paper quoted a spokesperson as saying: ''On the broader point raised by the arrest, journalists would no doubt be concerned if conversations between off-the-record sources and reporters came routinely to be regarded as criminal activity. In common with all news organizations we have no comment to make on the sources of our journalism.'' News International, the British newspaper arm of the News Corporation, said it was cooperating with the investigation and would have no comment about the arrests.  "
"At a Hacker Conference, Plenty of Friendly Federal Agents","LAS VEGAS -- Why are  federal agents hobnobbing with hackers? Defcon, a convention of computer hackers here, was crawling with federal agents on Friday. They smiled, shook hands, handed out their business cards, spoke on a panel called ""Meet the Federal Agent 2.0"" and were really, really nice. Naturally, the agents  have been hanging out at hacker gatherings for years for the purposes of snooping. ""Cloak and dagger,"" as one federal agent put it. This time they came with another purpose: to chat, impress and, perhaps ultimately, lure. The United States Cyber Command, the Pentagon's Internet defense arm,  ""has a work force issue,"" said Daron Hartvigsen, special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.   ""We have needs that some in this community can solve. We need folks with skills."" Government agencies especially need computer professionals with cybersecurity skills. At Defcon, these skills were in ample supply --  and they can alternately thrill and scare.  There were hackers and lockpickers here, problem solvers, troublemakers and assorted geeks. There were attendees with mohawks and blue hair, and some with blue mohawks. One wore a cape. A few wore kilts. Those without tattoos seemed to be in a minority. And most, whether out of fear or conceit, insisted on using their digital nicknames rather than their real ones: LosT, alien, Abstract.  In their midst were Internet crime investigators representing the Army, Navy, Air Force and NASA. The F.B.I.  set up a recruiting table at a related conference of security professionals earlier in the week. An official from the National Security Agency was scheduled to speak to next-generation hackers at a two-day event called Defcon Kids on Saturday. For the agents, it seemed less an aggressive recruiting drive than a public diplomacy mission. They spoke about their computer science degrees. They took pains to describe themselves as lovable  under their crew cuts. Ryan Pittman, an ex-police offier who now works computer security  cases in the Army's criminal investigations division, said the convention was an opportunity to whittle away the image of  ""jackbooted thugs."" Ahmed Saleh, a computer crimes investigator with NASA, described a job that might be appealing ""if you're a geek and you want to catch the bad guys."" There seemed to be plenty of receptive hackers. Christine Banek, a 29-year-old software programmer with plum-colored hair, sidled up to Mr. Saleh after the panel and asked if his agency was still hiring. She said she had applied online and had not heard back. ""If they were offering, I would totally take it,"" she said. Later, she suggested aloud that the government legalize marijuana. Positive drug tests generally disqualify a candidate from a law enforcement position. The audience had many questions. What do you do if you're asked to do something you're morally opposed to? Mr. Saleh said he had never been put in that situation, but that an employee at Starbucks could face a similar dilemma. (Really, on the morality of soy lattes?)   Do you use informants in computer cases, as you would in other cases? Yes. Do the agents  attack the computer systems of suspects? No. How seriously do the agents regard  Lulz Security, the loose-knit vigilante group under the F.B.I.'s watch  lately for attacking government and corporate Web sites, asked a young man from Sacramento. Mr. Hartvigsen said it would not be prudent to comment on an active case, offering only: ""We investigate folks who break the law."" One could be forgiven for wondering whether the agents  might feel compelled to do a bit of cloak-and-dagger at the conference, too. After all, there was some braggadocio from proclaimed members of the hacking collectives that are under investigation. One prominent member, who goes by the  nickname Sabu, posted taunts on Twitter Friday afternoon, suggesting, probably falsely, that the agents were unwittingly hobnobbing with him too at DefCon. He wrote: ""LOL to the two Feds that came to the booth.""  "
Former Editor Denies Knowing That Missing Girl's Phone Was Hacked,"Last Updated | 5:23 p.m. In response to the allegation that journalists at a British tabloid, The News of the World, hacked into the voice-mail account of a missing schoolgirl in 2002, the paper's former editor, who is now chief executive of the British newspaper division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, issued a statement in which she denied any knowledge of the affair. As my colleague Sarah Lyall reports, a new investigation into the practice of phone hacking by the Murdoch-owned News of the World has revealed that the paper deleted voice mail messages on the phone of a 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, after she disappeared in 2002 and before her murdered body was discovered, a lawyer for the girl's family said Monday.  Rebekah Brooks, who was the editor of The News of the World at the time and is now the chief executive of News International, a division of News Corporation, wrote in a letter to staff members on Monday: We were all appalled and shocked when we heard about these allegations yesterday. I have to tell you that I am sickened that these events are alleged to have happened. Not just because I was Editor of The News of the World at the time, but if the accusations are true, the devastating effect on Milly Dowler's family is unforgivable.... It is almost too horrific to believe that a professional journalist or even a freelance inquiry agent working on behalf of a member of the News of the World staff could behave in this way. If the allegations are proved to be true then I can promise the strongest possible action will be taken as this company will not tolerate such disgraceful behavior. I hope that you all realize it is inconceivable that I knew or worse, sanctioned these appalling allegations.  The complete text of the letter from Ms. Brooks was posted on the Web site of Sky News, which is part-owned by News Corporation. Mr. Murdoch's company is currently trying to gain full control of BSkyB, the satellite network that owns Sky News, and has promised to spin off Sky News to win regulatory approval from the British government for the deal. In her statement, Ms. Brooks also wrote that she was ""proud of the many successful newspaper campaigns at The Sun and The News of the World under my editorship."" She added: ""The battle for better protection of children from paedophiles and better rights for the families and the victims of these crimes defined my editorships."" Perhaps the most famous of those campaigns was launched by The News of the World in 2000, the year Ms. Brooks became its editor and the paper set out to ''name and shame'' sex offenders who had been released from prison. As my colleague Ms. Lyall reported in 2001: The campaign led to lynch-mob attacks, firebombings and rioting in at least 11 communities, with vigilantes in some cases attacking people who looked like the men pictured or who had been incorrectly identified as past offenders. In one town, the home of a pediatrician was attacked when anti-pedophile campaigners got their spelling confused.  According to The Guardian, which first reported the disclosure about the hacking of Milly Dowler's voice-mail account on Monday, in the days after the girl went missing in 2002, as her family and friends called her phone and left messages urging her to reply, ""The News of the World was listening and recording their every private word."" The Guardian's report continues: But the journalists at The News of the World then encountered a problem. Milly's voice mail box filled up and would accept no more messages. Apparently thirsty for more information from more voice mails, the paper intervened - and deleted the messages that had been left in the first few days after her disappearance. According to one source, this had a devastating effect: when her friends and family called again and discovered that her voice mail had been cleared, they concluded that this must have been done by Milly herself and, therefore, that she must still be alive. But she was not. The interference created false hope and extra agony for those who were misled by it. During a news conference in Afghanistan on Monday, the British prime minister, David Cameron, who reportedly spent time at Ms. Brooks's home last Christmas, called the allegations ""quite shocking.""  This video report from Britain's ITN on the affair includes some of Mr. Cameron's comments: Another former editor of The News of the World, Andy Coulson, resigned as Mr. Cameron's chief media adviser in January, saying that questions about the phone-hacking scandal had become a distraction. An an investigation of the phone hacking scandal last year by The New York Times Magazine suggested that the technique of intercepting voice-mail messaged was more widely used by News of the World reporters when Mr. Coulson was the newspaper's editor than had previously been known. As Bloomberg News reports, Mr. Coulson was the deputy editor of The News of the World when the newspaper ""printed a story based on a voice-mail left on Dowler's mobile phone on April 14, 2002, when she had been missing from her home in Surrey, southwest of London, for more than three weeks."" The limited scope of the initial police investigation into phone hacking at The News of the World, which led to the conviction of the paper's royal correspondent and a private investigator, also raised questions about the relationship between the tabloid press and British police. In 2003, Ms. Brooks, sitting next to Mr. Coulson, told a parliamentary committee, ""We have paid the police for information in the past."" Two months ago, The Guardian reported that Ms. Brooks wrote to another parliamentary committee in London to clarify those remarks. In that letter, Ms. Brooks wrote that she had no ""knowledge of any specific cases"" in which payments were made to police officers by News International, and had been speaking in general terms about the British newspaper industry when she gave that answer eight years ago. Mr. Cameron's closeness to the two former editors of the tabloid is a reminder of what a powerful role Mr. Murdoch's media empire plays in British politics. Earlier this year, Adam Curtis, a British filmmaker, published a fascinating post on his blog, ""Rupert Murdoch - a Portrait of Satan,"" which uses old BBC news reports and documentaries to explain how the relationship between Mr. Murdoch and the British establishment began in the 1960s, when the Australian press baron took over The News of the World. As Andrew Sparrow reports on a Guardian live blog, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has decided to allow an emergency debate on the phone-hacking scandal, which will take place on Wednesday and last three hours. Paul Waugh, the editor of the British Web site PoliticsHome.com, explained on Twitter: ""Speaker Bercow's decision means Labour MPs have 3 clear hours tomorrow to use Parliamentary Privilege to air fresh allegations re: hacking."" Later on Tuesday, Hugh Grant, who revealed in May that British police had informed him that he had been a victim of phone hacking, called for a public inquiry into the affair in an interview with Britain's Channel 4 News.  In April, Mr. Grant published a transcript of a conversation with a former News of the World journalist about phone hacking -- which was secretly recorded by the actor -- in The New Statesman, a British magazine. According to the transcript of that conversation, Mr. Grant asked the former journalist, Paul McMullan, about rumors that tabloid newspapers might have hacked into the phones of family and friends of Milly Dowler and two other girls who had been abducted and later killed. Mr. McMullan answered: ""Yeah. Yeah. It's more than likely. Yeah.... It was quite routine.""  "
Spammers and Their Bankers,"In early 2004 Bill Gates claimed that ''two years from now, spam will be solved.'' Today it amounts to 70 percent of all e-mail. Yet there may be a chance to cut it back.  In March, spam volumes tumbled as United States marshals seized computers at Internet hosting facilities that controlled Rustock, a huge spamming network. The seizure followed a lawsuit by Microsoft against Rustock's operators for violating its trademarks with spam that fraudulently claimed a Microsoft link. Spam volumes had already been declining sharply, as smaller networks were taken down. According to Symantec, an Internet security company, spammers were sending an average of 180 billion messages a day last August. On Wednesday, they were down to 39.4 billion. It is too early to declare victory. Symantec detected a small spam rebound in May. Tracking down and seizing computers is not easy -- even if there is a clear legal basis. We still do not know who operated Rustock. Entities from as far away as Azerbaijan leased computers from hosting firms around the United States. These controlled a million ''zombie computers,'' which unbeknownst to their owners sent thousands of spam messages a day. The good news is there may be other ways to disrupt spammers. The Times's John Markoff reported that computer scientists at two University of California campuses have found another vulnerability: spammers' banks. To track the flow of information, the researchers made hundreds of purchases. Buying Viagra from the Pharmacy Express group in Russia involved computers in Brazil, China and Turkey. The Viagra came from India. But 95 percent of the purchases were handled by three banks -- in Azerbaijan, Latvia and St. Kitts and Nevis. This suggests that if banks or credit card companies refused to settle payments for some transactions with these banks, they could deliver a blow to the spam economy. After Congress moved to suppress online gambling, Visa and Mastercard blocked payments for American players. Similarly, Congress might require them to block, say, card-not-present pharmaceutical purchases on the grounds that it is illegal for individuals to import drugs. Though spammers might be able to change banks, the process would be cumbersome. The concentration of business in three banks suggests there aren't that many willing to deal with spammers. It's certainly worth pursuing.  "
Android Is No. 1 Target of Mobile Hackers,"""Chaos."" This is the word McAfee, the antivirus and computer security company, chose to describe the state of desktop and mobile hacking in a new report issued this week. The ""McAfee Threats Report"" said that a rise in ""hacktivism"" from groups like Lulz Security, or LulzSec, and Anonymous, helped drive a drastic increase in online attacks in recent months. McAfee also found that GoogleAndroid is now the most targeted mobile platform by hackers. Over the past several months LulzSec caused havoc online when it began hacking dozens of Web sites belonging to government agencies and corporations. McAfee said in its report that LulzSec's brazen hacks were done with the hope of bringing turmoil to the Web, mostly for fun, rather than a monetary goal. Although some suspected members of LulzSec have been arrested by police, there are new threats that have emerged by hackers who are targeting Android users. ""There is malware ending up on Android phones that is coming out of China and is being used to steal the identity of Android users,"" said Dave Marcus, director of security research at McAfee Labs, in a phone interview. ""Once hackers take control of an Android device, they have access to any kind of information on there including personal data, GPS logs and carrier and billing code information."" McAfee said in its report that Android was previously the third most targeted mobile device by hackers; it is is now No. 1 - not a title Google will likely be proud of. Google did not respond to a request for comment about the McAfee report. Mr. Marcus said Android users have become the top target for malware developers because Google does not use a vetting process to monitor the distribution of new mobile apps. Anyone can share an app on the Google Marketplace, including hackers who hide malware inside free mobile software and games. In comparison, Apple monitors and approves each application it allows into the iTunes App Store. ""We certainly see this trend to hack mobile phones as something that is going to continue to grow over the next year,"" Mr. Marcus said. ""These cyber criminals are having some success when it comes to stealing information through Trojan viruses on Android phones. Why would they stop if it's working?""   "

Q&A: Getting a Response From Stalled Software,"Q. What causes a long pause with ""Not Responding"" indicated at the top of a program's window?  A. The ""Not Responding"" label at the top of a program's window (or in a task manager utility where a list of running programs is displayed) means that particular program has stopped communicating with computer's operating system. This could be because the program is tied up doing some sort of intensive processing work behind the scenes, and may become responsive again after it finishes its task.   The ""Not Responding"" tag may also mean that the program has just stalled out into a completely inert state and needs to be restarted. Programs can get hung up and stop responding for a number of reasons, including programming errors, hardware glitches, or conflicts with other applications on the system. If a program always hangs when you work on a certain document, there could be a problem with that particular file.  Malicious software may also be interfering with your programs and draining system resources. If you have not updated your antispyware and antivirus software lately, update the programs and run a system scan. (If you do not have any security software, even a free program is better than nothing.)  If you notice that programs stop responding when you use certain peripherals like a printer, check to make sure you have all the latest drivers for your hardware. Updating your operating system with the latest security patches and system software may also help, as well as making sure you have the most recent updates for the software that stops responding most often.

British to Expand Inquiry Into Murdoch Media,"LONDON -- Scotland Yard will expand its investigation of The News of the World and its parent company, police officials said Saturday, adding a new inquiry into possible instances of computer intrusion to the current accusations of phone hacking and payments to police officers.  The new investigation was opened after an examination of ''a number of allegations regarding breach of privacy'' received since the Metropolitan Police, also known as Scotland Yard, reopened inquiries in January into possible crimes by newspaper employees, a statement said. A police spokesman declined to answer further questions. But a former British Army intelligence officer, Ian Hurst, said in a statement that he had been contacted by investigators over allegations that he had made ''in regards to my family's computer being illegally accessed over a sustained period during 2006.'' Mr. Hurst had worked in Northern Ireland, running undercover operations. The BBC reported this year that his computer had been hacked and sensitive e-mail had been provided to The News of the World. A spokeswoman for News International refused to comment on the new inquiry. The investigation opens a new front for News International, the British arm of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, already shaken by a scandal that has seen the 168-year-old News of the World shuttered on a few days' notice and the resignations of two of Britain's top police officers. Dozens of civil lawsuits have been filed over allegations of phone hacking. And 10 former News of the World employees, including the newspaper's former editor, Andy Coulson, and the former News International chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, have been arrested in relation to two criminal investigations into the hacking and payments to police officers for information. The United States Department of Justice and the F.B.I. have also announced preliminary investigations into whether the wrongdoing had tainted Mr. Murdoch's American interests. On Friday, John Whittingdale, chairman of a parliamentary investigative panel, said it was likely that James Murdoch, the heir-apparent to his father's businesses, would be recalled to testify because of allegations that he had previously misled Parliament. Mr. Murdoch told the committee this month that he had no knowledge of more widespread wrongdoing at The News of the World when he approved a $1.1 million legal settlement, with a confidentiality agreement, in the first lawsuit brought over phone hacking in 2007. Senior colleagues have since disputed that account.  "
Britain: Another Arrest Is Made in Hacking Inquiry,"LONDON -- A 31-year-old woman has been arrested as part of the investigation into voice mail hacking at Rupert Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World, police officials said Wednesday.  The woman was accused of ''conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages,'' according to a statement from Scotland Yard. She was arrested early on Wednesday and held at a police station in Northumbria, in northeast England. She is the 17th person to be arrested since police opened a comprehensive inquiry into accusations that the newspaper had hacked the messages of almost 6,000 celebrities and newsworthy figures between 2001 and 2009 in search of scoops. The scandal has seen Mr. Murdoch and his son James called before Parliament; two of Britain's top police officers have been forced to resign; and the Prime Minister David Cameron questioned over his hiring of a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his spokesman. Mr. Coulson was among those arrested. Scotland Yard declined to identify the woman, or to provide further information, but the BBC and other British news media named her as Bethany Usher, a former News of the World reporter who is currently a lecturer in journalism at Teesside University. Ms. Usher did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. The police announced last week that they had made the first arrest in a connected investigation into computer hacking. A 52-year-old man was detained on the outskirts of London on suspicion of unspecified offenses involving computer misuse and invasion of privacy. He has not been identified by name, but was granted bail until December. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
If You Can't Trust Caller ID...,"Caller ID has been celebrated as a defense against unwelcome phone pitches. But it is backfiring. Telemarketers increasingly are disguising their real identities and phone numbers to provoke people to pick up the phone. ''Humane Soc.'' may not be the Humane Society. And think the I.R.S. is on the line? Think again. Caller ID, in other words, is becoming fake ID. ''You don't know who is on the other end of the line, no matter what your caller ID might say,'' said Sandy Chalmers, a division manager at the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection in Wisconsin.  Starting this summer, she said, the state has been warning consumers: ''Do not trust your caller ID. And if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information, hang up.'' Regulators in Wisconsin and many other states are hearing a significant jump in complaints about what is often called ''caller ID spoofing'' or ''call laundering.'' The rise of such tactics has prompted the Federal Trade Commission, which already prohibits telemarketers from masking their identity, to consider new rules. And last year, the Federal Communications Commission introduced rules to strengthen enforcement against the practice, and law enforcement officials in many states are working on other ways to combat it. Such efforts have done little, though, to help people like Thomas Harbon, 74, a retired computer science professor who lives in Anderson, Ind. He has complained several times to state officials about the spate of calls that have made him distrustful of caller ID. Sometimes, the calls appear to come from his town. Lately, if he is curious enough to pick up, he hears a recorded voice from someone named Rachel offering help with credit card interest rates. ''Sometimes it looks legitimate, and I'll pick up and hear 'This is Rachel from...' and that's about all she gets because I cut it off,'' Mr. Harbon said. Several federal rules prohibit forms of caller ID spoofing and laundering. Under the Truth in Caller ID Act, passed last year and enforced by the F.C.C., it is illegal to transmit inaccurate or misleading caller ID information ''with the intent to defraud, cause harm or wrongfully obtain anything of value.'' The F.C.C. said it has received complaints about caller ID spoofing, but declined to say whether it is investigating any of them. Privacy and consumer advocates say caller ID spoofing started on a small scale several years ago, but has risen sharply recently. The authorities say many spoofers are debt collectors or companies that promise to help consumers reduce their credit card payments or other debts. Julie Schultz, 46, a homemaker in Chicago, started getting 30 calls a week from debt collectors in the spring of 2010, after a run of bad luck, including a car accident that severely injured her husband, left her family unable to make its minimum credit card payments. But the calls typically showed up on her caller ID as a string of zeros, a local number without a name or even, in one case, ''Humane Soc.'' ''They want you to pick up that phone because you think it's somebody else or an important call that you're expecting,'' Ms. Schultz said. She has hired a lawyer who has taken on a handful of clients suing telemarketers. As laws have tightened, technology has made it easier for spoofers to cloak themselves and avoid getting caught. For instance, law enforcement officials say, it is easy to route a call onto the Internet and back onto the public telephone network, thereby masking the call's origin. Companies can also use free software or inexpensive services to have a fictitious name appear on caller ID. These services are often used for legitimate reasons by companies wanting to identify themselves to callers, but they can also be used to create aliases. Automated dialing technology, known as robocalling, which lets telemarketers place thousands of calls per second, has added to the problem of caller ID spoofing. The trade commission has received an explosion of complaints about telemarketing and robocalls. In September, it received 140,000 complaints about prerecorded robocalls, more than double the 61,000 complaints in the same month a year ago, the agency said. In addition, the F.T.C. said on Tuesday that it had filed a complaint against a company that it said violated its rules prohibiting the use of robocalling by telemarketers and the masking of caller ID. The agency said Sonkei Communications sold robocall services to telemarketers that generated tens of thousands of consumer complaints. The telemarketers sold home security systems, credit card services and programs, using caller ID readouts that said ''Service Message'' or ''Service Announcement,'' the F.T.C. said. Sonkei Communications could not be reached for comment. Law enforcement officials around the country said they were also seeing more fake caller IDs. ''It's just grown and grown,'' said Marguerite Sweeney, the head of telephone privacy enforcement for the Indiana attorney general. She said the state had heard from about 5,000 residents this year complaining about some form of caller ID spoofing. The tricks are getting more sophisticated, she added. In some cases, consumers complain that when they call back the number on their phone, they hear an automated recording for a ''do not call'' list, offering to take the caller's number. Ms. Sweeney said she assumed the scheme was intended to gather numbers of people who might be willing to entertain a telemarketing pitch. In other cases, she said, a number shows up on caller ID from a legitimate local business that is being used as a cover for a telemarketing pitch. ''Some random business or a person will call us and say, 'I'm getting irate calls from people saying I'm dialing them,' '' she said. In North Carolina, officials said they were seeing big growth in caller ID spoofing from companies promising to consolidate credit card debt and, more recently, marketers selling what they claim are inexpensive medical products to treat diabetes. When the state tries to trace the numbers, officials say, they wind up following a labyrinth that leads to China, Panama or the Philippines. They have also heard of cases of caller ID reading ''F.B.I.'' or ''I.R.S.'' For the most part, according to consumer advocates, the problem has been relegated to landlines. But they worry it threatens to spread to cellphones if proposed legislation passes that would allow businesses to use robocalls to reach consumers on their cellphones. Advocates for the legislation, the Mobile Information Call Act, say it is necessary because a growing number of Americans use only cellphones or rarely use landlines anymore. Under the legislation, businesses and nonprofit organizations could reach people on their cellphones to ''deliver information calls for commercial purposes.'' Attorney General Greg Zoeller of Indiana, who testified before Congress against the legislation, said he worried that the proposed rules threaten to pre-empt states from prohibiting sales pitches by cellphone. And then, he worries, caller ID on cellphones will be taken over by fake ID's. ''The misuse of this could have people afraid to answer their cellphones the way they have their landlines,'' he said.

Group Posts What It Says Are Iranian Government E-Mails,"Anonymous, a group of activist computer hackers, posted more than 10,000 e-mails Friday that it said were taken from Iranian government servers. Most of the e-mails were related to visa requests for individuals hoping to enter Iran, with the bulk of the messages being sent from the  country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visa-seekers. The group apparently intended the release to demonstrate that it could successfully penetrate Iranian networks.  A file containing the e-mails was originally uploaded to the file-sharing Web site The Pirate Bay and shared freely with the hope that a large number of people would download the messages. Anonymous members later posted the files on dozens of other file-sharing sites, asking people to help distribute and archive the documents. An individual who claimed responsibility for the data breach also posted  instructions showing how the group gained access to the Iranian servers and suggested how to proceed with further attacks on the Iranian government. One of the suggested next steps included bringing down a number of Iranian Web sites with a denial of service attack. The individual also warned other Anonymous users to only target Web sites in Iran, noting that the goal of the operation was ""about freeing the oppressed."" The collection of e-mail uploaded to the file-sharing Web sites was called ""Anonymous Operation Iran TOP SECRET FILES!""  The Iranian Consulate in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.   "
U.S. Weighed Use Of Cyberattacks To Weaken Libya,"WASHINGTON -- Just before the American-led strikes against Libya in March, the Obama administration intensely debated whether to open the mission with a new kind of warfare: a cyberoffensive to disrupt and even disable the Qaddafi government's air-defense system, which threatened allied warplanes. While the exact techniques under consideration remain classified, the goal would have been to break through the firewalls of the Libyan government's computer networks to sever military communications links and prevent the early-warning radars from gathering information and relaying it to missile batteries aiming at NATO warplanes.  But administration officials and even some military officers balked, fearing that it might set a precedent for other nations, in particular Russia or China, to carry out such offensives of their own, and questioning whether the attack could be mounted on such short notice. They were also unable to resolve whether the president had the power to proceed with such an attack without informing Congress. In the end, American officials rejected cyberwarfare and used conventional aircraft, cruise missiles and drones to strike the Libyan air-defense missiles and radars used by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's government. This previously undisclosed debate among a small circle of advisers demonstrates that cyberoffensives are a growing form of warfare. The question the United States faces is whether and when to cross the threshold into overt cyberattacks. Last year, a Stuxnet computer worm apparently wiped out a part of Iran's nuclear centrifuges and delayed its ability to produce nuclear fuel. Although no entity has acknowledged being the source of the poisonous code, some evidence suggests that the virus was an American-Israeli project. And the Pentagon and military contractors regularly repel attacks on their computer networks -- many coming from China and Russia. The Obama administration is revving up the nation's digital capabilities, while publicly emphasizing only its efforts to defend vital government, military and public infrastructure networks. ''We don't want to be the ones who break the glass on this new kind of warfare,'' said James Andrew Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he specializes in technology and national security. That reluctance peaked during planning for the opening salvos of the Libya mission, and it was repeated on a smaller scale several weeks later, when military planners suggested a far narrower computer-network attack to prevent Pakistani radars from spotting helicopters carrying Navy Seal commandos on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2. Again, officials decided against it. Instead, specially modified, radar-evading Black Hawk helicopters ferried the strike team, and a still-secret stealthy surveillance drone was deployed. ''These cybercapabilities are still like the Ferrari that you keep in the garage and only take out for the big race and not just for a run around town, unless nothing else can get you there,'' said one Obama administration official briefed on the discussions. The debate about a potential cyberattack against Libya was described by more than a half-dozen officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the classified planning. In the days ahead of the American-led airstrikes to take down Libya's integrated air-defense system, a more serious debate considered the military effectiveness -- and potential legal complications -- of using cyberattacks to blind Libyan radars and missiles. ''They were seriously considered because they could cripple Libya's air defense and lower the risk to pilots, but it just didn't pan out,'' said a senior Defense Department official. After a discussion described as thorough and never vituperative, the cyberwarfare proposals were rejected before they reached the senior political levels of the White House. Gen. Carter F. Ham, the head of the military's Africa Command, which led the two-week American air campaign against Libya until NATO assumed full control of the operation on March 31, would not comment on any proposed cyberattacks. In an interview, he said only that ''no capability that I ever asked for was denied.'' Senior officials said one of the central reasons a cyberoffensive was rejected for Libya was that it might not have been ready for use in time, given that the rebel city of Benghazi was on the verge of being overrun by government forces. While popular fiction and films depict cyberattacks as easy to mount -- only a few computer keystrokes needed -- in reality it takes significant digital snooping to identify potential entry points and susceptible nodes in a linked network of communications systems, radars and missiles like that operated by the Libyan government, and then to write and insert the proper poisonous codes. ''It's the cyberequivalent of fumbling around in the dark until you find the doorknob,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''It takes time to find the vulnerabilities. Where is the thing that I can exploit to disrupt the network?'' Had the computer-network attack gone ahead, administration officials said they were confident it could have been confined to Libyan networks and offered high promise of disrupting the regime's integrated air-defense system. One unresolved concern was whether ordering a cyberattack on Libya might create domestic legal restrictions on war-making by the executive branch without Congressional permission. One question was whether the War Powers Resolution -- which requires the executive to formally report to lawmakers when it has introduced forces into ''hostilities'' and sets a 60-day limit on such deployments if Congress does not authorize them to continue -- would be required for an attack purely in cyberspace. The War Powers Resolution, a Vietnam-era law enacted over President Richard M. Nixon's veto, does not define ''hostilities.'' In describing its actions to Congress and the American people, the White House argued that its use of conventional forces in the Libyan intervention fell short of the level of hostilities requiring Congressional permission under either the Constitution or the resolution, citing the lack of ground forces and the supporting role the United States was playing in a multilateral effort to fulfill a United Nations resolution. Some officials also expressed concern about revealing American technological capabilities to potential enemies for what seemed like a relatively minor security threat to the United States. In the end, Libya's air-defense network was dangerous but not exceptionally robust. American surveillance identified its locations, and it was degraded through conventional attacks.  "
Security To Thwart Swindlers On Phones,"More consumers are buying smartphones. So more criminals are taking aim at those devices. Criminals still prefer PCs for stealing personal data, bank and credit card account numbers as well as for running frauds. However, most PC attacks focus on Microsoft's decade-old Windows XP operating system, which is slowly being replaced by the more secure Windows 7. Over the next few years, hackers will have to find new targets. With smartphones outselling PCs for the first time -- 421 million of the hand-held computers are expected to be sold worldwide this year, according to market analysts at IDC -- the long-predicted crime wave on hand-held devices appears to have arrived. According to the mobile-security firm Lookout, malware and spyware appeared on 9 out of 100 phones it scanned in May, more than twice the 4-in-100 rate in December 2009. In fact, the most practical rule for protecting yourself is to start thinking of the smartphone as a PC.  Most malicious incidents on mobile devices involve bogus phone or text-message charges or rogue mobile applications, of which there are now more than 500 varieties, according to F-Secure, a Finnish security firm. All these ruses require users to take some kind of action, like clicking to accept or install a program, so caution while using mobile devices can prevent most problems. (However, experts warn that automated attacks are possible and could emerge in the future.) Most attacks happen in Eastern Europe and China. An overwhelming number -- 88 percent, according to F-Secure -- have singled out devices running Nokia's Symbian operating system. Symbian is the world's most commonly used smartphone platform, but Nokia said this month that it would be replacing it over the next few years with Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system. Early attacks, like the Cabir and Commwarrior worms in 2004 and 2005, caused little damage. But since 2009, attacks have grown more menacing. In September, hackers trying to steal money from accounts at a Spanish bank installed malicious applications on Symbian devices when they synced to home PCs infected with a version of the ZeuS malware. The application enabled criminals to reply to security codes sent by the bank to validate cash transfers. Such assaults could be a preview of what is to come for devices popular in the United States. Criminals have attacked phones running on Google's Android, Research In Motion's BlackBerry, Apple's iPhone and Microsoft's Windows Mobile operating system software, suggesting that more is ahead. Some experts believe that Android will become a top target for malware because anyone can create and distribute an app anywhere on the Web. Google does not check apps for security issues but has instead imposed technical hurdles to thwart malicious activity. For instance, apps run in a ''sandbox,'' a closed environment where they cannot affect one another or manipulate device features without user permission. Google removes from its official Android Market any apps that break its rules against malicious activity. Ten attacks have been directed at Android users, including a malicious program called Geinimi that appeared in third-party Android app markets in China in December. This addition to legitimate applications, primarily games, allowed hackers to manipulate text messages, steal contact lists, place calls, visit Web sites and quietly download files. The attacks underscore the importance of exercising care when downloading mobile applications. Users should install apps only from sites they trust. They should research apps to ensure they are not malware. A smartphone is ''a microcomputer in your hand, and you can have Trojans and worms and viruses like a PC can,'' said Andy Hayter, anti-malcode manager at ICSA Labs, an independent security-testing firm owned by Verizon. The extra-cautious may also want to use a security product; free and paid products are available for all but the iPhone platform from major security companies like F-Secure, Symantec and Kaspersky as well as specialized providers like Lookout and DroidSecurity. Tighter controls on use of third-party software on mobile devices may help explain the limited number of attacks so far, says Mikko H. Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure. For instance, Apple's more regulated environment has mostly kept trouble at bay. The only malware seen on iPhones occurred in 2009 and affected phones that had been altered to run software Apple did not authorize. A worm in Australia replaced the phone's wallpaper with an image of the '80s pop singer Rick Astley, in a prank known as rickrolling. There was also an attempt to blackmail people into paying 5 euros, and a worm that tried to steal account details from customers of a Dutch bank. Partly for security reasons, Microsoft in October shifted to a system for its new Windows Phone 7 that confined app sales to its own marketplace and issued guidelines to developers that tightened security and privacy requirements. Microsoft says it runs safety tests on every new app. Attacks that bill cellphones are the most promising way for criminals to make money, Mr. Hypponen says. Hackers are figuring this out, as shown by multiple frauds on Facebook asking people to fill out online surveys and provide cellphone numbers, which then receive monthly charges. Check your bills carefully for unusual expenses. BlackBerrys are rarely attacked because the devices are typically provided and controlled by security-conscious employers, and the phones are not commonly used in countries like Russia and China, the homes of many malware creators. The most widespread problem seen on BlackBerrys -- and on other platforms -- are commercial spyware programs like FlexiSPY, which are secretly installed by someone -- usually a jealous spouse -- who wants to track a phone owner's location, listen to the calls and read text messages and e-mails. ''You can even turn on the microphone remotely and listen to what's being discussed around the phone, even if there's no phone call taking place,'' Mr. Hypponen said. Phishing is also a growing problem on all smartphone platforms. Such attacks, common on PCs, involve text or e-mail messages that appear to be from a trusted party, like a bank, that lead people to bogus Web sites where they are asked to enter personal data. Mobile users are three times more likely to fall for these scams than PC users, according to statistics on phishing recently gathered by one security company, Trusteer. The company believes that is because mobile devices are activated all the time, and small-screen formatting makes the fraud more difficult to spot. It cautions people not to click on Web links in messages. Confidential information can also be collected wirelessly if transmitted unencrypted over a public Wi-Fi network. Experts suggest avoiding transactions over airport or cafe networks. Losing a mobile device and the data inside remains the most likely risk to a smartphone owner. Experts recommend users lock devices with a PIN, so someone who picks it up cannot use it. It is also wise to install apps that can help locate a lost or stolen phone and, if necessary, wipe the data from it. Apple, Microsoft and R.I.M. provide free apps for their devices, and similar apps are available for Android and other phones from third parties, including F-Secure and Lookout. A last bit of advice as true for the desktop computer as for the smartphone: back up the data on your phone to your computer or an online service.

"U.S. Agents, an Aerial Snoop and Teams of Hackers","LAS VEGAS WHY are federal agents hobnobbing with hackers? Defcon, a convention of computer hackers here, was crawling with them on Friday. They smiled, shook hands, handed out business cards, spoke on a panel called ''Meet the Federal Agent 2.0'' and were really, really nice. Naturally, federal agents have been hanging out at hacker gatherings for years to snoop. ''Cloak and dagger,'' as one put it.  This time they came with another purpose: to schmooze, impress and, perhaps ultimately, lure. The United States Cyber Command, the Pentagon's Internet defense arm, ''has a work force issue,'' said Daron Hartvigsen, special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. ''We have needs that some in this community can solve. We need folks with skills.'' Government agencies especially need computer professionals with cybersecurity skills. At Defcon, these skills were in ample supply -- and they can alternately thrill and scare. There were hackers and lockpickers here, problem solvers and troublemakers. There were attendees with mohawks and blue hair, and some with blue mohawks. One wore a cape. A few wore kilts. Most, whether out of fear or conceit, insisted on using their digital names rather than their real ones: LosT, alien, Abstract. In their midst were Internet crime investigators representing the Army, Navy, Air Force and NASA. The F.B.I. set up a recruiting table at Black Hat, a related conference of security professionals earlier in the week. A National Security Agency official was to speak to next-generation hackers at a two-day event called Defcon Kids on Saturday. For the federal agents, it seemed less an aggressive recruiting drive than a public diplomacy mission. They took pains to describe themselves as lovable hackers under their crew cuts. Ryan Pittman, an ex-cop who now works computer crime cases in the Army's criminal investigations division, said the convention was an opportunity to whittle away the federal agents' image as ''jackbooted thugs.'' Ahmed Saleh, a computer crime investigator with NASA, described a job that might be appealing ''if you're a geek and you want to catch the bad guys.'' There seemed to be plenty of receptive hackers. Christine Banek, 29, a software programmer with plum-colored hair, sidled up to Mr. Saleh after the panel and asked if his agency was still hiring. She said she had applied online and had not heard back. ''If they were offering, I would totally take it,'' she said. Later, she suggested aloud that the government legalize marijuana. Positive drug tests generally disqualify a candidate from a law enforcement position. It flies. It spies. It is the color of sunshine, and it has googly eyes. Meet WASP, the Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform, one of the star attractions of this year's Black Hat conference. It's a remote-controlled plane with a computer in its belly that can fly up to 400 feet above the ground, snoop quietly on wireless networks below and attack one if it wants to. It can also pretend to be a GSM cellphone tower, eavesdropping on calls and text messages that pass through. The WASP was built by Richard Perkins and Mike Tassey using hobby materials, including a Styrofoam plane body, a plastic propeller and foam tires, along with circuit boards and wires. The materials are all off the shelf, costing $6,190 -- a fraction of the cost of a spy plane, with cyberweapons included. Its creators eschew the term ''spy plane.'' ''There's a negative connotation to a spy plane,'' Mr. Tassey said. ''This was done in an attempt to prove a concept.'' What concept? ''That it can be done,'' he said. His sentiment perfectly embodied the ethos of Black Hat, a spirited gathering of technologists who sometimes make scary things to show that they can be made, and at other times break things to show how badly they need to be fixed. The bird conjured by Mr. Perkins and Mr. Tassey is barely four feet long and becomes an imperceptible, quietly humming little creature when it hovers overhead. It could be deployed over, say, an office building to sniff out information going across its wireless network. Or if the office network is well secured, the plane could follow an employee on a trip to a neighborhood Starbucks. The WASP could mimic the cafe's network, luring the unwitting employee and allowing access to a laptop or cellphone. As Mr. Tassey put it, ''In Starbucks, no one can hear your laptop scream.'' They sat at tables along the perimeter of a ballroom in the Rio hotel. Lights were low. Laptops burned like campfires. Men and women hunched over the machines, their backs curved like question marks. Their fingers clicked away furiously. ''This is a spelling bee for hackers,'' explained Giovanni Vigna, 42, a professor of computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. ''It's a way to prove your hacking skills.'' Each team, he said, was given the same type of virtual server, with the same strengths and weaknesses. The teams were charged with defending their servers and attacking those of others. Each time a weak spot was attacked, a flag was awarded. The team with the most flags won. Hence, the name of the contest: Capture the Flag. This was the final round. Contests are a big deal at Defcon. But they're not all on computers. Defcon is about celebrating tinkering. There was a ''lockpicking village'' where interested parties did exactly that: pick locks. ''Most of us see locks as puzzles,'' Babak Javadi, 26, one of the organizers, explained. He has been taking apart locks since he was a kid, he said, and now runs a security business, specializing in high-security locks. There was a barber offering mohawks. There were vendors selling ''advanced gaming eyewear,'' glasses that sell for up to $189 a pair, designed to reduce the glare of a computer screen and ease eye fatigue. There were vendors selling luggage tags that said ''Geek on Board.'' In one hall, a competition was under way to invent a beer-cooling contraption. In another, teams were competing to tamper with so-called tamper-resistant materials. ''You're doing something you're not meant to do: That's the essence of hacking,'' said Chris Kuivenhoven, 34, a security engineer from Atlanta. ''People can use it for good or bad.''  "
European Court Overturns Rule on Illegal File Sharing,"PARIS -- The highest court in the European Union said on Thursday that Internet service providers could not be required to monitor their customers' online activity to filter out the illegal sharing of music and other copyrighted material.  The ruling, by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, is a setback for a Belgian group representing music copyright owners, which had sought tougher measures to crack down on online file sharing. The organization, Sabam, had sued a Belgian Internet provider, Scarlet Extended, saying its customers were illegally sharing music files. Sabam had won a ruling in a Belgian court, which said Scarlet should have to install a system to filter out any unauthorized exchanges of songs on its own, not just in response to complaints from copyright holders. The court in Luxembourg said such a requirement would be disproportionate, adding that it would violate ''the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information.'' ''E.U. law precludes an injunction made against an Internet service provider requiring it to install a system for filtering all electronic communications passing via its services, which applies indiscriminately to all its customers, as a preventive measure, exclusively at its expense, and for an unlimited period,'' the court wrote. Lobbying groups for Internet service providers and for consumers hailed the decision. ''This judgment sends a crystal-clear signal,'' said Monique Goyens, director general of B.E.U.C., a Brussels group that lobbies for consumer rights. ''Internet providers cannot be asked to police consumers' use of the Web.'' Malcolm Hutty, president of EuroISPA, a service providers' lobbying group, added, ''This ruling is of fundamental importance for the future of the Internet and the development of a strong digital single market.'' The music industry shrugged off the implications of the decision. Other measures to curb illegal file sharing, including the blocking of Web sites that enable piracy and the cutoff of persistent file-sharers' Internet connections, will not be affected, the industry's international lobbying group said. ''In this particular case, the court rejected the content-filtering measure presented by the Belgian court as too broad,'' Frances Moore, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said in a statement. ''However, this does not affect the forms of I.S.P. cooperation that I.F.P.I. advocates.'' Indeed, a recent court ruling in Britain required an Internet provider, BT, to block access to a Web site called Newzbin2, which was found to have made pirated content available to customers.  "
Even Those Cleared of Crimes Can Stay on F.B.I.'s Watch List,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation is permitted to include people on the government's terrorist watch list even if they have been acquitted of terrorism-related offenses or the charges are dropped, according to newly released documents. The files, released by the F.B.I. under the Freedom of Information Act, disclose how the police are instructed to react if they encounter a person on the list. They lay out, for the first time in public view, the legal standard that national security officials must meet in order to add a name to the list. And they shed new light on how names are vetted for possible removal from the list. Inclusion on the watch list can keep terrorism suspects off planes, block noncitizens from entering the country and subject people to delays and greater scrutiny at airports, border crossings and traffic stops. The database now has about 420,000 names, including about 8,000 Americans, according to the statistics released in connection with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. About 16,000 people, including about 500 Americans, are barred from flying.  Timothy J. Healy, the director of the F.B.I.'s Terrorist Screening Center, which vets requests to add or remove names from the list, said the documents showed that the government was balancing civil liberties with a careful, multilayered process for vetting who goes on it -- and for making sure that names that no longer need to be on it came off. ''There has been a lot of criticism about the watch list,'' claiming that it is ''haphazard,'' he said. ''But what this illustrates is that there is a very detailed process that the F.B.I. follows in terms of nominations of watch-listed people.'' Still, some of the procedures drew fire from civil liberties advocates, including the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which made the original request and provided the documents to The New York Times. The 91 pages of newly disclosed files include a December 2010 guidance memorandum to F.B.I. field offices showing that even a not-guilty verdict may not always be enough to get someone off the list, if agents maintain they still have ''reasonable suspicion'' that the person might have ties to terrorism. ''If an individual is acquitted or charges are dismissed for a crime related to terrorism, the individual must still meet the reasonable suspicion standard in order to remain on, or be subsequently nominated to, the terrorist watch list,'' the once-classified memorandum says. Ginger McCall, a counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: ''In the United States, you are supposed to be assumed innocent. But on the watch list, you may be assumed guilty, even after the court dismisses your case.'' But Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official in the Bush administration, argued that even if the intelligence about someone's possible terrorism ties fell short of the courtroom standard of ''beyond a reasonable doubt,'' it could still be appropriate to keep the person on the watch list as having attracted suspicion. Mr. Baker noted that being subjected to extra questioning -- or even kept off flights -- was different than going to prison. The guidance memo to F.B.I. field offices says someone may be deemed a ''known or suspected terrorist'' if officials have ''particularized derogatory information'' to support their suspicions. That standard may be met by an allegation that the suspect has terrorism ties if the claim is corroborated by at least one other source, it said, but ''mere guesses or 'hunches' are not enough.'' Normally, it says, if agents close the investigation without charges, they should remove the subject's name -- as they should also normally do in the case of an acquittal. But for exceptions, the F.B.I. maintains a special file for people whose names it is keeping in the database because it has decided they pose a national security risk even they are not the subject any active investigation. The F.B.I.'s Terrorist Screening Center shares the data with other federal agencies for screening aircraft passengers, people who are crossing the border and people who apply for visas. The data is also used by local police officers to check names during traffic stops. The December memorandum lays out procedures for police officers to follow when they encounter people who are listed. For example, officers are never to tell the suspects that they might be on the watch list, and they must immediately call the federal government for instructions. In addition, it says, police officers and border agents are to treat suspects differently based on which ''handling codes'' are in the system. Some people, with outstanding warrants, are to be arrested; others are to be questioned while officers check with the Department of Homeland Security to see whether it has or will issue a ''detainer'' request; and others should be allowed to proceed without delay. The documents show that the F.B.I. is developing a system to automatically notify regional ''fusion centers,'' where law enforcement agencies share information, if officers nearby have encountered someone on the list. The bureau also requires F.B.I. supervisors to sign off before an advisory would warn the police that a subject is ''armed and dangerous'' or has ''violent tendencies.'' The F.B.I. procedures encourage agents to renominate suspects for the watch list even if they were already put on it by another agency -- meaning multiple agencies would have to be involved in any attempt to later remove that person. The procedures offer no way for people who are on the watch list to be notified of that fact or given an opportunity to see and challenge the specific allegations against them. Chris Calabrese, a counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, called the watch list system a ''Star Chamber'' -- ''a secret determination, that you have no input into, that you are a terrorist. Once that determination is made, it can ripple through your entire life and you have no way to challenge it.'' But Mr. Healy said the government could not reveal who was on the list, or why, because that would risk revealing intelligence sources. He also defended the idea of the watch list, saying the government would be blamed if, after a terrorist attack, it turned out the perpetrator had attracted the suspicions of one agency but it had not warned other agencies to scrutinize the person. Mr. Healy also suggested that fears of the watch list were exaggerated, in part because there are many other reasons that people are subjected to extra screening at airports. He said more than 200,000 people have complained to the Department of Homeland Security about their belief that they were wrongly on the list, but fewer than 1 percent of them were actually on it.

Facebook'Face Recognition' Feature Draws Privacy Scrutiny,"BRUSSELS (Bloomberg News) -- European Union data protection regulators said on Wednesday that they would investigate Facebook over a feature that uses face-recognition software to suggest people's names to tag in pictures without their permission, and a privacy group in the United States said that it planned to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission over the feature. A group of privacy watchdogs drawn from the European bloc's 27 nations will study the measure for possible rule violations, said Gerard Lommel, a Luxembourg member of the so-called Article 29 Data Protection Working Party. Authorities in Britain and Ireland said they are also looking into the photo-tagging function on the world's most popular social networking service.  ''Tags of people on pictures should only happen based on people's prior consent and it can't be activated by default,'' said Mr. Lommel. Such automatic tagging suggestions ''can bear a lot of risks for users'' and the European data protection officials will ''clarify to Facebook that this can't happen like this.'' Facebook said on its blog on Tuesday that ''Tag Suggestions'' was available in most countries after being phased in over several months. When Facebook users add photos to their pages, the feature uses facial-recognition software to suggest names of people in the photos to tag based on pictures in which they have already been identified. Before the feature was introduced, users could tag pictures manually without permission from their friends. The feature is active by default on existing users' accounts, and Facebook explains on its blog how people can disable the function if they don't want their names to be automatically suggested for other people's pictures. ''We launched Tag Suggestions to help people add tags of their friends in photos; something that's currently done more than 100 million times a day,'' Facebook, which is based in Palo Alto., Calif., said in an e-mailed statement. ''Tag suggestions are only made to people when they add new photos to the site, and only friends are suggested.'' In Europe, where personal privacy is protected by law more often than in the United States, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo have also been pushed by data protection officials to limit the amount of time they store online users' search records. The Information Commissioner's Office of Britain is ''speaking to Facebook'' about the privacy aspects of the technology, said Greg Jones, a spokesman for the group. ''We would expect Facebook to be upfront about how people's personal information is being used,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The privacy issues that this new software might raise are obvious.'' The Irish data protection authority is also looking into the issue, said a spokeswoman, Ciara O'Sullivan. The Article 29 group guides the work of national data protection agencies, which have the power to punish companies that break privacy rules. Meanwhile, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, based in Washington, is working on its complaint and expected to file it with the F.T.C. Wednesday or Thursday, Marc Rotenberg, the group's executive director, said in an interview. He said other privacy and consumer groups that he declined to identify planned to join the complaint. A spokesman for Facebook, Andrew Noyes, declined to comment on the center's plans for the F.T.C. complaint.  "
Privacy Concerns Over Leaf Data,"BY design, in-car telematics systems are a two-way street. Only after collecting data about a driver's coordinates can they offer the location of the nearest gas station or pizzeria. But as the owner of a Nissan Leaf recently discovered, once a service possesses a motorist's data, it is unclear how it might be used.  Casey Halverson, a freelance security blogger who was profiled on Tuesday by the Web site of Computer World magazine, discovered what he thought was a security loophole in the Leaf's onboard communications and navigation system. He found that information about Leaf owners could be culled and transmitted without their knowledge. The system, called Carwings, can be configured to pull down breaking news and information to the car using a built-in cellular data connection. Owners can select specific Web-based news updates that are sent using concise RSS feeds. Such updates can keep a driver informed about severe weather conditions ahead or looming traffic jams. However, through a bit of tinkering, Mr. Halverson discovered that information about his car also was being sent back to the RSS feed provider. This meant that any RSS feed provider could cull information about Leaf owners. That information could in turn be used for any purpose, legitimate or otherwise, without restrictions. ''They pretty much left it wide open,'' Mr. Halverson said in a telephone interview. Any company providing an RSS feed to Carwings could look at a vehicle's location, speed and direction and determine whether a driver was violating the speed limit, for example, or nearing a particular retail outlet. Conceivably, the latter piece of data could be used to send location-based ads to the car, much in the way that Web sites track online visitors and deliver ads aimed at their individual interests. There are privacy implications, but it is not clear how extensive the problem actually is or can become. For example, according to Mr. Halverson's analysis, data that could be used to identify an individual Leaf owner was not included in the information sent back to companies who served RSS feeds. Furthermore, data about the Leaf is sent to information providers only when an RSS feed is pulled down to the car. This would complicate any attempt to track a vehicle's progress. It is difficult to assess whether a determined hacker could overcome those restrictions. According to Nissan, the company has taken steps to prevent unauthorized use of the data. Katherine Zachary, a company spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail: ''Nissan takes consumer concerns very seriously and has responded quickly to stop the transmission of a vehicle owner's privacy-related data for nonofficial RSS sites. The data involved does not and cannot be attributed to any specific vehicle or owner.''  "
Questioning Privacy Protections In Research,"Hoping to protect privacy in an age when a fingernail clipping can reveal a person's identity, federal officials are planning to overhaul the rules that regulate research involving human subjects. But critics outside the biomedical arena warn that the proposed revisions may unintentionally create a more serious problem: sealing off vast collections of publicly available information from inspection, including census data, market research, oral histories and labor statistics. Organizations that represent tens of thousands of scholars in the humanities and social sciences are scrambling to register their concerns before the Wednesday deadline for public comment on the proposals. The rules were initially created in the 1970s after shocking revelations that poor African-American men infected with syphilis in Tuskegee, Ala., were left untreated by the United States Public Health Service so that doctors could study the course of the disease. Now every institution that receives money from any one of 18 federal agencies must create an ethics panel, called an institutional review board, or I.R.B.  More than 5,875 boards have to sign off on research involving human participants to ensure that subjects are fully informed, that their physical and emotional health is protected, and that their privacy is respected. Although only projects with federal financing are covered by what is known as the Common Rule, many institutions routinely subject all research with a human factor to review. The changes in the ethical guidelines -- the first comprehensive revisions in more than 30 years -- were prompted by a surge of health-related research and technological advances. Researchers in the humanities and social sciences are pleased that the reforms would address repeated complaints that medically oriented regulations have choked off research in their fields with irrelevant and cumbersome requirements. But they were dismayed to discover that the desire to protect individuals' privacy in the genomics age resulted in rules that they say could also restrict access to basic data, like public-opinion polls. Jerry Menikoff, director of the federal Office for Human Research Protections, which oversees the Common Rule, cautions that any alarm is premature, saying that federal officials do not intend to pose tougher restrictions on information that is already public. ''If the technical rules end up doing that, we'll try to come up with a result that's appropriate,'' he said. Critics welcomed the assurance but remained skeptical. Zachary Schrag, a historian at George Mason University who wrote a book about the review process, said, ''For decades, scholars in the social sciences and humanities have suffered because of rules that were well intended but poorly considered and drafted and whose unintended consequences restricted research.'' The American Historical Association, with 15,000 members, and the Oral History Association, with 900 members, warn that under the proposed revisions, for example, new revelations that Public Health Service doctors deliberately infected Guatemalan prisoners, soldiers and mental patients with syphilis in the 1940s might never have come to light. The abuses were uncovered by a historian who by chance came across notes in the archives of the University of Pittsburgh. That kind of undirected research could be forbidden under guidelines designed to prevent ''data collected for one purpose'' from being ''used for a new purpose to which the subjects never consented,'' said Linda Shopes, who helped draft the historians' statement. The suggested changes, she said, ''really threaten access to information in a democratic society.'' Numerous organizations including the Consortium of Social Science Associations, which represents dozens of colleges, universities and research centers, expressed particular concern that the new standards might be modeled on federal privacy rules relating to health insurance and restrict use of the broadest of identifying information, like a person's ZIP code, county or city. The 11,000-member American Anthropological Association declared in a statement that any process that is based on the health insurance act's privacy protections ''would be disastrous for social and humanities research.'' The 45,000-member American Association of University Professors warned that such restrictions ''threaten mayhem'' and ''render impossible a great deal of social-science research, ranging from ethnographic community studies to demographic analysis that relies on census tracts to traffic models based on ZIP code to political polls that report by precinct.'' Dr. Menikoff said references to the statutes governing health insurance information were meant to serve as a starting point, not a blueprint. ''Nothing is ruled out,'' he said, though he wondered how the review system could be severed from the issue of privacy protection, as the consortium has discussed, ''if the major risk for most of these studies is that you're going to disclose information inadvertently.'' If there is confidential information on a laptop, he said, requiring a password may be a reasonable requirement. Ms. Shopes, Mr. Schrag and other critics emphasized that despite their worries they were happy with the broader effort to fix some longstanding problems with institutional review boards that held, say, an undergraduate interviewing Grandma for an oral history project to the same guidelines as a doctor doing experimental research on cancer patients. ''The system has been sliding into chaos in recent years,'' said Alice Kessler-Harris, president of the 9,000-member Organization of American Historians. ''No one can even agree on what is supposed to be covered in the humanities and social sciences.'' Vague rules designed to give the thousands of review boards flexibility when dealing with nonmedical subjects have instead resulted in higgledy-piggledy enforcement and layers of red tape even when no one is at risk, she said. For example Columbia University, where Ms. Kessler-Harris teaches, exempts oral history projects from review, while boards at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign and the University of California, San Diego, have raised lengthy objections to similar interview projects proposed by undergraduate and master's students, according to professors there. Brown University has been sued by an associate professor of education who said the institutional review board overstepped its powers by barring her from using three years' worth of research on how the parents of Chinese-American children made use of educational testing. Ms. Shopes said board members at one university had suggested at one point that even using recorded interviews deposited at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library would have needed Reagan's specific approval when he was alive. Many nonmedical researchers praised the idea that scholars in fields like history, literature, journalism, languages and classics who use traditional methods of research should not have to submit to board review. They would like the office of human protections to go further and lift restrictions on research that may cause participants embarrassment or emotional distress. ''Our job is to hold people accountable,'' Ms. Kessler-Harris said. Dr. Menikoff said, ''We want to hear all these comments.'' But he maintained that when the final language is published, critics may find themselves saying, ''Wow, this is reasonable stuff.''  "
Google Agrees to Allow Owners of Wi-Fi Routers to Opt Out of Database,"BERLIN -- Google, under pressure from privacy regulators in the Netherlands, said Tuesday that it had agreed to give people around the world the option of keeping the names and locations of their home or business Wi-Fi routers out of a company database. Google uses the data to help pinpoint the location of cellphones and other mobile devices within broadcast range of the routers. That information is useful for weather and mapping services, among other things, and can allow Google to show relevant advertising for nearby businesses.  Under the agreement, which was announced by Google and the Dutch Data Protection Authority, owners of Wi-Fi routers can add ''--nomap'' to the end of a router's name to tell Google that they do not want its information included. If many people opt out of the registry, Google's ability to offer location-based services could be compromised. The company would then have to use cell tower locations and the Global Positioning System to determine a phone's location, which could result in less accuracy and greater use of battery power. But while Google's collection of Wi-Fi location data has been controversial in Europe, analysts in the United States were skeptical that many owners of routers would bother to remove them from the database. ''I think the Wi-Fi network operator would be more than happy to have it plotted,'' said Chenxi Wang, principal analyst covering security at Forrester Research. ''It doesn't hurt them in any way.'' Jacob Kohnstamm, the chairman of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, called the agreement a positive step for consumer privacy. ''We all hope that with enforcement actions like these, the bigger firms will use privacy by design from the start so we don't need to go into enforcement mode,'' Mr. Kohnstamm said. Google, the global search engine leader, was found to have illegally collected information about 3.6 million routers in the Netherlands from March 2008 through May 2010 as it compiled its Street View mapping service. It has said that it was using the information to help log the position of cellphones running its Android operating system. Google had faced a fine of 1 million euros, or $1.4 million, from the Dutch agency for its illegal data collection. Mr. Kohnstamm said officials at the agency would independently verify whether Google keeps its promise to remove the data once a router owner uses the new opt-out procedure. ''Assuming Google follows through on its agreement, the fine will not be levied,'' he said. In a statement, Google said the Wi-Fi location data could not be used to identify individuals. ''Even though the wireless access point signals we use in our location services don't identify people, we think we can go further in protecting people's privacy,'' Google said. Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, wrote in a blog post that Google hoped other companies that log router locations would also use Google's ''--nomap'' suffix as an opt-out mechanism. Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for Apple, which collects similar data through its phones and other devices, declined to comment. Google began advertising the details of the opt-out procedure in several Dutch newspapers and on its Web site. Mr. Kohnstamm said Google agreed to offer the option after it was requested by officials in the Netherlands and France, and several other European countries he declined to name. The Netherlands has been one of Europe's most aggressive enforcers of data protection laws, using sanctions and legislative action to tightly restrict how companies that do business on the Internet can collect and manipulate personal data. Google ran afoul of data protection officials from Europe to Hong Kong when it acknowledged that its Street View mapping vehicles had collected private data from Wi-Fi routers as the cars were compiling panoramic maps. This went beyond logging the name and location of the routers to include data traveling over the networks. Google attributed the unlawful data collection to a programming error and apologized publicly. The company, based in Mountain View, Calif., settled most of the complaints by privacy regulators by deleting the data, although prosecutors in Hamburg, Germany, are still weighing whether to bring criminal charges against Google. Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection supervisor whose inquiry brought Google's Wi-Fi collection practices to light, said his office was awaiting a decision by criminal prosecutors before deciding whether to levy penalties.

Use Twitter? Always Remember These Three Things,"Congressman Anthony Weiner's resignation today was triggered by a Twitter mistake last month that he admitted to making.  The New York Democrat tweeted a rather unstatesmanly photo of himself to an admirer. But instead of sending the link to the photo in a private ""direct message"" to the woman on Twitter, he published it on his main Twitter feed. He's far from the first to do so - Twitter's direct message and public post input fields do look a lot alike. The only sure way to keep electronic communications from falling into the wrong hands is not to send them at all. For most people today, that's not a practical option. But you should always consider the risks of sending a message meant for private viewing over the world's biggest instant-publishing medium. 1. Don't DM anything you wouldn't want public. It's simply too easy to type into the wrong box on Twitter, posting a public tweet that others can see in seconds. Some reporters avoid the risk by asking people who ""DM"" them-Twitter slang for a direct message-to switch to e-mail instead. Sure, you can also send an e-mail to the wrong address, but it's harder to do by accident.  2. Don't presume protected tweets will stay private. Twitter gives you the option to protect your main Twitter feed, so that only your approved followers can see what you tweet. But because tweets are short, and contain only text instead of images and video, it's easy for someone to manually retweet your message by cutting and pasting it into a new, and public, tweet of their own. They may not mean you harm, but an offhand joke meant for a few close friends can become an inexcusable offense if seen by others. And if you've got enemies, it's possible they were already following you before you turned on the Protected Tweets option. 3. Turn on Twitter's secure connection option. Weiner claimed early on that his Twitter account had been hijacked by a hacker. He later recanted, but it can happen. By default, Twitter sessions aren't encrypted the way online shopping purchases are, which leaves them vulnerable on unencrypted Wi-Fi networks in particular. You can enable encryption for everything by going to your Twitter account's settings and turning on the option to ""Always use HTTPS.""  But again, that won't save you if you type into the wrong box.  "
Hugh Grant Testifies at Phone-Hacking Inquiry,"5:18 p.m. | Updated The actor Hugh Grant on Monday testified before a commission investigating the practices of British newspapers, giving extensive details about how a variety of tabloids had managed to insinuate themselves into his life. The methods he accused the newspapers of using to discover his personal details included stalking, a break-in, phone-hacking and purchasing embarrassing photographs, according to summaries of his testimony that appeared in the live blogs of two British papers that have been following the investigation closely, The Guardian and The Telegraph. In addition to The News of the World, the weekly newspaper that was recently closed by News Corporation for its use of phone hacking, Mr. Grant also accused The Daily Mail and The Daily Mirror. The Mail on Sunday, Mr. Grant said, may have hacked his phone as well. The apartment break-in took place in 1995, he said, after news had broken about his being arrested with a Hollywood prostitute. Nothing was taken, but shortly afterward, Mr. Grant told the inquiry, according to The Guardian, ""a detailed account of what the interior of my flat looked like appeared in one of the papers."" ""I remember thinking who told them that - was that the burglar, or was that the police?"" he said. The New Statesman offers commentary to accompany the centerpiece of Mr. Grant's testimony, his list of 10 myths about tabloid journalism. Mr. Grant may well have been inspired by the 10 plagues of the Bible as much as the Ten Commandments. Here is The Telegraph's version of the myths:  Mr. Grant's statement to the committee can be found at the committee's Web site.   "
Phone Hacking Tied to Terrorists,"Four people in the Philippines hacked into the accounts of AT&T business customers in the United States and diverted money to a group that financed terrorist attacks across Asia, according to police officials in the Philippines.  A statement from the Philippines Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, a law enforcement agency, said three men and one woman had been arrested in raids across the capital, Manila, last week. According to the agency, the men were working with a group called Jemaah Islamiyah, a terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda and responsible for the 2002 bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people. The group has been held responsible for several other terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia, mostly in Indonesia but including the Philippines. If the new accusation holds up, it would point to a troubling connection between hackers and terrorist cells. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Saturday that it was working with the police in the Philippines on the investigation into the telephone hacking effort, which apparently began as early as 2009. The suspects remotely gained access to the telephone operating systems of an unspecified number of AT&T clients and used them to call telephone numbers that passed on revenues to the suspects. AT&T said it reimbursed its customers for the charges. It said in a statement that ''its network were neither targeted nor breached by the hackers.'' The company declined to say how many business customers were affected, nor how much it cost AT&T. The Philippines police agency's statement said the scheme cost $2 million. It is known as a ''remote toll fraud'' and singles out telephone accounts that are protected by weak passwords.  "
New Worm By Creators Of Stuxnet Is Suspected,"The designers of Stuxnet, the computer worm that was used to vandalize an Iranian nuclear site, may have struck again, security researchers say. Stuxnet, which infected tens of thousands of computers in 155 countries last year, created an international sensation when experts reported that it was designed as an American-Israeli project to sabotage Siemens Corporation computers used in uranium enrichment at the Natanz site. The researchers say the new malicious program, which they call Duqu, is intended to steal digital information that may be needed to mount another Stuxnet-like attack.  The researchers, at Symantec, announced the discovery on the company's Web site on Tuesday, saying they had determined that the new program was written by programmers who must have had access to Stuxnet's source code, the original programming instructions. ''Duqu's purpose is to gather intelligence data and assets from entities, such as industrial control system manufacturers, in order to more easily conduct a future attack against another third party,'' the Symantec researchers said. ''The attackers are looking for information such as design documents that could help them mount a future attack on an industrial control facility.'' They said the Duqu program was found in Europe in a narrowly limited group of organizations, ''including those involved in the manufacturing of industrial control systems.'' In contrast to Stuxnet, Duqu has been found in only a handful of organizations to date. The program is designed to last 36 days and then remove itself from the system it infected. Like Stuxnet, Duqu tries to prove its authenticity by using a stolen digital certificate, this one apparently taken from a Taiwanese company. Symantec officials were able to revoke the security certificate after it was discovered stolen because the company owns the VeriSign authentication service that controls the certificate infrastructure. The Symantec posting, and a related technical paper, raised a new mystery of its own. The company said it had been alerted to the new malware by a ''research lab with strong international connections,'' but declined to identify it further or say whether it was governmental or private. According to Vikram Thakur of Symantec, the organization decided not to come forward because it wanted to protect the identity of the victim organization. The technical paper did include this comment from the team that apparently discovered the malware: ''As we are in academia, we have limited resources to analyze malware behavior.'' Mr. Thakur added that in the two days since Symantec had received its initial malware sample, the security firm had received other variants of the program, which also appear to be aimed at makers of industrial control equipment. The researchers identify a wide variety of similarities between Duqu and Stuxnet and said that the new program could not have been written without having access to the original programmer's instructions. It has been previously noted that Stuxnet had both an attack capability as well as the ability to spy on the computers it infiltrated. Security researchers have argued that the Stuxnet attackers were able to gather valuable intelligence information about the Iranian nuclear program as well as damage the control equipment at Natanz. The Symantec researchers said they had not been able to determine how the Duqu code reached its target. Stuxnet used a wide range of system vulnerabilities, leading to speculation that it could have been written only by an organization with the resources of a national intelligence agency. Mr. Thakur said of Duqu, ''This is extremely sophisticated, this is cutting edge.''  "
Hackers Breach Tech Systems Of Multinational Oil Companies,"At least five multinational oil and gas companies suffered computer network intrusions from a persistent group of computer hackers based in China, according to a report released Wednesday night by a Silicon Valley computer security firm. Computer security researchers at McAfee Inc. said the attacks, which were similar to but less sophisticated than a series of computer break-ins discovered in late 2009 by Google, appeared to be aimed at corporate espionage. Operating from what was a base apparently in Beijing, the intruders established control servers in the United States and Netherlands to break into computers in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece and the United States, according to a report, ''Global Energy Cyberattacks: 'Night Dragon.' '' The focus of the intrusions was on oil and gas field production systems as well as financial documents related to field exploration and bidding for new oil and gas leases, according to the report. The attackers also stole information related to industrial control systems, the researchers noted, but no efforts to tamper with these systems were observed.  McAfee executives declined to name the victim companies, citing nondisclosure agreements it signed before being hired to patch the vulnerabilities revealed by the intrusions. Last year, when Google announced that intellectual property had been stolen by Chinese intruders, it expressed frustration that while it had observed break-ins at a variety of other United States companies, virtually none of the other companies were willing to acknowledge that they had been compromised. ''We have confirmed that five companies have been attacked,'' said Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee's vice president for threat research. He said he suspected that at least a dozen companies might have been affected by the team of computer hackers seemingly based in Beijing and who appeared to work during standard business hours there. ''These people seemed to be more like company worker bees rather than free-spirited computer hackers,'' he said. ''These attacks were bold, even brazen, and they left behind a trail of evidence.'' It was not possible to tell whether the attacks were the work of a government organization or a particular group of cybercriminals, Mr. Alperovitch said. Jenny Shearer, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, said that the agency was aware of the McAfee report, but had no comment. According to the report, the intruders used widely available attack methods known as SQL injection and spear phishing to compromise their targets. Once they gained access to computers on internal company networks, they would install remote administration software that gave them complete control of those systems. That made it possible for the intruders to search for documents as well as stage attacks on other computers connected to corporate networks. In addition to their parallels to the Google attacks of last year, the intrusions resembled a Chinese-based electronic espionage network that was found in 2009 and named GhostNet. In that case, researchers at the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto uncovered an elaborate network aimed at government computers as well as those of nongovernmental organizations like the office of the Dalai Lama. The researchers concluded that the control servers of the attack system were based on the island of Hainan, which is part of China. The McAfee report was released shortly before the annual RSA Conference on Web security in San Francisco. The annual computer security industry trade show and conference routinely leads to an outpouring of accounts of computer network vulnerabilities and new reports of intrusions and data thefts.  "
Wall Street Journal Leak Site Works on Security Fixes,"May 7, 12:29 a.m. | Updated  Updating Qualys's rating of SafeHouse's encryption. May 9, 8:03 p.m. | Updated  Adding comment from Adobe. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday introduced SafeHouse, a Web site that takes a page from WikiLeaks by inviting whistle-blowers to submit tips and documents. But within hours, security researchers were challenging the notion that the site was safe for leakers. And on Friday, The Journal said it was rushing through technical changes to address the problems. According to the researchers, the way SafeHouse uses Web encryption technology known as HTTPS opens the site up for attacks, and is not rigorous enough for a site that handles highly sensitive communications. They also said they were troubled that SafeHouse used Adobe Flash for uploading documents, a technology that can help strip leakers of anonymity. The problems were the subject of a barrage of messages on Twitter on Thursday afternoon by Jacob Appelbaum, a developer for the Tor Project, which provides tools for anonymous online communication used by dissidents, whistle-blowers, journalists and others. Mr. Appelbaum was formerly associated with Wikileaks. ""Pro-tip: if you're going to create a document-leaking website - have a clue!"" he wrote. The Journal said in an e-mailed statement that it was taking the issues raised ""very seriously"" and that it would end its use of Flash within 48 hours. ""In addition, our system has been updated to limit the types of less secure connections it will accept,"" it said.  SafeHouse's terms of serviceencourage whistle-blowers to improve their security by using tools like Tor that provide anonymity. However, both Mr. Appelbaum and Peter Eckersley, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said Adobe Flash defeated  those tools. Mr. Eckersley said the problem was with a Flash feature called Flash Socket Class, which would allow SafeHouse to discover a user's real I.P. address, regardless of any anonymizing technologies that might be in use. As such, The Journal could identify people who upload documents or be forced by the government to do so. News organizations like The Journal are accustomed to protecting sources, including from the government, but having the information could expose it to legal difficulties. The E.F.F. said that it raised its concerns about Flash Socket Class in March 2010 with Adobe's chief privacy officer, MeMe Rasmussen, and that the company said the issue would be hard to fix but that it would work on it.  A true fix would require the development of specialized technology for browsers, Adobe said in response to questions, and such a project is not under way at this time. However, Adobe said that Web sites can use Flash for document uploads without including the socket functionality, and added that the tool does not clash with all anonymizing services. Moreover, even when it is in place, Web users can disable it using a Flash Player configuration file, Adobe said.  E.F.F. said that, while The Journal could choose not to use the sockets tool, it could be forced to alter its site later by the government or a court order. It praised Adobe for providing user controls, but called them ""incredibly obscure."" The way HTTPS is used by SafeHouse would not be problematic for an average Web site, said Ivan Ristic, director of engineering at Qualys and founder of a research effort called SSL Labs. However, it did not cover all the bases necessary to ensure that a user couldn't be fooled into engaging in unencrypted communication. Dan Kaminsky, chief scientist at the security firm DKH, said even major banks did not use the advanced technologies in question. Those technologies are ""nice to have,"" but can cause other problems, he said, and their absence does not make a site unsafe. Mr. Ristic said it was also troubling that SafeHouse was using algorithms known as cipher suites, which are not strong enough to ensure that recorded communications cannot be deciphered later if the key to them is somehow obtained. On Friday afternoon, Qualys was giving SafeHouse a grade of B on its use of encryption, in large measure due to poor cipher strength. But by Friday evening, its use of cipher technology was getting higher marks, and Qualys raised its grade to an A. ""Hopefully we'll see this WSJ site moving toward a truly secure deployment,""  Mr. Eckersley of the E.F.F. said. ""That kind of i-dotting and t-crossing is necessary to be safe against some of the attacks we've seen used against HTTPS Web sites in recent years.""   "
Bank of America Web Site Still Troubled,"12:01 p.m. 10/5/11 | Updated  with new problems reported on Wednesday.  Bank of America's Web site continued to be troubled by sporadic problems on Wednesday, as has been the case in five of the last six days. Visitors to the site were greeted with a different message on Wednesday: ""We value your business and appreciate your continued patience. Most of our site is working normally, but you may experience occasional delays."" After running slowly for much of Tuesday, the Web site seemed to return to normal on Tuesday night. But the slowdown developed again Wednesday morning. The difficulties have tended to recur during periods of higher traffic, only to resolve during off-peak times. The problems first cropped up on Friday, a day after the bank, the nation's largest, announced it would impose a new $5 a month charge on some debit cardholders. But a bank official insisted the problems were not caused by hackers angered by the new fee or efforts to flood the site with traffic as a protest, a strategy called a denial of service attack. ""Every indication is that recent performance issues have not been the result of hacking, malware or a denial of service attack,"" Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for the bank, said Tuesday. ""Our customer information is safe, the online banking site is largely operating normally. A notice to customers was posted as a precaution. We continue to assess the situation."" She declined to further explain the specific cause behind the difficulties but another bank official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the volume of traffic on the site had been unusually high in recent days. The problems have been intermittent since Friday, continuing on Saturday but clearing up Sunday, only to return Monday. The site's problems were magnified for many bank customers because they typically pay their bills in the first part of the month. ""Financial institutions live and die by their ability to do online banking,"" said Mark Rasch, a former federal computer crime prosecutor now with CSC, an information technology services firm. The breakdown has already caused some longtime customers to take their business elsewhere. ""How hard is it to maintain a Web site?"" asked Mark Hugh Miller, a writer in Los Angeles who has been a Bank of America customer for 40 years but said he planned to switch his checking account to a local credit union. Mr. Miller said he first encountered problems on Sunday night when he tried to log on and see if a check he had written had cleared. He finally managed to get through on Tuesday morning. ""It wasn't just slowness,"" he said. ""Sometimes, the site never opened. Other times, it was unresponsive."" While nearly all highly trafficked consumer sites encounter slowdowns from time to time, the length of the difficulties at Bank of America's Web site is unusual, technology experts said. ""Today is the fourth day,"" said Ken Godskind, vice president for monitoring products at SmartBear Software. ""This is an awfully long time for something to be going on."" If the problems were not caused by hackers or an attack, other causes might be a surge in traffic connected to the new $5 fee or a change or upgrade to the bank's internal system that unexpectedly slowed the site, Mr. Godskind said. He said the times when the site was working, like Sunday, tend to be low-traffic periods.  "
The Long and Wireless Road to a Home Router,"Buying a home wireless router is about as chaotic and confusing a shopping experience as you will ever encounter. Walk down the aisle where some distracted clerk points you and you'll see boxes marked cryptically as G, N and N+. And then another bunch of codes like 150, 300 and 600 as well as some marked dual-band. There are boxes next to them with things called ''Powerline.'' Try asking a clerk and you'll still be confused, except that maybe you'll be told that the most expensive one is the best. You are going to need a little help.  Some retailers, like Best Buy, and manufacturers like Belkin and Netgear have come up with display charts and lists that show home networking products in a ''good, better, best'' continuum, with solutions based on what you want to do with your network. But with wireless routers ranging from $35 to $160 and up, do we really need the best? What you are looking for is ''good enough.'' The real question many people want answered is, ''Do we need a manufacturer's expensive router if we're playing online video games or watching Netflix?'' Here are the questions that really need answering when you are considering buying a wireless router. DO I EVEN NEED ONE? To get an Internet signal from your Internet service provider's modem to a PC at the other end of the house, you'll need a wireless router. In fact, because routers act as firewalls, helping to keep out malicious hackers, everyone should have a router, even if you have only one computer connected via Ethernet cable to the Internet. Bottom line: Buy a router. WHAT KIND SHOULD I BUY? The most common standards for routers are 802.11g and 802.11n. The N technology lets wireless signals travel farther than G, and can attain a higher transmission speed. Netgear's WNR2000 N router costs $50, just $15 more than its WGR614 G router. So-called N+ routers denote nothing specific; it's a marketing term that implies the addition of various features depending on the manufacturer. Bottom line: Always get an N router. HOW MUCH SHOULD I SPEND? Some home routers cost as much as $400. Wireless N routers like the TRENDnet TEW-652BRP are available at B&H Photo for as little as $23; and the D-Link DIR-601 is $28 from Amazon. Leo Laporte, host of the Tech Guy radio program, recommends always going for the least expensive. ''The chip sets in different routers are all the same,'' he said. ''It's the firmware that adds different capabilities.'' (Firmware is another techie word for the software.) Bottom line: Spend as little as possible once you know which features, discussed next, you want. At that price, you can always buy another if it breaks. WHAT SPEED DO I NEED? Wireless routers using the N technology can typically transmit a signal at up to 300 megabits per second. But an Internet signal is typically around 5 to 7 megabits per second; so why do you need a superfast router if the incoming signal is so much slower? You may not. The high advertised speeds are meant to impress and to leave some wiggle room -- by the time that 300 Mbps signal has traveled upstairs, across your house and through multiple walls and beams, it may have lost as much as 70 percent of its speed, according to Nandan Kalle, Belkin's networking business manager. (According to Mr. Kalle, there is no simple consumer test that can check a router's speed.) The higher the starting speed of a router, the more it'll have left after it tries to reach the hinterlands of your house. ''You want to make sure that the wireless router is not your bottleneck,'' said David Henry, Netgear's senior director of product marketing. The benefit of a higher-speed router is that you can take advantage of its speed when transferring files within a house. For example, if you want to send a movie file that's already on your PC to your TV, a higher router speed could enable a sharper picture that plays smoothly. Higher router speeds are also useful if you want to back up files to a central hard drive connected to your router and available to everyone else on the network, or you want to send movies, music and photos from one PC to another. Also, if several people in the home are transferring files around the home and accessing the Internet simultaneously, a higher router speed can help things move along more smoothly. Bottom line: If you're using a router to simply bring the Internet to every computer (and other devices) to your home, you don't care about moving data from one device to another and your home isn't overly big, then don't worry about speed. Any N router will be fast enough. DUAL OR SINGLE BAND? The newest N routers carry the signal on either the 2.4 Ghz (gigahertz) band, or on both the 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands. (If you get a dual-band router, the box may indicate a 600 Ghz speed, indicating the combined speed of both bands; if you use only one band, you get only half that maximum speed.) Because microwave ovens and cordless phones use the 2.4 Ghz band, a router placed too close to those devices could lose its signal, forcing you to regularly restart your modem and router. The 5 Ghz band is less prone to interference and has more capacity than the 2.4 Ghz band, which means that even if your neighbors are on wireless, their signal shouldn't interfere with yours. On the other hand, a 5 Ghz signal does not travel as far as its lower-speed counterpart. And if your PC or other device is not compatible with a 5 Ghz signal, it won't work on that band. Bottom line: If your router is in your kitchen or other area that regularly runs cordless phones or vacuum cleaners, consider a dual-band router. Otherwise, you probably don't need it. WHAT'S THIS POWERLINE STUFF? The convenience of wireless often outweighs its problems: the likelihood that you will lose your signal from time to time. Wireless connections are slower than wired ones. According to a study by Epitiro, a quality-of-service research group, a wireless signal is typically 30 percent slower that a wired one. For the most reliable and fastest Internet experience, a wired connection is the answer. But unless you're willing to string Ethernet cables along your floor or able to stuff them in your walls, that may not be practical. Another solution is called Powerline networking, or HomePlug: using your home's electrical wiring to transmit the Internet signal. To do so, you need to buy two Powerline AV transmitters (they're available from Belkin, Netgear and other manufacturers). One is connected to the router using an Ethernet cable, and the other is plugged into the wall where you want the Internet signal to pop out. You connect that second unit to your PC (or Internet-capable TV or Blu-ray player), using an Ethernet cable. Bottom line: When possible, create a wired, not a wireless network. Or you can bridge the wireless gap with Powerline technology -- but it's best to always maintain a wireless connection as a backup in case your Powerline system goes down.  "
British Panel Wants to Hear From Three Men Who Dispute Murdochs' Testimony,"The chairman of the British parliamentary panel that questioned Rupert and James Murdoch last week about phone hacking wants to hear from three men who claim that the Murdochs gave inaccurate testimony. John Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament who chairs the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told The Evening Standard of London on Tuesday: ""It is somewhat frustrating to keep hearing media reports about people wishing to correct evidence. If they have doubts about any testimony they should get in touch with us immediately."" Mr. Whittingdale was referring to statements released in recent days by three men who all held senior positions at News International, the Murdochs' British newspaper division, until earlier this month.  Colin Myler, who was the editor of The News of the World, the British tabloid at the center of the hacking scandal, and Tom Crone, who was the chief legal adviser to News International, said in a joint statement on Thursday that James Murdoch ""was mistaken"" when he told the committee that he had not been made aware of an incriminating e-mail in 2008, when he agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by a phone hacking victim. The e-mail, from a News of the World journalist, strongly suggested that phone hacking was more widespread at the paper in 2005 than the company had previously acknowledged. Then on Friday, Jon Chapman, News International's director of legal affairs until this month, said in a statement that he wanted to cooperate with the committee to correct ""serious inaccuracies in statements made"" at last week's hearing. Mr. Whittingdale told The Standard, ""If Mr. Chapman has information which he believes calls into question the evidence provided by James Murdoch, then we would be very keen to speak to him."" The Standard notes that Mr. Chapman was a senior executive at Enron before he started working for News International in 2003. During last week's hearing, James Murdoch was asked if he was familiar with the term ""willful blindness,"" which was used to describe the behavior of senior executives at Enron who averted their eyes from wrongdoing. As The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by the Murdochs' News Corporation, explained on Friday:Mr. Chapman had served on the front lines since News International started having to deal with the allegations back in 2006, when News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were arrested. Mr. Chapman ultimately reported to Les Hinton, a top aide to Rupert Murdoch and executive chairman of News International until December 2007. Mr. Hinton then became head of News Corp.'s Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Hinton recently resigned from that role, saying he was ""ignorant of what apparently happened"" at The News of the World. Mr. Chapman played a key role in settling an unfair-dismissal dispute brought by Mr. Goodman after his conviction - a settlement that was approved by Mr. Hinton and the unit's head of human resources, according to testimony by Mr. Chapman before the parliamentary committee. He also played a role in an internal inquiry that resulted from that dispute, in which Mr. Chapman and a colleague reviewed a batch of e-mails between Mr. Goodman and five others, and then forwarded some or all of them to an outside law firm for review. That law firm, Harbottle & Lewis LLP, at the time found no ""reasonable evidence"" that others knew about or were carrying out similar illegal procedures. Another lawyer recently hired by News International, Ken MacDonald, said following a review of nine or 10 of those emails that there was ""blindingly obvious"" evidence of corrupt payments. During testimony on Tuesday to the parliamentary committee, Rupert Murdoch appeared to lay responsibility with Mr. Chapman, who helped oversee the Harbottle review, saying the former legal counsel would have been familiar with the file's contents ""for a number of years.""Mr. Chapman was a central figure in an internal inquiry conducted by News International into phone hacking in 2007. He has also previously provided evidence on the matter to the parliamentary committee. In response to a request from the committee in October 2009, News International provided a copy of the letter sent to Mr. Chapman on May 29, 2007, from Lawrence Abramson of Harbottle & Lewis. Here, from the House of Commons Web site, is the full text of that letter:Re Clive Goodman We have on your instructions reviewed the emails to which you have provided access from the accounts of: Andy Coulson Stuart Kuttner Ian Edmondson Clive Goodman Neil Wallis Jules Stenson I can confirm that we did not find anything in those emails which appeared to us to be reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman's illegal actions were known about and supported by both or either of Andy Coulson, the Editor, and Neil Wallis, the Deputy Editor, and/or that Ian Edmondson, the News Editor, and others were carrying out similar illegal procedures. Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance.In hindsight, what is striking about the letter is that it suggests that Harbottle & Lewis was instructed by News International to conduct a very narrow review of the e-mails; the lawyers  looked only for evidence that Mr. Goodman's superiors knew about his use of the illegal technique or that others at the paper were using it. They were not asked to look for evidence of other kinds of illegal activity, like payments to the police, or to review e-mails sent by other reporters at the paper, like the one that contained a transcript of 35 hacked voice mail messages that Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone said they told James Murdoch about in 2008. As my colleagues Jo Becker and Ravi Somaiya reported last weekend, while some of the e-mails reviewed for News International's internal inquiry in 2007 ""showed no direct evidence of hacking, according to three company officials they did contain suggestions that Mr. Coulson may have authorized payments to the police for information."" They also reported that, according to News International officials, the 2007 review of e-mails was not undertaken to find out if hacking had been widely practiced by News of the World journalists. Rather, the review ""was aimed at defending the company from a lawsuit filed by Clive Goodman,"" who had been fired for hacking. Mr. Goodman claimed that his dismissal was unfair because his colleagues had also used the technique. This might explain why Harbottle & Lewis was asked to review e-mail traffic only between Mr. Goodman and his editors. Three of the five editors named in the Harbottle & Lewis letter -- Andy Coulson, Neil Wallis and Ian Edmondson -- have been arrested in recent months in connection with new police investigations into phone hacking and illegal payments to police officers.  "
Murdoch's Former Allies Deliver a Counterpunch,"LONDON -- The day after James Murdoch appeared before a parliamentary panel investigating allegations of phone hacking at The News of the World tabloid, he was firmly locked in a high-stakes battle of wills with the tabloid's last editor, Colin Myler, and a former legal manager, Tom Crone. Mr. Murdoch told Parliament that Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler had failed to inform him of the depth of the scandal at the tabloid he supervised in his father's media empire, News Corporation. The two men, with equal vehemence, insist they informed him of more widespread criminal practices at the paper in 2008.  Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler are known in the industry as tough operators -- ''not the kind of people you take on lightly,'' according to Brian Cathcart, a professor of journalism at Kingston University, and the founder of Hacked Off, a campaign seeking full investigation of the scandal. ''This is a man,'' he said of Mr. Crone, ''who has been the body-burier at The News of the World, and he's a sharp lawyer. But it's come down to a situation for the company where there's no saving James without taking him on.'' Mr. Myler, one of his former employees said, is a devout Catholic and is more cautious than most tabloid editors. ''If he decides to do something,'' said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the continuing investigations and the condition of the tabloid's severance package, ''it is well thought through and calculated.'' The two men had presented a united front with Mr. Murdoch through years of scrutiny since the scandal surfaced in 2006. But that cracked after Mr. Murdoch's first round of testimony, in July, as the panel tried to determine how long he had known of potentially rampant hacking at The News of the World, now defunct. Any remaining bonds between them shattered after Mr. Murdoch's second round, on Thursday. In both appearances before the parliamentary committee, he was asked sharp questions about clear evidence of broader hacking that circulated among his executives in 2008. Mr. Murdoch sought to deflect the panel's focus from himself and toward Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone. After the first round, the two men released a statement rejecting Mr. Murdoch's testimony that they had not informed him of evidence suggesting more widespread hacking: an e-mail that indicated more than one reporter at The News of the World had used information from hacked voicemail messages for stories. On Thursday, after Mr. Murdoch said their statements were ''inconsistent and not right'' and ''misleading,'' the rejoinder was swift. ''It is regrettable,'' Mr. Crone counterpunched in a statement, ''but I can perfectly understand why James Murdoch felt the need to discredit Colin Myler and myself. The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning e-mail and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement.'' He concluded: ''At best, his evidence on this matter was disingenuous.'' Mr. Myler, too, said he stood by his account. Professor Cathcart sees the clash as a turning point in what is now an epic scandal, roping in top politicians, police officials and media moguls. ''The day that Myler and Crone broke ranks was the day this cracked open,'' he said. Several former News of the World employees, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect severance packages, expressed bafflement at Mr. Murdoch's decision to engage in a public conflict with the two men. Mr. Crone, the former staff members said, is a steely man of few, but devastating, words, a manner he forged over years of facing down the angry subjects of News of the World scoops. He was often found in the newsroom, and was the subject of affectionate rumor. He has had, one former staff member said, ''pretty much the most high-pressure job on Fleet Street for the last two decades, handling the biggest stories at the most litigious paper in the world. If there's one man who knows his stuff, knows where all the bodies are buried, and isn't flappable, it's Tom Crone.''  "
Sony Chief Says PlayStation Network to Return Soon,"Sony posted a series of announcements on its PlayStation blog Thursday, answering customer questions about a cyberattack that brought down the entire PlayStation Network and other services last month. In one of the blog posts, Sir Howard Stringer, Sony's chief executive, said that the PlayStation gaming network and Qriocity Network, which is carries streaming video and music to customers, would be back online in the coming days. Although Sony said it is unsure if customers' information and credit card data was stolen during the attack, Mr. Stringer said Sony had implemented a program for its customers that offers a ""$1 million identity theft insurance policy per user."" He also said Sony plans to announce identity theft programs for other regions soon. Sony also laid out plans to try and reimburse customers who have been without access to services for almost three weeks. ""As we have announced, we will be offering a 'Welcome Back' package to our customers once our PlayStation Network and Qriocity services are up and running,"" Mr. Stringer wrote, trying to quell customer frustration and dissatisfaction with the slow response to get services back online. The free package will include one month of free PlayStation Plus membership. Sony has come under increased pressure from Congress, United States Senators and international courts to explain why the company took over a week to notify its 77 million customers of the security breach. Mr. Stringer defended the company's response time, saying ""forensic analysis is a complex, time-consuming process.""  "
Sony Chief Defends Response to PlayStation Data Breach,"Over the weekend Sony finally brought its PlayStation Network back online after attackers forced it  to shut down for almost a month. Now the company's top managers are defending their response to the attack, which some say was too slow. In an interview at the company's New York offices on Tuesday, Howard Stringer, Sony's chief executive, argued that Sony had responded to the attack in a timely manner, and that as executives learned about the extent of the attack, they regularly shared information with customers. When asked why Sony waited almost a week to notify customers that personal information and credit card data had possibly been stolen in the attack, Mr. Stringer said: ""We reported quickly."" Mr. Stringer said that the attack was the largest of its kind on a company, and that ""we still have a lot of investigation to do to find out how this happened, but we're not there yet.""  Kazuo Hirai, Sony's corporate executive officer and executive vice president, spoke via teleconference from Japan and shared details of how the company plans to avoid another attack of this size. Mr. Hirai said Sony had rebuilt its security network and added stronger defenses to its servers. He also said the company has created new managerial-level security positions. The responsibility of the people in those new jobs ""is to set up a system to avoid this type of event again - putting a new system in place,"" Mr. Hirai said. Mr. Stringer said the attacks on Sony had prompted the company to strengthen security across all of its products. ""In every level of the company we are examining security,"" he said. ""From televisions to e-books, and onwards."" The Sony attacks have inspired privacy advocates and members of Congress to push for new laws that would better protect people's information online. Mr. Stringer said he welcomed such laws and cited recent public discussions started by the White House about creating standards around dealing with crime and personal data online. Sony was recently asked to testify before a Congressional subcommittee about the attacks but declined, saying that it was working with law enforcement to investigate the breach. When asked if the company would testify if asked again by lawmakers, Mr. Stringer said, ""We'll wait to see what Congress has to offer.""  "
Hacking Group Says It Brought Down C.I.A. Site,"7:05 p.m. | Updated  Adding background on denial of service attacks, update on availability of C.I.A. site. Lulz Security, a group of hackers who have been responsible for a number of recent online data breaches, took aim at some United States government agencies on Wednesday.  The group said via Twitter that it had brought down the Central Intelligence Agency Web site, presumably with a so-called denial of service attack.  This involves hitting the site with so much traffic that it cannot handle the load. On Wednesday evening the site was sometimes unavailable but at other times loaded slowly.  The group also set up a series of hacks that allowed people who dialed a phone number to prank-call an office at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ""FBI in Detroit just got hundreds of calls. That woman was mad,"" the group wrote. The F.B.I and C.I.A did not respond to requests for comment. A C.I.A. spokeswoman told CNBC that the agency was looking into the report.  On Monday, Lulz Security claimed two victims. It posted an internal file from the Senate Web site and data that it said was from the internal network of Bethesda Softworks, a gaming company. Lulz Security has also claimed responsibility for hacking a number of other Web sites and companies, including the sites of PBS and Sony Pictures and a Web site associated with the F.B.I.     A distributed denial of service attack involves using many computers to bombard a Web site with an overload of traffic, knocking it  offline. These types of attacks do not result in data being stolen or servers being breached.  "
Hacking Group Lulz Security Says It Is Ending Spree,"10:26 p.m. | Updated Adding background on Ryan Cleary, whom the British police arrested this week and linked to Lulz Security. Lulz Security, a group of hackers who have tormented corporations and government agencies, said Saturday that it would stop its spree, 50 days after it first started the attacks. In a statement posted on The Pirate Bay, a file-sharing Web site, the group said its six members had decided to ""say bon voyage"" as Lulz Security but did not cite a reason. In addition, the group shared a number of files and documents it said were obtained in the course of its attacks. These files, which were available for download, included what appeared to be internal company documents from AT&T  and user names and passwords from a number of other Web sites. On its Twitter feed, the group's members encouraged other hackers to continue attacking Web sites and government agencies and said they planned to stay involved in the efforts through Anonymous, another collective of hackers.  Even assuming the statement speaks for what is a loose and anarchic group, the claim that Lulz Security does not plan any more data breaches or other hacking efforts is open to question. Lulz Security has become known online for its sarcastic and snide commentary, and has continually promised to carry on. It is unclear why the group decided to stop hacking under its current name. In a recent interview with Adrian Chen of Gawker, one the group's members, who goes by the name ""Topiary"" online, said Lulz Security planned to continue its campaign for some time and said he had no fears of being apprehended by the authorities. ""Worrying is for fools!"" Topiary told Mr. Chen when asked if he feared being caught. Lulz Security has been pursued by government agencies around the world, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency. Other hackers were also taking aim at the group's members, saying they had gone too far with their activities. E-mail and phone messages seeking comment from F.B.I. officials drew no immediate response. Earlier this week, the British police arrested Ryan Cleary, 19, and charged him with illegally using a computer to perform denial-of-service attacks - bombarding Web sites with so many automated messages that they shut down. One of Mr. Cleary's targets was said to have been Britain's  Serious Organized Crime Agency, an attack that Lulz Security took credit for. Lulz Security has claimed responsibility for hacking a number of sites over the past two months, including PBS.org, the United States Senate, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the Web site of a company associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Here is the full statement attributed to Lulz Security:Friends around the globe, We are Lulz Security, and this is our final release, as today marks something meaningful to us. 50 days ago, we set sail with our humble ship on an uneasy and brutal ocean: the Internet. The hate machine, the love machine, the machine powered by many machines. We are all part of it, helping it grow, and helping it grow on us. For the past 50 days we've been disrupting and exposing corporations, governments, often the general population itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because we could. All to selflessly entertain others -- vanity, fame, recognition, all of these things are shadowed by our desire for that which we all love. The raw, uninterrupted, chaotic thrill of entertainment and anarchy. It's what we all crave, even the seemingly lifeless politicians and emotionless, middle-aged self-titled failures. You are not failures. You have not blown away. You can get what you want and you are worth having it, believe in yourself. While we are responsible for everything that The Lulz Boat is, we are not tied to this identity permanently. Behind this jolly visage of rainbows and top hats, we are people. People with a preference for music, a preference for food; we have varying taste in clothes and television, we are just like you. Even Hitler and Osama Bin Laden had these unique variations and style, and isn't that interesting to know? The mediocre painter turned supervillain liked cats more than we did. Again, behind the mask, behind the insanity and mayhem, we truly believe in the AntiSec movement. We believe in it so strongly that we brought it back, much to the dismay of those looking for more anarchic lulz. We hope, wish, even beg, that the movement manifests itself into a revolution that can continue on without us. The support we've gathered for it in such a short space of time is truly overwhelming, and not to mention humbling. Please don't stop. Together, united, we can stomp down our common oppressors and imbue ourselves with the power and freedom we deserve. So with those last thoughts, it's time to say bon voyage. Our planned 50 day cruise has expired, and we must now sail into the distance, leaving behind -- we hope -- inspiration, fear, denial, happiness, approval, disapproval, mockery, embarrassment, thoughtfulness, jealousy, hate, even love. If anything, we hope we had a microscopic impact on someone, somewhere. Anywhere. Thank you for sailing with us. The breeze is fresh and the sun is setting, so now we head for the horizon. Let it flow... Lulz Security -- our crew of six wishes you a happy 2011, and a shout-out to all of our battlefleet members and supporters across the globe  "
111 Charged in Elaborate Identity-Theft Scheme,"A total of 111 people have been indicted in an identity-theft scheme that originated largely in the back rooms of Queens restaurants, the authorities said on Friday, and then mushroomed into a worldwide network of counterfeiters, hackers, fences and thieves who made off with an estimated $13 million in fraudulent purchases. The investigation, dubbed Operation Swiper, uncovered ties to criminal enterprises in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, the authorities said.  The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said on Friday that the size of the identity-theft operation took him aback. ""This is by far the largest and certainly amongst the most sophisticated identity-theft credit card fraud cases that any of us have every seen,"" he said.  Detectives rounded up 75 suspects and are searching for 21 others, including four who are believed to have fled to Russia, according to Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. He added that 15 people suspected in the plot were already in custody. The charges involve defrauding thousands of people over the course of 16 months, from May 2010 until this September. Often, the police said, the criminals obtained victims' credit card information from restaurant employees who used hand-held skimming machines. Overseas hackers and confederates working in banks also played a role in stealing personal information, they said.   Other members of the ring then forged credit cards using the stolen account information and went on weekly shopping sprees in California, Chicago, Texas and other places.  Apple electronics were favorite purchases, as well as designer clothes, including Louis Vuitton and Gucci. The goods were then fenced and the cash pocketed, the police said. Some members of the ring resorted to more old-fashioned crime, the authorities said, targeting a cargo shipment at Kennedy International Airport for theft, and planning to rob a bank in Forest Hills, Queens - both plots, the police said, were tracked and disrupted. The police and prosecutors said that early in their investigation, they received no tips from credit card companies or retail businesses even though balances on stolen accounts were skyrocketing.  Deputy Inspector Gregory T. Antonsen, the commander of the Police Department's Identity Theft Squad, said that law enforcement had been urging the business community to take greater security measures. He highlighted the deterrent value of identity chips implanted in credit cards that are common in Europe.   Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said that credit companies were ""putting too much money into marketing and not enough into security."" He said that the companies, ""would rather take the losses"" than spend on security measures designed to avert theft.  Some of the suspects spent their ill-gotten gains on trips to luxury villas in Puerto Rico and drove around in Porsches, the authorities said. ""They frequently vacationed in Miami - they were all scheduled to go there on Friday,"" Inspector Antonsen said at a news conference at Police Headquarters on Friday. ""Unfortunately they are in Central Booking in jail.""   He paused, then clarified whose misfortune he was referring to: ""For them.  Not for us.""   "
Hacker-Avoidance Tips for SecurID Users (and Others),"If you use an RSA SecurID keyfob or card for stricter security than a user name and password provides, you may have just become a last line of defense. RSA Security, a division of EMC Corporation, said on Thursday that it suffered a sophisticated hacker attack that resulted in the theft of sensitive information related to its popular SecurID two-factor authentication products. These products involve keyfob devices that display pass codes that change every 30 to 60 seconds, which many companies give to employees who access their networks remotely and some financial institutions give to high-net-worth clients as a way to bolster password security. The devices provide a second security factor - ''something you have'' - that is combined with the standard first factor of a user name and password, which is ''something you know.''  While RSA provided few details about what exactly was stolen from its computer systems, it said the information would not, alone, enable a successful attack on SecurID customers, but could potentially reduce the ''effectiveness'' of the system ''as part of a broader attack.'' RSA's system is comprised of three main elements: a proprietary SecurID algorithm, a ''secret seed'' number for each device, and a user pass code. In theory, only by possessing all three could a hacker break in. The RSA hack's worst case appears to be the theft of two of the three - the algorithm and the secret seeds - says Aleksandr Yampolskiy, director of security at Gilt Groupe, operator of a high-end e-commerce site. However, he notes that the seeds appear to be safe, since RSA has said that no customer data was stolen. That means the third element - the user names and pass codes - stored away in customer networks, and employees' brains, are still safe. For now, anyway. The next step for the RSA hackers could be to filch them too, either by hacking a company's network or you. Here's what you, the keyfob user, should weigh and watch out for: 1) Use a difficult-to-guess pass code for your SecurID token. The advice here is the same as for all your passwords: don't use strings like ''12345'' or the dreaded ''password'' password. Do use a random combination of characters and letters. ''As long as you still have good passwords, your risk is lower because they would still have to crack your passwords to get in,'' says Rich Mogull, chief executive at Securosis, a security research and analysis firm. 2) Be wary if all of a sudden you are locked out of a system and you don't recall mistyping your password or the code provided by your SecurID, Mr. Yampolskiy says. Alert your I.T. department so they can investigate, because it could be an indication that hackers tried a brute-force attack to guess your credentials. 3) Beware ''social engineering.'' Many hacker attacks begin with a low-tech effort to trick marks into downloading malware that can gather user names and passwords or to get them to simply hand over the information. Be suspicious of odd e-mails, and never provide user names or other credentials to anyone without verifying that person's identity and need to know, including should they call you on the phone. 4) Be socially conscious. On social networks, employees should be cautious about what they reveal about their companies, says Scott Crawford, research director for security and risk management at Enterprise Management Associates, an industry research firm. They also need to be careful about what games and apps they use and the links they click on, because of the risk of revealing considerable personal information or unwittingly downloading malware. The same goes for social networks as on e-mail and the Web: don't open or click on anything that looks dodgy, especially if you're on a computer that you use to access your company network or to bank online. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
PlayStation Security Breach a Test of Consumers' Trust,"When Sony designers made the PlayStation 3, they lavished attention on the hardware. And when their shiny new machine was finished, Sony executives basically said, ''Hmm, we'd better figure out an online system for this thing.'' So they tacked one on. It shows.  On Tuesday I was among the more than 70 million customers of Sony's PlayStation Network and Qriocity music and video service to receive an appalling e-mail essentially saying that everything the company knew about us -- where we live, when we were born, our log-ins and passwords, and possibly more -- had been ripped off. As an admission of online ineptitude, it could hardly be more thorough. It could get worse. ''If you have provided your credit card data through PlayStation Network or Qriocity,'' Sony said, ''out of an abundance of caution we are advising you that your credit card number (excluding security code) and expiration date may have been obtained.'' The PlayStation Network has always been the PS3's weakest link, especially in comparison with Microsoft's Xbox 360, the other high-definition game console. Microsoft designed the 360 around the Internet from the ground up, and Xbox Live feels slick, robust and responsive. PlayStation Network feels clunky and slow. When you are on Xbox Live, you feel like you're cruising an entertainment bazaar. On PlayStation Network, you feel as if you're waiting in line. For years I've been telling adults who ask which console to buy to get a 360 if they want to play online and download TV shows and movies, and to get a PS3 if they want to watch Blu-ray discs. It has been pretty much that simple. (Nintendo's Wii isn't high-def and is aimed mostly at families with children, so that's a different market.) The root issue is that Sony has never made the transition from an electronics and media company focused on physical products to a software and services company focused on providing experiences. And now it is paying a huge price in its online credibility and reputation. Sony didn't even realize that its trove of customer data had been stolen until an external security consultant discovered the theft on Monday, a week after the fact. Can anyone imagine Microsoft allowing hackers to ravish its network or Apple allowing crooks to steal tens of millions of customers' intimate information on iTunes and then having to hire an outside company to figure out what happened? Of course not. For all the enmity between them, Apple and Microsoft have remade themselves as both Internet and online entertainment companies. Through their game and media services, they are successfully competing with television networks and film studios to reach a mass consumer audience. Sony, by comparison, has failed on the Internet. And remember, this is the company that popularized the concept of portable personal music with the Walkman, then allowed Apple to use the Internet to all but take over the music business. And video games are all about the Internet. Gamers are the most intense, engaged and (along with their hacker brethren) powerful constituency in cyberspace. Gamers and game culture live online, and they know what is important when it comes to digital entertainment. When the Xbox 360 endured its Red Ring of Death pandemic, with millions of units experiencing complete hardware failure, Microsoft received relatively little consumer backlash. Millions of Xbox owners dutifully sent their consoles in for free replacement and never contemplated switching to Sony. It was embarrassing and costly for Microsoft, but customers didn't defect en masse. It's not that gamers love Microsoft; they recognize that hardware sometimes fails. What matters, what keeps people coming back, is software and online community, and in both those areas the Xbox is great. But the gamer (and any sane consumer) also says this: If you are cavalier with my personal information I will punish you by walking away. Qriocity and PlayStation Network have been down for a week, and it is unclear when they will be back up. In other words, PlayStation users are cut off from the Internet and from one another. Once Sony inevitably assures us that everything is fine, who, exactly, is going to volunteer to trust the company again with personal financial information? I'm going to hold off on that. I know I won't be alone.  "
"Nintendo Is Hit by Hackers, But Breach Is Deemed Minor","TOKYO -- Nintendo, the manufacturer of the Wii and 3DS game systems, said Sunday that it had been the target of a recent hacker attack, the latest in a flurry of intrusions into corporate Web sites.  Nintendo, which is based in Kyoto, said in a statement that a server at an affiliate of its United States unit was accessed unlawfully ''a few weeks ago.'' That server contained no consumer information and no data had been lost, the company said. The attack on Nintendo appears to be significantly less serious than the security breach of Sony's PlayStation Network, which forced it offline in late April for more than a month. Hackers in that case took personal data from tens of millions of user accounts, including credit card numbers. Nevertheless, the continuing intrusions underscore the vulnerability of online services at a time companies have raced to expand their Internet offerings. A hacker group called LulzSec, which has said it was behind several data breaches at Sony, also appeared to claim responsibility for the attack at Nintendo. In a post on Twitter on Saturday, the group suggested that Nintendo might be spared some of the harsher intrusions it said it had directed at Sony. ''We're not targeting Nintendo. We like the N64 too much -- we sincerely hope Nintendo plugs the gap,'' the group said on its Twitter account, referring to the company's Nintendo 64 game machine, released in the mid-1990s. LulzSec on Thursday claimed responsibility for breaking into the Sony Pictures Entertainment site and stealing personal information of about 52,000 customers. The group also claimed to have broken into a database for Sony Music's Japanese site on May 23. It is a consequential time for Nintendo, as it introduces its e-Shop service for the 3DS, its flagship device that lets users play 3-D games without wearing special glasses. Nintendo said it has fixed the problem and that the hacking episode would not delay its new online service, the Nintendo e-Shop, which lets users download games for the 3DS hand-held machine. The service will go online Monday in the United States as planned, said Ken Toyoda, a spokesman for Nintendo. ''The server issue was resolved some time ago,'' Mr. Toyoda said from Los Angeles, ahead of the annual E3 Expo, a major trade event for the gaming industry. Gaming companies like Nintendo and Sony Computer Entertainment have been eager to take their businesses online to increase revenue and to compete with the popularity of simple downloadable games played on smartphones and tablet computers. Sony had been banking on its PlayStation Network as a base for an online universe that would link its gaming consoles, and its TVs, digital music players and other Sony-made devices. Sony promised in May that it would bolster its online security. It said it was cooperating with the F.B.I. in a wide-ranging investigation. Other tech giants have been the focus of a global surge in hacker attacks. Last week, Google said that hundreds of users of Gmail had been the targets of clandestine attacks, apparently originating in China. The attacks were aimed at stealing the passwords and monitoring e-mail from accounts of senior government officials in the United States, Chinese political activists, officials in several Asian countries, military personnel and journalists, Google said.  "
Security Firm Offers to Replace Tokens After Attack,"RSA Security on Monday offered to replace its SecurID tokens for most of its 40 million users as it tries to regain customer confidence after prominent hacking attacks.  Arthur W. Coviello, the company's executive chairman, made the offer in a letter posted on the company's Web site. Most Fortune 500 companies and government agencies supply the electronic tokens to employees who need access to computer networks from customer offices, hotels or homes. The tokens generate random numbers for use in remote log-ins. The move came three days after Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, confirmed that hackers had breached its network in May, partly by using data stolen from RSA in a separate hacking attack in March. Lockheed's was the first intrusion that was known to result from the hacking at RSA, a division of the EMC Corporation. RSA said in March that the hackers had stolen data that could compromise a company's SecurID system in a broader attack. Mr. Coviello said in the letter that characteristics of the attack on RSA ''indicated that the perpetrator's most likely motive'' was to steal security information that could be used to obtain military secrets and intellectual property. He said RSA had worked with military companies to replace their tokens ''on an accelerated timetable.'' He said RSA was expanding the offer to other companies, particularly those focused on protecting intellectual property and their corporate networks.  "
RSA Faces Angry Users After Breach,"The nation's biggest banks and large technology companies like SAP rushed Tuesday to accept RSA Security's offer to replace their ubiquitous SecurID tokens as many computer security experts voiced frustration with the company. The company's admission of the RSA tokens' vulnerability on Monday was a shock to many customers because it came so long after a hacking attack on RSA in March and one on Lockheed Martin last month. The concern of customers and consultants over the way RSA, a unit of the tech giant EMC, communicated also raises the possibility that many customers will seek alternative solutions to safeguard remote access to their computer networks. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup said they planned to replace the tokens as soon as possible. The banks declined to say how many customers would be affected, although SAP said that most of its 50,000 employees used RSA's tokens and that it was seeking to replace them all. Defense industry officials said Tuesday that concerns about the tokens had prompted some of the nation's largest military contractors to accelerate their plans to shift to computer smart cards and other emerging security technology.  The RSA tokens provide security by requiring users to enter a unique number generated by the token each time they connect to their networks. Competitors eyeing the dominant market share of RSA are offering special deals like $5 rebates per token to customers that are considering a switch. For now, however, the biggest worry for RSA is how to appease angry customers as well as mollify computer security consultants, who have been increasingly critical of how long it took the company to acknowledge the severity of the problem. Industry officials said that Lockheed, the nation's largest military contractor, made the security changes suggested by RSA after its attack in March. They included increased monitoring and addition of another password to its remote log-in process. Yet the hackers still got into Lockheed's network, prompting security experts to say that the tokens themselves needed to be reprogrammed. Arthur W. Coviello Jr., RSA's executive chairman, made the offer in a letter posted on the company's Web site on Monday. He said RSA was expanding the offer to companies other than military contractors, particularly those focused on protecting intellectual property and their corporate networks. He also said it was suggesting that banks use two additional RSA services to avert fraud in authenticating computer log-ins. Mr. Coviello said in the letter that characteristics of the attack on RSA ''indicated that the perpetrator's most likely motive'' was to steal security information that could be used to obtain military secrets and intellectual property. He said that RSA had worked with military companies to replace their tokens ''on an accelerated timetable.'' Michael Gallant, an EMC spokesman, said, ''We have not withheld any information that would adversely affect the security of our customers' systems.'' ''We provided very specific recommendations, we provided details of the attack, and we worked closely with customers to strengthen their overall security,'' Mr. Gallant said. The company's admissions were too little, too late, industry experts said. ''They got pushed really hard by some of their customers, particularly in the financial services sector,'' said Gary McGraw, chief technology officer for Cigital, a computer security consulting company based in Washington. ''They came around, but they came around late.'' Mr. McGraw said that companies would be wise to replace RSA's tokens and that some companies -- banks, in particular -- had done so. Like many people, he criticized RSA for failing to disclose the potential danger of the problem to its customers. Until Monday, RSA said publicly and privately in meetings with customers that replacements were unnecessary, he said. ''They shared their party line that everything is fine -- pay no attention to the explosion in the corner,'' Mr. McGraw said. Another security consultant, Alex Stamos, chief technology officer for iSEC Partners, said that many companies that use RSA tokens were irate about the hacking and RSA's response. He claimed that RSA misled customers about the potential problems after the initial hacking came to light. ''Their whole excuse doesn't hold water,'' he said. By minimizing the problem for six to seven weeks, Mr. Stamos said that RSA made companies more vulnerable. ''There would have been huge benefit for RSA customers to know the truth,'' he said. In the short term, customers are focused on getting new tokens but the overall outlook is cloudy. ''Companies are asking for the new tokens and looking long term to switching away from RSA,'' Mr. Stamos said. ''If you have 30,000 employees, switching to a new access solution is a yearlong process.'' Avivah Litan, a longtime financial technology analyst for Gartner, estimated that it would cost banks just under $1 per customer to clean up the mess, even though RSA had agreed to supply new tokens. That would amount to as much as $95 million in customer service, mailing and other costs -- a tiny fraction of the roughly $29 billion in profit the banking industry earned in the first quarter of this year. As a result, most bankers see the recent breach as an annoyance, not a major security threat. Ms. Litan said that most of the biggest banks would step up other fraud protection measures, like monitoring their Web sites and customer accounts for suspicious behavior. Moving to a new token provider would be costly because it would require them to redesign their online-banking applications as well as help customers -- typically high-net-worth customers they do not want to alarm -- make the shift to a new system. Still, to increase security, Ms. Litan predicted that more banks would instead turn to new fraud prevention technologies that have been gaining adoption recently. Such technologies help banks make sure that customers' PCs are malware-free, send text messages or call customers to confirm transactions, and use analytics to look for unusual behavior that might point to fraud. But the blow to RSA's reputation could hurt the company's ability to win new business, she said. While RSA was once the safe, conservative choice, ''now when people talk about them, they will always be associated with this breach,'' Ms. Litan said. Experts have speculated that the hackers obtained at least part of the RSA databases holding serial numbers and other critical data for the tens of millions of tokens. But to make use of the data stolen from RSA, security experts said, the hackers of Lockheed would also have needed the passwords of one or more users on the company's network. RSA has said that in its own breach, the hackers did this by sending ''phishing'' e-mails to small groups of employees, including one worker who opened an attachment that unleashed malicious software, enabling the hacker to obtain the worker's passwords. Lockheed has said it would keep using the SecurID tokens and would replace 45,000 of them. L-3 Communications, a military contractor in New York, is also still using the tokens. The military industry officials said that even before the breach at RSA, Northrop Grumman, another giant military contractor, had begun shifting from SecurID tokens to smart cards. The Pentagon also uses the smart cards, and other military contractors are accelerating plans to switch to them as well, the officials said. Indeed, analysts say rivals like Vasco Data Security, Symantec, VeriSign and dozens of small security vendors are circling. On Tuesday, PhoneFactor, which offers a phone-based password service to hundreds of companies, offered live Webcasts and a rebate to companies that wanted to switch. ''Since the Lockheed story, it's been crazier than ever,'' said Steve Dispensa, the chief technology officer of PhoneFactor.  "
Hacker Rattles Security Circles,"He claims to be 21 years old, a student of software engineering in Tehran who reveres Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and despises dissidents in his country. He sneaked into the computer systems of a security firm on the outskirts of Amsterdam. He created fake credentials that could allow someone to snoop on Internet connections that appeared to be secure. He then shared that bounty with people he declines to name. The fruits of his labor are believed to have been used to tap into the online communications of as many as 300,000 unsuspecting Iranians this summer. What's more, he punched a hole in an online security mechanism that is trusted by millions of Internet users all over the world. Comodohacker, as he calls himself, insists he acted on his own and is unperturbed by the notion that his work may have been used to spy on antigovernment compatriots.  ''I'm totally independent,'' he said in an e-mail exchange with The New York Times. ''I just share my findings with some people in Iran. They are free to do anything they want with my findings and things I share with them, but I'm not responsible.'' In the annals of Internet attacks, this is likely to go down as a moment of reckoning. For activists, it shows the downside of using online tools to organize: an opponent with enough determination and resources just might find a way to track their every move. It also calls into question the reliability of a basic system of trust that global Internet brands like Google and Facebook, along with their users, rely upon. The system is intended to verify the authenticity of a particular Web site -- to ensure, in effect, that Gmail is Gmail, and that the connection to the site is encrypted and difficult for an outsider to monitor. Hundreds of companies and government authorities around the world, including in the United States and China, have the power to issue the digital certificates that the system relies upon to verify a site's identity. The same hacker is believed to be responsible for attacks on three such companies. In March, he claimed credit for a breach of Comodo, in Italy. In late August came the attack on the Dutch company DigiNotar. On Friday evening, a company called GlobalSign said it had detected an intrusion into its Web site, but not into more confidential systems. Armed with certificates stolen from companies like these, someone with control over an Internet service provider, like the Iranian authorities, could trick Internet users into thinking they were safely connected to a familiar site, while eavesdropping on their online activity. Fearing the prospect of other breaches similar to those carried out by this hacker, Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox Web browser, last week issued a warning to certificate authority companies to audit their security systems or risk being booted off Firefox. ''It is a real example of a weakness in security infrastructure that many people assumed was trustworthy,'' said Richard Bejtlich, the chief security officer of Mandiant Security in Alexandria, Va. ''It's a reminder that it is only as trustworthy as the companies that make up the system. There are bound to be some that can't protect their infrastructure, and you have results like this.'' Comodohacker said via e-mail that he began his explorations by scrolling through a list of certificate authority companies. DigiNotar caught his interest because it was Dutch. He said he was motivated by the failure of Dutch peacekeepers to prevent the massacres of Muslims in Srebenica in 1995. He also said he chose the Dutch company because of a Dutch legislator, Geert Wilders, who has built a political career out of criticizing Muslims in his country. DigiNotar, which is owned by an Illinois company called Vasco Data Security International, did not make the attack particularly difficult, according to a report by Fox-IT, a security company that was commissioned by the Dutch government to investigate. The company's critical servers contained malicious software that should have been spotted by antivirus tools, the report said, and the servers related to certificates were all protected by just one weak password. DigiNotar did not respond to requests for comment last week. There was fallout in the Netherlands as well. The government there said last week that it was widening its investigation into the breach in an effort to learn whether the private data of Dutch citizens, many of whom file income tax returns online, had been compromised. Comodohacker apparently began poking around DigiNotar's systems in early June, the Fox-IT report said. He gained control of the server in about 10 days and generated 531 fake certificates, including some for well-known sites like Google, Skype and Facebook, along with a few foreign intelligence sites. He shared them with a person or organization believed to have had control over dozens of Internet service providers and university networks in Iran -- perhaps the government itself. Fox-IT concluded that over the course of a month, 300,000 people were served up fake certificates produced by Comodohacker. E-mails, chats, user names and passwords could have been monitored, revealing who they were talking to and what they were planning. Google on Thursday issued an unusual warning to its users in Iran, calling on them to change passwords and check if their e-mails were being forwarded to unfamiliar or suspicious addresses. Word of the Google warning caught the attention of Jubeen Sharbaf, an Iranian in Toronto. He is not ignorant of the Iranian government's attempts to spy on its people, he said via e-mail. ''This was alarming though because Google is perceived to be very secure, and beside Skype it has been used for the line of communication within and outside Iran,'' he said. Comodohacker was plainspoken about his motivations. ''My country should have control over Google, Skype, Yahoo, etc.,'' he said by e-mail. ''I'm breaking all encryption algorithms and giving power to my country to control all of them.'' In the days since his attack was discovered, Comodohacker posted lengthy explanations on Pastebin, a sort of Internet bulletin board, of how he had penetrated the system of the Dutch firm and why, along with his e-mail address. He has also boasted of his own skills, calling his work the ''most sophisticated hack of all time,'' and at one point exclaiming: ''I'm really sharp, powerful, dangerous and smart!'' Mikko Hypponen, a security researcher with F-Secure Labs of Helsinki, said the hacker was ''somebody who has skills, and he also has the old-school hacker mentality where he likes to boast.'' Mr. Hypponen added: ''If he were an intelligence analyst for the secret police he wouldn't be doing this.'' Asked whether he was paid for his services, the hacker replied in broken English: ''I don't fight for my belief for award in this world.'' The e-mail he sent appears to have come from a computer in Russia, according to an independent security analyst who reviewed it. Comodohacker has either remotely taken control of someone's computer in Russia, or he may not be an Iranian software engineer at all.  "
Google Warns Users in Iran About Security Issue,"Google took the unusual step of warning Gmail users in Iran to ""secure their accounts,""  a week after an unidentified hacker generated fake Web site verification certificates that may have allowed the Iranian state to monitor communications by its citizens, including dissidents. On Google's security blog late Thursday, Eric Grosse, vice president for security engineering, said the company was ""directly contacting possibly affected users."" He noted that users of the Google Chrome browser were unaffected by the malicious attack but urged ""all users in Iran to take concrete steps to secure their accounts."" The company spelled out five separate steps, beginning with changing passwords and verifying account recovery options to ensure that alternate e-mail addresses and phone numbers are updated. It went on to advise users to make sure unfamiliar apps and Web sites did not have access to their accounts and that e-mails were not being automatically forwarded to suspicious, unknown addresses. Google was not the only site to be affected by the attack. The hacker produced fake certificates for other communications sites, including Skype and Facebook. The  certificates could be used by a third party with control of an Internet service provider. That third party could in turn eavesdrop on supposedly secure online conversations.   "
Media and Entertainment Companies Add Support to Proposed Antipiracy Legislation,"Big media companies have ratcheted up the pressure on Washington to support legislation that would protect online content. On Tuesday, dozens of entertainment, sports and media companies - including Time Warner, Viacom, Disney, News Corporation, Sony and the National Football League - jointly sent an open letter to Congress that will also appear  in major media outlets. ""Every day Internet criminals use illegal foreign Web sites to steal from New York companies and hardworking Americans,"" the letter reads. ""These illegal foreign Web sites are destroying American jobs and causing billions in lost revenue."" The ad is the latest plea for the passage of the Stop Online Piracy Act (or S.O.P.A.) scheduled for debate on Thursday by the House Judiciary Committee. The similar Protect IP Act is currently with the Senate.  The Creative America coalition, which represents major media companies and unions like the Screen Actors Guild and Directors Guild of America, has led the effort. Last week Creative America began running ads in national broadcast and cable outlets and various online publications. ""They sell phony medications. Dangerous counterfeit products. Stealing jobs from American businesses,"" one ad reads. A spokesman for Creative America declined to say how large the ad buy was.  ""Educating people about the growing problem of foreign rogue Web sites and their destructive impact on American jobs and creativity is one of Creative America's most important goals,"" the organization's executive director, Mike Nugent, said in a statement. Time Warner, in association with Creative America and other big media companies, has taken a similarly all-American approach. In the print ad, an American flag is superimposed on a computer keyboard. ""Stop Foreign Internet Criminals From Stealing American Jobs,"" the ad reads. ""We all strongly urge you to protect the jobs and intellectual property of American citizens by supporting the Protect IP Act (S. 968) and Stop Online Piracy Act (H.R. 3261)."" Last week, studio executives from Time Warner's Warner Brothers subsidiary and News Corporation's 20th Century Fox subsidiary traveled to Washington to meet with the House Judiciary Committee and senior White House officials. Of course, protecting American jobs will also help protect media companies' profits. As more content moves online, pressure has mounted on companies like Time Warner and its rivals to strike digital syndication deals and control what goes online and when.  As media companies lobby Washington to pass a bill, technology companies led by Google Inc. have waged efforts to block antipiracy legislation. S.O.P.A. and Protect IP would give the Justice Department the power to require Internet service providers and pay services like PayPal to cease relationships with foreign Web sites linked to piracy. Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, has called the legislation ""a form of censorship"" and told reporters on Monday that Washington ""should not criminalize the intermediaries.""  "
16 People Arrested in Wave Of Attacks on Web Sites,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In the most visible law enforcement response to a recent spate of online attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday announced the arrests of 16 people across the country in connection with strikes carried out by a loose, secretive federation of hackers called Anonymous. In an indictment unsealed Tuesday afternoon in United States District Court in San Jose, Calif., 14 people were charged in connection with an attack on the Web site of the payment service PayPal last December, after the company suspended accounts set up for donating funds to WikiLeaks. The suspects, in 10 separate states, are accused of conspiring to ''intentionally damage protected computers.''  Anonymous had publicly called on its supporters to attack the sites of companies it said were turning against WikiLeaks, using tools that bombard sites with traffic and knock them offline. A Florida man was also arrested and accused of breaching the Web site of Tampa InfraGard, an organization affiliated with the F.B.I., and then boasting of his actions on Twitter. And in New Jersey, a former contractor with AT&T was arrested on charges that he lifted files from that company's computer systems; the information was later distributed by LulzSec, a hacker collective that stemmed from Anonymous. The PayPal attack came in response to the release by WikiLeaks last November of thousands of classified State Department cables. Members of Anonymous, a clique of worldwide hackers with a vague and ever-changing menu of grievances, have claimed responsibility for a number of attacks on government and corporate Web sites over the last eight months. In recent weeks, police in Britain and the Netherlands have arrested several people suspected of having participated in those attacks. Justice Department officials said British and Dutch police also made related arrests on Tuesday. FoxNews.com reported Tuesday that the police in London had arrested a 16-year-old boy who they believed was a core member of LulzSec and used the alias Tflow. The arrests of suspected Anonymous supporters in the United States were among the first known in this country. Ross W. Nadel, a former federal prosecutor who founded the computer hacking and intellectual property unit at the Federal District Court in San Jose, said the arrests could be ''a highly visible form of deterrence.'' The prosecution is expected to face at least two major challenges, said Jennifer Granick, a San Francisco-based lawyer who specializes in computer crimes and has defended hackers in the past. Because hackers often use aliases and other people's computers when they carry out attacks, prosecutors will have to prove that those arrested ''were the ones with their fingers on the keyboard,'' she said. Second, the conspiracy charge could be especially difficult to prove, given that Anonymous boasts of being leaderless and free-floating. ''When you have a decentralized group,'' Ms. Granick said, ''the question is, Are there big fish, and are any of these people big fish?'' The charge of ''intentional damage to a protected computer'' is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, while conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Cyberattacks are made possible by a combination of two features of the Internet economy. Poor security at many companies and agencies makes sensitive government and private data vulnerable to breaches. And mounting an attack is inexpensive and, with the right skills, relatively simple. In the San Jose case, all 14 suspects are accused of using a free program called Low Orbit Ion Cannon to hurl large packets of data at PayPal's site with the intention of overwhelming it. With the exception of one suspect, whose name was redacted by the court for reasons that federal officials did not explain, those arrested were identified by their real names and nicknames, ranging from Anthrophobic to Toxic to MMMM. Most were in their 20s, and just three were above the age of 30. It is unclear if any of them knew one another.  "
Fox Edits Phone-Hacking Joke From Emmys; Replaces Baldwin With Nimoy,"The commercials for the Emmy Awards this year promised ""unexpected"" moments. Here's one: on Sunday afternoon Fox confirmed a report by the Web site Deadline Hollywood that the network had spiked a planned joke involving allegations of misconduct by its parent company, the News Corporation, from the awards telecast. Alec Baldwin, a star of the NBC comedy ""30 Rock,"" had taped an opening skit for the show days in advance, and in it he had referenced the phone hacking scandal that has embroiled the News Corporation in Britain. When Fox decided to edit out the reference over the weekend, Mr. Baldwin asked that his appearance be cut altogether because he felt the edit might affect the flow of the entire segment. In a Twitter message on Thursday, Mr. Baldwin suggested that Fox had erred in its edit. He later wrote: ""I think it would have made them look better. A little."" In the skit, Mr. Baldwin played the ""president of television."" While on the phone with an unidentified colleague, he paused and said, ""Rupert, is that you? I hear you breathing, Rupert!"" The chairman and chief executive of the News Corporation is Rupert Murdoch. A Fox spokeswoman said the reference was removed because the company was taking the hacking allegations seriously and did not want to appear to be making jokes about them. Leonard Nimoy was brought in as Mr. Baldwin's replacement for the taped skit. At the end of the elaborate comedy segment, which included cameos from many other actors, the award show's host, Jane Lynch of Fox's ""Glee,"" sang about television being a ""vast wonderland"" and referred to the ""wise and compassionate rulers"" of the networks, adding, ""especially Fox."" Mr. Baldwin wrote on Twitter on Sunday evening that he understood the decision to scrap the joke: ""If I were enmeshed in a scandal where I hacked phones of families of innocent crime victims purely for profit, I'd want that to go away, too.""   "
Third British Journalist Is Arrested in Phone-Hacking Case,"LONDON -- Police officials said Thursday that they had arrested a third journalist in connection with an expanding case of phone-hacking by reporters at The News of the World, a British tabloid.  The Metropolitan Police issued a statement announcing the arrest of a man early Thursday morning ''on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting mobile phone voice mail messages'' but did not identify the suspect, who was questioned at a London police station and then released on bail without any charges being filed. A person with knowledge of the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the inquiry, said the suspect was James Weatherup, an assistant editor at The News of the World who has also worked as a reporter and news editor there. British news media also identified Mr. Weatherup as the suspect. A biographical entry on the professional social networking site LinkedIn lists ''crisis management'' as one of Mr. Weatherup's areas of expertise. Last week, Scotland Yard arrested two journalists from the tabloid, which is one of Britain's most widely circulated newspapers. The men -- Ian Edmondson, who was fired as the tabloid's news editor this year, and Neville Thurlbeck, the newspaper's chief reporter -- were questioned, like Mr. Weatherup, on suspicion of illegally intercepting voice mail messages. Mr. Edmondson and Mr. Thurlbeck were released on bail. Many of the voice mail accounts said to have been hacked by reporters at the newspaper, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, belonged to British royalty and international celebrities, including Prince William and Prince Harry. The arrests this month signaled a potentially decisive turning point in the investigation, which has been under way for five years. Only two men have been jailed in the case, both in 2007: Clive Goodman, formerly the tabloid's royalty reporter, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator. The newspaper had previously said that the two had acted alone in hacking the accounts of celebrities, some of whom are now suing the newspaper. But the newspaper later acknowledged the involvement of others. A statement by the newspaper last week said that it was cooperating fully with the inquiry. A spokesman for the newspaper declined to comment on Mr. Weatherup's arrest. The case has major political repercussions. Critics have said that the original police inquiry, which continued for five years without any arrests other than those of Mr. Goodman and Mr. Mulcaire, was inhibited by concern at Scotland Yard and in the previous Labour Party government over the political influence wielded by the media empire controlled by Mr. Murdoch. His News International subsidiary owns The News of the World and several other major titles. Before the general election in Britain last May, Mr. Murdoch switched his newspapers' support from Labour to David Cameron and the Conservatives, who had recruited Andy Coulson, the former editor of The News of the World, as the Conservatives' communications director.

Scandal Stirs U.S. Debate On Big Media,"Progressive activists and public interest groups have long blasted Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation for political biases. But in recent weeks they have seized on a new and more tangible reason to call for the revocation of his TV licenses and the breakup of his company: the British hacking scandal. The scandal, they say, is an opportunity to raise awareness of -- and, they hope, objection to -- media consolidation at a time when the American government is reviewing the rules that govern how much companies like News Corporation, Comcast and the Walt Disney Company can own.  ''For those of us who've been warning about the dangers of too much media power concentrated in too few corporate hands, this scandal is a godsend,'' said Jeff Cohen, the founding director of the Park Center for Independent Media at Ithaca College. The scandal is also giving Democratic lawmakers an opportunity to call for more attention to the practices of such companies. Representative Bobby Rush, a Democrat of Illinois and a past critic of Mr. Murdoch, questioned in an interview whether the media mogul had been allowed to amass too much media power. ''We can't forget the fundamental tenet of media ownership in the United States. It's not a right, it's a privilege. And it's a privilege based on trust and responsibility,'' he said. Representative Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, said that along with media consolidation, the scandal raised questions about ''privacy expectations in the digital world'' and about how ''we support freedom of the press while ensuring the integrity and truthfulness of the press.'' There are few if any immediate threats to Mr. Murdoch's American portfolio, which includes the Fox network, two dozen local television stations, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. The Federal Communications Commission signaled last week that it regarded the hacking scandal as isolated to Britain. But the scandal in Britain could influence the F.C.C. review of media ownership rules, especially if there is perceptible public discord about powerful media moguls like Mr. Murdoch. The discord is already evident in Britain, where politicians have talked openly about considering new laws that would lead to a breakup of the News Corporation, which owns 39 percent of British Sky Broadcasting as well as numerous newspapers there. In the United States, politicians have called for investigations into whether News Corporation entities hacked into the phones of Americans, including the victims of Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now investigating; on Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch said that he was aware of no evidence that any 9/11 American victims had been affected. But media reform groups like Free Press, which advocates for more diversity in media ownership, say their interest extends far beyond any single investigation. ''I think this is the moment to contend with the serious damage the Murdoch empire has done to our media system over the past few decades,'' Craig Aaron, the head of that group, said last week. The 2004 book ''The New Media Monopoly'' by Ben H. Bagdikian found that more than half of the radio and television stations, daily newspapers, magazines, publishers and movie studios in the United States were owned by five companies. In January, in the most recent case of consolidation, the government approved a bid by Comcast to take control of NBC Universal. Proponents of media mergers say such combinations improve consumer access to news, information and entertainment. They say the Internet has fostered competition, creating new choices for consumers. Groups like Free Press say the opposite -- that such combinations reduce the country's journalistic corps and decrease the diversity of voices in print and on the air. Mr. Aaron said he sensed that most Americans were aware of big media brands like Fox and NBC but unaware that their owners also controlled dozens of other brands. Media companies present an obstacle to awareness: ''Most media outlets don't like to cover themselves.'' But ''when people find out just how much those companies own, they are worried about it and want to know more,'' he said, adding that the who-owns-what chart was the most popular feature on the Free Press Web site. This week, the F.C.C. declined to comment on the status of its ownership review, which is supposed to assess whether the existing rules are effectively promoting diversity, localism and competition. Earlier this month, an appeals court upheld most of the steps that the commission took in 2007 to loosen ownership rules, but it rejected on procedural grounds one rule that enabled more companies to own a newspaper and a station in the same local market. Cable outlets like Fox News -- the scourge of liberals and a symbol of Mr. Murdoch's political power -- are not under the purview of the F.C.C. or its ownership review, but the News Corporation's 27 local stations are, because each is dependent on a federal license for use of the public airwaves. License revocations are extremely rare, and analysts said they did not anticipate problems for the stations as a result of the hacking scandal. But an F.C.C. provision assessing the character of a station owner could be invoked by the News Corporation's opponents when the company's licenses for Fox and MyNetwork stations come up for renewal. The broader problem for Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Aaron suggested, is that he ''had an air of invincibility'' before the scandal became one of the most talked-about news stories in Britain and the United States. ''Whatever happens now, that's gone,'' he said. Andrew Jay Schwartzman of the public interest group Media Access Project, said he doubted that loyal viewers of Fox News, a News Corporation property, would change their views. But, he added, ''a much larger group of people have an instinctive mistrust of powerful media, and they understand that consolidation of media ownership is not good for democracy.'' ''For better or worse,'' Mr. Schwartzman said, ''News Corporation's misdeeds will fuel that skepticism.''  "
Sunday Dialogue: Lessons From the Tabloid Scandal,"Questions about media practices, bias and influence, both in Britain and the United States, arise from the Murdoch affair. Readers offer divergent views in response to a letter on Thursday. The Letter To the Editor: Re ''Murdochs Deny That They Knew of Illegal Acts'' (front page, July 20): Do British parliamentary inquiries into Rupert Murdoch's media empire offer any lessons for the United States? Perhaps, if they alert us to the power of a ''political-journalistic complex'' no less dangerous than the ''military-industrial complex'' that President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned about half a century ago. Have similar abuses been committed here, or do Fox News and others scrupulously observe the rule of law on this side of the pond?  Are elected officials too cozy with representatives of a news industry that is supposed to ''cover'' them? Which Congressional committees, headed by which party, are prepared to launch the appropriate investigations? RICHARD STEIN Eugene, Ore., July 20, 2011 The writer is a retired professor of English at the University of Oregon. Readers React Mr. Stein's letter tries to connect Fox News in the United States with the News Corporation scandal in Britain. This has been the hope of the left all along -- that the phone-hacking scandal will somehow snare Fox News and cause the demise of Rupert Murdoch's whole right-wing media empire. The real problem for Mr. Stein and the left is not ''political-journalistic complexes'' -- it's when those complexes are right-wing. Everything was fine when the left controlled the vast majority of the media. To be sure, it wasn't all under one owner, but it might as well have been since the political-journalistic bias was all the same. Now that the popularity of Fox News and talk radio has cut that percentage, there's a perceived problem. But don't worry, Mr. Stein. You've still got the television networks, NPR, PBS, MSNBC, CNN, The New York Times and most major newspapers, Hollywood, academia -- but I run out of space. MARK R. GODBURN North Canaan, Conn., July 21, 2011 Time will tell whether the hacking and payoffs were repeated on this side of the Atlantic. But as awful as these are, they pale by comparison to what Rupert Murdoch's Fox News has done to our democracy. By slanting and distorting the news and promoting, whether for influence or profit, a peculiar brand of rabble-rousing right-wing radicalism, Mr. Murdoch has misled many decent Americans into acting against their own interests, and those of the country. We see the consequences in the senseless attacks on programs like Medicare and Social Security, and the cynical refusal, at a time when so many are suffering, to repeal tax cuts for the rich. We see the consequences in our failure to act on global warming even as our nation suffers from freakish storms and drought. And most chillingly, we see the consequences in the attempt by one house of Congress to blackmail the country into adopting the extremist program of the Tea Party. One can only hope that here, as in Britain, evidence of wrongdoing will prove sufficient to break the bonds of fear and fealty that are the basis of Mr. Murdoch's influence on Republican politicians, and to reveal to the American public the cynicism of the man behind Fox News! JOSHUA P. HILL New London, Conn., July 21, 2011 The acts of The News of the World newspaper in Britain were undeniably despicable. But I find ironic the holier-than-thou news articles pretending that such invasions of privacy and news-at-any-cost intrusions by the media are limited to a few disreputable media that just happen to promote political views contrary to theirs. What about the plagiarism by certain reporters at other newspapers, including The New York Times? Or the media's encouragement of stealing state secrets by publishing the Pentagon Papers and the WikiLeaks documents? I find those acts just as despicable as those of The News of the World. The truth is that the media culture that promotes ''getting a story'' at any cost is widespread and certainly includes those self-styled respectable news sources as well as the late, unlamented News of the World. RON HOLDAWAY Thayne, Wyo., July 21, 2011 My immediate reaction to Mr. Stein's proposal that a Congressional committee investigate the news industry was a resounding ''No!'' I am sure I am not the only one who will cite the First Amendment as the reason for not wanting Congress poking its nose into the news industry. Personally, I do not believe that any Murdoch-owned news operation in the United States has engaged in unlawful journalistic behavior, and merely asking the question, as Mr. Stein did, does not in and of itself constitute cause. Let us all take a deep breath and pull back from the abyss. R. THOMAS BERNER Bellefonte, Pa., July 21, 2011 The writer is professor emeritus of journalism and American studies at Pennsylvania State University. What I have wondered since the Murdoch phone-hacking scandal became public is: What are the differences between a newspaper's eavesdropping on individuals and a government's eavesdropping on its own citizens? To me, the latter is more blameworthy and ominous. Yet it is what the Bush administration did under the banner of national security, with barely a peep of outrage. HERB COURSEN Brunswick, Me., July 21, 2011 Mr. Stein asks: ''Do British parliamentary inquiries into Rupert Murdoch's media empire offer any lessons for the United States?'' Here's one: Rather than our journalists simply taking dictation and our politicians using inquiries for publicity, they should emulate the way the British persistently pursue questioning, gathering details until the truth begins to emerge. Unfortunately, if we learn that the power of a ''political-journalistic complex'' is as dangerous as our current ''military-industrial complex,'' it will have the same effect on us as President Dwight D. Eisenhower's ignored warning -- none. JOHN CAPPELLETTI New York, July 21, 2011 I can't deny my pleasure at seeing Rupert Murdoch and his henchmen hoisted on their own petards. However, we should be placing the blame where it belongs. Just as drug dealers would have no business without drug users, the newspapers of the kind exemplified by The News of the World would not sell so many copies if people did not buy them. Giving the readers what they want is the underlying cause of these privacy abuses. Too many people love to read about the private lives of prominent people, the dirtier the tidbits, the better. As long as there are folks who enjoy the miseries or escapades of others, this kind of garbage will find buyers. JESSE SAMUELS West Hartford, Conn., July 21, 2011 To avert accusations of political bias, any Congressional committee appointed to scrutinize the whole of Rupert Murdoch's press stable in the United States (not just Fox News and his cable media) will need to have equal bipartisan representation. Committee members should have no current or past liaisons with the Murdoch press (whether acrimonious or favorable) that would compromise their judgment. It would probably be prudent to wait to see the outcome of the British parliamentary inquiry and police investigations. There have been loud calls for investigations into Mr. Murdoch's extensive press interests in Australia, and he has recently made forays into China, including Hong Kong. This could progress to a contagion across several continents that will prove difficult to contain. JOSEPH TING Brisbane, Australia, July 21, 2011 The liberal news media's assault against Rupert Murdoch, in Britain and the United States, is clearly politically motivated. Its primary goal is to damage the Fox News channel for the 2012 elections. DANIEL B. JEFFS Apple Valley, Calif., July 21, 2011 Rupert Murdoch and his son James deny prior knowledge of the phone hacking. Given the duration of time it occurred and amount of money spent, it is implausible to me that any business person, particularly one with Mr. Murdoch's acumen, wouldn't have known what was going on. Mr. Murdoch's claims of shock and surprise are about as believable as his claim that Fox News is ''fair and balanced.'' JOSHUA E. NEIMAN Baltimore, July 21, 2011 The Writer Responds What is apparent from reader responses is how passionate people are about the intersection of politics and the press. Rupert Murdoch's media empire is big news, on the left and on the right, for better and for worse. Is there cause for concern in the often-cozy relationships of media and politicians? I think so. What is at risk isn't simply the accuracy of press reports but also the motives of public officials. I asked whether any official body was likely to investigate this unholy alliance. The question was rhetorical. Such an inquiry is unlikely to take place in the current political climate. If it did, we would be wise to heed Mr. Berner's warning about protecting First Amendment press freedom. With the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United, government can no longer limit corporate spending in candidate elections. The door is open for news corporations to play an even stronger role in shaping political activity. The two-way street between public figures and the media can produce other casualties. Democracy depends on an informed electorate. When the self-interest of the press comes too close to that of the politicians we expect them to scrutinize, the possibility of useful, independent analysis grows dimmer. Mr. Godburn dismisses such concern and ironically congratulates the left for controlling the media. The actual state of affairs is more complicated. A recent Times article on the Murdoch scandal cited a 2004 book by Ben H. Bagdikian, ''The New Media Monopoly,'' which found that more than half of the radio and television stations, daily newspapers, magazines, publishers and movie studios in the United States were owned by five companies. In the end, the best alternative to media manipulation and behind-the-scenes collusion is an energetic, critical readership, prepared to hunt out facts in spite of public efforts at concealment. I'd second Mr. Samuels's suggestion that the blame must also fall on readers. I assume that would include viewers, listeners and all those who ''consume'' the worst elements of what passes for daily news and fix their attention on our supposed current stars. As someone else pointed out, the fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves. RICHARD STEIN Eugene, Ore., July 22, 2011  "
"Malware Aimed at Iran Hit Five Sites, Report Says","The Stuxnet software worm repeatedly sought to infect five industrial facilities in Iran over a 10-month period, a new report says, in what could be a clue into how it might have infected the Iranian uranium enrichment complex at Natanz. The report, released Friday by Symantec, a computer security software firm, said there were three waves of attacks. Liam O Murchu, a security researcher at the firm, said his team was able to chart the path of the infection because of an unusual feature of the malware: Stuxnet recorded information on the location and type of each computer it infected.  Such information would allow the authors of Stuxnet to determine if they had successfully reached their intended target. By taking samples of Stuxnet they had collected from various computers, the researchers were able to build a model of the spread of the infection. They determined that 12,000 infections could be traced back to just five initial infection points. Between June 2009 and May 2010, the program took aim at specific organizations in Iran on three occasions, Symantec research noted in an update of a research report the company published last year. The Symantec team said it had collected five Internet domains that were linked to industrial organizations within Iran. They said because of the company's privacy policies, they would not disclose the domain names. ''All of the domains are involved in industrial processing,'' Mr. O Murchu said in an interview. It is likely that a classified site like Natanz is not connected directly to the Internet. Therefore, an attacker might try to infect industrial organizations that would be likely to share information, and the malware, with Natanz. At least three and possibly four versions of the program were probably written, and the researchers discovered that the first version had been completed just 12 hours before the first successful infection in June 2009. The researchers speculated that the first step in the infection was either an infected e-mail sent to an intended victim or a hand-held USB device that carried the attack code. When international inspectors visited Natanz in late 2009, they found that almost 1,000 gas centrifuges had been taken offline, leading to speculation that the attack may have disabled part of the complex. In April 2010, the attackers again tried to distribute the program. This time they found a new vulnerability in Windows-based computers to be infected with a USB device and most likely successfully inserted the program that way at an unknown location inside Iran. The Symantec researchers also said they had determined that the malware program carried two different attack modules aimed at different centrifuge arrays, but that one of them had been disabled. Stuxnet first infected Windows-based industrial control computers while it hunted for particular types of equipment made by the Siemens Corporation. It was programmed to then damage a uranium centrifuge array by repeatedly speeding it up, while at the same time hiding its attack from the control computers by sending false information to displays that monitored the system. The New York Times reported in January that Israel had built an elaborate test facility at a classified nuclear weapons site that contained a replica array of the Iranian uranium enrichment plant. Such a test site would have been necessary for the design of the attack software. ''We know the exact configuration of the system they were looking for,'' Mr. O Murchu said. ''We know they were looking for a certain number of frequency converters. And each of those frequency converters controls a certain number of motors. And those numbers fit in with what you expect to see in an uranium enrichment facility.''  "
"There Is Data Theft, Sure, Just Rarely This Type","For years, advertisers have known that ''hitting the fear button,'' as they would put it, is a good way to drive sales. Judging by the number of pitches you see for products that claim to protect your data, it must still be true. The latest is from DIFRwear, a company that makes wallets for about $23 that are meant to block RFID signals given off by some credit cards, ID cards and passports.  RFID, which stands for radio-frequency identification, is a technology that lets a chip in a card use radio waves to communicate over a short distance -- inches, usually -- with a reader. One example, MasterCard's PayPass, lets shoppers make charges by passing a card in front of a terminal. You can see where alarmists go with this. They predict that criminals will obtain receivers that can pick up the signals, and will sit in Starbucks stores and collect credit card and identity data, with shopping sprees to follow. But there is a two-part problem with ramping up the threat level on RFID theft. First, it's uncertain how prevalent the theft is. ''I won't say infrequent, but it's not as frequent as people think it is,'' said Bill Conner, the chief executive of Entrust, which works with secure identity technology. So how often has it happened? The Identity Theft Resource Center, which tracks electronic thievery, said it had seen no reported cases of RFID identity or credit card theft. It also takes some pretty advanced technology to grab data from even a few feet away. Entrust had to build a suitcase-size receiver to do it. And if a thief really has a suitcase-size reader and is sitting two feet from a cash register, your wallet won't help you because you still have to take the card out of the wallet to use it. The point here is that before you pay for protective products, first make sure the threat is real and that the product works. Or to put it another way, don't buy polar-bear repellant for a trip to Miami. ROY FURCHGOTT  "
Companies Offer Free Versions Of Identity Theft Services; Bucks,"The recent spate of computer hacking and security breaches has heightened interest in credit and identity-theft monitoring services. Two companies, TrustedID and Debix, have started offering free versions of their surveillance systems. We here at Bucks typically advocate creating your own free monitoring system.  You can, for instance, periodically obtain your free credit reports from the big three credit bureaus (one from a different bureau every four months, through AnnualCreditReport.com) and check them for suspicious activity. Or, as Ron Lieber discussed in a recent column, you can use the ""security freeze"" option. But the idea of a service that is free and automatic piqued our interest. Debix and TrustedID claim to hunt down potential fraud by scanning online sites where fraudsters may be hawking your personal information.  (A hat-tip to Edgar Dworsky at ConsumerWorld for alerting us to the free services). Austin, Texas-based Debix is the provider of AllClearID, a service being offered by Sony to customers whose personal information was compromised in the breach of its PlayStation network. The Sony victims are getting service's  ""plus"" version, which the company offers through corporate clients and includes insurance to cover financial losses. But AllClear ID also offers a free version to the general public. It includes Internet surveillance, notification if suspicious activity is found and help with repairing your identity if information is stolen. To sign up, you enter your name, e-mail address and date of birth on its Web site. Bo Holland, Debix's chief executive, says he considers the most valuable feature of the free version to be the identity repair service. If someone successfully steals your identity - by obtaining personal information, like your Social Security number or date of birth -- and opens bank accounts or credit cards in your name, the damage can take great effort to repair. Most people don't know where to begin. ""We can do it in a matter of weeks,"" says Mr. Holland. The Internet surveillance, he says, is done electronically; software scans online information in chat rooms where identities are bought and sold. The system also can monitor ""peer to peer"" file sharing networks, he said, which often act as ""vacuums"" sucking up vulnerable personal  information from personal computers. To sign up, you enter your name, e-mail address and date of birth at AllClearID's Web site. The service doesn't ask you to enter credit card numbers, because the company's research shows consumers are often uncomfortable doing so, Mr. Holland said. But typically, he said, when identity information is found online, it is a collection of information like names, birth dates, e-mail addresses and Social Security numbers, which may also have credit card information attached. AllClearID could boost its match rate by requesting more specific information from customers, like credit card numbers, but opts not to, he said in a follow-up e-mail. ""We get pretty good results with our low data collection approach."" The free product from TrustedID, based in Redwood City, Calif., is called IDSafe. It  includes monitoring of the Internet and ""black market"" Web sites for up to three credit cards and your Social Security number, along with  e-mail notification of any suspicious activity.(The company's premium version costs $14.99 a month, or $125 a year, and includes extras like protection for multiple family members, telephone notification of potential problems and protection for financial losses.) Lyn Chitow Oakes, chief marketing officer for  TrustedID, says it also uses electronic systems to monitor the Internet for possible misuse of personal information and credit card numbers (you provide the numbers you want tracked when you register). In addition, she said, company representatives may gain invitation to private chat rooms, where stolen data is hawked, so they can monitor conversations as passive participants. ""The information is monitored and matched against the information the customer provides us,"" she said. If a flagged credit card or Social Security number is found, ""We alert the consumer immediately,"" initially by e-mail and, eventually, by phone if the consumer doesn't respond. IDSafe also provides a free credit score from TransUnion each year, but it isn't the actual FICO score that a lender would obtain if you applied for a loan. ""It gives you a pretty good idea of where your score would be,"" Ms. Chitow Oakes said. Do you subscribe to a credit or identity monitoring service? Has it alerted you to any problems?

"CRACK, CRUMBLE AND CRUNCH APRIL 3-9","THE NEWS Scores of older-model Boeing 737s, the world's most widely used jetliner, were pulled aside for special inspections after one tore open in flight and subsurface cracks were found in the fuselages of five more.  BEHIND THE NEWS Boeing said the problem -- tied to metal fatigue in the aluminum skin and the joints that support it -- was appearing much sooner in the planes' service life than expected, after only 40,000 takeoff-and-landing cycles instead of 60,000 or more. At least 175 of the planes will now have to be checked once every 500 flights until the cracking problem is better understood. THE NEWS Major banks and retailers, including Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Target, L.L. Bean and the College Board, warned customers to beware of swindles after hackers cracked the digital security of a marketing firm to steal the names and e-mail addresses of millions of the companies' customers. BEHIND THE NEWS Experts worry that the stolen data will be used for widespread ''spear phishing'' -- tricking people into revealing bank and credit card information by sending them what seem to be legitimate, personally addressed e-mails from a company they do business with. THE NEWS The embattled president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has seen his support start to crumble among tribal leaders and his own ruling elite, suffered his biggest defection so far when the United States switched from backing him to trying to ease him out of office. BEHIND THE NEWS With all of Mr. Saleh's and his government's attention focused on the struggle to cling to office, Washington's main interest in the country -- counterterrorism efforts -- has been set back, and the active local branch of Al Qaeda has been moving to exploit the turbulence. THE NEWS Highly radioactive water was found to be gushing directly into the Pacific Ocean through a large crack in a concrete pit at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan. BEHIND THE NEWS The leak, which was plugged on Wednesday, stemmed from Tokyo Electric's desperate effort to cool four of the plant's six reactors by pumping water into them, after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 knocked out their cooling systems. To free storage space for highly contaminated water from the reactors, the company intentionally released tons of lower-level radioactive runoff into the sea. THE NEWS Manny Ramirez, one of baseball's greatest hitters, retired rather than face a 100-day suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. BEHIND THE NEWS It was the third time that Ramirez, most recently of the Tampa Bay Rays, tested positive. The commissioner's office said it had notified Ramirez ''of an issue under Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.'' Known for his dreadlocks, baggy pants and often oblivious demeanor, Ramirez compiled a .312 batting average and had hit 555 home runs since 1993.  "
Hacking of White House Gmail Affected Diverse Departments,"WASHINGTON -- The computer phishing attack that Google says originated in China was directed, somewhat indiscriminately, at an unknown number of White House staff officials, setting off the Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry that began this week, according to several administration officials. It is unclear how many White House staff members -- or those of other departments in the executive branch -- might have been affected, according to two officials with knowledge of the investigation. But the intended victims ranged across various functions in the White House, and were not limited to those working on national security, economic policy or trade areas that would be of particular interest to the Chinese government.  Administration officials said they had no evidence any confidential information was breached, or even that many people fell for the attack by providing information that would allow a breach of their Gmail accounts. White House classified systems run on dedicated lines and information on those systems, the officials said, cannot be forwarded to Gmail accounts. But investigators were trying to determine if the attackers believed that some staff members or other officials used their personal e-mail accounts for confidential government communications. ''Right now,'' said one senior official, ''that's a theory, not a fact.'' Google disclosed the attack this week and said that it was directed at not only American government officials, but also human right activists, journalists and South Korea's government. Google tracked the attack to Jinan, China, which is the home to a Chinese military regional command center. But that does not necessarily mean the attackers were Chinese or related to the government. The Chinese government denied any involvement. The attack used e-mails that appeared to be tailored to their victims, the better to fool them, a technique known as spear phishing. Recipients were asked to click on a link to a phony Gmail login page that gave the hackers access to their personal accounts. The attacks come as the United States government considers expanding its use of Web-based software for e-mail, along with word processing, spreadsheets and other kinds of documents. Google is one of the many companies vying for the business with its Apps product, as is Microsoft. Web based e-mail would be vulnerable to hackers who steal login information through phishing attacks. But Web-based systems are not necessarily any easier to hack than traditional e-mail, which a government agency would usually manage using its own servers, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute, a computer security firm in Traverse City, Mich. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday that all White House-related electronic mail was supposed to be conducted on work e-mail accounts to comply with the Presidential Records Act, which governs how those communications are protected and archived. Mr. Carney said there was no evidence that any White House accounts were compromised. White House employees are permitted to have private e-mail accounts, he said, but cannot use them for work purposes. Officials at the White House and other agencies often keep two computers in their offices, one for unclassified work and another for classified. Senior officials sometimes have a ''secure facility'' in their homes, in which computers and telephones are on dedicated lines and communications are encrypted. Given its size, Google and its Gmail system will always make an attractive target. Other personal e-mail services, including Yahoo and Microsoft's Hotmail, have faced similar attacks, according to Trend Micro, a computer security company in Cupertino, Calif. ''The types of attacks that are happening against Web mail users aren't confined to Gmail alone and extend to other e-mail platforms,'' said Nart Villeneuve, a senior threat researcher for Trend Micro.

Guard That Password (and Make Sure It's Encrypted),"Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com FOR a pretty strong password, think 10. If your password contains 10 characters, you should be able to sleep well at night -- perhaps for 19.24 years. That's how long it would take hackers to try every combination of 10 characters, assuming that the password is encrypted and that the hackers have enough computing power to mount a 100-billion-guesses-a-second effort to break the encryption. But if your user names and passwords are sitting unencrypted on a server, you may not be able to sleep at all if you start contemplating the potential havoc ahead.  The hacker group LulzSec, for example, recently said it had gained access to Sony's servers, where it could get at names, home addresses and passwords for more than one million Sony customers: everything was stored in plain text form. It posted information for more than 37,000 user accounts. Sony Pictures issued a statement saying that ''we deeply regret and apologize for any inconvenience caused to consumers by this cybercrime.'' Hackers would love to get their hands on a complete collection of all of your passwords, like those held at LastPass, a cloud-based password management service. At the instruction of its customers, LastPass stores user names and passwords on its server as each Web site is visited, then fills in everything automatically on subsequent visits. LastPass reported last month that it had noticed some odd behavior in its network traffic logs and might have suffered an online break-in. I've been a customer of LastPass since last year and felt a twinge of concern upon hearing the news. But my nerves were calmed by the enthusiasm of independent security experts who view LastPass's security model to be exceptionally well designed. LastPass does not store actual passwords, only the encrypted forms. It does not hold the key to decrypting them -- only its users hold that. It doesn't even store the user's master LastPass password, the one used to gain access to all the others: this, too, is encrypted before it is sent to the cloud and arrives at LastPass. Steve Gibson, a security expert and chief executive of the Gibson Research Corporation, a publisher of utility programs for PCs, says he uses LastPass because its service adheres to his dictum that data ''should be encrypted before it goes up to the cloud and then decrypted when it returns.'' LastPass, based in Vienna, Va., is a relatively new service, having started in 2008. Joe Siegrist, its chief executive, says that from its inception the company built systems to withstand every kind of imaginable threat, including the possibility ''that its own employees cannot be trusted.'' LastPass does have a possible vulnerability that Mr. Siegrist makes no effort to shy away from: it depends on the user's selecting a strong master password, one not found in a dictionary in any language. If LastPass, or any company that stored passwords in encrypted form, were to suffer a data breach, the risk would be that the thieves could apply a brute-force attack at their leisure, offline, methodically trying every possible combination of characters until a match was found. With a physical safe and a combination lock, the thieves would need nearly infinite patience and a nearly infinite life expectancy to work their way through the possibilities. Computers, however, work at a different speed. Mr. Gibson posted a Web page that allows visitors to see how long it would take for a computer to try every possible combination of letters, numbers and special symbols to crack an encrypted password. Here's a little quiz: Which is the stronger password? ''PrXyc.N54'' or ''D0g!!!!!!!''? The first one, with nine characters, is a beaut. Mr. Gibson's page says that it would take a hacker 2.43 months to go through every nine-character combination offline, at the rate of a hundred billion guesses a second. The second one, however, is 10 characters. That one extra character makes it much, much stronger: it would take 19.24 years at the hundred-billion-guesses-a-second rate. (Security researchers have established the feasibility of achieving these speeds with fairly inexpensive hardware.) Don't worry about the apparent resemblance of ''D0g,'' with a zero in the middle, to the word in the dictionary. That doesn't matter, ''because the attacker is totally blind to the way your passwords look,'' Mr. Gibson writes on his Web site. ''The old expression 'Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades' applies here,'' he says. ''The only thing that an attacker can know is whether a password guess was an exact match or not.'' Mr. Gibson says that as long as the password is not on a list of commonly used passwords and is not found in a dictionary, the most important password factor is length. A SKEPTICAL voice comes from Paul C. Van Oorschot, a professor of computer science at Carleton University in Ottawa. ''I believe any system will fail,'' he contends. Consequently, he says, ''I don't use a password manager; I write my passwords down on paper, slightly obfuscated.'' Even this, however, does not give him enough comfort for some things: he does not have an online banking account because of his concern about hacking risk. An alternative response to that risk is to use strong passwords, gibberish characters adding up to at least 10 characters. Of course, it is absolutely imperative that Web sites store your password in encrypted form. Always, always, always. If Sony had built more secure systems, it would not find itself being mocked in the public square. A new Web site has popped up: HasSonyBeenHackedThisWeek.com.  "
Arrest Is Made in Hacking Of Celebrities' Private E-Mail,"LOS ANGELES -- A Florida man was arrested Wednesday and charged with breaking into and commandeering the e-mail accounts of at least 50 celebrities -- including the actresses Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and the pop singer Christina Aguilera -- to steal photographs, financial data and personal correspondence, the F.B.I. said.  The suspect, Christopher Chaney, 35, of Jacksonville, Fla., was named in a 26-count indictment, the culmination of an 11-month investigation. Officials said the trove of material he obtained -- in many cases by taking over the e-mail accounts of his targets so they would automatically forward incoming messages to his own account -- included several nude photographs of Ms. Johansson that surfaced on celebrity Web sites last month. Mr. Chaney, who was released on $10,000 bond, faces a minimum of two years, and a maximum of 121 years, in prison if convicted. Andre Birotte Jr., United States attorney for Los Angeles, said by all indications Mr. Chaney was acting alone and not doing the bidding of any of the celebrity Web sites or tabloids that thrive on such information, though he said the investigation was continuing. He said Mr. Chaney had not made significant amounts of money with his scheme. The arrest was announced with fanfare here by the authorities, who said they were using the draw of celebrities in what otherwise might be a routine case to alert the public to basic precautions of e-mail security. Mr. Chaney hacked his way in using public records and informed guesses, the authorities said. ''While there is certainly a celebrity aspect of this case -- and let's make no mistake about it, that's why I assume many of you are here today -- I want to emphasize that all computer users are vulnerable to the same kind of hacker attack,'' Mr. Birotte said. F.B.I. officials said Mr. Chaney used several aliases to gain access to the private accounts of the celebrities between Nov. 3, 2010, and Feb. 10. He used data that he stole to gain access to his targets' e-mails, officials said. He is accused of distributing some of the illegally obtained files and offering them to celebrity sites. ''Mr. Chaney was able to access nude photos of some of the celebrities, photos that were, unfortunately, uploaded onto the Internet,'' Mr. Birotte said. The photographs of Ms. Johansson, the star of films like ''Lost in Translation'' and ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona,'' caused a sensation when they surfaced, and she quickly denounced the invasion of her privacy. The hacking of cellphones to feed the celebrity tabloid culture has become a major issue in recent months, partly because of the controversy surrounding revelations of such hacking by the News Corporation's former London-based newspaper The News of the World. The newspaper, which was owned by Rupert Murdoch, was shuttered, and the scandal set off a parliamentary investigation in Britain.  "
U.S. Policy to Address Internet Freedom,"WASHINGTON -- Days after Facebook and Twitter added fuel to a revolt in Egypt, the Obama administration plans to announce a new policy on Internet freedom, designed to help people get around barriers in cyberspace while making it harder for autocratic governments to use the same technology to repress dissent. The State Department's policy, a year in the making, has been bogged down by fierce debates over which projects it should support, and even more basically, whether to view the Internet primarily as a weapon to topple repressive regimes or as a tool that autocrats can use to root out and crush dissent.  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will lay out the policy in a speech on Tuesday, acknowledged the Internet's dual role in an address a year ago, and administration officials said she would touch on that theme again, noting how social networks were used by both protesters and governments in the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and other Arab countries. The State Department plans to finance programs like circumvention services, which enable users to evade Internet firewalls, and training for human rights workers on how to secure their e-mail from surveillance or wipe incriminating data from cellphones if they are detained by the police. Though the policy has been on the drawing board for months, it has new urgency in light of the turmoil in the Arab world, because it will be part of a larger debate over how the United States weighs its alliances with entrenched leaders against the young people inspired by the events in Tunisia and Egypt. Administration officials say that the emphasis on a broad array of projects -- hotly disputed by some technology experts and human rights activists -- reflects their view that technology can be a force that leads to democratic change, but is not a ''magic bullet'' that brings down repressive regimes. ''People are so enamored of the technology,'' said Michael H. Posner, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor. ''People have a view that technology will make us free. No, people will make us free.'' Critics say the administration has dawdled for more than a year, holding back $30 million in Congressional financing that could have gone to circumvention technology, a proven method that allows Internet users to evade government firewalls by routing their traffic through proxy servers in other countries. Some of these services have received modest financing from the government, but their backers say they need much more to install networks capable of handling millions of users in China, Iran and other countries. A report by the Republican minority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to be released Tuesday, said the State Department's performance was so inadequate that the job of financing Internet freedom initiatives -- at least those related to China -- should be moved to another agency, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. ''Certainly, the State Department took an awfully long time to get this out,'' said Rebecca MacKinnon, a former CNN correspondent and expert on Internet freedom issues who is now a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. ''They got so besieged by the politics of what they should be funding.'' Still, Ms. MacKinnon said that she believed the State Department's deliberations had been thoughtful and the plan ''is going to be effective if it's couched within a broader set of policies.'' There are other contradictions in the State Department's agenda: it champions the free flow of information, except when it is in secret cables made public by WikiLeaks; it wants to help Chinese citizens circumvent their government's Internet firewall, but is leery of one of the most popular services for doing so, which is sponsored by Falun Gong, a religious group outlawed by Beijing as an evil cult. In the long months the government has wrestled with these issues, critics said, the Iranian government was able to keep censoring the Internet, helping it muffle the protests that followed its disputed presidential election in 2009. Mr. Posner, a longtime human rights advocate, acknowledges that the process has been long and occasionally messy. But he contends that over the past year, the administration has developed a coherent policy that takes account of the rapidly evolving role the Internet plays in closed societies. The State Department has received 68 proposals for nearly six times the $30 million in available funds. The department said it would take at least two months to evaluate proposals before handing out money. Among the kinds of things that excite officials are ''circuit riders,'' experts who tour Internet cafes in Myanmar teaching people how to set up secure e-mail accounts, and new ways of dealing with denial-of-service attacks. This does not satisfy critics, who say the lawmakers intended the $30 million to be used quickly -- and on circumvention. ''The department's failure to follow Congressional intent created the false impression among Iranian demonstrators that the regime had the power to disrupt access to Facebook and Twitter,'' said Michael J. Horowitz, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, who lobbies on behalf of the Global Internet Freedom Consortium, a circumvention service with ties to Falun Gong. Mr. Horowitz has organized demonstrations of the service for legislators, journalists and others. On Jan. 27, the day before the Egyptian government cut off access to the Internet, he said there were more than 7.8 million page views by Egyptians on UltraSurf, one of two consumer services under the umbrella of the Global Internet Freedom Consortium. That was a huge increase from only 76,000 on Jan. 22. The trouble, Mr. Horowitz said, is that UltraSurf and its sister service, Freegate, do not have enough capacity to handle sudden spikes in usage during political crises. That causes the speed to slow to a crawl, which discourages users. The companies need tens of millions of dollars to install an adequate network, he said. Under a previous government grant, the group received $1.5 million. But the experience in Egypt points up the limits of circumvention. By shutting down the entire Internet, the authorities were able to make such systems moot. Administration officials point out that circumvention is also of little value in countries like Russia, which does not block the Internet but dispatches the police to pursue bloggers, or in Myanmar, which has sophisticated ways to monitor e-mail accounts. Ron Deibert, the director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, said that governments had been shifting from blocking the Internet to hacking and disabling it. Even in the United States, he noted, the Senate is considering a bill that would allow the president to switch off the Internet in the event of a catastrophic cyberattack.  "
"Internet Censorship Growth Hampers News, Study Says","A detailed study of Internet censorship in China and Iran shows that blocking techniques are changing rapidly and are becoming significant new obstacles for news organizations, governments and businesses. The study, being published on Tuesday, focuses on Internet blocking faced by Iranian and Chinese visitors to BBC Web sites during periods of political unrest in the two countries over the last two years.  ''This problem of Internet control is becoming an issue for more than human rights concerns,'' said an author of the report, Ronald Deibert, the director of the Canada Center for Global Security Studies and the Citizen Lab, a University of Toronto organization that focuses on Internet security. ''The fact is that you have dozens of countries not just filtering for porn, but political filtering and key events as well.'' The study, by the BBC and Dr. Deibert's center, acknowledges that the Internet accounts for only about 13 percent of the broadcaster's global audience, which totaled 225 million people in 2010-11. But it is increasingly important in authoritarian countries; for example, there are now 500 million Chinese Internet users, many times the number that listen to shortwave broadcasts. The study documents the activities of firewall censorship during a variety of political events, including anniversaries of events like the Tiananmen Square protests. The activities of censoring authorities are not easily predictable and can change rapidly, the authors say, adding that broadcasters must be ready to engage in a ''cat and mouse'' game with censors by constantly monitoring government firewall systems and by clever use of alternatives like Twitter and other social media. Government censorship of broadcasters goes back at least to World War II, the report says. The Nazis enacted strict laws to prevent Germans from listening to foreign broadcasts, and radios were designed so they could not receive the broadcasts. During the cold war, the Soviets began an intensive radio-jamming campaign, and the United States responded with a ''ring plan'' -- vast deployments of strategically placed shortwave transmitters meant to overwhelm the jammers. The report, ''Casting a Wider Net: Lessons Learned in Delivering BBC Content on the Censored Internet,'' says the news media will need to form alliances to combat censorship efforts. ''Vietnam has been learning its blocking technology from China,'' said the lead author, Karl Kathuria, the BBC's senior operations manager. ''One of our recommendations is that broadcasters get together as well.'' To help make its service available through firewalls, BBC has collaborated with Psiphon, a software firm that is a spinoff of the University of Toronto computer security researchers. The firm supplies circumvention software to BBC and the Voice of America as well as other organizations. There are several ways to avoid firewall blocking systems. One of them, known as a Web proxy, routes requests for Web pages through an intermediate Internet address.  "
Making a PC That Is Abroad Look Like It Is in the U.S.,"Sept. 23, 5:05 p.m. | Updated   Now that Netflix has split into two companies -- one dedicated to streaming video and one dedicated to the distribution of DVDs and games -- it's gotten harder to take your streaming Netflix movies on the road, especially overseas. The key to accessing Netflix and many other online services  outside of the United States is to convince the Netflix servers that you're visiting their site from inside the United States. To do this, you need to use something called a , or VPN. Like business VPNs designed to protect e-mail and network connections for users with remote connections, the VPN you're going to use to watch Netflix wraps your data in encryption and, in essence, creates a tunnel between you and the Netflix server. When Netflix pings your computer, it sees that it is close by rather than thousands of miles away.  The simplest way to set up a VPN is to access a commercial service. I dug through the Internet to find a few potential choices:  ($4.99/month, first week free), and  ($5/month). A friend in China swears by  although I've found that free and ostensibly free services (those that put limits on your account) are usually a bit slower than the paid services. VPNs aren't just for streaming video. If you're more interested in anonymity while browsing, you can also try , a free, open-source VPN designed to help activists and members of the news media connect anonymously and safely. Once you have your VPN up and running, your computer will appear to exist inside the United States, thereby unlocking Netflix content. This is also useful for unblocking Facebook, Google, and Twitter in countries that censor Web content. Sure, it's gotten harder to slip a Netflix DVD in your laptop bag for viewing on the go, but by connecting to the streaming service via VPN -- for a few dollars more -- you get the best of both worlds plus a few added benefits. VPNs have gotten so easy to use that almost anyone with a Mac or PC can set one up in a few minutes, and having a VPN at the ready is better than getting stuck in a hotel room with nothing to watch while staring down a long night of jet lag.

Industry Coalition Hopes to Set Computer Networking Standards," MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Acknowledging that so-called cloud computing will blur the distinctions between computers and networks, about two dozen big information technology companies plan to announce on Tuesday a new standards-setting group for computer networking. The group, to be called the Open Networking Foundation, hopes to help standardize a set of technologies pioneered at Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley, and meant to make small and large networks programmable in much the same way that individual computers are.  The changes, if widely adopted, would have implications for global telecommunications networks and large corporate data centers, but also for small household networks. The benefits, proponents say, would be more flexible and secure networks that are less likely to suffer from congestion. Someday, they say, networks might even be less expensive to build and operate. The new approach could allow for setting up on-demand ''express lanes'' for voice and data traffic that is time-sensitive. Or it might let big telecommunications companies, like Verizon or AT&T, use software to combine several fiber optic backbones temporarily for particularly heavy information loads and then have them automatically separate when a data rush hour is over. For households, the new capabilities might let Internet service providers offer remote services like home security or energy control. The foundation's organizers also say the new technologies will offer ways to improve computer security and could possibly enhance individual privacy within the e-commerce and social networking markets. Those markets are the fastest-growing uses for computing and network resources. While the new capabilities could be crucial to network engineers, for business users and consumers the changes might be no more noticeable than advances in plumbing, heating and air-conditioning. Everything might work better, but most users would probably not know -- or care -- why or how. The members of the Open Networking Foundation will include Broadcom, Brocade, Ciena, Cisco, Citrix, Dell, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, Facebook, Force10, Google, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Juniper, Marvell, Microsoft, NEC, Netgear, NTT, Riverbed Technology, Verizon, VMWare and Yahoo. ''This answers a question that the entire industry has had, and that is how do you provide owners and operators of large networks with the flexibility of control that they want in a standardized fashion,'' said Nick McKeown, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Stanford, where his and colleagues' work forms part of the technical underpinnings, called OpenFlow. The effort is a departure from the traditional way the Internet works. As designed by military and academic experts in the 1960s, the Internet has been based on interconnected computers that send and receive packets of data, paying little heed to the content and making few distinctions among the various types of senders and receivers of information. The intelligence in the original Internet was meant to reside largely at the end points of the network -- the computers -- while the specialized routing computers were relatively dumb post offices of various size, mainly confined to reading addresses and transferring packets of data to adjacent systems. But these days, when cloud computing means a lot of the information is stored and processed on computers out on the network, there is growing need for more intelligent control systems to orchestrate the behavior of thousands of routing machines. It will make it possible, for example, for managers of large networks to program their network to prioritize certain types of data, perhaps to ensure quality of service or to add security to certain portions of a network. The designers argue that because OpenFlow should open up hardware and software systems that control the flow of Internet data packets, systems that have been closed and proprietary, it will cause a new round of innovation focused principally upon the vast computing systems known as cloud computers. ''This is a pragmatic solution,'' said David Farber, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon who was one of the pioneers of data networking technology. ''The idea of moving intelligence to the end points of the network was one of the original design points of the Internet,'' Mr. Farber said. But he noted that as the network evolved to offer sophisticated advanced services through centralized cloud computers, including the delivery of digital voice and video, it became less feasible to continue relying on decentralized network design. Mr. Farber noted that there have been other research projects aimed at redesigning the Internet. For example, the National Science Foundation, in addition to supporting the OpenFlow initiative, has financed the Global Environment for Network Innovations, or GENI. Open Flow appears to have generated broad industry support, he said, but it must still prove itself in the market. A number of networking companies, including Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Juniper, have already produced prototype systems that support OpenFlow technology. Morever, at least one Silicon Valley start-up, Nicira Networks, is now testing OpenFlow products that are meant to enter the cloud computing market later this year. ''If you look at really big companies like Google and Amazon, they take really smart programmers and give them a problem like search or automating storage and then turn the crank and out pops a great system,'' said Martin Casado, Nicira's chief technologist and one of the members of the OpenFlow research project at Stanford. But Mr. Casado noted that in the past the one part of the system that could not be programmed was the network. ''This customizes the network to the applications that are actually being run.''  "
Video of British Debate on Hacking Scandal,"As my colleagues Sarah Lyall and Alan Cowell report, during a debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed that there should be a public inquiry into the workings of the British newspapers, once a police investigation of the techniques of News of the World journalists concludes. Here, from Britain's Channel 4 News, is video of Mr. Cameron responding to a call for a public inquiry from Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party: Later, the debate turned to whether or not the scandal surrounding the use of voicemail-hacking by journalists working for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation should delay the government's decision on approving his company's takeover of BSkyB, a satellite television channel.  Here is video of remarks on that question by Chris Bryant, a member of the opposition Labour Party, in which he compared Mr. Murdoch, unfavorably, to Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and media baron: Mr. Bryant began by saying that several members of Parliament who have led the debate over the influence of Mr. Murdoch in Britain ""have had threats."" He then added: We have let one man have far too great a sway over our national life. At least Berlusconi lives in Italy, but Murdoch is not resident in this country. He does not pay tax here and has never appeared before a select committee of this House. No other country would allow one man to garner four national newspapers, the second-largest broadcaster, a monopoly on sports rights and first-view movies. America, the home of the aggressive entrepreneur doesn't allow it; we shouldn't. At another stage, another Labour member of Parliament, Tom Watson, suggested that Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of the British newspaper division of News Corporation, who was the editor of The News of the World in 2002 when it published an article based on a voice mail intercepted from the phone of a missing 13-year-old girl, must have known how her reporters were getting information.  Mr. Watson then referred to another serious allegation of wrongdoing by News of the World staff: the claim that investigators working for the newspaper when Ms. Brooks was the editor had interfered with a police officer's investigation of a murder, in order, it is claimed, to protect a private investigator who also worked for the paper. Mr. Watson said: I want to inform the House of further evidence that Rebekah Brooks knew about the unlawful tactics of News of the World as early as 2002, despite all her denials yesterday. Rebekah Brooks was present at a meeting with Scotland Yard when police officers pursuing a murder investigation provided her with evidence that her newspaper was interfering with the pursuit of justice...  The [officer, who] included Dick Fedorcio of the Metropolitan Police, told her that News of the World staff were guilty of interference and party to using unlawful means to attempt to discredit a police officer and his wife. She was told of actions by people she paid to expose and discredit David Cook and his wife Jacqui Hames, so that Mr. Cook would be prevented from completing an investigation into a murder. News International was paying people to interfere with police officers and were doing so on behalf of known criminals. We know now, that News International, Mr. Speaker, had entered the criminal underworld. Given this information, Mr. Watson said, Ms. Brooks, cannot deny that she was ""warned that under her auspices unlawful tactics were being used"" or ""that she was told by the police that her own paper was using unlawful tactics, in this case, to help one of her law-breaking investigators.""

Latest Updates on British Phone-Hacking Scandal,"On Wednesday, The Lede is following developments in the phone-hacking scandal in Britain.  4:29 P.M. | What Sky Means to Murdoch In this video report from Britain's Channel 4 News - which explains just how central the BSkyB satellite network is to the global ambitions of News Corporation - one analyst notes that the company's British newspapers, ""which have marginal economic value,"" might be less worth holding on to ""now that they have no political value."" Here is Michael Wolff, Rupert Murdoch's biographer, explaining to Jeremy Paxman of The BBC on Monday that some members of News Corporation have been agitating to discard the British newspapers for years: By the way, as if to illustrate that even as well-supported a public broadcaster as The BBC is not perfect, while Mr. Wolff was waiting to speak to Mr. Paxman on Monday, another BBC anchor mistook him for a baseball pundit: The Lede is signing off for the day, though we will return to cover the continuing fallout from the phone-hacking scandal on Thursday. For an overview of the day's events, read this report by my colleagues John Burns and Alan Cowell and watch this Guardian video report. Thanks for your comments and tips. 4:12 P.M. | News Corp. Has Considered Selling Its British Newspapers As John Cassidy notes in a New Yorker blog post on the reversals at News Corporation, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported that the company has considered selling off its three remaining British newspapers, The Sun, The Times of London and The Sunday Times. According to The Journal (which is also owned by News Corporation): Rupert Murdoch and his tight-knit group of advisers at News Corp. have put a variety of strategic options on the table as they attempt to stem the fallout from a scandal and map out a future for their businesses, according to people familiar with the situation. One idea contemplated in recent weeks is an option Mr. Murdoch has long shot down: selling his other British newspapers. News Corp. has informally explored whether there were any potential buyers for its U.K. newspaper unit, News International, according to people familiar with the matter.  Mr. Cassidy adds: Scotland Yard, meanwhile, will be continuing its investigation into allegations that journalists from the Murdoch newspapers bribed police officers to obtain information about celebrities, the royals, and others. Bribery is a serious charge which carries long prison sentences. Who authorized these payments? Who else knew about them? From 1995 to 2007, the head of News International was Les Hinton, a longtime Murdoch aide who is now chief executive of Dow Jones. As The Guardian reported on Sunday: ""Les Hinton, Rupert Murdoch's lifelong lieutenant and closest adviser, faces questions over whether he saw a 2007 internal News International report, which found evidence that phone hacking was more widespread than admitted by the company, before he testified to a parliamentary committee that the practice was limited to a single reporter."" 3:41 P.M. | Family Regrets Selling Wall Street Journal to Murdoch  Richard Tofel of ProPublica reports that ""A number of key members of the family which controlled The Wall Street Journal say they would not have agreed to sell the prestigious daily to Rupert Murdoch if they had been aware of News International's conduct in the phone-hacking scandal at the time of the deal."" Mr. Tofel's report, published by ProPublica and The Guardian on Wednesday, continues: ""If I had known what I know now, I would have pushed harder against"" the Murdoch bid, said Christopher Bancroft, a member of the family which controlled Dow Jones & Company, publishers of The Wall Street Journal. Bancroft said the breadth of allegations now on the public record ""would have been more problematic for me. I probably would have held out."" Bancroft had sole voting control of a trust that represented 13 percent of Dow Jones shares in 2007 and served on the Dow Jones Board. Lisa Steele, another family member on the Board, said that ""it would have been harder, if not impossible,"" to have accepted Murdoch's bid had the facts been known. ""It's complicated,"" Steele said, and ""there were so many factors"" in weighing a sale. But she said ""the ethics are clear to me - what's been revealed, from what I've read in the Journal, is terrible; it may even be criminal."" Elisabeth Goth, a Bancroft family member not on the Board who had long advocated change at Dow Jones, expressed similar sentiments. Asked if she would have favored a sale to Murdoch in 2007 knowing what she does today, she said, ""my answer is no.""  Mr. Tofel, a former assistant publisher of The Wall Street Journal, is the general manager of ProPublica, which is ""an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest."" Paul Steiger, ProPublica's editor-in-chief, is a former managing editor of The Wall Street Journal.  2:50 P.M. | Cameron and Miliband React to Dropped BSkyB Bid Here, from The Telegraph and ITN, is video of Prime Minister David Cameron welcoming News Corporation's decision to withdraw its bid to purchase 61 percent of BSkyB, the satellite television network, it does not already own: From the same source, here is the response of Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, ""a victory for people up and down this country who have been appalled by the revelations about phone hacking, who have thought it's beyond belief that Mr. Murdoch could, when this criminal investigation is going on, expand his stake in the British media."" 2:41 P.M. | Video of Brown's Commons Address Here, from Britain's Channel 4 News, is video of some of what Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, told the House of Commons on Wednesday: Given what we now know about how The Sun obtained details about the illness of Mr. Brown's infant son, Fraser, in 2006, one part of his address was particularly moving. Mr. Brown said that he was not speaking for himself but for many, many wholly innocent men, women and children who at their darkest hour, at the most vulnerable moment of their lives, with no one and nowhere to turn, found their properly private lives, their private losses, their private sorrows, treated as the public property of News International. Their private, innermost feelings and their private tears bought and sold by News International for commercial gain. 2:22 P.M. | Senators Call for U.S. Investigation of News Corp. Now that the debate has wrapped up in London - with a request by one member of Parliament to switch topics from phone hacking to the ""significant victory by four lengths"" of the House of Commons' rowing team over one from the House of Lords - we take a moment to note that a second U.S. senator has called for an American investigation of News Corporation.  On Wednesday, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, wrote to both the Attorney General and the the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, calling on them ""to investigate whether U.S.-based News Corp. violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).  Allegations have arisen that reporters employed by News Corp.'s News of the World newspaper bribed law enforcement officials, which may be a violation of the FCPA."" As Talking Points Memo reported, on Tuesday, Senator John D. Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, said in a statement: ""The reported hacking by News Corporation newspapers against a range of individuals - including children - is offensive and a serious breach of journalistic ethics."" He added: ""This raises serious questions about whether the company has broken U.S. law, and I encourage the appropriate agencies to investigate to ensure that Americans have not had their privacy violated."" Jake Bernstein of ProPublica explains: News International Limited, the British arm of the Murdoch empire, is a subsidiary of News Corp., a publicly traded American company which also owns the Wall Street Journal and Fox News (not to mention the Sunday Times of London, the Times of London, and the British tabloid the Sun). Because of this, experts say, News Corp. and all of its subsidiaries come under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a Watergate-era law which makes it a crime for U.S. companies to participate in bribery abroad.... After years of relative quiet, the United States has substantially stepped up the resources to prosecute companies for violating the bribery law. There are 150 open investigations of American companies, according to the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher. In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice combined for a total of just 12 FCPA enforcement actions. By 2010 that number had jumped to 54, the law firm reports. While some American news organizations have devoted considerable energy to tracking the phone-hacking scandal in great detail, the subject has been largely absent from at least one broadcaster's airwaves. On Wednesday, John Fugelsang, a comedian, advised his Twitter followers: ""If you need a break from all this news coverage of the Rupert Murdoch hacking scandals allow me to recommend Fox News."" On Wednesday, CNN reported that a Fox News program that discusses the media industry, Fox News Watch, has made no mention of the hacking scandal on the air. This CNN report includes part of a Web video from the Fox News Web site, which shows what the media program's panelists talk about during commercial breaks. The video appears to indicate that the media watchers did briefly joke about not discussing the scandal, in oblique terms. A discussion of Fox News is a reminder that Mr. Murdoch has found ways to thrive in the very different media environments of Britain and the United States.  In Britain, where television news is strictly regulated and there is a dominant, state-supported public broadcaster, The BBC, the news channel he has the most influence over, Sky News, is bound by law to be fairly objective. It may also be that since Britons can rely on the television news to be a decent source of news, newspapers are free to be adopt more partisan approaches or indulge in tabloid excesses. In the U.S., by contrast, the scrapping of the fairness doctrine for television, during Reagan-era deregulation, has created a situation where Mr. Murdoch's tabloid newspaper, The New York Post, is not nearly as popular as its cousins in the U.K. but Fox News is closer in spirit and approach to The Sun or The News of the World than to, say, The Times of London. At the same time, the effort by most major American newspapers to hew to principles of objectivity and balance in news reporting created a situation where more partisan print publications sprang up in recent years in the form of blogs. Thinking of U.S. cable news channels as the American equivalent of British tabloid newspapers also helps explain why Piers Morgan, a former editor of The News of the World and The Mirror in London, ended up not at an American newspaper but on CNN. 12:54 P.M. | Gordon Brown Speaks to Parliament on Hacking Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is now addressing the House of Commons on what he describes as ""the criminal-media nexus"" exposed by the phone-hacking scandal. Mr. Brown complained that the British newspaper division of News Corporation had engaged in a spate of ""new crimes with new names,"" like hacking and blagging. In impassioned remarks, Mr. Brown just said that because he refused to support proposals to weaken The BBC - as proposed in detail by James Murdoch in his MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh television festival in 2009 - ""the relationship between the Labour government I led was in all these years neither cosy not comfortable."" Mr. Brown said, ""I rejected these polices,"" because they were ""plainly not in the British people's interest."" As a result, Mr. Brown said, the company's newspapers ran stories suggesting that he was ""the murderer of soldiers killed by our enemies."" Mr. Brown also said that the Conservative Party's positions on media ownership, by contrast, were ""so close that it was often expressed in exactly the same words."" He also explained that he pressed for a public inquiry into the phone-hacking scandal when he was prime minister, but was opposed by civil servants. Despite loud and repeated objections from the Conservative benches as he spoke, Mr. Brown pressed on to call for a criminal inquiry into what he described as News International's connections to the criminal underworld. He referred, in particular, to allegations raised in the House of Commons last week by his ally Tom Watson, that during her tenure as editor of The News of the World, Rebekah Brooks - the current chief executive of News International - was warned by Scotland Yard that her newspaper was interfering with a police officer's investigation of a murder. Mr. Brown said that a News of the World editor responsible for having that officer followed was not disciplined but promoted. 12:30 P.M. | Draft Terms of Reference for Hacking Public Inquiry During the Commons debate, a member of Parliament just complained that he has no idea where he can find the draft terms of reference for the public inquiry the government has published. If the honorable member is following this live blog, he can find those terms here, on the prime minister's official Web site, Number10.gov.uk. 12:21 P.M. | 'This is a victory for Parliament' In his opening statement in the Commons debate on News Corporation, Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, called the decision by Rupert Murdoch's media company to abandon a $12 billion bid for outright control of BSkyB, a satellite television network, ""a victory for Parliament.""  Speaking for the government, George Young of the Conservative Party echoed that comment and said that the pressure piled on News Corporation by members of Parliament proves that the House of Commons has proven itself ""a champion of the people."" 12:08 P.M. | Live Video of Commons Debate on News Corporation The Commons debate on News Corporation has just begun with a statement from Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party. Readers can watch a live video stream from Westminster on The BBC's Democracy Live Web site. 12:05 P.M. | The Guardian Responds to Cameron on Coulson Warning One interesting aspect of the scandal at British newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is that the misconduct was exposed in large part by the reporting of another newspaper, The Guardian, which is owned by a public trust. It was the reporting of Nick Davies, a Guardian journalist, which first revealed in July 2009 that phone hacking was much more widespread than the initial police investigation suggested. The Guardian's editors have also revealed that they made an effort to warn David Cameron, before the election last year that made him prime minister, that Mr. Coulson had employed a private investigator with a criminal record during his time as editor of The News of the World. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron said that The Guardian's warning to his chief of staff had not been passed on to him. On The Guardian's politics live blog a short time ago, Andrew Sparrow wrote: ""David Cameron had a go at the Guardian today at PMQs."" He then posted this long response to Mr. Cameron's remarks from a Guardian News & Media spokesperson:     Before the last election the Guardian was unable for legal reasons to report the full details about a private investigator, on remand for murder, used by the News of the World under Andy Coulson's editorship.     The investigator - Jonathan Rees - had served a seven-year sentence for perverting the course of justice before being rehired by the News of the World when Coulson was editor in 2005. In 2008 he had been charged with conspiracy to murder Daniel Morgan, his former business partner, who was found in a pub car park with an axe in his head in 1987.     In February 2010 Andy Coulson was Director of Communications for the Conservative Party and there was much speculation that David Cameron would appoint him to the same role at Downing Street.     On 23 February 2010 the Guardian's Nick Davies emailed Coulson about an article he was intending to write about his paper's hiring of Rees, with full details of his criminal exploits and his involvement with corrupt police officers. The email also referred to two pieces the Guardian had run in 2002 exposing Rees's involvement with corrupt police. Coulson declined to comment.     On the evening of 24 February the Guardian ran a story publishing some details of the background to this story. Because of the contempt of court rules, the Guardian could not publish the full story. The paper was not able to name Mr Rees - it referred to ""Mr A'. It could not reveal why he had been sent to prison in 2000. It could not reveal that Rees was on remand for conspiracy to murder or even that details of his illegal activities involving the News of the World had previously been reported in the Guardian.     Up to this point David Cameron had protested that he believed Andy Coulson's claims that he knew nothing about the illegal behaviour of private investigators on his paper's behalf.     The Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, felt that it was important that David Cameron had this piece drawn to his attention and also that he knew about the additional, unreportable details. It was obviously not possible to approach Mr Cameron via Mr Coulson. On or around 24 February the Guardian's Deputy Editor, Ian Katz, telephoned Mr Cameron's senior adviser, Steve Hilton.     He drew attention to the piece. He told him:      The identity of ""Mr A""     That Jonathan Rees had been hired after a seven-year sentence for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by planting cocaine on an innocent woman     That he was on remand for conspiracy in an axe murder     That the full background to his corrupt dealings had been published in the Guardian 2002.     The significance was that it was inconceivable that Coulson could have been ignorant about the record and activities of the criminals they were using. Anyone reading what the Guardian had published in 2002 in conjunction with the ""Mr A' report in February 2010 would have had serious concerns about Coulson's fitness to be in Downing Street.     Hilton has confirmed this conversation. It is not contested that he passed the details to Ed Llewellyn, Cameron's head of staff.     No 10 maintains Mr Cameron did not even read the ""Mr A"" report of 24 February - although he now maintains that it contained ""the lion's share"" of the information about the Rees case. That suggests that even the publicly available disturbing allegations about his press aide were not brought to his attention.     As the election neared, the Guardian's editor also informed the Liberal Democrat Party leader, Nick Clegg, about the matters that were unreportable. This was in an email sent on 5 April. It has been reported that Clegg was ""stunned"" by what he had learned and that he cautioned Mr Cameron against appointing Coulson.     Rusbridger also passed on the information to Lord Ashdown. Lord Ashdown has confirmed that he sent a warning to Downing Street in May 2010.     Mr Cameron says the Guardian's editor did not raise the matter at two meetings on 30 March 2010 and 3 March 2011. The first meeting - to discuss the upcoming election - was with four Guardian executives and was after the warning had gone via Hilton. The second was after Coulson had left Downing Street and is thus irrelevant.     The prime minister has suggested that the Guardian did not raise any concerns about Coulson after deputy editor Ian Katz's conversation with No 10 director of strategy Steve Hilton in February 2010.     In fact Katz met No 10 chief of staff Ed Llewellyn at the Conservative Party conference on 4 October 2010 and had a further conversation about Coulson's involvement with hacking, as part of a wider conversation of the political scene. In particular they discussed the Rees case, details of which had still not been published because he was still awaiting trial for murder.     Alan Rusbridger said: ""The prime minister's account of why he failed to act on the information we passed his office in February 2010 is highly misleading. Any ordinary person hearing of the unpublishable facts about a convicted News of the World private investigator facing conspiracy to murder charges would have recognised the need to investigate the claims. "" 11:27 A.M. | Recorded Video of Prime Minister's Question Time Here, from The BBC's Democracy Live Web site, is recorded video of Wednesday's edition of Prime Minister's Question Time, which was largely devoted to questions about the widening phone-hacking scandal: As soon as the Commons debate on News Corporation gets underway, the same BBC Web site will stream live video from Westminster. 11:08 A.M. | Commons Debate on News Corp. Slightly Delayed The BBC reports that the Commons debate on News Corporation's recently abandoned bid for BSkyB might not begin until about one hour from now, after the conclusion of a debate on a proposal for fixed-term parliaments. According to Commons rules, the debate on News Corporation will have to end by 7 p.m. local time (2 p.m. here in New York). 10:55 A.M. | Lawyer Who Vetted Tabloid Stories Leaves News Corp. Although it was quickly buried in an avalanche of larger news developments, Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that Tom Crone, ""the legal manager at Rupert Murdoch's U.K. newspaper arm, which is fighting widespread hacking allegations, has left the company."" Reuters adds that Mr. Crone was a senior News International executive for 26 years, and had ""oversight of all editorial legal matters for The Sun and the News of the World newspapers."" He is also one of the company's executive who had ""previously appeared before parliament to answer questions on phone hacking."" A lawyer and a journalist who worked with Mr. Crone told Reuters that he was ""responsible for approving many of the front pages of the two tabloids."" Mr. Crone appeared before the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport on March 11, 2003, when the editors of The Sun and The News of the World at the time, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, were asked if they ever paid police officers for information. As this video - and transcript - shows, Ms. Brooks instantly replied, ""We have paid the police for information in the past,"" before Mr. Coulson cut in to add, ""We operate within the code and within the law and if there is a clear public interest then we will."" 10:35 A.M. | Report Gordon Brown Will Speak in Commons Debate As Andrew Sparrow notes on The Guardian's politics live blog, a Sky News reporter, Glen Oglaza, reports on Twitter that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is expected to speak during the upcoming debate on News Corporation in the House of Commons. 10:23 A.M. | Commons Committee Could Compel Brooks to Appear The BBC News live blog reports that Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of both The News of the World and The Sun who is now the chief executive of News Corporation's British newspaper division, has been confronted with an ultimatum by John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport. If Ms. Brooks does not reply within the next two hours to an invitation to appear before the committee next week, Mr. Whittingdale plans to issue a summons to compel her to attend a hearing next Tuesday. 10:08 A.M. | Commons Debate on News Corp. Still On Laura Kuenssberg, The BBC's chief political correspondent, reports that the opposition Labour Party ""intend to press ahead with the Commons debate on BSkyB although there is unlikely to be a vote at the end of it."" The debate was scheduled to consider a motion introduced by Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, calling on News Corporation to drop its bid for total control of the satellite television network. Given the political climate in Britain now, and the close links of Prime Minister David Cameron's former media director, Andy Coulson, to the phone hacking scandal, the opposition clearly wants to keep the issue front and center. Mr. Miliband told The BBC that the decision by News Corporation was ""a victory for people up and down this country who have been appalled by the phone hacking scandal."" Ms. Kuenssberg suggests that, in political terms, Mr. Miliband ""has made the most of this crisis,"" helping to assuage some doubts about his ability to lead Labour back to power. 9:42 A.M. | A Tactical Retreat? Emily Bell, a former editor of The Guardian's Web site, who is now director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia's journalism school, suggests on Twitter that News Corporation's decision to withdraw its bid for total control of BSkyB now does not mean that the company will not make another bid in the future, after the furor over the hacking scandal dies down. The BBC reports that Don Foster, a spokesman on culture for the Liberal Democrats, called the decision, ""amazing,"" but also suggested that regulators should now ask whether News Corporation is a ""fit and proper"" company to own nearly 40 percent of Britain's largest private broadcaster.  9:34 A.M. | News Corporation Statement on End of BSkyB Bid Here is the full text News Corporation's statement on the end of its $12 billion bid for total control of BSkyB, just posted on the Web site of the London Stock Exchange: NEWS CORPORATION WITHDRAWS PROPOSED OFFER FOR BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP PLC News Corporation (""News Corp"") announces that it no longer intends to make an offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC (""BSkyB"") not already owned by it. Chase Carey, Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer, News Corporation, commented: ""We believed that the proposed acquisition of BSkyB by News Corporation would benefit both companies but it has become clear that it is too difficult to progress in this climate. News Corporation remains a committed long-term shareholder in BSkyB. We are proud of the success it has achieved and our contribution to it.""  9:25 A.M. | News Corporation Withdraws Bid for BSkyB Sky News reports that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has decided to withdraw its $12 billion bid to purchase the 61 percent of BSkyB, a British satellite network, it does not yet own. Sky News, which is part of BSkyB, and so partly owned by News Corporation, calls the report an exclusive from its City of London editor, Mark Kleinman.  The Sky News report continues: The media group feels the situation has become ""too politicised"" for it to continue with its takeover offer, a senior source told Kleinman. ""I'm told News Corp intends to remain a long-term shareholder in BSkyB,"" Sky's City editor added. We will report more details as soon as we have them 9:16 A.M. | Video of Commons Debate on Phone Hacking  While there was some agreement between the major political parties on the pubic inquiry into phone hacking during Prime Minister's Question Time on Wednesday, David Cameron and the leader of the opposition, Labour's Ed Miliband, did clash over the question of why the prime minister had decided to bring Andy Coulson, the former editor of The News of the World, into government despite a warning from The Guardian that there was damaging information about his record that had not yet been published. Video of one part of that exchange, from Britain's Channel 4 News, begins with Mr. Cameron's statement that if Mr. Coulson lied about his knowledge of misconduct at The News of the World to Mr. Cameron and the police, his former media adviser could be jailed: 9:03 A.M. | Prime Minister's Questions Concludes Prime Minister David Cameron's weekly appearance before the House of Commons is now over. He is scheduled to meet soon with the family of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old murder victim whose voice mail account was hacked into and tampered with by The News of the World after she was abducted in 2002. Mr. Cameron is expected to return to Parliament to vote in favor of a motion calling on Rupert Murdoch to drop his $12 billion bid for total control of BSkyB, the British satellite network, at 11 a.m. ET (4 p.m. British Summer Time). The Lede will continue to update readers on news developments all day. 8:51 A.M. | Cameron Plans to Vote on Motion Against Murdoch Bid Laura Kuenssberg, The BBC's chief political correspondent, reports on Twitter that, after some earlier hedging, Prime Minister David Cameron's office now says that he will vote later on Wednesday when the House of Commons takes up a motion on News Corporation to withdraw its bid to take full control of the BSkyB satellite network. The motion, tabled by the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, reads: ""This House believes that it is in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to withdraw their bid for BSkyB."" 8:43 A.M. | Will Inquiry Be Able to Compel Murdoch's Testimony? Mr. Cameron is asked if the new public inquiry will be able to compel non-British citizens, like, for example, Rupert Murdoch, to give testimony under oath, unlike Commons select committees can ask but not compel foreigners to appear before them. The prime minister replies that this is a good question and he thinks that the inquiry will have that power. On Tuesday, the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport - which has oversight responsibility for the department that will make a decision on whether or not News Corporation will be allowed to purchase BSkyB - asked Mr. Murdoch and his son James to appear next week. It is unclear if they will agree to do so, but, as Americans, they could decide to skip the hearing. 8:37 A.M. | A Call to Impose British TV Standards on Newspapers Mr. Cameron is asked why British government regulation of television news, which imposes a requirement of balance and fairness, is not simply extended to newspapers. Mr. Cameron, who used to work in television - and pointed out today that the company he worked for was once fined heavily for getting something wrong - replies that broadcasters are regulated because they are granted a share of the public airwaves, while newspapers are not, but says that the judge who will lead the inquiry is free to make recommendations for a more robust system of regulation of newspaper journalism. Another question is whether government meetings with executives from social media companies, like Facebook, should also be recorded in the interest of transparency.  As Mr. Cameron explains it is up to the British television regulator, Ofcom, to decide if Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is ""fit and proper"" to own BSkyB, the satellite network. 8:27 A.M. | Text and Video of Cameron's Statement on Public Inquiry The full text of Prime Minister David Cameron's statement on the public inquiry, just posted on Number10.gov.uk, his office's official Web site. In his remarks, Mr. Cameron said: Last week in the House I set out our intention to establish an independent public inquiry into phone hacking and other illegal practices in the British press. We have looked carefully at what the nature of this inquiry should be. We want it to be one that is as robust as possible. One that can get to the truth fastest and get to work the quickest. And one that commands the full confidence of the public. Clearly there are two pieces of work to be done. First: a full investigation into wrongdoing in the press and the police, including the failure of the first police investigation. Second: a review of regulation of the press. We would like to get on with both these elements as quickly as possible, while being mindful of the ongoing criminal investigations the Inquiry into wrongdoing cannot take place, in full, until these criminal proceedings have concluded. So after listening carefully, we have decided the best way to proceed is with one inquiry in two parts. I can tell the House this Inquiry will be led by one of the most senior judges in the country, Judge Leveson who will report to both the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. He added: Starting as soon as possible, Judge Leveson, assisted by a panel of senior independent figures, with relevant expertise in media, broadcasting, regulation and government, will inquire into:  The culture, practices and ethics of the press. Their relationship with the police. The failure of the current system of regulation. The contacts made, and discussions had, between national newspapers and politicians. Why previous warnings about press misconduct were not heeded. And the issue of cross-media ownership. He will make recommendations for a new, more effective way of regulating the press. One that supports their freedom, plurality and independence from government but which also demands the highest ethical and professional standards. He will also make recommendations about the future conduct of relations between politicians and the press. This part of the Inquiry will report within twelve months. The second part of the inquiry will examine: The extent of unlawful or improper conduct at The News of the World and other newspapers. And the way in which management failures may have allowed this to happen. This part of the Inquiry will also look into the original police investigation and the issue of corrupt payments to police officers. And it will consider the implications for the relationships between newspapers and the police. Mr. Speaker, Judge Leveson has agreed our draft terms of reference. 8:18 A.M. | Lack of Restrictions on Foreign Ownership of U.K. Media One late question raises the point that Britain does not bar a foreign corporation from owning media companies in the U.K. Mr. Cameron points out that it was a Labour government that passed the law that allows Rupert Murdoch, an Australian-born U.S. citizen, to own British media companies. Last week, during a previous debate in the House of Commons, Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament, launched an impassioned attack on that law, and Mr. Murdoch, and pointed out that, in this regard, the United States has more restraints on the free market than Britain does. Here are some of Mr. Bryant's remarks during that debate in the Commons last week: We have let one man have far too great a sway over our national life. At least Berlusconi lives in Italy, but Murdoch is not resident in this country. He does not pay tax here and has never appeared before a select committee of this House. No other country would allow one man to garner four national newspapers, the second-largest broadcaster, a monopoly on sports rights and first-view movies. America, the home of the aggressive entrepreneur, doesn't allow it; we shouldn't. 8:07 A.M. | Regulation of Private Investigators Too? Chris Bryant, a member of Parliament for the opposition Labour Party who has pursued questions about phone hacking for years - in 2003 he prompted Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of The News of the World, to admit, ""We have paid the police for information in the past"" - suggests that some restraints on the work of private investigators should be part of the inquiry. Mr. Bryant mentions that he has been shown low-cost technology that makes eavesdropping on mobile phone calls very simple. 8:00 A.M. | Praise for New Police Investigation Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons select committee on home affairs, praises Sue Akers, the senior police officer in charge of the new investigation into phone hacking who appeared before his panel on Tuesday, and asks the prime minister to ensure that she will have all the necessary resources to pursue the case fully. Mr. Cameron says that the Metropolitan Police force is responsible for its own budget, but expresses confidence that Ms. Akers will be able to get to the bottom of the matter. 7:53 A.M. | On Press Regulation and Freedom John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport, points out that it was not only newspapers that were responsible for these breaches of law and ethics but also newspapers that exposed them. He asks Mr. Cameron to affirm that the inquiry will not lead to regulation of the press that will stifle its freedom.  Mr. Cameron replies that it is important to allow the press the freedom to make politicians' lives miserable. In response to an earlier question, Mr. Cameron also said that he does not want British newspapers to be regulated in the same way that British television is (television news is bound to be impartial under British law, while newspapers are not). There are ways of setting up regulation that is not run by the government but is till effective, Mr. Cameron says, and offers the regulation of the advertising industry as an example. 7:47 A.M. | Cameron Names Judge to Lead Public Inquiry During his statement explaining the terms of reference of the new public inquiry into the phone hacking scandal, Prime Minister David Cameron said that it would be led by a senior judge, Lord Justice Leveson. Mr. Cameron explains that there will be one public inquiry that will have two parts: it will be both a full investigation of wrongdoing by the press and the police - including a look at the failure of the initial police investigation on the phone hacking at The News of the World - and will look at the question of how newspapers can be regulated. Mr. Cameron also says in his statement that he will instruct his government to start make recordings of all conversations with media executives in the interest of transparency. Joe Murphy, the London Evening Standard's political editor, reports that, before he became a judge, Brian Levenson was ""the man who prosecuted Rose West,"" a notorious serial killer. He adds: Lord Justice Leveson will have the authority to call leading figures from Rupert Murdoch's News International empire as well as politicians and senior policemen. He was the barrister who led the case against West, Britain's most prolific woman serial killer, who was sentenced to life in 1995 for the murders of 10 women and girls including her 16-year-old daughter. 7:27 A.M. | Cameron Statement on Public Inquiry Coming Soon After Prime Minister's Questions ends, Mr. Cameron will make a statement explaining the terms of the new public inquiry into the phone hacking scandal - which were agreed to on Tuesday night by the leaders of all three major parties. Mr. Cameron refers to the inquiry in response to a question from a member of his own party, who asks if he will discuss the ""criminal conspiracy"" between the previous Labour government and Rupert Murdoch's media empire. Mr. Cameron says that the new inquiry ""will look at the relationship between politicians and media groups."" He adds, ""this inquiry will have the ability to call serving politicians and former prime ministers,"" to get to the bottom of the influence of newspapers on British political leaders. 7:21 A.M. | Question About 9/11 Hacking Report After some questions on other topics - including one that brings an aside from Mr. Cameron on the subject of lead being stolen from the roof of a church in his constituency - Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament who has pressed for an investigation of phone hacking by The News of the World for two years, asks Mr. Cameron if he will try to find out if the newspaper did, as a rival tabloid reported this week, try to obtain phone records to allow it to hack into the phones of victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Cameron said that the new police investigation should get to the bottom of that issue. 7:06 A.M. | Questions About Warning to Cameron on Coulson Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, presses the prime minister to explain why he hired Andy Coulson, the former editor on The News of the World, despite a warning given to his chief of staff from The Guardian that Mr. Coulson had hired a private investigator with a criminal record, casting doubt on his assurances that he had no knowledge of illegal activities at the tabloid during his tenure in charge. As Patrick Wintour explained last week in The Guardian: The Guardian disclosed that it had passed to a senior Cameron aide information about the News of the World's links to the detective, Jonathan Rees, which could not at the time be reported because Rees was awaiting trial for an axe murder. The trial later collapsed. Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, said the paper contacted all three party leaders before the 2010 election to make them aware of unpublished details surrounding the allegations of Coulson's involvement in illegal information gathering. During a telephone conversation in February 2010, Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz told Steve Hilton, No 10's director of strategy and one of the prime minister's closest advisers, that under Coulson's editorship the News of the World rehired Rees after he had served a seven-year sentence for conspiring to frame a woman for possession of cocaine. Hilton was told that Coulson could not have been unaware of Rees's track record of obtaining material illegally through corrupt police officers and other methods because they had been the subject of two prominent articles in the Guardian in 2002. These details could not be reported at the time because of the risk of prejudicing Rees's trial. Mr. Cameron replies that Mr. Coulson told him, and the police and Parliament, that he had no knowledge of illegal activities on his watch, so if he did lie he will be prosecuted. During the heated exchange that ensues, Mr. Miliband calls the decision to ""a catastrophic error of judgment."" Mr. Cameron then pivots to point out that the initial investigations took place under the previous Labour government. When he sits down, George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, slaps him on the back, as the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, who leads the Liberal Democratic Party, looks somewhat uncomfortable. 7:01 A.M. | Is News Corp. 'Fit and Proper' to Own BSkyB? The first question for Prime Minister David Cameron, from Duncan Hames, a Liberal Democrat member of Parliament, raises the question of whether News Corporation is ""fit and proper"" to own BSkyB, the British satellite network - invoking the language that would allow the government to reject the company's bid to take sole control of the broadcaster. Mr. Cameron replies that there is a ""firestorm"" around the company and would advise it to delay any mergers until the scandal surrounding its newspapers having hacked into voice mail accounts is cleared up. 6:59 A.M. | Live Video of Prime Minister's Questions British Prime Minister David Cameron is scheduled to start taking questions from members of the House of Commons soon, at 7 a.m. ET (12 p.m. in London). The BBC's Democracy Live Web site has streaming video from the British Parliament. The Lede will be offering updates once the event gets underway. According to The BBC's chief political correspondent Laura Kuenssberg, a debate on the motion to call on Rupert Murdoch to drop his bid for total control of BSkyB, the British satellite network, is scheduled for 11 a.m. (4 p.m. British Summer Time).   "
Rupert Murdoch Defends His Company and His Son,"In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, a newspaper he owns, Rupert Murdoch defended the way his son, James, has handled the the phone-hacking scandal and claimed that News Corporation has responded to the misconduct by its tabloid journalists ""extremely well."" Bruce Orwall of The Journal reported that Mr. Murdoch called the newspaper on Thursday, ""in response to inquiries about the status of his son, News Corp. Deputy Chief Operating Officer James Murdoch, who is also non-executive chairman of BSkyB. Some people familiar with the company have raised the idea that James was considering stepping down as chairman of BSkyB, in an attempt to distance the satellite provider further from the scandal."" Speaking to Mr. Orwall, Mr. Murdoch said that there was no change to his son's position in News Corporation. He also dismissed the idea that he that James Murdoch had been slow to deal with the phone-hacking scandal at The News of the World. ""I think he acted as fast as he could, the moment he could,"" Mr. Murdoch said.  Mr. Murdoch added that while News Corporation had made ""minor mistakes,"" the company had generally handled the crisis ""extremely well in every way possible.""  He also pledged to establish an independent committee, led by a ""distinguished non-employee,"" to ""investigate every charge of improper conduct,' and develop a ""protocol for behavior"" by reporters across his media company. Mr. Murdoch told Mr. Orwall that he had decided to appear before a parliamentary committee in London next week -- after his initial refusal prompted Parliament to issue a formal summons -- so that he could discuss ""some of the things that have been said in Parliament, some of which are total lies. We think it's important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public.... I felt that it's best just to be as transparent as possible.""   "
Confusion Over Parliament's Power to Compel Murdochs to Testify,"Updated | 5:47 p.m. As my colleagues Sarah Lyall and Alan Cowell report, Rupert Murdoch and his son James both reluctantly agreed to testify next week before a British parliamentary committee investigating phone hacking at newspapers owned by their News Corporation. The decision came after the two men initially refused an invitation to attend an oversight committee hearing, and Parliament then took the extraordinary step of issuing a summons to order them to appear. The episode served to illustrate the stark contrast between the way oversight committees work in the United States -- where legally binding subpoenas are routinely issued by Congress -- and in Britain, where the House of Commons relies almost entirely on the willingness of witnesses to accept invitations, to such an extent that it is no longer clear if Parliament actually has the legal power to compel appearances. In letters to the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport on Thursday morning, Rupert Murdoch wrote that he was ""not available"" to give evidence at a hearing next Tuesday, but is ""fully prepared to give evidence to the forthcoming judge-led public inquiry,"" while James Murdoch said that he would be glad to appear on another date next month. After he received the letters declining his invitation to attend next week's hearing, John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of the Commons select committee, said that he would try to compel them to do so. But Parliament's power to do so, given that both Murdochs are American citizens, appears to be limited and is the subject of some confusion, even to British lawmakers.  As The Guardian reports, Sir George Young, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Thursday: ""A range of sanctions are available to the House for contempt."" Addressing the Commons speaker, John Bercow, Mr. Young continued, ""One includes you, Mr. Speaker, admonishing somebody who appears at the bar, a responsibility I know you would discharge with aplomb. There are a range of other penalties including fines and imprisonment, but that has not been used for some time."" Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament who has pursued the phone hacking scandal vigorously, wrote on Twitter before the summons was issued: ""This thing about the Murdochs and their nationality is a red herring. I took advice. If in the U.K. we can compel them to attend committee."" (Now that the Murdochs have agreed to appear before the panel next week, they will have to answer questions from Mr. Watson, a member of the committee who has previously won a lawsuit against News Corporation's British newspaper division.) Also via Twitter, Chris Bryant -- a Labour member of Parliament who has been doggedly asking questions about misconduct by the tabloid press for nearly a decade -- wrote to one of his Conservative colleagues, Louise Mensch: ""I'm not sure that non U.K. citizens can't be summoned. They can be arrested by police for crimes or non-attendance in court."" As The BBC reports, Mr. Whittingdale did escalate the matter after the Murdochs wrote to say they were too busy to attend the hearing next week, by asking the serjeant-at-arms of the House of Commons to deliver a formal summons to the two News Corporation executives at the London headquarters of their British newspaper division in Wapping. The serjeant-at-arms, whose partly ceremonial role is defined on Parliament's Web site as ""keeping order within the Commons,"" is often seen carrying a mace and usually wears a traditional uniform and a sword. After the summons was issued, Paul Waugh, the editor of PoliticsHome.co.uk reported on Twitter that he was informed by a member of the parliamentary committee: ""Deputy Serjeant at Arms will not be wearing tights or a sword to serve summons on Murdoch."" Ms. Mensch, who sits on the parliamentary committee, reported on Twitter a short time later:  ""Summons served on Jeff Palker, General Counsel, News Corp. Signed receipt obtained."" Adding to the confusion is the fact that James Murdoch was born in London and is, according to The Financial Times, a dual citizen of the United States and Britain. Although the younger Mr. Murdoch speaks with an American accent, he does appear to consider himself British. When he addressed the Edinburgh television festival in 2009, he referred repeatedly to the threat posed to ""our society"" posed by state support for the BBC. At one stage in that lecture, he also said, ""Great journalism does not get enough credit in our society, but it holds the powerful to account and plays a vital part in a functioning democracy."" After it became clear that the summons might not be respected, Mr. Bryant, suggested on his Twitter feed that stronger measures should be taken. He wrote, ""House should consider emergency motion on Monday to arrest Murdochs if they continue to refuse to attend."" Mr. Bryant also discussed the issue with George Monbiot, a columnist, who observed on the social network: ""This is now a straightforward power struggle between Murdoch and Parliament. Democracy demands that Parliament wins."" To help clear up the confusion, it is worth consulting an official government report, revised last year, that explains in detail how Parliament's power to order nonmembers of the Commons to appear has lapsed over the years. (Thanks to Mr. Waugh, the PoliticsHome editor, for pointing to it.) According to the report, from the House of Commons Information Office, Parliament ""has various powers, albeit rarely used nowadays, to punish strangers (i.e. nonmembers) who offend it in some way."" The report adds, ""Contempt, in particular, has been viewed with differing degrees of severity over the years, and it is impossible to give guidance here as to how the House would react at any one time to an incident."" In a section on testimony to parliamentary committees, the report explains: If a Select Committee has issued a summons to a witness to attend, or produce papers, and the witness has not responded, it is for the House to act (or not) on the basis of a Report made to it by the committee. The House may order the Serjeant at Arms as Warrant Officer of the House to serve a Warrant on the witness. Formerly, the Serjeant would be sent with the Mace as the symbol of his authority, to order the attendance of witnesses. However, by the end of the seventeenth century, it had become accepted that the Mace was required to remain in place for the House to meet. Therefore, the device of the Speaker's Warrant was invented. In serving the Warrant, the Serjeant or his appointee may call on the full assistance of the civil authorities, including the police. The last use of the Warrant to summon witnesses was in January 1992 (when the Maxwell brothers were reluctant to attend the Social Security Select Committee inquiry into the operation of pension funds). As The Associated Press explained at the time, Kevin and Ian Maxwell -- whose father, Robert, was the rival press baron who bitterly opposed Rupert Murdoch's purchase of The News of the World in 1969 -- did eventually appear before that parliamentary committee ""but refused to answer questions about the disappearance of millions of dollars from Maxwell company pension funds.""  For some idea of how long it has been since Parliament had the same sort of power to compel witnesses to appear before it that the United States Congress routinely exercises, consider this part of the Commons report: If the witness is in attendance, he or she may be brought by the Serjeant at Arms to the Bar of the House and before the assembled Members, to be admonished by the Speaker. If not in attendance, the witness may be ordered into the custody of the Serjeant, by use of the Warrant, to be brought to the Bar at a date and time specified by the House. The last stranger (non-Member) to be brought before the Bar and admonished by the Speaker was John Junor on 24 January 1957, for an article published in the Sunday Express casting doubt on the honour and integrity of Members. Junor apologised and no further action was taken. The fact that it was a reporter who was last compelled to appear on the floor of the House of Commons (the ""Bar of the House"" refers to a white line across the floor of the Commons chamber) underscores that Parliament's desire to rein in the press is not new. Another section of the Commons report explains that the power to fine or imprison witnesses who fail to appear has also fallen into disuse over the centuries: The last fine imposed on an offender by the House was on 6 February 1666. Thomas White was fined 1000 (114,000 today): White absconded after being ordered into the custody of the Serjeant at Arms, for causing Henry Chowne, the Member for Horsham, to be arrested and prevented from attending Parliament. The power to fine was denied in 1762 by Lord Mansfield in R v Pitt and R v Mead (3 Burr 1335) and the House has not sought to revive the claim to fine since.... The last imprisonment by the Commons of a non-Member was of Charles Grissell in 1880 (breach of privilege in connection with the Committee on the Tower High Level Bridge [Metropolis] Bill). The House no longer retains it right to imprison. Instead the House uses a division of the Metropolitan Police based on the Parliamentary Estate to detain and, if necessary, arrest individuals. In the lower third of the Clock Tower, is a room in which unruly Members were confined when committed to the custody of the Serjeant at Arms. Technically, a Member so committed could be detained for the remainder of the Parliamentary Session but one day was the general rule. The last Member committed was Charles Bradlaugh (Northampton), who spent the night of 23 June 1880 in the room.   "
Complete Text of Rupert Murdoch's Apology,"Updated | 1:44 p.m. Since, remarkably, Rupert Murdoch's personal letter of apology for the phone hacking scandal will run in its pages as a full-page ad on Saturday, The Guardian has obtained the complete text and posted it online. Rupert Murdoch 'sorry' ad The letter, which is signed by Mr. Murdoch, will be published in all of Britain's national newspapers this weekend. It reads: We are sorry. The News of the World was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself. We are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred. We are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected. We regret not acting faster to sort things out. I realise that simply apologising is not enough. Our business was founded on the idea that a free and open press should be a positive force in society. We need to live up to this.  In the coming days, as we take further concrete steps to resolve these issues and make amends for the damage they have caused, you will hear more from us.  Sincerely, Rupert Murdoch Later on Friday, Mr. Murdoch met with the family of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in 2002, to apologize for the conduct of journalists at his newspaper, The News of the World, who broke into the girl's voice mail account during the frantic search for her. This Sky News report includes remarks to the media from Mr. Murdoch and the family's lawyer after the meeting: The fact that Mr. Murdoch's letter of apology will appear in The Guardian is striking, since it was that newspaper's July 8, 2009, report which first suggested that phone hacking had been far more widespread at The News of the World than an initial police investigation had revealed.  As a Guardian interactive timeline explaining how the scandal unfolded reminds us, two days after The Guardian reported that the misconduct by News of the World journalists was apparently not limited to the actions of a single reporter, Clive Goodman, Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper division, News International, issued a statement dismissing those allegations. The full text of that statement remains on the News Corporation Web site. It began with the assertion that ""News International has completed a thorough investigation into the various allegations made since the Guardian story broke on Wednesday."" After a discussion of the illegal phone-hacking carried out by Mr. Goodman -- the tabloid's former royal correspondent who was jailed, along with a private investigator, for breaking into the voice mail accounts of members of the British royal family -- the statement moved on to this detailed list of denials, most of which now ring hollow in light of the revelations of the past weeks: From our own investigation, but more importantly that of the police, we can state with confidence that, apart from the matters referred to above, there is not and never has been evidence to support allegations that:   News of the World journalists have accessed the voicemails of any individual.   News of the World or its journalists have instructed private investigators or other third parties to access the voicemails of any individuals.   There was systemic corporate illegality by News International to suppress evidence. It goes without saying that had the police uncovered such evidence, charges would have been brought against other News of the World personnel. Not only have there been no such charges, but the police have not considered it necessary to arrest or question any other member of News of the World staff. Based on the above, we can state categorically in relation to the following allegations which have been made primarily by the Guardian and widely reported as fact by Sky News, BBC, ITN and others this week:   It is untrue that officers found evidence of News Group staff, either themselves or using private investigators, hacking into ""thousands"" of mobile phones.   It is untrue that apart from Goodman, officers found evidence that other members of News Group staff hacked into mobile phones or accessed individuals' voicemails.   It is untrue that there is evidence that News Group reporters, or indeed anyone, hacked into the telephone voicemails of John Prescott.   It is untrue that ""Murdoch journalists"" used private investigators to illegally hack into the mobile phone messages of numerous public figures to gain unlawful access to confidential personal data, including: tax records, social security files, bank statements and itemised phone bills.   It is untrue that News Group reporters have hacked into telephone voicemail services of various footballers, politicians and celebrities named in reports this week.   It is untrue that News of the World executives knowingly sanctioned payment for illegal phone intercepts. All of these irresponsible and unsubstantiated allegations against News of the World and other News International titles and its journalists are false. The Guardian has been selective and misleading in its coverage of the report and investigation by the Information Commissioner.    "
Day of Reckoning,"Never apologize. Never back down. Never lose. That's the sort of advice that has long nurtured the super-powerful type-A humans who run the world's armies and empires. But after nearly two weeks of an unfolding scandal that has set Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation reeling - revelations of reporters hacking the phones of murder and terrorism victims, their families and even British law enforcement and government - such tough-minded philosophies appear to have faded into the distance. Both Murdoch and his son James are to appear before Parliament next week. And in the United States, the F.B.I. is set to open an inquiry into whether News Corporation journalists sought to gain access to the phone records of victims of the 9/11 attacks.Friday was a day of reckoning: Rebekah Brooks, a favored member of Murdoch's empire and chief executive of News International, who ran the British tabloid News of the World, resigned. Brooks issued a statement. Here's the apology part: ""As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place."" And here's the backdown: ""Therefore I have given Rupert and James Murdoch my resignation. While it has been a subject of discussion, this time my resignation has been accepted."" Later on Friday, another blow. Les Hinton, the chief executive of Dow Jones & Co., and Murdoch's longtime confidant, also resigned. Murdoch's statement read: ""You will have just heard that I, with the heaviest of hearts, have accepted the resignation of Les Hinton. It is a measure of his integrity and the quality of his character that he felt compelled to take responsibility even though he is far from the serious issues in London."" Hinton was the head of News Corporation's News International unit at the time the phone-hacking was to have taken place.  The boss himself did his own apologizing: but not before an interview on Thursday with The Wall Street Journal, a paper he owns, in which he defended the handling of the crisis and seemed to minimize the British paper's wrongdoing. But on Friday Murdoch apologized in person to the family of a 13-year-old murder victim, whose phone messages were hacked by News of the World staff. A broader gesture is planned for the weekend, when Murdoch will publish a full-page apology to all targets of his staff's actions in all national papers in Britain, under the headline ""We Are Sorry"" in order to leave no doubt. It would be interesting to be able to say that opinion in the blogosphere was divided, but it wasn't. Those who weren't breathlessly reporting news developments, it seemed, were taking News Corporation to task. But some some were looking ahead to what might be next. Over at Forbes, Peter Cohan asked the heretofore unthinkable question, ""Time To Rid News Corp. of the Murdochs?"" News Corp. is a publicly-traded family company. It hosts  family members related by blood and by decades of loyalty. Those bonds  have been forged by fighting battles in which an outsider tries to scale  mountains tightly-guarded by elites. ...  It is possible that News Corp.'s unsavory tactics are limited to its  UK operations and were done by rogue operators. But the reality is that  when a family controls 40% of the shares of  a publicly-traded company and the head of that family runs the company,  nothing of significance will happen there without the knowledge of that  capo - or his trusted lieutenants. Over the last decade, News Corp's stock has been in the doldrums.  It's lost 15% of its value since July 14, 2001 while the Dow Jones  Industrial average has gained 21% ... If you are a shareholder, it's hard to find a reason to celebrate Murdoch's control over this company. Nor is it comforting to realize that News International, whose chair is James Murdoch, could be indicted for bribing U.K. officials. Nor can it be reassuring to read that Rupert Murdoch believes that the hacking matter had been handled ""extremely well in every way possible."" Cohan's Forbes colleague Robert Lenzner describes a possible quick fix for this problem (if you are Murdoch). Take the whole operation private, via a repurchase plan the company announced earlier this week. ""[T]his $5 billion share repurchase would give the insiders over 50 percent of the vote in running the empire,"" Lenzner wrote. ""This strategy makes sense because Murdoch has clearly never had as his top priority creating value for other shareholders. Far from it. His priority has been the aggrandizement of media power the past 11 years, especially by vastly overpaying for the Wall Street Journal. A massive write-off of over $2 billion was the result. Never you mind; Murdoch controlled the Wall Street Journal."" At Slate Jack Shafer made his prediction on who would be next to fall: Murdoch's son James, the chairman of News Corporation's Europe and Asia divisions:  As the Telegraph reported this week, as long as Brooks stayed on the payroll, she shielded James from some of the more vociferous attacks. She, after all, was News of the World editor when Dowler's phone was hacked. But Brooks' resignation exposes James Murdoch to the fury now, which he can't possible endure. Rupert knows this, and knows that he must soon sacrifice his favorite son. Murdoch's predicament illustrates why no parent should have only one offspring-a backup unit must be kept at all times in case something dreadful happens to the child you're depending on. It's Murdoch's good luck that he has two children who can replace James while he does his time in Siberia. Both Elisabeth, a media tycoon in her own right, and Lachlan, the eldest son and previous heir apparent, could take James' place in the News Corp. hierarchy. Neither carries any phone-hacking scandal taint, and both are ambitious. ... Would Murdoch really sack his son? I don't see why we should rule out infanticide in this case. With sympathy for Murdoch in short supply, Robert Niles at the Online Journalism Review explains why he is rooting for News Corporation to fail. Size and power become symbiotic, especially when an organization (or a bank account) grows beyond a certain tipping point. News Corp. long ago past that point, in both Britain and the United States. News Corp.'s ability to command fear and favor from elected officials stripped its leadership and employees of fear of consequence for breaking the law. So, it appears in Britain and possibly in the United States, they did. If someone's not afraid of breaking the law, do you really believe that the ethics of responsible journalism and truthful news reporting are going to bind such people, either? Of course not. Anyone who dismisses the law for power will dismiss the truth to preserve their power, too. Our loyalties as journalists ought to be to the truth first, our communities next and our industry after that. I know colleagues who have said that they feel a reflexive obligation to defend fellow journalists when they are attacked. The managers and employees of News Corp. do not deserve that support. To defend News Corp. now, after all this, is to deny our higher obligations to community and to truth. Murdoch did find some support in this columnby The Times's Roger Cohen, and Jonathan S. Tobin at Commentary joined that small crowd. As Cohen rightly points out, Rupert Murdoch was the best thing that ever happened to British newspapers and has been a positive force in the American media as well.  Rupert Murdoch was not the first press baron in Britain with political influence. Such figures have been key players in British history for more than a century. The idea that shaming Murdoch or depriving him of the right to own a network will fix this supposed problem is absurd. Moreover, although Murdoch is by no means a doctrinaire conservative, we all know that were he a liberal, few of the pundits who want his head would think cutting back his holdings should be an international priority. Murdoch is the quintessential anti-establishment figure, a visionary risk taker whose goal has been to create markets not merely to make money (though he certainly has made a great deal of it). Though liberals despise his Fox News Channel, he rightly understood that the liberal monopoly of the mainstream media left a vacuum on the right that the public demanded be filled with content. Like Cohen, I'd bet on Murdoch not only to survive this crisis but to sooner or later come out far ahead. Now that would be news.   "
Media Response to the Arrest of Rebekah Brooks,"News of Sunday's arrest of Rebekah Brooks, the former chief of Rupert Murdoch's media operations in Britain, was greeted with a mix of righteous indignation that she had clung to power for so long, barely concealed glee by some of Mr. Murdoch's rivals and conspicuous understatement in at least one of the tabloid newspapers that Ms. Brooks once edited. Ms. Brooks, 43, a former secretary who scaled the heights of the male-dominated world of the British tabloids, resigned on Friday as chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. Her arrest is the latest twist in an escalating scandal that has convulsed the Murdoch empire since an inquiry began into accusations over phone hacking and payments to the police. The blogosphere was awash with taunts on Sunday for Ms. Brooks, who once edited The News of the World, a News International tabloid that has been accused of hacking into the phones of celebrities, politicians and others, including a 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, who was abducted and murdered. The paper was Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid until it closed last week. ""Rebekah Brooks will be allowed one phone call after her arrest. By rights, we should all be able to listen in on it,"" Toby Hadoke, a British comedian, . Some questioned whether the arrest, just two days before Ms. Brooks was scheduled to appear before a parliamentary committee with Mr. Murdoch and his son James, was little more than a pretext to avoid being eviscerated in public. ""Is this just another ploy to make sure Rebekah Brooks can't answer questions at select committee on Tuesday on grounds of self incrimination?"" a young womanwho calls herself Oxfordgirl asked on Twitter. The contention that the arrest could prove her salvation was also suggested by several bloggers who said the move could provide cover for both Ms. Brooks and the police, who are increasingly under scrutiny for abetting News International's attempt to cover up possible wrongdoing. Others appeared intent on ridiculing Ms. Brooks with the same venom that her staple of tabloids had once heaped on  countless politicians and celebrities. ""Always takes my brain a second to realize I'm looking at a picture of Rebekah Brooks and not some lesser-known faculty member at Hogwarts,"" the television writer and producer Danny Zuker said in a Twitter message, alluding to the school where Harry Potter studies magic. For all the baying by a voracious media, however, news of Ms. Brooks's arrest appeared to be conspicuously underplayed in some of the newspapers in the Murdoch empire, including the popular tabloid The Sun, which Ms. Brooks also once edited. On Sunday the paper seemed far more preoccupied with the birth a week ago of the soccer star David Beckham's daughter, Harper Seven, a picture of whom was splashed on its homepage.  (Coincidentally, the British media reported over the weekend that Mr. Beckham was said to believe that he was the target of phone hackers and that he had instructed his lawyers to find out if he was on the list of the 4,000 possible victims.) The Sun, famous for its scantily clad Page Three girls, did carry news of the arrest in a 243-word article by an unnamed staff member, who reported that Ms. Brooks had been arrested ""by appointment"" at a London police station. The conservative Daily Telegraph, for its part,  emphasized that Ms. Brooks had been surprised by the arrest, even though the meeting had been arranged. Other newspapers were far less forgiving of Ms. Brooks, whose audaciousness is legendary in British newspaper circles. In 1994, she famously prepared for The News of the World's interview with James Hewitt, a paramour of Princess Diana, by reserving a hotel suite and hiring a team to ""kit it out with secret tape devices in various flowerpots and cupboards,"" according to Piers Morgan, her former boss and now a CNN talk show host, writing in his memoir ""The Insider."" In the Sunday issue of The Observer, which has played a leading role in exposing the scandal, the columnist Andrew Rawnsley wrote that Mr. Murdoch had been humiliated by the revelations about phone hacking while Ms. Brooks fell - ""or was thrust - on to the spike.""  Mr. Rawnsley said the biggest political winner in the affair was the previously struggling opposition leader, Ed Miliband of the Labour Party, who, he noted, had led the charge against the Murdoch empire and in so doing had transformed himself into a ""geek with teeth."" The Daily Mail, a British tabloid that competes with the Murdoch newspapers, said Sunday that Ms. Brooks's arrest would intensify pressure on Mr. Murdoch's company while potentially putting ""James Murdoch, the son of the 82-year-old media tycoon, back at the heart of the inquiry."" ""Today it was claimed that he had been involved in covering up the 'industrial scale' of the phone hacking,"" the paper said. Others, like the journalist Michael Wolff, tweeted about the close ties between James Murdoch and Ms. Brooks, suggesting that the younger Mr. Murdoch may have a difficult time insulating himself from the scandal. ""In 2008, during a two-hour interview I did with Rebekah Brooks, she took seven phone calls from James Murdoch - that's how often they spoke,"" Mr. Wolff said in Twitter messages posted in the hours after Ms. Brooks's arrest. In another tweet, he added, with more than a hint of schadenfreude, ""Here's a detail from inside the Murdoch entourage: They are having trouble getting London restaurant reservations."" The call for Mr. Murdoch's company to be called to account for its unsavory behavior resounded in the British media. The Guardian ran an editorial over the weekend that suggested questions that Ms. Brooks should be asked by the select committee in Parliament on Tuesday. The first, the paper insisted, should be: ""As editor of the Sun and NoW, did you honestly not know about phone hacking, when so many of your reporters and executives say it was openly discussed in the newsroom?""  The paper also said that members of Parliament should ask her if she was remaining on the News International payroll. Some bloggers and commentators said Sunday that the arrest of Ms. Brooks, whom Mr. Murdoch has compared to a daughter, would satisfy at least some of the public's demand for justice, while perhaps helping the News Corporation manage a public relations debacle that has shaken it to its core. In its report on the arrest, The Wall Street Journal, which is also owned by the News Corporation, emphasized that Ms. Brooks's resignation last week was part of a broader attempt by the company to minimize the fallout from the phone-hacking affair. The paper wrote that people close to the company had said on Friday that her resignation was not tied to any anticipated developments in the police investigation. ""Instead, the company portrayed it as part of a broader damage-control campaign that it rolled out Friday and that also included the resignation of Dow Jones Chief Executive Les Hinton and several apologies from Rupert Murdoch.""   "
Scotland Yard Chief's Resignation Statement,"As my colleagues Alan Cowell and Ravi Somaiya report, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service, Sir Paul Stephenson, resigned his post on Sunday, ""as damage from a phone-hacking scandal moved to the highest levels of British public life."" Video of the commissioner reading his complete statement of resignation was posted online by The BBC. The the full text of the statement can be read on the Web site of the Metropolitan Police Service, commonly known as Scotland Yard. Near the start of his statement, Sir Paul said: ""I have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met's links with News International at a senior level and in particular in relation to Mr. Neil Wallis who as you know was arrested in connection with Operation Weeting last week."" Sir Paul has been under fire for accusations that he had compromised the investigation of phone hacking by his closeness to Mr. Wallis, a former News of the World deputy editor, who was hired as a public relations adviser for Scotland Yard. Last week, Mr. Wallis was arrested for questioning in connection with the police investigation of phone hacking at The News of the World, which was owned by News International, Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper division.  Mr. Wallis also worked for a spa where Sir Paul was treated for five weeks early this year while recovering from a fractured leg. Although Scotland Yard has said Sir Paul did not know that Mr. Wallis worked for Champney's Spa, this Sky News report from earlier on Sunday makes it clear that Sir Paul's stay at the luxurious facility, which cost about $17,000, had raised questions about the police commissioner's relationship with the former tabloid editor. In his statement, Sir Paul insisted that his integrity was unblemished, but said that he did not want questions about his leadership to undermine police preparations for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. He said:Let me turn to phone hacking and my relationship with Neil Wallis. I want to put the record straight. I met Mr. Wallis in 2006. The purpose of that meeting was, as with other journalists, to represent the context of policing and to better inform the public debate carried out through the media on policing issues. I had no knowledge of, or involvement in, the original investigation into phone hacking in 2006 that successfully led to the conviction and imprisonment of two men. I had no reason to believe this was anything other than a successful investigation. I was unaware that there were any other documents in our possession of the nature that have now emerged. I have acknowledged the statement by John Yates that if he had known then what he knows now he would have made different decisions. My relationship with Mr. Wallis continued over the following years and the frequency of our meetings is a matter of public record. The record clearly accords with my description of the relationship as one maintained for professional purposes and an acquaintance. In 2009 the Met entered into a contractual arrangement with Neil Wallis, terminating in 2010. I played no role in the letting or management of that contract. I have heard suggestions that we must have suspected the alleged involvement of Mr. Wallis in phone hacking. Let me say unequivocally that I did not and had no reason to have done so. I do not occupy a position in the world of journalism; I had no knowledge of the extent of this disgraceful practice and the repugnant nature of the selection of victims that is now emerging; nor of its apparent reach into senior levels. I saw senior figures from News International providing evidence that the misbehavior was confined to a rogue few and not known about at the top. One can only wonder about the motives of those within the newspaper industry or beyond, who now claim that they did know but kept quiet. Though mine and the Met's current severe discomfort is a consequence of those few that did speak out, I am grateful to them for doing so, giving us the opportunity to right the wrong done to victims - and here I think most of those especially vulnerable people who deserved so much better from us all. Now let me turn to the suspicion that the contractual relationship with Mr. Wallis was somehow kept secret. The contracting of Mr Wallis only became of relevance when his name became linked with the new investigation into phone hacking. I recognize that the interests of transparency might have made earlier disclosure of this information desirable. However my priority, despite the embarrassment it might cause, has been to maintain the integrity of Operation Weeting. To make it public would have immediately tainted him and potentially compromised any future Operation Weeting action. Now let me turn to the reported displeasure of the prime Minister and the home secretary of the relationship with Mr. Wallis. The reasons for not having told them are two fold. Firstly, I repeat my earlier comments of having at the time no reason for considering the contractual relationship to be a matter of concern. Unlike Mr. Coulson, Mr. Wallis had not resigned from News of the World or, to the best of my knowledge been in any way associated with the original phone hacking investigation. Secondly, once Mr. Wallis's name did become associated with Operation Weeting, I did not want to compromise the Prime Minister in any way by revealing or discussing a potential suspect who clearly had a close relationship with Mr. Coulson. I am aware of the many political exchanges in relation to Mr. Coulson's previous employment - I believe it would have been extraordinarily clumsy of me to have exposed the Prime Minister, or by association the home secretary, to any accusation, however unfair, as a consequence of them being in possession of operational information in this regard. Similarly, the mayor. Because of the individuals involved, their positions and relationships, these were I believe unique circumstances. Consequently, we informed the Chair of the [Metropolitan Police Authority], Mr. Malthouse, of the Met's contractual arrangements with Mr. Wallis on the morning of the latter's arrest. It is our practice not to release the names of suspects under arrest, making it difficult to make public details of the arrangements prior to Mr. Wallis's release the same day. The timing of the MPA Committee that I appeared before at 2pm that day was most unfortunate. Now let me briefly deal with the recent story in relation to my use of Champney's facilities. There has been no impropriety and I am extremely happy with what I did and the reasons for it - to do everything possible to return to running the Met full time, significantly ahead of medical, family and friends' advice. The attempt to represent this in a negative way is both cynical and disappointing. I thought it necessary to provide this lengthy and detailed account of my position on aspects of the current media questions and speculation concerning my conduct. I do this to provide the backcloth to the main purpose of this statement. There are a great number of things I value as part of my professional life - very high in this list are my reputation for judgement and integrity. On judgement: running a large and overwhelmingly successful organization like the Met must be dependent to a great extent on others providing the right information and assurances. I could reiterate that I had no reason to doubt the original investigation into phone hacking or be aware of the documents and information in our possession and only recently provided by News International. I could point to the many other successes of the Met. I could point to the long history of how and why the relationship between the Met and media has developed a way of doing business that has brought real benefits but perhaps runs the risk of misinterpretation or worse. In this particular regard it is clear to me that the current furore marks a point in time, a need to learn and change. However, as commissioner I carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in. With hindsight, I wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently. I didn't and that's it. I do not believe this on its own would be a matter for me to consider my position as commissioner. However, the issue of my integrity is different. Let me state clearly, I and the people who know me know that my integrity is completely intact. I may wish we had done some things differently, but I will not lose sleep over my personal integrity. Nevertheless, I must accept that the intense media coverage, questions, commentary and indeed allegations, as demonstrated by this weekend's attempt to misrepresent my arrangements for my recovery from illness, not only provide excessive distraction both for myself and colleagues, but are likely to continue for some time. In particular the public inquiry must take time, with even the first part scheduled not to report within a year.   "
London Mayor Last Year Dismissed Hacking Allegations as 'Codswallop',"Boris Johnson, London's mayor, was pressed on Monday to explain why he initially dismissed allegations that the police had failed to notify thousands of victims of phone hacking as ""a load of codswallop."" Mr. Johnson, a member of the Conservative Party, told reporters that he made that remark last September because John Yates, the deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service who resigned on Monday, had assured him that there was no need to open a new investigation since no new evidence had come to light following the initial inquiry in 2006. The mayor, who is partial to a colorful turn of phrase, said that Mr. Yates had told him that there was ""nothing at the end of the rainbow."" A transcript of Mayor's Question Time for Sept. 15, 2010, shows that Mr. Johnson called the allegation that phone hacking was much more widespread than the initial police investigation had suggested, ""a load of codswallop cooked up by the Labour Party.""   To put this episode in context, it helps to know that Mr. Johnson was himself a victim of phone hacking and is also a journalist, writing a column for The Daily Telegraph, a newspaper that supports the Conservatives.  In 2009, a report by Nick Davies of The Guardian -- a newspaper that has supported the Labour Party in the past -- suggested that the police had failed to notify thousands of victims of phone hacking whose account details were included in the notes of a private investigator working for The News of the World. Those notes were seized by the Metropolitan Police Service, commonly known as Scotland Yard, in 2006.  After that report was published in The Guardian, Mr. Yates was asked to determine if a new investigation was needed. He announced, just one day later: ""No additional evidence has come to light. I therefore consider no further investigation is required."" The problem, as my colleague Don Van Natta Jr. wrote on Saturday, was that there was quite a lot of old evidence, collected by Scotland Yard in 2006 but overlooked or concealed for years, to indicate that The News of the World had indeed broken into the voice-mail accounts of thousands of people. On Sept. 1, 2010, The New York Times Magazine published a report by Mr. Van Natta and our colleagues Jo Becker and Graham Bowley that detailed flaws in the initial police investigation. Two weeks after that article was published, Joanne McCartney, a Labour member of London's assembly, asked Mr. Johnson: ""Since this story has been revived by the New York Times article, have you had any briefings or discussions, perhaps with your deputy, on this issue and also what the police are doing?  Have you or haven't you?"" Mr. Johnson replied: ""I read the New York Times article, with great attention.  At the end of it I found myself scratching my head and wondering what news there was in it.  After he was pressed further by Ms. McCartney to say if he had discussed the matter with his deputy mayor for policing, Mr. Johnson added: I am almost in continuous conversations with my deputy mayor for policing about this and other matters.  It would be fair to say that he and I have discussed this.  The conclusion of our conversation would be obvious from what I have said.  In other words, this is a load of codswallop cooked up by the Labour Party and that we do not intend to get involved with it.  Dave Hill, who blogs about London for The Guardian, suggested on Monday that Mr. Johnson's ""eagerness to maintain good relations with"" the British newspaper division of News Corporation might have influenced his decision to avoid the phone-hacking scandal.  According to Mr. Hill, Mr. Johnson has accepted, ""six free meals from various members of its top brass since becoming mayor. These have included 'dinner for two' in Mayfair with Rebekah Brooks (Rebekah Wade as she was then), a lunch with James Murdoch and a dinner with Rupert Murdoch."" Mr. Hill added: Boris has long had a second motive for playing the hacking allegations down. He is, of course, himself a phone-hacking victim. Questioned by Labour London Assembly members last Wednesday he made plain his long-standing reluctance to assist in any prosecution that might entail details about his private life being once more dragged into the limelight. That reluctance is understandable, but still forms part of the context that make Boris's hands-off approach to the hacking scandal and his support for the Met's disinclination to re-investigate last year subjects that demand scrutiny.  "
Latest Updates on Phone Hacking Scandal," 2:10 P.M. | Commons Debate on Phone Hacking Ends The debate in the House of Commons on phone hacking has just ended and Parliament has now started its summer recess. On Twitter, one Conservative member of Parliament who has been at the center of the drama this week, Louise Mensch, writes that she is going to Disney World. In that spirit, The Lede is going to wrap up for the day, but we will be back on Thursday to cover any new developments in the scandal. In the meantime, please visit the home page of this Web site for any breaking news and to read what my colleagues in London have to say about the day's events. Here is Alan Cowell's overview of the latest developments and Graham Bowley's report on News Corporation's decision to stop paying the legal fees of the private investigator who hacked into phones for The News of the World, four years after he was jailed for doing so. As the American Journalism Review explains, supporters of the Murdochs, or those interested in a very different perspective on the scandal, might enjoy this Wall Street Journal editorial. Thanks for your comments. 1:56 P.M. | Is News Corp. Paying Anyone Else's Legal Fees? The debate in Parliament is now coming to an end, with a statement from Jeremy Hunt, the culture, media and sport secretary. On The BBC News Web site, Robert Peston has an interesting new blog post about the legal questions that are emerging as central issues. One is the fact that News Corporation has, until today, been paying the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who was jailed for phone hacking on behalf of The News of the World. Another is that a London law firm retained by the company to review internal e-mails in 2007, Harbottle & Lewis, has asked News Corporation to release it from its obligation of confidentiality so that it can respond to criticism of its work by James Murdoch. Mr. Peston writes: For months journalists, including myself, have asked News Corporation whether it was still paying the legal expenses of Glenn Mulcaire, the private detective imprisoned for phone hacking in 2007 who carried out illegal voice mail interceptions for the News of the World. The company controlled by the Murdoch family consistently refused to answer. Until yesterday, when James Murdoch - deputy chief operating officer of News Corp. - confirmed to MPs that those expenses had been paid by his company. And today, News Corp.'s newly created Management and Standards Committee decided it would stop paying Mr Mulcaire's legal costs. So what about other former employees of the News of the World, who have been arrested? Is News Corp. continuing to pay their legal expenses? All of that's under review, said a company spokesman. Separately News Corp. said it could not give permission to Harbottle & Lewis, the firm of solicitors, to talk about how the solicitors had come to write a letter in May 2007, which was given to MPs, saying that illegal hacking was confined to a single rogue reporter.... The reason Harbottle's letter has become so resonant is because it was based on a file of 300 News of the World emails (see my earlier posts - News International 'found smoking gun e-mails' and Police officer 'sold royal family contact details' - for more on this), which on June 20 of this year was passed to the Metropolitan Police. Yesterday, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald - who for News Corporation reviewed the emails in the file that related to bribes allegedly paid to the police - told MPs ""I cannot imagine anyone looking at that file and not seeing evidence of crime on its face."" One of the unanswered questions about the News of the World scandal is why it took four years for News Corporation to pass these smoking-gun emails to the Met. 1:33 P.M. | Gobby Saved Writing on Twitter, Lousie Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament, reports that the Commons official in charge of security, the Serjeant at Arms, has decided to restore the credentials of a BBC journalist who was punished on Wednesday for securing images of the man who attacked Rupert Murdoch with a pie. Ms. Mensch writes that the journalist, Paul Lambert, known by the nickname Gobby, has gotten his Commons pass back - as has another reporter who was similarly sanctioned. 1:16 P.M. | The Role of The BBC Enters the Debate As the debate continues in the House of Commons, several Conservative members of Parliament have suggested that the public inquiry into the media should include a review of what they call the liberal bias of The BBC's news reports.  The Conservatives uniformly claim that The BBC needs more commercial competition, since its reports are so widely-viewed. According to one member of Parliament, who is a former television executive, the nightly BBC News is watched by 5 million viewers, while ITV, the commercial channel, reaches about half that audience and Sky News, on the BSkyB satellite network started by Rupert Murdoch, is viewed by just 200,000 people a night. In response, Don Foster, a Liberal Democrat, says that he hopes the inquiry will not be used ""to clip the wings of The BBC,"" which is, incidentally, exactly what Mr. Murdoch has been demanding for years. Mr. Foster mentions that James Murdoch launched a ferocious assault on The BBC in a 2009 address to the Edinburgh Television Festival. Mr. Foster noted that the younger Mr. Murdoch said in that lecture, ""The only reliable, durable, and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit."" On The Guardian's live blog, Andrew Sparrow explains that Mr. Murdoch's lecture that year apparently disturbed Gordon Brown, who was then the prime minister. According to Mr. Sparrow, an article in last week's Sunday Times (another newspaper owned by the Murdochs) said that Mr. Brown ""hated every word"" of Mr. Murdoch's attack on The BBC and the television regulator Ofcom. Isabel Oakeshott of The Sunday Times reported:  Inside Downing Street, he pored over the text, line by line. ""I can't overstate how important that speech was,"" said a former Labour strategist who was with Brown at the time. ""It changed everything. He saw it as very rightwing and a direct attack on what we were doing. He felt the Murdochs didn't share any of our values.""  From the Labour benches, several speakers have defended the role of The BBC as a source of news but suggested that rules mandating impartial news reporting on British television should not be applied to newspapers. 12:32 P.M. | Complaints About Sanction for a BBC Journalist Louise Mensch, the Conservative member of Parliament who was questioning James Murdoch on Tuesday when his father Rupert was attacked by a pie-wielding ""activist/comedian,"" mentions that a BBC journalist who secured video of the attacker in police custody has had his credentials removed. Ms. Mensch suggests that the House of Commons should act to have this sanction reversed, in the interest of fostering freedom of the press. Paul Waugh, the editor of the Web site PoliticsHome.com, who witnessed the attack on Tuesday, reports: Thanks to the BBC's fixer Paul Lambert, the world managed to see some great TV footage of Murdoch's pieman as he was being held by the cops yesterday. But it seems that the House authorities, already furious at the breach of security by Jonathan May-Bowles (aka @jonniemarbles), were not pleased with all of the actions of the man known universally as Gobby. Some in the House were unhappy at the way Gobby and his TV camera pursued May-Bowles and the cops through the building, (at one stage intrepidly running down an up escalator, I hear). As a result, Gobby has had his Westminster pass withdrawn. Ms. Mensch also took to the Twitwaves to express her support for the new #SaveGobby campaign on the social network. Ms. Mensch's Twitter feed reveals that, during the upcoming parliamentary recess, she plans to read the autobiography of Piers Morgan, a former editor of The News of the World and The Daily Mirror. On Tuesday, Ms. Mensch mistakenly claimed during the parliamentary hearings that Mr. Morgan boasted of phone hacking in his book. In fact, he wrote that he learned of the technique when he suspected that his own voice mail might have been hacked into by rival journalists. After Mr. Morgan rebuked Ms. Mensch on CNN for failing to read his book, and making accusations about his conduct only under the cloak of parliamentary privilege (which prevents him from suing her for libel), she asked him, via Twitter, to send her an autographed copy of his autobiography. Mr. Morgan replied that hre would do so, and write: ""Louise, next time you lie about me under the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege, try reading the book first."" 11:30 A.M. | More on Mulcaire's Legal Fees Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament - who first asked Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of The News of the World, if her newspaper had paid police officers for information in 2003 - suggests that News Corporation continued to pay legal fees for Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator jailed in 2007 for phone hacking, until today because ""they wanted to make sure he didn't say anything additional that further incriminated anyone in the newspaper or the wider company."" David Allen Green a legal blogger for The News Statesman wrote on Wednesday: Since the revelations in the New York Times revived the phone hacking scandal back in September 2010, one of the most puzzling aspects has been the ""settlement"" agreement that News International had entered into with Glenn Mulcaire. In particular, as was pointed out at Jack of Kent, a conventional settlement agreement made no sense if Mulcaire was not actually an employee to begin with. Since then, it has become clear that the agreement had two key terms in addition to any cash payment for Mulcaire to compromise all and any legal claims against News International, if he ever had any such claims at all. First, there was an obligation of confidentiality on Mulcaire. This is standard in such agreements, though in this case it was clearly convenient to News International. A cynic may even suggest that was the whole point. Second, there appears to have been an indemnity for the payment of Mulcaire's legal fees for defenses to civil claims. This may have been tied into a further right of News International to conduct his defense. This would have been sensible from a strategic point of view, as it appears News International was facing a number of actions as co-defendant with Mulcaire. ... it would now seem that Mulcaire has no direct interest in co-ordinating any defense to the civil claims with News International. He may well feel at least morally released from any obligation of confidentiality. 10:58 A.M. | Piegate, Hackgate and 'Dear Mr. Murdoch' The debate in the House of Commons continues, although most of the benches have now emptied. This might be a good moment to catch up on some of the ways in which the scandal has moved into popular culture. First, there is an article on The Guardian's Web site in which Jonathan May-Bowles, the ""activist/comedian"" who goes by the name Jonnie Marbles, explains and defends his decision to attack Rupert Murdoch with a pie plate filled with shaving-cream on Tuesday. (This .gif loop makes some forensic analysis of the pie attack possible, and raises the question of why it was just the women on the parliamentary panel who jumped to htier feet whn the attack was launched, as the men sat and watched.) The Guardian also has the news that Roger Taylor of the band Queen has released an updated version of his 1994 song, ""Dear Mr. Murdoch."" Mr. Taylor's song has been posted on Queen's official YouTube channel. Elsewhere on YouTube, there is this highly unofficial fake trailer for a movie about the hacking scandal: 10:13 A.M. | Questions About a Whistle-Blower's Testimony Earlier in the debate, Ed Miliband, the opposition leader, read aloud from an article on phone hacking at The News of the World published by The New York Times Magazine on Sept. 1, 2010. That article included statements by two sources that Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World who was at the time a media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, knew about and approved of phone hacking by his reporters. In that article, my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Graham Bowley reported: A dozen former reporters said in interviews that hacking was pervasive at News of the World. ""Everyone knew,"" one longtime reporter said. ""The office cat knew."" One former editor said Coulson talked freely with colleagues about the dark arts, including hacking. ""I've been to dozens if not hundreds of meetings with Andy"" when the subject came up, said the former editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The editor added that when Coulson would ask where a story came from, editors would reply, ""We've pulled the phone records"" or ""I've listened to the phone messages."" Sean Hoare, a former reporter and onetime close friend of Coulson's, also recalled discussing hacking. The two men first worked together at The Sun, where, Hoare said, he played tape recordings of hacked messages for Coulson. At News of the World, Hoare said he continued to inform Coulson of his pursuits. Coulson ""actively encouraged me to do it,"" Hoare said. Hoare said he was fired during a period when he was struggling with drugs and alcohol.  John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Commons committee on culture, media and sport, points out that one of the two sources who connected Mr. Coulson to phone hacking was anonymous. The other, he notes, was Sean Hoare, a former News of the World reporter who died on Monday. According to Mr. Whittingdale, Mr. Hoare, who struggled with subsrance abuse, might not have been seen as a credible witness in a legal proceeding. He says: ""it was widely believed that Sean Hoare's testimony would not stand up in court."" 10:03 A.M. | Lawyers Ask Murdochs to Allow Them to Testify John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport, rises to speak. Mr. Whittigndale's committee questioned Rupert Murdoch and his son James on Tuesday.  During their appearance, the two men repeatedly said that they had relied legal advice from a respected law firm, Harbottle & Lewis, for advice on whether or not a cache of 2,500 internal e-mails contained no evidence of wrongdoing by senior editors at The News of the World. Mr. Whittingdale says that he has received a letter from Harbottle & Lewis, in which the firm explained that it has now asked News Corporation to release the firm's lawyers from ""their obligation of confidentiality,"" so that they can respond to the accusation that they failed to uncover evidence of wrongdoing in those e-mails. Mr. Whittingdale says that News Corporation has not yet agreed to the request from Harbottle & Lewis, but urges the company to do so, ""in the light of the assurances that we were given of their willingness to cooperate fully."" 9:37 A.M. | Miliband Defends His Media Adviser Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, rises to give his party's view on the motion before the House of Commons, ""that this House has considered public confidence in the media and the police."" He says that while there are indeed other important issues, the revelations that phone hacking was used to gather private information about not just celebrities and politicians but also ""about the lives of others who never sought the public eye,"" makes it vital to discuss the misconduct fully and put a stop to it. Mr. Miliband says, ""we do not want to live in a country where the depraved deletion of a dead teenager"" is considered acceptable. He adds that failures of the police and politicians to stop phone hacking need to end. From the Conservative benches, Mr. Miliband is asked about the conduct of one of his current aides, Tom Baldwin, who is a former reporter at The Times of London. A leading Conservative, Lord Ashcroft, who helped finance the last election campaign by his party, claimed this month that Mr. Baldwin had  to obtain his bank records when he was a reporter. Mr. Miliband replies that he has asked Mr. Baldwin and his former employer, The Times, which is also owned by Rupert Murdoch, about this allegation and both have denied that there is anything to it. The Times, Mr. Miliband says, ""specifically confirm that he did nothing illegal."" As the Conservative benches laugh at the fact that Mr. Miliband is falling back on assurances from one of Mr. Murdoch's newspapers, the leader of the opposition points out that, when he was at The Times, ""Tom Baldwin's line manager was the current education secretary."" 9:12 A.M. | A 'Private and Confidential' Letter From John Yates Alan Johnson, who was the home secretary before last year's election, says that John Yates, the former assistant commissioner of Scotland Yard, told him in ""a private and confidential letter"" last week that the reason that a new police investigation into phone hacking commenced this year is that ""in January 2011, News International began to cooperate properly with the police."" Mr. Johnson asks Mr. Cameron if the fact that this cooperation began at about the same time that Andy Coulson resigned from government was ""a coincidence."" 9:02 A.M. | Did Cameron Have Advance Warning of New Investigation? Barry Gardiner, a Labour member of Parliament, intervenes to ask the prime minister if he had any advance notice of the new police investigation into phone hacking, which began just days after Andy Coulson resigned as his media adviser. Mr. Cameron says that he cannot speak for all of his staff, but he did not have any such warning himself. 9:00 A.M. | Main Debate Begins on Phone Hacking Moving on from the discussion of the prime minister's statement on phone hacking, a formal debate in the House Commons begins with remarks from Mr. Cameron. He says that Parliament has led the public debate on phone hacking in recent weeks, which led to the end of News Corporation's bid for full control of BSkyB, the satellite television network. 8:49 A.M. | Members of Parliament Asked to Drop Their Phones As the discussion of Mr. Cameron's statement on phone hacking continues in Westminster, the Commons speaker, John Bercow, asks members of Parliament who are standing in an attempt to attract his notice to ""stop fiddling with"" their phones as they do so. 8:27 A.M. | Video of Cameron's Complete Statement on Hacking Here, from Britain's Channel 4 News, is video of Prime Minister David Cameron's complete statement on phone hacking to the House of Commons, which was made about two hours ago: 8:21 A.M. | News Corp. Reportedly Stops Paying Mulcaire Legal Fees Laura Kuenssberg, chief political correspondent for The BBC News Channel, reports on Twitter that ""News Corp. is terminating the payment of legal fees to Glen Muclaire, the private investigator convicted of hacking."" Mr. Mulcaire was jailed in 2007 for the phone hacking he did on behalf of The News of the World. During his testimony to the Commons select committee on home affairs on Tuesday, James Murdoch admitted that his company had continued to pay legal fees for Mr. Mulcaire after he was released from prison, even as it said that the investigator's phone hacking operation was despicable and unsanctioned by editors and executives. Also on Twitter, Paul Waugh, the editor of Politics Home, a British Web site, notes that Britain's Sky News reports that News Corporation will stop paying Mr. Mulcaire's legal fees ""today.""  8:07 A.M. | Request to Remove Coulson's Commons Pass Ann Clwyd, a Labour member of Parliament, asks Mr. Cameron to remove the pass which allows Andy Coulson to continue to ""wander the halls"" of the House of Commons. Referring to Mr. Coulson, Ms. Clwyd suggests that the prime minister ""obviously cannot smell a rat when he has one in his midst."" Mr. Cameron chides Ms. Clwyd's use of metaphor and does not address the question of Mr. Coulson retaining his pass, despite having resigned from the government in January. 8:01 A.M. | 'Gotcha!' Pressed further about his employment of Mr. Coulson, the prime minister names former journalists who have worked as media advisers to the Labour Party and says, ""Gotcha!"" Mr. Cameron mentioned both Alastair Campbell, a former tabloid journalist who worked as Tony Blair's media strategist, and Tom Baldwin, a former reporter for Rupert Murdoch's Times of London who is currently an aide to the Labour leader Ed Miliband. Mr. Cameron's use of the word ""Gotcha"" recalls a 1982 headline from The Sun, Mr. Murdcoh's tabloid, which featured that word on its front page with a report on the sinking of an Argentine ship, the General Belgrano, during the Falklands War. Roy Greenslade, a columnist for The Guardian who was an editor at The Sun in 1982, reported that Rupert Murdoch himself played a role in the use of that headline by the newspaper. Mr. Greenslade explained in 2002: By chance, the war coincided with a pay strike by the journalists' union so, on the evening of May 2, only a dozen executives, including me, were producing the paper when the first genuinely dramatic war news broke. A news agency reported that the General Belgrano had been hit. Wendy Henry shouted ""Gotcha!"" not as a suggested headline but as a spontaneous reaction, the kind of black joke common to every newspaper office. [The Sun's editor, Kelvin] MacKenzie seized on it and designed a front page which said: ""GOTCHA. Our lads sink gunboat and hole cruiser."" The first edition was off stone before more detailed news of the Belgrano's sinking arrived. It dawned on us that there might have been a huge loss of life, and as Petrie read the agency reports aloud, the mood changed. Realising that ""Gotcha"" might be inappropriate, MacKenzie drew up another front page with a new headline: ""Did 1,200 Argies drown?"" The Sun's owner, Rupert Murdoch, happened to walk on to the floor as MacKenzie was completing the new layout and said he didn't see the need to replace ""Gotcha."" MacKenzie disagreed and subsequent editions carried the less controversial line. Without a strike, it's likely that the original page one would have been altered so quickly that few copies would have left the building. But the time it took to make the change ensured that hundreds of thousands of the first edition were published and ""Gotcha"" came to symbolize ever after the Sun's, and MacKenzie's, cynical, jingoistic, bloodthirsty war coverage. 7:51 A.M. | Cameron's 'Permanent Conversation' With Coulson Mr. Cameron is asked another direct question about how he responded in 2010 to allegations that his media adviser, Andy Coulson, knew about phone hacking when he was the editor of The News of the World. The prime minister says that, as new reports were published last year about phone hacking, he had ""a permanent conversation if you like,"" with Mr. Coulson asking all the time, ""was this new evidence that he knew about phone hacking?"" Mr. Cameron adds, ""if it was he would have to go."" Mr. Cameron leaves unanswered the question of whether any doubts about Mr. Coulson's knowledge of phone hacking were raised in his mind by those reports. 7:38 A.M. | Cameron Set Himself a 'Test' on Coulson Emily Thornberry, a Labour member of Parliament, asks Mr. Cameron to say when he read the Sept. 1, 2010 New York Times article which suggested that Andy Coulson did know about phone hacking.  Mr. Cameron replies that the article's allegations were republished in the British press. ""I set myself a credible test,"" he says, ""if anybody brought me credible information that he knew about hacking, I'd fire him.""  In response to further questions, Mr. Cameron refuses to say if he ever discussed News Corporation's effort to take full control of the satellite broadcaster BSkyB with executives from that company. 7:32 A.M. | On Cameron's Friendship With Brooks David Lammy, a Labour member of Parliament, describes informal meetings Mr. Cameron has had with his friend, Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of New International, and asks if ""such informality on his behalf"" is improper. Mr. Cameron replies that it is not, and notes that Ms. Brooks said in her testimony on Tuesday that she visited the prime minister's residence about six times a year when Labour was in power. He also refers to the fact that Ms. Brooks had a ""sleepover"" at No. 10 Downing Street when Gordon Brown was prime minister. He says that he has never seen Ms. Brooks ""in her pajamas.""  7:23 A.M. | On the New Home Affairs Select Committee Report Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons select committee on home affairs, asks Mr. Cameron if he has had time to read his panel's new report, published early on Wednesday, which suggests that News Corporation's British newspaper division, News International, ""deliberately"" tried to obstruct the initial police investigation of phone hacking. Mr. Vaz also says that a former director of public prosecutions told the committee that any proper review of a cache of internal News International e-mails, which have been held by the law firm Harbottle & Lewis for years, would have made it plain in five minutes that crimes were committed. As Christopher Hope of The Daily Telegraph reported on Wednesday morning: Harbottle & Lewis took possession of hundreds of internal emails from the News of the World in 2007 after being hired by News International. The firm indicated in a short letter to News International that the emails did not show wider evidence of criminality. This document was relied upon by the publisher during parliamentary inquiries in 2009. Yesterday, Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, the former director of public prosecutions, who in May was asked to review the information, told members of the Commons media select committee that evidence of criminality in the files was ""blindingly obvious"". He said that if police had seen the scale of criminality in the file when it was compiled in 2007 they would have opened a corruption inquiry immediately.  7:12 A.M. | What Was Cameron's Response to Times Article? Mr. Cameron is pressed to say what his response was to The New York Times article last September that suggested that Andy Coulson knew about and sanctioned phone hacking when he was a tabloid editor.  Mr. Cameron replies that there was no new information in that article to raise any questions in his mind. That article, like a July, 2009 report in The Guardian, dealt not with new evidence gathered by the police after Mr. Coulson resigned, but about how much of the evidence gathered by the police in 2006 was not properly examined. 7:06 A.M. | Miliband Claims Cameron Had a 'Conflict of Interest' Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, asks Mr. Cameron to address what he calls the prime minister's ""conflict of interest"" regarding wrongdoing at the British newspaper division of News Corporation. Mr. Miliband claims that Mr. Cameron's aides ""built a wall of silence between the facts and the prime minister."" The opposition leader suggests that Mr. Cameron's failure to ask questions about Mr. Coulson's role in phone hacking after an article published by The New York Times on Sept. 1, 2010 suggested that the practice had been more widespread during his editorship than the initial police investigation revealed. In response, Mr. Cameron objects that he had now made all of his meetings with News Corporation officials before the election public, but Labour Party leaders have not done so. He continues to detail what he says was the overly close relationship between Labour officials and editors and executives in Rupert Murdoch's media empire. 6:53 A.M. | Cameron's Statement on Hiring Coulson Mr. Cameron says that his chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, behaved entirely properly in    "
Cartoon in Murdoch's Paper Calls Hacking Inquiry a Distraction From African Famine,"During Wednesday's debate in the House of Commons on the phone hacking scandal, several Conservative members of Parliament expressed concern that the issue was a distraction from far more important issues -- among them, a famine in Somalia. Peter Lilley, for instance, said: ""I welcome the recall of Parliament. I am only sorry that we are not being recalled to discuss the problems of the eurozone, the slowdown in the world economy in the face of higher energy prices, and the famine in east Africa."" On Thursday, that idea was expressed clearly, and controversially, on the pages of Rupert Murdoch's Times of London, in the form of an editorial cartoon with the headline ""Priorities."" The cartoon showed a starving Somali child holding his distended stomach and saying, ""I've had a bellyful of phone-hacking.""  Katharine Viner, an editor at The Guardian, posted a snapshot of the cartoon online and asked: ""What do people think of this cartoon in the Times?"" Earlier this week, another Murdoch-owned newspaper, The Wall Street Journal ran a combative editorial saying that news organizations not owned by News Corporation were reporting so heavily on the hacking scandal purely to damage a rival. The Journal's opinion editors complained about ""the commercial and ideological motives of our competitor-critics,"" adding, ""The Schadenfreude is so thick you can't cut it with a chainsaw."" During his testimony to a parliamentary committee in London on Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch himself made a similar charge. When asked whom he blamed for the scandal, he replied: ""A lot of people had different agendas, I think, in trying to build this hysteria. All our competitors in this country formally announced a consortium to try and stop us. They caught us with dirty hands and they built the hysteria around it."" The defenses of the phone hacking at The News of the World, which has been closed, came on the editorial pages of the most respected newspapers in Mr. Murdoch's media empire.  In 2007, when Mr. Murdoch moved to buy The Journal, Ken Auletta of The New Yorker reported that part of the negotiation ""focused on whether Murdoch could be trusted to keep his distance from news coverage, and what kind of independent board could assure this."" To assuage the fears of the family that owned the newspaper, Mr. Murdoch ""said that he would be willing to establish an independent board to assure that editors were free from his whims."" As Mr. Auletta explained, Mr. Murdoch offered to set up ""a board like the one he had established for The Times of London and The Sunday Times, where of the fifteen members only seven have no ties to News Corp., and where he can theoretically hire or fire the editor only with the assent of the board. In London, The Times board rarely meets, and is reliant for much of its information on Murdoch."" The composition of that board, known as a ""special committee,"" was eventually outlined in detail as part of News Corporation's ultimately successful bid to buy Dow Jones, the publisher of The Journal. Last week, Dow Jones reported that the special committee, ""formed to monitor editorial integrity and independence at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires"" in 2007, had issued a statement clearing the American news organization of any connection to the hacking scandal. The Dow Jones report continued: The statement of the committee, which is composed of independent journalism professionals, came a few hours after Les Hinton, Dow Jones's chief executive officer, resigned. Hinton had been executive chairman of News International, the U.K. unit responsible for the News of the World newspaper at the center of the hacking allegations. Of the hacking scandal, the committee said, ""Such matters are deeply concerning to us, suggesting as they do a serious default of basic journalistic standards in certain units of News Corp."" The committee added: ""To date, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that today's resignation of Les Hinton as publisher of The Wall Street Journal is [in] any way related to activities at The Wall Street Journal or Dow Jones or that any of the London offenses or anything like them have taken place at Dow Jones. We will continue to monitor the situation closely."" The committee has quarterly meetings. The members, each paid $100,000 a year by the company, are Thomas J. Bray, former editorial page editor of the Detroit News; Louis Boccardi, former chief executive of the Associated Press; Jack Fuller, retired president of Tribune Publishing Co.; Nicholas Negroponte, co-founder of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Susan M. Phillips, dean of the George Washington University School of Business. In 2007, Mr. Auletta suggested that Mr. Murdoch ""seems to value even a trophy property like The Times of London less for its prestige than for its influence - its power to help sway elections, to promote his political ideas, and to protect his corporate interests."" Minutes after Mr. Murdoch concluded his appearance before the parliamentary committee in London on Tuesday, Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, commented on Twitter: ""News Corp. isn't a news company at all, but a global media empire that employs its newspapers (and in the U.S., Fox News) as a lobbying arm.""  "
James Murdoch's Testimony Called Into Question by Former News of the World Executives,"Two former executives who worked at The News of the World released a statement on Thursday in which they said James Murdoch was ""mistaken"" when he told a parliamentary committee investigating the phone hacking scandal at the newspaper that he was not aware of a key piece of evidence in 2008. Colin Myler, who was the editor of the tabloid until it was shuttered this month, and Tom Crone, who was the chief legal adviser to News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation until last week, said that Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the division, was told in 2008 that an e-mail had been discovered that indicated that more than just one reporter at the newspaper had relied on phone hacking for information. As my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr. and Jo Becker reported after James Murdoch and his father, Rupert, appeared before the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Tuesday: The decision by James Murdoch to authorize a confidential 725,000 settlement ($1.1 million) in the first hacking lawsuit filed against The News of the World also came under scrutiny. A payment intended to settle the case, filed by the soccer union boss Gordon Taylor, came in June 2008 after News International learned of the evidence that he had managed to pry from Scotland Yard. That included a transcript of one of his voice mails marked ""For Neville,"" an apparent reference to The News of the World's chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. Had that been revealed in court, it would have contradicted News International executives' evidence given to the same House of Commons committee that hacking was limited to one ""rogue"" reporter, Mr. Goodman, the royal reporter. James Murdoch said Tuesday that he had been given an oral briefing on the Taylor case and ""did not get involved directly"" in the negotiations. Asked whether he was aware that hacking was illegal, James Murdoch acknowledged, ""That was my understanding.""    Near the end of Tuesday's hearing, after the pie attack on Rupert Murdoch distracted many observers, Tom Watson, a member of the panel, asked James Murdoch: ""When you signed off the Taylor payment, did you see or were you made aware of the full 'Neville' e-mail, the transcript of the hacked voice mail messages?"" Mr. Murdoch replied, ""No, I was not aware of that at the time."" In their joint statement on Thursday, Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone wrote: Just by way of clarification relating to Tuesday's CMS select committee hearing, we would like to point out that James Murdoch's recollection of what he was told when agreeing to settle the Gordon Taylor litigation was mistaken. In fact, we did inform him of the ""For Neville"" e-mail, which had been produced to us by Gordon Taylor's lawyers. In a very brief statement posted on the News Corporation's Web site later on Thursday, James Murdoch said, ""I stand behind my testimony to the select committee."" A lawyer and a journalist who worked with Mr. Crone told Reuters last week that he was ""responsible for approving many of the front pages"" of The News of the World. Tim Bratton, the general counsel of the Financial Times, observed on Twitter that Mr. Crone's part in the statement ""is significant because he is a libel expert and so must be ""confident,"" that it is true.  "
Cameron Under Pressure,"Since we gathered here last, the News International phone-hacking scandal has unfolded with staggering speed: the past week brought the resignations of top News Corporation executives and two ranking British police officials, the unexplained death of a former News of the World editor and whistleblower, and the beginning of sometimes dramatic government hearings on the matter, one featuring Rupert and James Murdoch, a shaving cream pie and an amazing flying spouse (pink jacket). But among the many questions driving the scandal is the possibility that wrongdoing might ""go all the way to the top,"" implying that relationships between the government of Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron and  members of the Murdoch press were too close to be clean. Cameron himself has had to respond to pressure,  not only to explain his hiring of the former News of the World editor Andrew Coulson as his communications director (after revelations about the tabloid's tactics had already come to light), but to press a wider government investigation and defend his own actions and those of his government. Cameron cut short a diplomatic trip to South Africa to appear at a special session of Parliament on Wednesday - one of those rowdy, theatrical British debates that put Senate floor scuffles to shame. The inquiries, of course, will be ongoing, but whatever the outcome, the scandal has put an unusually intense focus on Cameron, raising the question of whether his government is truly under threat. The answer among most commentators was, no. But earlier in the week Alex Massie at The Daily Beast saw the glass half empty for the prime minister: Will David Cameron's government survive the phone-hacking scandal engulfing Britain's political and media class? A week ago such a question seemed absurd; now it is no longer unthinkable that Cameron will be felled by his association with Rupert Murdoch and his hacking band of disgraced executives. As a rule it is rarely a promising development when reporters start asking if the prime minister should resign. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats and deputy prime minister, insisted on Monday that ""of course"" Cameron should not step down. ""Let's keep things in perspective here,"" he pleaded, though he must know that perspective is the first thing to be sacrificed in times as turbulent as these. The wonder is not that the question was answered in the negative but that it was asked at all. The inconceivable is now conceivable. ""Cameron's government may not fall,"" Massie added, ""but it is hard to imagine circumstances in which he can survive this tumult with his reputation wholly intact. Nothing will ever be quite the same again."" By week's end, most others seemed to think that was a bit of a stretch, and that Cameron's appearance on Wednesday had significantly strengthened his hand. Michael Gerson at The Washington Post was one of them. Starting at 7:30 [Wednesday morning], Cameron took practice questions from his advisers. His speech to Parliament began before noon. Eventually, he fielded 163 minutes of questions from 136 members of Parliament. It was a grilling to which an American president would never consent - analogous to a joint session speech, combined with a congressional investigation, both sprung on a moment's notice. But Cameron gave an assured performance - a successful blend of contrition and defiance. No prime minister, even tangentially, wants to be involved in a scandal that somehow involves Rupert Murdoch; a private investigator with a criminal past; the resignation of the head of the Metropolitan police; the voice mails of a murdered teenage girl; a suddenly deceased whistle-blower; an arrested newspaper editor; and a lawsuit by Jude Law. Under these circumstances, no government could respond, ""Move along. Nothing to see here."" But Cameron's role in this mess is tangential. This is mainly a scandal at the wild, ragged edges of the Murdoch media empire   In his statement, Cameron offered what Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party called a ""half apology"" for hiring Coulson. ""With hindsight,"" Cameron said, he would not have offered Coulson the job. (""You live and learn and believe me I have learned."") Andrew Sullivan gave Cameron a warm review, arguing that his statement to Parliament was a winning moment that established his character in the tumult of the scandal. ""Moments like the current one in Westminster,"" Sullivan wrote, ""are like sudden klieg-lights beaming down on otherwise crepuscular institutions. All the sharp shadows form; you see character tested; you see cliques revealed; you see the press divide. And in all this, you learn. One thing I've learned is that David Cameron is not to be under-estimated. His performance a short time ago today in the Commons was commanding. ... Pitch perfect to my ears."" At The Daily Beast Philip Delves Broughton finds Cameron ""bruised and depleted,"" arguing that the prime minister's political strength - his apparent appeal to a segment of the British public - has been compromised. He writes, ""Cameron's success to date has been attributed to his having a connection with Middle England, that amorphous mass of honest burghers, sipping pints and playing village cricket, the British equivalent of Nixon's 'silent majority.' The great danger of the phone-hacking scandal is that this connection has been seriously frayed."" He continued:  Everyone in Britain understands the need for politicians of every party to win over newspaper owners and their editors, even Rupert Murdoch. But there is also a hypocritical deal in place here - that when you do so, you should do so with at least a display of reluctance. You should treat your friendships in the press as a necessary evil. Journalists don't mind being treated that way. It's part of the job. But Cameron was spending his Christmases with these people. He made them his closest advisers. He was eating sausage rolls with them even while his government decided the fate of Murdoch's acquisition of the rest of BSkyB. Writing again on Friday, Massie seemed to sense that the any outrage directed towards Cameron had indeed begun to wane. ""Miliband's criticism of Cameron,"" he wrote, ""has been based on a simple idea: 'He simply doesn't get it.' Hiring Coulson was the original sin that prevented the prime minister from acting more decisively before it became impossible for him to avoid doing so. The fallout from that decision has yet to be fully measured and it may yet be the case that Cameron will face further embarrassment once the multiple inquiries into the scandal begin to report in the fall. For the time being, however, the evidence suggests the public views the scandal as simply confirming their already low opinion of politicians and journalists alike. This being so, it has not radically changed their views in any serious or significant fashion."" No offense taken.  "
New Arrest in British Phone Hacking Scandal,"The police in London arrested a 71-year-old man in connection with the widening British phone hacking scandal that has shaken Rupert Murdoch's media empire.  The police did not name the man, who the BBC said was arrested on suspicion of corruption and conspiring to intercept communications.  But the Guardian and several other news organizations said he was Stuart Kuttner, a former managing editor of the News of the World newspaper, the tabloid at the center of the scandal that Mr. Murdoch shuttered last month.   Mr. Kuttner had been the managing editor of the News of the World for 22 years, and in charge of the paper's finances, before stepping down in July 2009. On that occasion, he praised the paper's work, saying the journalists there reflected ""Fleet Street at its finest."" ""They are masters of our craft and it has been an honor to have worked with them,"" Mr. Kuttner said, according to a Guardian report at the time. The arrest on Tuesday is the latest in a widening investigation into accusations of illegal activity at the newspaper, including gaining unauthorized access to private voice mails and paying bribes to the police. The scandal has already led to the closing of the 168-year-old newspaper, the resignation of two top police officials and the arrests of 10 other people, including the newspaper's former editor, Andy Coulson, and the former News International chief executive, Rebekah Brooks.  A Parliamentary committee last month asked Mr. Murdoch and his son James about whether Mr. Kuttner's resignation in 2009, which came just ahead of a damning report in the Guardian, was connected to the accusations of widespread phone hacking. Philip Davies, Conservative Party MP: Stuart Kuttner left the company either the day, or the day after,allegations were made in The Guardian originally about phone hacking. Was that linked? Did he resign? Was he sacked? What happened to Stuart Kuttner, and how did he leave the company? James Murdoch: That I don't know; that would have been at the time a matter for News of the World. Rupert Murdoch: It is for you to ask him. In testimony before Parliament later the same day, Ms. Brooks said that ""payments of private detectives would have gone through the managing editor's office,"" a reference to the paper's practice of hiring detectives to gather information.  One of those private detectives, Glenn Mulcaire, was imprisoned in 2007 for phone hacking. Since Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation stopped paying for his ongoing legal defense in late July, Mr. Mulcaire has said he acted on instructions from the paper. Ms. Brooks was questioned on this point by Tom Watson, a Labour party member of Parliament: Tom Watson: So Stuart Kuttner would have discussed some payments to private detectives with you? Rebekah Brooks: Not necessarily, no. We are talking about 11 years ago. He may have discussed payments with me, but I don't particularly remember any incidents. Tom Watson: You don't remember whether you would have discussed any payments at all? Rebekah Brooks: I didn't say that; I said in relation to private detectives. I was aware that the News of the World used private detectives, as every paper in Fleet Street did. Tom Watson: So you don't recall whether you authorized payments or talked with Stuart Kuttner? Rebekah Brooks: The payments of private detectives would have gone through the managing editor's office.  "
Letter Raises New Questions About Internal Inquiry at Tabloid,"Updated | 5:29 p.m. A disgraced reporter for The News of the World complained in a 2007 letter to his employers that he should not have been fired for phone hacking because the ""practice was widely discussed in the daily editorial conference, until explicit reference to it was banned by the editor,"" as my colleagues Sarah Lyall, Ravi Somaiya and Alan Cowell report. That claim is potentially significant for a number of reasons, not least of which is the fact that the tabloid's editor at the time was Andy Coulson, who has insisted for years that he had no knowledge of phone hacking at the paper. Mr. Coulson later served as Prime Minister David Cameron's chief media strategist, before quitting in January. A redacted version of the March 2, 2007, letter from the tabloid's former royal correspondent, Clive Goodman -- who was jailed that year for intercepting the voice mail messages of three employees of the British royal family -- was included in a cache of correspondence published Tuesday on the Web site of a British parliamentary panel investigating phone hacking. The Guardian has posted an annotated version of Mr. Goodman's letter on its Web site.  The letter was provided to the Commons select committee on culture, media and sport by Harbottle & Lewis, a law firm retained by The News of the World in 2007 to see if Mr. Goodman's e-mail correspondence with his editors from that period contained any evidence to support his claim that ""other members of staff were carrying out the same illegal procedures,"" with the ""full knowledge and support"" of senior journalists at the now-defunct tabloid. In the letter, Mr. Goodman called the newspaper's decision to fire him for ""gross misconduct"" both ""perverse"" and ""inconsistent."" According to a report by Nick Davies, a Guardian journalist who has seen an unredacted copy of the letter, Mr. Goodman also wrote that his phone hacking was carried out ""with the full knowledge and support"" of senior journalists at the paper whose names he listed in the letter. Mr. Davies reports that Mr. Goodman's letter also names another senior journalist at the tabloid who arranged the payments to the private investigator who carried out the hacking, Glenn Mulcaire. Mr. Davies also explains that the names of the journalists were redacted from Mr. Goodman's letter at the request of police officers in London who are leading a new criminal investigation of phone hacking at the tabloid. Mr. Goodman's letter was addressed to the director of human resources for News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation, which owned The News of the World. According to the copy of the letter made public on Tuesday, Mr. Goodman also sent it to both Stuart Kuttner, who was the managing editor of The News of the World, and Les Hinton, a close ally of Rupert Murdoch's who was at the time the chief executive of News International. As my colleagues Jo Becker and Ravi Somaiya reported, Mr. Kuttner was arrested two weeks ago ""on suspicion of conspiring to hack cellphones and pay police officers."" Mr. Hinton resigned last month from his post as chief executive of Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Hinton has also maintained for years that he was unaware of any evidence of widespread phone hacking at The News of the World. As Marian Wang, a blogger for ProPublica, points out, another copy of Mr. Goodman's letter was also supplied to the parliamentary committee by News International, in response to a request from the panel. What is most interesting about the version that News International produced is that it omits more than just names from the letter -- two entire sections of Mr. Goodman's letter are missing. Both sections relate to Mr. Goodman's claim that the newspaper's editor, Mr. Coulson, and it's senior lawyer, Tom Crone, had assured the reporter that he would not lose his job as long as he ""did not implicate the paper or any of its staff,"" during his trial. Here is the complete text of those two sections, which News International removed from the letter before sending it to the committee: iii My conviction and imprisonment cannot be the real reason for my dismissal. The legal manager, Tom Crone, attended virtually every meeting of my legal team and was given full access to the Crown Prosecution Service's evidence files. He, and other senior staff of the paper, had long advance knowledge that I would plead guilty. Despite this, the paper continued to employ me. Throughout my suspension, I was given book serialisations to write and was consulted on several occasions about royal stories they needed to check. The paper continued to employ me for a substantial part of my custodial sentence. iv Tom Crone and the Editor promised on many occasions that I could come back to a job at the newspaper if I did not implicate the paper or any of its staff in my mitigation plea. I did not, and I expect the paper to honour its promise to me. The copy of the letter News International submitted to the committee also redacted Mr. Goodman's mention of phone hacking having been discussed in ""the daily editorial conference"" at the newspaper. The British parliamentary panel also released several recent letters from current and former senior executives at the British newspaper division of News Corporation on Tuesday. Among the new letters posted online by the select committee is one from James Murdoch, who oversees the newspapers purchased decades ago by his father, Rupert Murdoch. After the father and son gave testimony to the panel last month, three former employees claimed in letters to the committee that James Murdoch's testimony contained inaccurate statements. During that same appearance before the committee, the Murdochs suggested that a review of Clive Goodman's e-mails carried out by Harbottle & Lewis on behalf of the company had supported their understanding that Mr. Goodman, the former royal correspondent, was the only News of the World reporter who engaged in phone hacking. As Robert Peston, The BBC's business editor, explains on his blog, the law firm now says that it was asked to carry out a much more narrow review of a batch of e-mails provided by the newspaper's executives. Mr. Peston writes: News International and the Murdochs have said they relied on the advice of Harbottle & Lewis in their failure to investigate the full extent of alleged criminal behavior at the News of the World till this year. But Harbottle says that for a fee of 10,000 it provided very narrow advice in a letter on whether the News of the World's royal editor Clive Goodman, who was dismissed after being found guilty of phone hacking, could make credible allegations in an employment tribunal that phone hacking was widespread at the now closed Sunday tabloid. As The Lede noted last month, in a post that contained the full text of the letter Harbottle & Lewis provided to News International in 2007, it seems clear now that the law firm was instructed to look through the e-mail correspondence only for evidence that Mr. Goodman's superiors knew about the phone hacking that informed his articles, or that others at the paper were doing also using the technique. Harbottle & Lewis was not, apparently, asked to look for evidence of other kinds of illegal activity, like payments to the police, or given access to e-mails sent by other reporters at the paper, like one that contained a transcript of 35 hacked voice mail messages.

News Corp. Starts Compensation Process for Phone Hacking Claims,"News Corporation has begun a voluntary program that allows people who believe they have been the victims of phone hacking to apply online for compensation.  A statement issued Fridayby the company's British publishing unit, News International, urged possible  victims to take advantage , calling it a ""speedy, cost-effective alternative to litigation.'' Charles Gray, a former High Court judge and arbitration specialist, will assess the applications and serve as an independent adjudicator, News International said. There is no limit on how much the company might have to pay.  ""It should provide very significant benefits to applicants such as avoiding the enormous expenses of court proceedings,"" Mr. Gray said in the statement. As an incentive to participate, News Corporation is offering possible victims a premium of 10 percent on whatever Mr. Gray chooses to award. The company also said it would pay applicants' legal costs and ensure confidentiality. The London police have said that the number of British citizens whose phones may have been hacked by reporters at the now-shuttered News of the World tabloid could reach as many as 5,795. On Wednesday, Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer, said the company had ""fully reserved"" funds to pay for litigation related to hacking. Last month Rupert Murdoch, the company's chairman and chief executive, said that he would personally donate $1.6 million to charities chosen by the family of Milly Dowler, the murdered British teenager whose phone was hacked by the News Corporation tabloid. Additionally, the company said it would pay $3.2 million to the Dowler family. The company first announced that it planned to offer a compensation program in April, a result of the 2006 arrest of a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who was hired by News of the World and who admitted to intercepting voice mails.  In June, News International confirmed that Mr. Gray would serve as an independent adjudicator, just before the phone-hacking scandal exploded in July. The program began accepting claims on Friday.    "
Murdoch-Owned Tabloid Had Lawyers Investigating Phone Hacking Followed,"The News of the World hired a detective to spy on two lawyers representing victims in the News Corporation's phone-hacking scandal, and the lawyers' families, Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper group confirmed Monday. The detective, Derek Webb, told the BBC that he was commissioned in 2010 to follow Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris, two lawyers representing multiple clients who alleged that The News of the World had illegally intercepted their voice mail messages.  Mr. Lewis and Ms. Harris had been instrumental in exposing the scandal by pursuing the first two legal cases in 2008. The newspaper paid significant damages, and the cases opened the door to further lawsuits and a new criminal investigation. The Metropolitan Police said last week that the number of possible phone-hacking victims currently stands at 5,795.   The aim of the surveillance, the BBC reported, citing internal News of the World documents, was to demonstrate that Mr. Lewis and Ms. Harris were involved in a romantic relationship and that they might be sharing confidential information. They might then be compelled, said a News of the World lawyer in an e-mail quoted by the BBC, to recuse themselves from further hacking cases. The surveillance was discussed, the BBC also reported, without specific names, ""at a very high level.""  The spying included the lawyers' families. Mr. Lewis's former wife and teenaged daughter were watched, Mr. Webb said.   Citing surveillance reports, Nick Davies of The Guardian reported that Ms. Harris and her two young children also appear to have been followed. The British newspaper division of News Corporation said in a statement: News International's inquiries have led the company to believe that Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris were subject to surveillance. While surveillance is not illegal, it was clearly deeply inappropriate in these circumstances. This action was not condoned by any current executive at the company Mr. Lewis described the surveillance of his daughter as ""nothing short of sick."" Tom Watson, a British lawmaker who has been prominent in parliamentary investigations of phone hacking, said Monday that the revelation ""shows an utterly relentless and ruthless organization"" that would ""stop at nothing."" The surveillance has increased pressure on Mr. Murdoch's son James, the head of his father's European and Asian operations, who oversaw The News of the World during the period in question. Mr. Murdoch has long denied any wrongdoing, but is scheduled to face members of Parliament -- including Mr. Watson -- on Thursday to answer further questions on whether, and when, he knew of a widespread culture of illegality at the newspaper. The tabloid was closed this summer in response to the scandal, and 16 of its former employees have been arrested in connection with allegations of phone hacking and paying police officers for information. At a previous parliamentary hearing, News International's legal manager, Tom Crone, admitted that he had seen a dossier on Mr. Lewis and Ms. Harris compiled by what he described as a ""freelance journalist."" The material involved ""their private lives"" he told lawmakers, but he declined to go into specifics, citing an ongoing police investigation.    "
Judge to Release Summary of Detective's Notes in British Phone-Hacking Scandal,"Rupert Murdoch's son James, the deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, will most likely face tough questions at a hearing by a British parliamentary committee on Thursday over his role in the phone-hacking scandal at The News of the World tabloid, as my colleagues Sarah Lyall and Don Van Natta Jr. reported, and a ruling by a judge released on Tuesday could add to the pressure. Sir Brian Leveson, the judge presiding over a public inquiry into the allegations that the tabloid illegally gained access to the voice mail messages of about 5,800 people, released a seemingly technical document, titled ""Approach to Evidence,"" outlining how the inquiry would seek evidence in the midst of three ongoing police investigations. On page 15 of the 17-page document, the judge wrote that he would release a detailed summary of the notebooks of Glenn Mulcaire, the private detective who went to prison over his role in the phone hacking.  The notebooks, reportedly running to 11,000 pages, provide a meticulous record of the phones Mr. Mulcaire is accused of hacking, complete with names, dates and places. The list also identifies, crucially, the News of the World staff members who commissioned him. The summary of the notebooks might finally show the full extent of the practice, which Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper company, News International, insisted for many years was the work of one ""rogue reporter."" Though many details will be removed, the names of the tabloid's staff members will be replaced with a color code that denotes seniority. And the judge also asked the police to provide him with the full extent of the hacking activities, including ""the first and last known occasions"" on which it took place. The relevant paragraph is below, followed by the full document: The notebook belonging to Mr. Mulcaire, which has formed an important part of the police investigation, will be summarized so that its true significance and extent may be understood. The personal data of those who are listed in the journal as targets or potential targets shall not be included, although names already in the public domain or where consent has been forthcoming may be.  The name of any journalist linked with any entry (so called 'corner names') shall also be anonymized or given a cipher although, again, each coded name will be placed in a band that identifies their comparative seniority but in such terms that do not permit of further identification. The Inquiry will be given the names of those to whom ciphers have been attached but I shall similarly direct under s. 19(2) of the 2005 Act that this information shall not be disclosed or published until the conclusion of any criminal trial.  Although I appreciate that the investigation is ongoing, I would also be grateful if the police could identify the extent of the operation that involved the interception or potential interception of phone messages along with the present evidence of the first and last known occasions on which activity in furtherance of interception took place.

"As Online Communications Stymie Wiretaps, Lawmakers Debate Solutions","WASHINGTON -- Leading Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday reacted skeptically to the idea of overhauling surveillance laws to make it easier to wiretap people who communicate online rather than by telephone, a major priority for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The lawmakers expressed their concerns at a House hearing devoted to a problem that law enforcement officials call ''going dark'' -- investigators' inability to carry out court-approved wiretap orders when the people who are the targets communicate using services that lack a surveillance capability.  The F.B.I. has been quietly laying the groundwork for years for a push to require Internet-based communications services -- like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, BlackBerry and Skype -- to design their systems with a built-in way to comply with wiretap orders. On Thursday, the bureau made its first full airing of the ''going dark'' problem. ''Due to the revolutionary expansion of communications technology in recent years, the government finds that it is rapidly losing ground in its ability to execute court orders with respect to Internet-based communications,'' said the F.B.I.'s general counsel, Valerie Caproni. A 1994 law requires phone companies to build their networks with the capability of immediately starting to intercept a user's communications when the company is presented with a wiretap order. But that law does not cover Internet-based communication providers. As a result, while they, too, are subject to court wiretap orders, they are often unable to comply, for technical reasons, when presented with one. Ms. Caproni stopped short of making any specific legislative proposal, saying that the Obama administration was still debating the issue internally. Last fall, The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials were developing a bill that would impose new regulations on Internet communications companies and phone and broadband carriers, making them easier to wiretap. ''We don't have a specific request yet,'' Ms. Caproni said. ''The administration does not yet have a proposal. It is something that is actively being discussed within the administration, and I am optimistic that we will have a proposal in the near future.'' Still, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, was one of several lawmakers who said he was likely to greet such a proposal with skepticism. Forcing Internet communications services to build in ''back doors'' for law enforcement surveillance, he said, would hamper innovation and create vulnerabilities for hackers and foreign governments to exploit. ''Requiring back doors in all communications systems by law runs counter to how the Internet works and may make it impossible for some companies to offer their services,'' Mr. Conyers said. Several lawmakers of both parties raised concerns about how such a mandate would affect the competitiveness of Internet companies that operate in the United States. Still, several Republicans suggested sympathy with law enforcement officials' fear that changing technology could hamper their ability to investigate criminals and terrorists. Ms. Caproni emphasized that the F.B.I. was not seeking new surveillance powers, but rather a way to keep its existing powers from eroding. She also said the F.B.I. was not seeking a decryption key that would allow the government to directly intercept and unscramble secure communications. Rather, she said, the bureau hoped to require communication service providers to deploy, within their own systems, a wiretapping capability. The provider would have to be able to isolate, intercept and deliver to the government a particular user's communications in response to a wiretap order. Susan Landau, a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study fellow and former Sun Microsystems engineer, argued against building interception systems within a service, citing high-profile cases in which hackers exploited such mechanisms in Greece and Italy to illegally spy on politicians and other prominent people. Ms. Caproni spoke with caution about several aspects of the F.B.I.'s broad goals that have attracted controversy. For example, law enforcement officials have said in the past that all companies that facilitate communications should be able to provide a plain-text version of messages in response to a wiretap order. Such a mandate could require major changes for companies like Research in Motion, whose BlackBerry Enterprise Server system relays encrypted messages that the company says it cannot unscramble. Last year, Research in Motion came into conflict with several governments, including in India and the United Arab Emirates, over their inability to conduct surveillance of messages sent via its encrypted service. Asked about encryption, Ms. Caproni said that if a provider encrypted communications but had the ability to decrypt them, then it should be required to give law enforcement unscrambled versions. And she said that if an individual encrypted his own communications, investigators would have to find some other way to monitor that person. But crucially, she did not directly address whether a service provider should be allowed to encrypt a user's communications in such a way that the provider is unable to unscramble them -- even if a court orders it to do so. The hearing came a day after the release of several hundred pages of internal F.B.I. documents showing that the bureau has been working with great urgency to push to change legislation for years. The documents were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet freedom advocacy group. The documents shed new light on how the F.B.I.'s interest in the ''going dark'' problem predates the Obama administration. The bureau commissioned a study from the RAND Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton several years ago, and it conducted surveys of law enforcement officials seeking examples of encountering obstacles to carrying out wiretap orders. One such document redacted a legislative proposal for the ''going dark'' surveillance issue. But beneath it, a related proposal was left uncensored: electronic communications service providers, it said, should be required ''to retain for two years records showing the origination and termination of communications.'' Currently, law enforcement agencies are able to obtain such records only if the provider has chosen to preserve them for its own purposes, like billing.  "
LulzSec Hackers Make Enemies Online,"Lulz Security, the hacking group that has been on a spree lately,  might think its antics are hilarious. But some others in the hacker world are sick of its games.  After six weeks of attacks - and hundreds of sarcastic Twitter posts - a number of people, offended by the exposure of innocent Internet users' personal information and irritated by the bravado, are working to stop LulzSec by investigating and revealing its members' identities to the world, and especially to the F.B.I.  On Friday, The Guardian reported that a disaffected former associate known only as m_nerva had leaked logs of conversations that LulzSec's members had among themselves in online chat rooms.  The logs cover a period from May 31 to June 4,  which covers the LulzSec hacks on Sony and P.B.S. Under the apparent leadership of one of the hackers, known only as Sabu, between six and eight group members discuss media coverage of their deeds and rail against a rival hacker, called The Jester, who has been publishing what he says are leaks about LulzSec on his Web site. The Jester is known as a defender of the United States military and an opponent of WikiLeaks and radical Muslim groups, which he has hit with crippling amounts of traffic in what are known as denial-of-service attacks.  After LulzSec hacked a company affiliated with the F.B.I. on June 3, the logs reveal that two members quit, fearing reprisals from the authorities. The two were ""not up for the heat"", Sabu typed. He added: ""You realise we smacked the FBI today. This means everyone in here must remain extremely secure."" In a Twitter post directed toward m_nerva on Tuesday, LulzSec promised reprisals for the leak of the logs. ""Remember this tweet,"" it said, ""for I know you'll read it: your cold jail cell will be haunted with our endless laughter. Game over, child.""  But it seems that another group, calling itself Web Ninjas, has been revealing personal tidbits and photos of what it says are LulzSec members on its blog, LulzSec Exposed.  It has also posted a chat transcript which seems to be the same one obtained by The Guardian.  ""Web ninjas decided to give them a taste of their own LULZ and we have shown them that they are not the 'Internet Gods' they think they are. 'Web Ninjas' does and will stop Lulzsec,"" it wrote. ""We are here to stand for HACK VICTIMS."" And a group called Backtrace Security says it has been hunting the people behind LulzSec since February. Citing the dangers of its continuing tussle with LulzSec, Backtrace declined to disclose its principals' identities. But one who uses the handle Asherah said he and his colleagues published the LulzSec members' nicknames and, in some cases, real names online in February, and have been assisting the F.B.I. since March. As LulzSec's hacking activity - and Twitter publicity machine - heated up, they moved on June 7 to publicize the names on Twitter, apparently setting off a kind of hacker civil war. ""They were rampaging, and clearly not willing to stop,"" Asherah said. ""Despite the rumors, they're not very accomplished hackers. They're attention-drunk."" LulzSec claims to hack for the ""lulz,"" or fun of it, unlike their more political cousins Anonymous, a nebulous and large movement. ""That doesn't mean politics don't enter, that means it enters when it's lulzy, when it's hilarious,"" said Gabriella Coleman, an assistant professor at New York University who studies Anonymous. ""The lulz matters in Anonymous, but the political wings are really political, and they have to keep the lulz tamed."" Though separate, several days ago the two entities declared a joint cyberwar against governments and security companies called Operation Anti-Security. But it is not clear whether LulzSec can fight wars on multiple online fronts and continue to strike such visible targets while others try to bring it down.  "
"Amid Claims of More Captured Drones, a Report on Their Vulnerability","After flaunting its capture of a sophisticated American spy drone on national television last week, Iran is said to be planning to invite local reporters and foreign diplomats to an even more spectacular display of pilotless hardware in the near future. The Tehran Times, an English-language newspaper supported by Iran's government, reported the impending ""exhibition"" of seven drones, three from the United States and four from Israel, along with the electronic equipment that is said to have been used to bring them down. The report, from a single anonymous source, was originally published online on Wednesday but  was picked up on Thursday by the semiofficial Mehr News Agency, indicating that at the very least there is interest in Tehran in spreading the news more widely.   Iran has frequently accused the United States and Israel of running covert programs to spy on Iran and sabotage its nuclear facilities.   The paper said each of the drones had violated the country's airspace, and while it did not elaborate on how or when the drones had fallen into Iranian possession, it did include quotes from a January interview with an Iranian military commander who asserted that at least two ""highly advanced spy planes"" had been ""shot down"" by Iran. If a public display of multiple American and Israeli drones occurs, it would be the first confirmation of such Iranian assertions before the most recent capture of an advanced American RQ-170 drone in eastern Iran, which was announced last week.   American officials dismissed the notion that more drones were held by Iran.  ""One would wonder if Iran has drones why they haven't trotted them out before now,"" said one United States official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject. The official added that the Iranian government appeared to be ""in full propaganda blast mode right now."" It still remains unclear how the RQ-170, one of the American military's most sophisticated spy drones, came into the possession of the Iranian military, let alone how several more could have ended up there.  The Iranian military has said it had staged a cyberattack against the RQ-170 that enabled it to guide the remotely piloted aircraft to a safe landing. Footage shown on Iranian television last week of what appeared to be an intact stealth drone, though discoloration along one of the wings indicated possible damage and repair work.  Another possible explanation is simple malfunction.  But an Air Force report that surfaced online this week points to deficiencies in the communication network that could put drones at greater risk in hostile areas.  Dated April 2011, the report from the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board was published on Tuesday by Public Intelligence, a whistle-blower Web site that describes itself as a ""repository of information in the public interest"" and allows for the anonymous disclosure of documents.   ""We did receive the report last week approximately one to two days after Iran said it had the RQ-170,"" said Michael Haynes, the site's administrator. The timing of the disclosure interested the cybersecurity analyst Jeffrey Carr. ""Clearly someone with FOUO access wanted this information to be made public to inform the controversy surrounding the incident,"" he wrote on his blog on Thursday, using the acronym for the report's classification as ""for official use only."" He said the report outlines drone vulnerabilities that should be taken seriously: With this report as background, the capture of the RQ-170 by Iranian forces needs to be evaluated fairly and not dismissed as some kind of Iranian scam for reasons that have more to do with embarrassment than a rational assessment of the facts.  Among the key findings of the drily written report, entitled ""Operating Next-Generation Remotely Piloted Aircraft for Irregular Warfare,"" is that American drones -- also called remotely piloted aircraft or RPAs -- are hampered by their communications systems: Limited communications systems result in communications latency, link vulnerabilities, and lost-link events, which limits mission roles assigned to RPAs, operational flexibility, and resiliency in the face of unanticipated events. The report, a full version of which is included at the bottom of this post, lists several ways in which drones can come under attacks targeting their communications: There is a wide range of methods that a determined adversary can use for attacking RPA guidance and navigation systems. The report mentions here only three categories of threats without going into the details:      - Small, simple GPS noise jammers can be easily constructed and employed by an unsophisticated adversary and would be effective over a limited RPA operating area.      - GPS repeaters are also available for corrupting navigation capabilities of RPAs.      - Cyber threats represent a major challenge for future RPA operations. Cyber attacks can affect both on-board and ground systems, and exploits may range from asymmetric CNO attacks to highly sophisticated electronic systems and software attacks. The report also found that the ""spoofing or hijacking"" of communication links could also lead to ""platform loss"" -- i.e., a missing drone. An Iranian engineer said to be involved in working on the captured RQ-170 told The Christian Science Monitor on Thursday that it had been just those sorts of weaknesses in the communication network that allowed Iran to get the drone: ""The GPS navigation is the weakest point,"" the Iranian engineer told The Monitor, giving the most detailed description yet published of Iran's ""electronic ambush"" of the highly classified US drone. ""By putting noise [jamming] on the communications, you force the bird into autopilot. This is where the bird loses its brain."" The ""spoofing"" technique that the Iranians used - which took into account precise landing altitudes, as well as latitudinal and longitudinal data - made the drone ""land on its own where we wanted it to, without having to crack the remote-control signals and communications"" from the US control center, says the engineer.   "
Hackers Shut Down Government Sites,"The online group Anonymous said Wednesday that it had paralyzed the Egyptian government's Web sites in support of the antigovernment protests. Anonymous, a loosely defined group of hackers from all over the world, gathered about 500 supporters in online forums and used software tools to bring down the sites of the Ministry of Information and President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party, said Gregg Housh, a member of the group who disavows any illegal activity himself. The sites were unavailable Wednesday afternoon.  The attacks, Mr. Housh said, are part of a wider campaign that Anonymous has mounted in support of the antigovernment protests that have roiled the Arab world. Last month, the group shut down the Web sites of the Tunisian government and stock exchange in support of the uprising that forced the country's dictator, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, to flee. Mr. Housh said that the group had used its technical knowledge to help protesters in Egypt defy a government shutdown of the Internet that began last week. ''We want freedom,'' he said of the group's motivation. ''It's as simple as that. We're sick of oppressive governments encroaching on people.'' Anonymous also mounted strikes late last year, characterized by some of its supporters as a ''cyberwar,'' against companies like MasterCard, Visa and PayPal that had refused to process donations to the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks. The F.B.I. said last week that it had executed 40 search warrants ''throughout the United States'' in connection with that campaign. The strikes by Anonymous, known as ''distributed denial of service'' attacks, could lead to criminal charges that carry 10-year prison sentences, the F.B.I. said. Arrests have been made and equipment seized in Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and France, according to British and American officials. They declined to provide further details. Barrett Brown, who is helping to organize a legal defense for those who might be prosecuted, said further raids were expected. Mr. Housh said ''these arrests aren't going to have any effect.'' Just hours after the raids, he said, about 600 people, including many who had been arrested and then released, were back online and coordinating efforts in Egypt.  "
Why It's Not Easy to Freeze Your Child's Credit File,"In her job as an analyst specializing in the retail banking world, Julie McNelley talks to a lot of bank executives. Recently, she says, she has heard concerns about child identity theft involving the use of a minor's Social Security number to commit financial fraud. How serious a risk is child identity fraud?  The Federal Trade Commissionrecently cited a report from ID Analytics, an identity-theft prevention firm, estimating that 140,000 minors may be at risk each year. (For perspective, there are 73 million Americans under age 18, according to the latest Census.) Sometimes the perpetrator isn't a stranger but a strapped family member in need of fresh credit. A report this springfrom CyLab, a research center at Carnegie Mellon University, said an analysis of 43,000 children registered with a commercial identity protection service found that 10 percent of them had someone else using their Social Security number. But the statistical significance of the finding in the general population is undetermined, the report said. Still, child identity theft can be particularly insidious because it may go undiscovered for years, until the child grows up and applies for credit. So Ms. McNelley, who is also a parent, decided to take the initiative and seek a security freeze in her young son's name at the three major credit-reporting bureaus. (My colleague Ron Lieber wrote about credit freezesin a recent column.) She doesn't have reason to believe his information is being misused, she said. ""I'm choosing to err on the side of caution."" But Ms. McNelley, who blogged about her effort, found that she had trouble accomplishing her mission. In fact, according to the three major credit bureaus, it's not really an option, unless a child is already a victim. A security freeze is a tool that can be used to shut access to an existing credit file, said Rod Griffin, director of public education for Experian, one of the major bureaus.  Most children don't have credit files - or at least, they shouldn't. (The main exception is if a parent has added a teenager, say, as a cardholder on a credit card account; that may establish a file.) Generally, a file is created the first time an application is received for credit. So if a child's Social Security number hasn't been used on a credit application, there should be no file. And ""if there isn't one,"" Mr. Griffin said, ""there's nothing to freeze."" Spokesmen for TransUnion and Equifax gave similar responses to a question about whether parents could freeze access to a child's Social Security number. A security freeze, the TransUnion spokesman noted in an e-mail, ""applies to a credit file, not a SSN."" So rather than starting out by asking for a freeze, parents may want to step back and consider if they have reason to suspect that their child's information may be at risk. Gabby Beltran, a spokeswoman for Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit group, said it recommends that parents initiate an inquiry with the credit bureaus only if they suspect a problem. (Repeated inquiries, she says, may inadvertently create a semblance of a credit record, which is what you are trying to avoid.) Warning signals may include getting preapproved credit offers in your child's name in the mail (although that can sometimes happen if you open a savings account in your child's name, so you shouldn't panic if that happens), or calls from collection agencies about accounts in your child's name that you don't know about. If you are worried, you can find information from Experianand Transunionon their Web sites about how to check if there is a credit file in your child's name. (An Equifax spokesman said parents could contact the bureau regarding a minor child's credit file at the following address:Equifax Inc., In care of minor child, P.O. Box 105139, Atlanta, Ga. 30348. The letter must state the child's Social Security number and include a copy of the child's birth certificate as well as the parent's driver's license or other identification.) Generally, when contacting the bureaus, you must send documentation via Postal Service mail to prove you are the parent or guardian of the child in question. (The Identity Theft Resource Center offers sample letters to send.) If there's no file, there's probably no problem. If there is a file, the bureau will send it to you. If you see evidence of fraud, you can request a fraud alert to flag potential creditors of the problem and take steps to correct the record. Mr. Griffin says Experian will agree to a freeze or fraud alert if there is a report and will work with the parent to remove fraudulent accounts. There are commercial services that offer to monitor your, or your child's, Social Security number for potential misuse. A unit of Experian, for instance, offers the service for about $20 a month. Consultants say it makes sense to take care with your child's Social Security number. You must provide it if establishing certain financial accounts, but it's not usually mandatory in other cases. If it's requested at your pediatrician's office, or to register for school or for child athletic activities, ask why it's being sought, how it's used and how the information will be protected if you provide it. Ms. McNelley says she never provides her child's Social Security number at a doctor's office, and she has never been questioned about leaving that space blank on a form. She says she is waiting for a response to her written requests for a credit freeze for her son and will update her blog when she hears. Have you ever suspected misuse of your child's Social Security number? What steps did you take?  "
California Creates Special Unit to Fight Computer Crimes,"California has long led the nation in technological innovation. A lesser-known fact: It also leads the country in cybercrime. The state has the most identity theft complaints and the third-highest number per capita, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Over a million Californians are victims of identity theft every year. Taken together, the F.T.C. estimates that their losses exceeded $46 million last year. The state is now accelerating its crusade against cybercriminals. On Tuesday, Kamala D. Harris, California's attorney general, announced the creation of the nation's largest e-crime unit, a group of 20 investigators and prosecutors whose sole mission will be to thwart and prosecute cybercrimes like identity theft, Internet scams, computer theft, online child pornography and intellectual property theft across the state. The unit, formed in August, has already filed 20 criminal cases and is investigating an additional 24 cases. California joins Texas, Florida and Louisiana, which also have cybercrime units, though California's scope and mandate will be much broader. Texas's and Florida's cybercrime units focus almost exclusively on online child pornography. Louisiana's unit, which is broader in scope, is a three-person team: an investigator, a prosecutor and a forensics specialist. Until now, cybercrimes in California were typically prosecuted at the local level -making any effort to prosecute multijurisdictional crimes difficult. Take the case of George Bronk, a Sacramento-area man, who was sentenced to four years in prison in July for hacking into the e-mail and Facebook accounts of women and blackmailing them with indecent pictures and videos. His victims spanned at least 17 states. Initial attempts to report the blackmail to local law enforcement often proved futile because it could not be tied to any one jurisdiction. ""The unique aspect of technology is that it knows no jurisdictional boundary,"" Ms. Harris, said in an interview Tuesday. ""We want to ensure Internet crimes don't drop off simply because it wasn't clear for local law enforcement, or the consumer, where to go because an incident occurred in the cloud.""   "
Tabloid Tactics: A Former Editor Proudly Tells All,"LONDON -- He admitted that he and his colleagues hacked into people's phones and paid police officers for tips. He confessed to lurking in unmarked vans outside people's houses, stealing confidential documents, rifling through celebrity garbage cans and pretending that he was not a journalist pursuing a story but ''Brad the teenage rent boy,'' propositioning a priest. After Paul McMullan, a former deputy features editor at Rupert Murdoch's now-defunct News of the World tabloid, had finished his jaw-droppingly brazen remarks at a judicial inquiry on Tuesday, it was hard to think of any dubious news-gathering technique he had not confessed to, short of pistol-whipping sources for information. Nor were the practices he described limited to a select few, Mr. McMullan said in an afternoon of testimony at the Leveson Inquiry, which is investigating media ethics in Britain the wake of the summer's phone hacking scandal. On the contrary, he said, The News of the World's underlings were encouraged by their circulation-obsessed bosses to use any means necessary to get material.  ''We did all these things for our editors, for Rebekah Brooks and for Andy Coulson,'' Mr. McMullan said, referring to two former News of the World editors who, he said, ''should have had the strength of conviction to say, 'Yes, sometimes you have to stray into black or gray illegal areas.' '' He added: ''They should have been the heroes of journalism, but they aren't. They are the scum of journalism for trying to drop me and my colleagues in it.'' Mr. Coulson, who resigned from his job as chief spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron in January, and Mrs. Brooks, who resigned in July from her job as chief executive of News International, the British newspaper arm of the Murdoch empire, have both been arrested on suspicion of phone hacking, or illegally intercepting voice mail messages. Mrs. Brooks, whom Mr. McMullan called ''the archcriminal,'' is also suspected of making illegal payments to the police. Both have repeatedly denied the allegations, and neither has yet been charged. Nothing that Mr. McMullan said was particularly surprising; anyone following the phone hacking scandal that engulfed News International and its parent, the News Corporation, over the summer is now more than familiar with outrageous tales of tabloid malfeasance. What was startling was that Mr. McMullan, who left his job in 2001, eagerly confessed to so much and on such a scale -- no one else has done it quite this way -- and that he maintained that none of it was wrong. Most people from the tabloid world have reacted to the revelations in the manner of Renault when discussing gambling in ''Casablanca,'' saying they are ''shocked, shocked.'' But Mr. McMullan veered so far in the other direction that at times he sounded like a satirist's rendition of an amoral tabloid hack. Underhanded reporting techniques are not shocking at all, he said, particularly in light of how often he and his colleagues risked their lives in search of the truth. As examples of the dangers of his job, he described having cocaine-laced marijuana forced on him by knife-wielding drug dealers in a sting operation; being attacked by a crowd of murderous asylum seekers; and, in his ''Brad the teenage rent boy'' guise, sprinting through a convent dressed only in underpants to escape the pedophile priest he had successfully entrapped. ''Phone hacking is a perfectly acceptable tool, given the sacrifices we make, if all we're trying to do is get to the truth,'' Mr. McMullan said, asking whether ''we really want to live in a world where the only people who can do the hacking are MI5 and MI6.'' No, he said, we do not. ''For a brief period of about 20 years, we have actually lived in a free society where we can hack back,'' he said. Journalists in Britain have traditionally justified shady practices by arguing that they are in ''the public interest.'' Asked by an inquiry lawyer how he would define that, Mr. McMullan said that the public interest is what the public is interested in. ''I think the public is clever enough to decide the ethics of what it wants in its own newspapers,'' he said. Referring to articles about Charlotte Church, a singer who told the inquiry this week of her distress at her family's treatment by the tabloids, he said, ''If they don't like what you have written about Charlotte Church's father having a three-in-a-bed with cocaine, then they won't read it.'' For all that, Mr. McMullan said that The News of the World had come to rely too much on outsiders to do work that could have easily been done by reporters, like conducting surveillance on potentially adulterous athletes. Also, he said, some of the investigators were incompetent. The year he became deputy features editor, he said, the department had a budget of $: 3.1 million -- more than $4.5 million -- to pay sources, buy stories and hire outsiders to find addresses, medical records and other information. ''That was the joy of working for Murdoch,'' he said. ''They had that big pot of money.'' Mr. McMullan, who now owns a pub and does occasional freelance work, spoke nostalgically of his tabloid career, seven years of it spent at The News of the World. He loved spiriting exclusive sources away ''and hiding them from other journalists,'' he said, as when he ''spent two weeks locked in a hotel room with Princess Diana's gym instructor in Amsterdam.'' He also liked jumping in one of The News of the World's stable of 12 cars and speeding away in pursuit of famous targets. ''I absolutely loved giving chase to celebrities,'' he said. ''How many jobs can you have car chases in? Before Diana died, it was such good fun.'' (Some celebrities liked it, too, he said. Brad Pitt ''had a very positive attitude'' about being pursued by crazed journalists in cars.) Mr. McMullan had brought along some illustrative materials, including a photograph of his surveillance van. He also briefly displayed a topless photograph of Carla Bruni-Sarkozy in The News of the World, apparently as a way to show how easy it is to obtain racy photographs. ''That's the president of France's wife,'' he said. ''It's a little early in the day for that, Mr. McMullan,'' the inquiry lawyer said. Many witnesses at the Leveson Inquiry, especially victims of the tabloids, have called for a law to protect citizens from news media intrusion. Mr. McMullan said he thought that privacy was ''evil,'' in that it helps criminals cover up their misdeeds. Using a Britishism for ''pedophile,'' he said, ''Privacy is for pedos.''  "
Citi Says Many More Customers Had Data Stolen by Hackers,"The Citigroup credit card data breach exposed the private financial data of more than 360,000 customer accounts, about 80 percent more than it reported last week, according to a statement the bank released late Wednesday night.  Previously, Citigroup said that more than 200,000 cardholders, or about 1 percent of its 21 million North American cardholders, were affected. The new revelations come as the bank was forced to respond to Connecticut's attorney general and several other state regulators who have opened inquiries into the breach. They join federal authorities, including the Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who have been conducting investigations into how the bank was attacked. On Thursday morning, Sean Kevelighan, a Citigroup spokesman, said that the figures were always rough estimates and the discrepancy could be attributed to an increase in its credit card accounts and other factors. Citigroup now has about 23 million credit card accounts, up from 21 million accounts at the end of 2010, the last publicly reported figure. In the statement, Citigroup also pinpointed May 10 as the date when it discovered the breach, and it said that it had immediately rectified the problem and begun an internal investigation. By May 24, bank officials concluded that the data thieves had captured the names, account numbers, and e-mail addresses of about 360,000 customer accounts. Social Security numbers, expiration dates, and the three-digit security password found on the back of the card were not exposed -- a finding that security experts have said would make it hard for the thieves to commit fraud. As of May 24, the bank began preparing to replace about 218,000 cardholder accounts and to prepare notification letters to its customers. Those were mailed beginning June 3, but it waited to notify the public until June 9. Citigroup said it implemented ''enhanced procedures'' to prevent similar incidents from happening and also notified law enforcement and government officials. It did not indicate when they were contacted, however. In its statement, Citigroup reassured customers that they would not be held liable for fraudulent charges and could take advantage of free identity theft protection assistance, available via a phone number on the back of their credit card, if they believed they were a victim. The bank also encouraged its customers to review their account statements and report any suspicious activity. Citigroup, citing the continuing law enforcement investigation, provided no additional details about how their system was left vulnerable.  "
Fake Friends On Facebook,"Q.Facebook keeps sending me e-mail messages to notifying me of comments and photos posted to my wall, but the alerts are not coming to the e-mail account I use with Facebook. Is someone impersonating me?  A.Impersonation on Facebook is a possibility. But unless you clicked a confirmation link at one point to acknowledge you set up a Facebook account linked to that e-mail address, it is more likely that you are getting fraudulent Facebook messages. (If you received no confirmation message and someone is trying to use your address to set up a Facebook account, that account will only be active for a short time because Facebook deactivates unconfirmed accounts after three days.) The spoofed messages, which are intended to look exactly like Facebook's own notifications, often contain links to spam sites or malware that is activated when you click a link or an attachment. Some could also be phishing efforts to get you to type in your Facebook password so your account can be hijacked. Facebook has a fairly extensive list of scams and threats on its site, which can be found by clicking the Threats link at www.facebook.com/security. The page also has links to other resources, like how to report account abuse. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"In Planning Digital Defenses, the Biggest Obstacle Is Human Ingenuity","STEFAN SAVAGE, Computer science and engineering, University of California, San Diego Security is a curious concept, part perception and part prognostication. Webster's captures both sides of this dichotomy in its definition: ''freedom from danger; freedom from fear.'' Fear concerns a perceived threat; danger reflects what actually threatens us. We fear attacks that never come and live blissfully unaware of true dangers around the corner. This uncertainty is only intensified when our security concerns are transformed by changes in technology. Indeed, technology and its abuse evolve hand in hand. Just as the internal combustion engine begat highway accidents and auto theft, many of the most visible and transformative successes of computing technology -- e-mail, databases, e-commerce, the Web and so on -- have ushered in whole new classes of abuse.  But the evolution of computer security is not merely some dark mirror, passively reflecting advances in technology. While technology provides new opportunities for threats, these become true dangers only when there is a motivation to exploit them and a means to do so. Anticipating security threats is not merely a matter of reasoning abstractly about how new technology might raise new risks; it requires an understanding of human nature. Today, the evolution of computer abuse -- and therefore of computer security -- is driven by commerce. Botnets, spam, phishing, banking trojans, identity theft and so on are all commercially motivated enterprises perfected in a constant arms race with a well-financed computer security industry. As little as a decade ago, this ecosystem did not exist. The computer viruses and worms of the 20th century were joy riders, driven primarily by an ambition for notoriety. But once it became possible to make money from computer infection, whether through advertising (like spam) or theft (like stealing bank account credentials), this economic engine fed a bloom in online crime that we are still experiencing. Such economically motivated attacks are unlikely to disappear, and we can expect new threats to directly reflect each new technical innovation in how money is used, moved and stored. Emerging cellphone-based payment systems, automated banking transfers and the increasingly liquid markets for online goods in multiplayer games will all be ripe targets for online crooks. While criminal profit-seeking is perhaps the largest force transforming the computer security landscape today, it is by no means the only one. Another is the large-scale collection and use of personal data. As we leave ever more detailed online footprints -- via purchasing, browsing and social relationships -- a vast ''big data'' ecosystem has emerged to collect, process and resell this information. Concerns about this issue are typically framed in terms of privacy: How much do I want others to know about me? How might it affect my ability to get health insurance, employment or credit? While these are important questions, they do not capture the full extent of how this data might be used -- not just to extract information about people's desires and social relationships, but to use that understanding to affect their behavior. Nor would this be limited to the banal goal of getting you to purchase a particular product; it could be used for Internet-scale social monitoring and manipulation. The ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that computer technology is well suited to exploit. Advances in natural-language processing and data mining make it entirely feasible to mint millions of ''social bots,'' each establishing online friendships with their targets like virtual con men, each building trust over time and delivering personalized messages designed to elicit information, sway opinion or call to action. This idea, which one of my colleagues has called ''social architecture,'' completely upends traditional computer security concerns: The threat is not of humans controlling or monitoring our computers, but precisely the converse. Finally, there is growing potential for the abuse of computers as an instrument of war. The obvious issues involve espionage and information theft, but the real transformation is much broader. The Stuxnet worm, designed to sabotage gas centrifuges in Iran, made it clear that computer attacks can have physical, real-world consequences -- a particularly troubling precedent because computing capabilities are now embedded in virtually every aspect of our lives. The power we use, the water we drink, the cars, planes and trains we travel in, the elevators and air-conditioning in our buildings, even many of our children's toys -- all are controlled by computers. A parallel trend, fueled by cheap wireless connectivity, is that these devices are increasingly networked. And while few of these systems have been attacked in anger, it is this very fact that leads most of them to be rife with vulnerabilities -- a sheltered ecosystem with no immunity to attacks from an outside invader. Earlier this year, my colleagues and I demonstrated weaknesses that allowed us to remotely infiltrate, track and control popular automobiles more than 1,000 miles away. Other researchers have demonstrated remote attacks on implantable cardiac defibrillators, smart power meters, utility control networks and so on. The crucial question is whether these are merely Chicken Little fears or real dangers. And the answer will be a matter not of technology but of politics. Do conflicting powers believe that such attacks will advance their aims better than alternatives, that they are worth the effort to develop, that they are worth the risks of retaliation? There is a tendency to believe that computer security is different from other security. Maybe because computing is mechanistic and predictable, we like to think that security questions should succumb to some form of deterministic analysis. But security is at its heart a human issue. It is about conflict, and computers are merely a medium by which conflict can be expressed. The future of computer security, then, is less about the future of technology than it is about the future of human relations.  "
"Hackers From China Hit Gmail, Google Says"," SAN FRANCISCO -- Google said Wednesday that hundreds of users of Gmail, its e-mail service, had been the targets of clandestine attacks apparently originating in China that were aimed at stealing their passwords and monitoring their e-mail. In a blog post, the company said the victims included senior government officials in the United States, Chinese political activists, officials in several Asian countries, military personnel and journalists.  It is the second time Google has pointed to an area of China as the source of an Internet intrusion. Its latest announcement is likely to further ratchet up the tension between the company and Chinese authorities. Last year, Google said it had traced a sophisticated invasion of its computer systems to people based in China. The accusation led to a rupture of the company's relationship with China and a decision by Google not to cooperate with China's censorship demands. As a result, Google decided to base its Chinese search engine in Hong Kong. The more recent attacks were not as technically advanced, relying on a common technique known as phishing to trick users into handing over their passwords. But Google's announcement was unusual in that it put a spotlight on the scale, apparent origins and carefully selected targets of a coordinated campaign to hijack e-mail accounts. Google said that once the intruders had logged into the accounts, they could change settings for mail forwarding so that copies of messages would be sent to another address. The company said it had ''disrupted'' the campaign and had notified the victims as well as government agencies. Executives at Google declined to comment beyond the blog post. The company recommended that Gmail users take additional security steps, like using a Google service known as two-step verification, to make it more difficult to compromise their e-mail accounts. But it emphasized that the password thefts were not the result of a general security problem with Gmail. Google acknowledged that it had been alerted to the problem in part by Mila Parkour, a security researcher in Washington who posted evidence of a type of phishing attack on her blog in February. She documented examples of what has recently been described as a ''man-in-the-mailbox'' attack, in which the intruder uses the account of one victim and his e-mail contacts to gain the trust of a new victim. Ms. Parkour wrote that the method used in this attack ''is far from being new or sophisticated,'' but that she was posting information about it because of ''the particularly invasive approach of the attack.'' She highlighted a fake document titled ''Draft US-China Joint Statement'' that was circulated among people with e-mail accounts at the State Department, the Defense Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency and Gmail. Clicking to download the document directed users instead to a fake Gmail log-in page that captured their passwords. Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said the White House was looking into the matter. ''We have no reason to believe that any official U.S. government e-mail accounts were accessed,'' Ms. Hayden said in an e-mail. Google said the attacks apparently originated in Jinan, a provincial capital in eastern China. The city is a regional command center for the Chinese military, one of seven in the country. It is also home to the Lanxiang Vocational School, which was founded with military support. Last year, investigators looking into the attack on Google's systems said they had traced some of the hacking activityback to the school. At the time, government and school officials strongly denied any connection with the attack, and China's foreign ministry said linking the Chinese authorities to such attacks was ''baseless, highly irresponsible and hype with ulterior motives.'' That earlier attack appeared to be aimed at gathering information on human rights activists who were involved in political campaigns aimed at China. It was part of a wave of attacks that hit a range of American companies beginning in mid-2009 and that was first publicly disclosed by Google in January 2010. Chinese government media officials were not immediately available to comment on Google's latest announcement. Rafal Rohozinski, a network security specialist at the SecDev Group in Ottawa, said it was impossible to lay blame for the campaign on the Chinese government with any certainty. Because of the borderless nature of the Internet, it is easy for intruders to connect through a series of countries to mask their identities. ''The fact that someone is harvesting Gmail credentials is not surprising,'' Mr. Rohozinski said. This year, the Chinese government has stepped up its controls over the Internet within the country, with increased scrutiny of news and blog sites, particularly in the wake of political upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East. The government has also apparently crippled some virtual private network services, or VPNs, which have been used by Chinese and expatriates to gain access to corporate e-mail or get around controls that block many Web sites from being entered in China, like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Security specialists said the Google warning to users was an indication that efforts to place the responsibility for Internet security on individuals was failing. ''I think this is impossible to solve by going to one user at a time and trying to teach them how to behave on the Internet,'' said Nir Zuk, founder and chief technology officer of Palo Alto Networks. ''It doesn't matter how much education you put into it -- you will always have end users that will make a mistake.'' Online Correction: June 2, 2011, Thursday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the founder and chief technology officer of Palo Alto Networks. He is Nir Zuk, not Nir Zuck.  "
E-Mail Fraud Hides Behind Friendly Face,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Most people know to ignore the e-mail overture from a Nigerian prince offering riches in exchange for a bank account number. That is a scam, plain to the eye. But what if the e-mail appears to come from a colleague down the hall? And all he asks is that you add some personal information to a company database? This is spear phishing, a rapidly proliferating form of fraud that comes with a familiar face: messages that seem to be from co-workers, friends or family members, customized to trick you into letting your guard down online. And it has turned into a major problem, according to technology companies and computer security experts. On Wednesday, Google disclosed that it had discovered and disrupted an effort to use such pinpoint tactics to steal hundreds of Gmail passwords and monitor the accounts of prominent people, including senior government officials. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that the F.B.I. would investigate Google's assertion that the campaign originated in China.  Such tactics were also used in an attack on a company called RSA Security, which security experts say may have given hackers the tools to carry out a serious intrusion last month at Lockheed Martin, the world's largest military contractor. The security specialists say these efforts are a far cry from more standard phishing attempts, which involve spraying the Internet with millions of e-mails that appear to be from, say, Citibank in the hope of snaring a few unfortunate Citibank customers. Spear phishing entails sending highly targeted pitches that can look authentic because they appear to come from a trusted source and contain plausible messages. As such, the specialists say, the overtures are becoming very difficult for recipients to detect. ''It's a really nasty tactic because it's so personalized,'' said Bruce Schneier, the chief security technology officer of the British company BT Group. ''It's an e-mail from your mother saying she needs your Social Security number for the will she's doing.'' Mr. Schneier said the attacks are more like a traditional con game than a technically sophisticated intrusion. ''This is hacking the person,'' he said. ''It's not hacking the computer.'' Symantec, the computer security firm, said it intercepted around 85 targeted attacks a day in March, including efforts to steal personal information through phishing or with links to nefarious software that could ultimately expose corporate files. The only month with more attacks was March 2009, when there was a surge that coincided with a G20 summit meeting. Symantec said the most common targets were government agencies and senior managers and executives; the phishing of such big game is commonly referred to as ''whaling.'' Manufacturing firms were the targets of 15.9 percent of the attacks, compared with 8 percent for the financial sector and 6.1 percent for technology companies, Symantec said. Hackers taking aim at corporations are often seeking new product designs and may focus on engineers at a defense contractor, for example, to get data they can sell on the black market. Enrique Salem, Symantec's chief executive, gave the example of an e-mail sent to the head of a company that appears to be from the Internal Revenue Service. The message raises questions about the tax implications of an acquisition, and the chief executive passes the message to others inside the company. Someone opens the attachment, giving the attacker access to the company's internal network. ''It's about getting you to do something to compromise the system,'' Mr. Salem said. In the case of the Gmail attacks, Google said they appeared to originate from Jinan, China, and were aimed at users like Chinese political activists, military personnel, journalists and South Korean officials. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the government had no involvement in any such attacks, and that it ''consistently opposes any criminal activities that damage the Internet and computer networks including hacking, and cracks down on these activities according to law.'' It is not clear how the attackers obtained the Gmail addresses they used, although they could have been found inside other compromised accounts, including corporate or government accounts whose addresses are often easier to guess. The attackers may have hoped to find some work-related e-mail in their victims' personal Gmail accounts. Mila Parkour, an independent security researcher who helped alert Google to the attacks, said she was tipped off to the campaign when one of the victims let her examine some suspicious messages. That led her to discover a fake but convincing Gmail login screen that attackers used to dupe targets into submitting their passwords. She said the messages indicated that the phishing attempts had begun at least a year before she learned of them -- early in 2010. ''I thought it was interesting because they did it for so long,'' Ms. Parkour said. She said she also saw screens that mimicked the login pages for the Web portals of corporate e-mail systems. Companies and individuals can take steps to head off these attacks. For instance, Google encourages people to use a two-step process that sends a special code to their cellphone when they log into Gmail. The Defense Department asks its personnel to use a ''digital signature'' on their e-mails that verifies their identity. The momentum is on the side of the attackers, given that their forgeries can be realistic and thus irresistible, according to Lt. Col. Gregory Conti, a computer security expert at West Point. He said one reason the problem was getting harder to parry was that the people sending the messages use the Internet, specifically social networks like Facebook, to gather so much personal information about potential targets. ''What's 'wrong' with these e-mails is very, very subtle,'' he said, adding: ''They'll come in error-free, often using the appropriate jargon or acronyms for a given office or organization.'' The way to stop such efforts is not clear, Mr. Conti said: ''It's an open problem.'' Victims of spear phishing include people who oversee corporate security, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute, a research company in Traverse City, Mich., that focuses on data security. He gave the example of a security technology executive who received an e-mail from what appeared to be his employer's human resources department that asked for personal information to make a payment. Mr. Schneier of BT said he did not believe there was an easy and universal fix for the problem, any more than there was for car theft. He said the personal nature of the attacks makes them too seductive. ''Welcome to the world. You cannot stop it,'' he said. ''Live with it.''  "
Iran Is Said to Be Sheltering Atomic Fuel Program and Planning to Raise Production,"WASHINGTON -- Iran is moving its most critical nuclear fuel production to a heavily defended underground military facility outside the holy city of Qum, where it is less vulnerable to attack from the air and, the Iranians hope, the kind of cyberattack that crippled its nuclear program, according to intelligence officials. The head of Iran's atomic energy agency, Fereydoon Abbasi, spoke about the transfer in general terms on Monday to an official Iranian news service. He boasted that his country would produce the fuel in much larger quantities than it needs for a small research reactor in Tehran that produces medical isotopes.  The fact that Iran is declaring that its production will exceed its needs has reinforced the suspicions of many American and European intelligence officials that Iran plans to use the fuel to build weapons or to train Iranian scientists to produce bomb-grade fuel. Describing the new facilities in an interview with the news service, the Islamic Republic News Agency, Mr. Abbasi, who narrowly survived an assassination attempt last year, said that a 2009 proposal for the West to supply Iran with new fuel for the small research reactor, in return for an end to Iranian production of the fuel, is dead. ''We will no longer negotiate a fuel swap and a halt to our production of fuel,'' he said. ''The United States is not a safe country with which we can negotiate a fuel swap or any other issue.'' At the White House, Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said that the Iranian plan ''to install and operate centrifuges at Qum,'' in a facility whose existence President Obama and Europeans leaders made public two years ago, ''is a violation of their United Nations security obligations and another provocative act.'' Mr. Vietor noted that Iran has said that international inspectors ''will continue to have access to these centrifuges as part of its inspection activities in Iran,'' which would make it likely that any diversion of the fuel for weapons use could be detected. So far, Iran has allowed periodic visits by inspectors, but refused to provide information they demanded about the facility, or interviews of its personnel. A report updating the agency's findings in Iran was expected in the next few days. In interviews, current and former United States government officials provided new details of internal debates in recent years over how to deal with the Iranian nuclear program. Those discussions weighed the risks of a traditional covert attack on Iran's facilities versus a cyberattack. They laid the groundwork for what in 2009 and 2010 became the most successful effort thus far to slow Iran's nuclear ambitions -- the computer worm known as Stuxnet, which disabled about a fifth of country's working centrifuges and temporarily halted Iran's planned expansion of its capabilities. The officials involved in the discussions about Iran said the Bush White House asked the Central Intelligence Agency in the summer of 2008 to assess the feasibility of covert action to blow up or disable crucial elements of Iran's nuclear facilities. But when the agency delivered the plans, they were quickly rejected, all the officials said, for fear that any kind of obvious attack on the facilities could touch off another conflict in the Middle East just as a new American president was assuming office. The options were developed in part to assess whether a physical attack on the facilities would be significantly more effective than more subtle -- and deniable -- sabotage of the Iranian facilities, including cyberattacks. That presentation and subsequent discussions led to a detailed exploration of Iran's vulnerability to a sophisticated cyberattack. ''There were a range of options from the highly kinetic to the other end of the scale,'' one former official involved in the decision-making said, using the military's jargon for the use of physical force against a target. The officials who described the discussions would not speak of the specific operations under consideration, which remain classified, but said that the Obama transition team had been fully briefed on the possibilities. The New York Times reported in January that Stuxnet was primarily the work of the American and Israeli governments, and was the most successful example yet of a computer-based attack to destroy another nation's physical infrastructure. But neither the United States nor Israel has ever publicly discussed how the sophisticated computer worm came into existence, or who was responsible for releasing it. It is not clear whether Stuxnet had been written or tested by the time the Bush administration explored the computer-based options in late 2008. It hit Iran roughly one year into the Obama presidency. Experts disagree on exactly how much it set the Iranian program back; internal American intelligence assessments say it was delayed by one to two years, but some outside experts believe the interruption was briefer. The account of the Bush administration's deliberations came in interviews with four top former and current officials, all of whom were involved in the debate over how to stop, or at least slow, Iran's nuclear progress. None would speak on the record about an issue of such sensitivity, and they declined to discussed classified operations that the Bush or Obama administration had approved. Their revelation that the C.I.A. was asked to provide a range of options so late in Mr. Bush's presidency is an indication of how worried the administration was about leaving office with Iran's program still under way and relatively unimpeded. One senior official said that the C.I.A. ''laid out the art of the possible, and what the likely effects would be.'' Among those attending the meeting, that official said, were Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser. Senior officials in the Bush administration said that there was a broad consensus, which included President Bush himself, that hitting Iran's nuclear facilities was far too risky. Early in 2008, the officials said, the United States denied a request from Israel for equipment that might have helped mount an air attack. Vice President Dick Cheney was known to be a strong advocate of direct action against the facilities, either through covert means or by helping Israel build up its capability to strike. Mr. Cheney does not discuss the issue in his new memoir, published this week, other than to say that he favored an American military strike against Syria's nuclear reactor in 2007, partly as a warning to Iran.  "
From Bullets to Megabytes,"Richard A. Falkenrath, a principal of the Chertoff Group, an investment advisory firm, is a former deputy commissioner for counterterrorism for the New York Police Department and deputy homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush. STUXNET, the computer worm that last year disrupted many of the gas centrifuges central to Iran's nuclear program, is a powerful weapon in the new age of global information warfare. A sophisticated half-megabyte of computer code apparently accomplished what a half-decade of United Nations Security Council resolutions could not. This new form of warfare has several implications that are only now becoming apparent, and that will define the shape of what will likely become the next global arms race -- albeit one measured in computer code rather than firepower.  For one thing, the Stuxnet attack highlights the ambiguous boundaries of sovereignty in cyberspace. Promoting national security in the information age will, from time to time, cause unpredictable offense to the rights and interests of innocent people, companies and countries. Stuxnet attacked the Iranian nuclear program, but it did so by maliciously manipulating commercial software products sold globally by major Western companies. Whoever launched the assault also infected thousands of computers in several countries, including Australia, Britain, Indonesia and the United States. This kind of collateral damage to the global civilian realm is going to be the norm, not the exception, and advanced economies, which are more dependent on advanced information systems, will be at particular risk. What's more, offensive and defensive information warfare are tightly, insidiously coupled, which will significantly complicate military-industrial relations. The expertise needed to defend against a cyberattack is essentially indistinguishable from that needed to make such an attack. The Stuxnet programmers are reported to have exploited proprietary information that had been voluntarily provided to the American government by Siemens, that German company that makes data-and-control programs used in nuclear power facilities -- including Iran's. Siemens did this to help Washington build up its ability to fend off cyberattacks. Will Siemens and other companies think twice next time the American government calls? Probably. Whether it's true or not, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, the United States is now in the business of offensive information warfare, along with China, Israel and Russia, among others. It's not hard to imagine, then, the splintering of the global information technology industry into multiple camps according to their willingness to cooperate with governments on security matters. We can already see this happening in the telecommunications industry, where companies promote their products' resistance to government intrusion. At the same time, other companies might see an advantage to working closely with the government. Stuxnet also raises sticky and perhaps irresolvable legal questions. At present there is no real legal framework for adjudicating international cyberattacks; even if victims could determine who was responsible, their governments have few options outside of diplomatic complaints and, perhaps, retaliation in kind. An international entity that could legislate or enforce an information warfare armistice does not exist, and is not really conceivable. A similar question exists within the United States. Under American law the transmission of malicious code is in many cases a criminal offense. This makes sense, given the economy's reliance on information networks, the sensitivity of stored electronic data and the ever-present risk of attack from viruses, worms and other varieties of malware. But the president, as commander in chief, does have some authority to conduct offensive information warfare against foreign adversaries. However, as with many presidential powers to wage war and conduct espionage, the extent of his authority has never been enumerated. This legal ambiguity is problematic because such warfare is far less controllable than traditional military and intelligence operations, and it raises much more complex issues of private property, personal privacy and commercial integrity. Therefore, before our courts are forced to consider the issue and potentially limit executive powers, as they did after President Harry Truman tried to seize steel plants in the early 1950s, Congress should grant the White House broad authority to wage offensive information warfare. By explicitly authorizing these offensive operations in appropriate, defined circumstances, a new statute would strengthen the president's power to provide for the common defense in cyberspace. Doing so wouldn't answer all the questions that this new era of warfare presents. But one thing is sure: as bad as this arms race will be, losing it would be even worse.  "
America's Deadly Dynamics With Iran,"The chief Washington correspondent of The New York Times. COMMUTING to work in Tehran is never easy, but it is particularly nerve-racking these days for the scientists of Shahid Beheshti University. It was a little less than a year ago when one of them, Majid Shahriari, and his wife were stuck in traffic at 7:40 a.m. and a motorcycle pulled up alongside the car. There was a faint ''click'' as a magnet attached to the driver's side door. The huge explosion came a few seconds later, killing him and injuring his wife. On the other side of town, 20 minutes later, a nearly identical attack played out against Mr. Shahriari's colleague Fereydoon Abbasi, a nuclear scientist and longtime member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Perhaps because of his military training, Mr. Abbasi recognized what was happening, and pulled himself and his wife out the door just before his car turned into a fireball. Iran has charged that Israel was behind the attacks -- and many outsiders believe the ''sticky bombs'' are the hallmarks of a Mossad hit. Perhaps to make a point, Mr. Abbasi, now recovered from his injuries, has been made the director of Iran's atomic energy program. He travels the world offering assurances that Iran's interest in nuclear weapons is peaceful.  Even for the Iranian scientists who get to work safely, life isn't a lot easier. A confidential study circulating through America's national laboratories estimates that the Stuxnet computer worm -- the most sophisticated cyberweapon ever deployed against another country's infrastructure -- slowed Iran's nuclear progress by one to two years. Now it has run its course. But there is no reason to believe the attacks are over. Iran may be the most challenging test of the Obama administration's focus on new, cheap technologies that could avoid expensive boots on the ground; drones are the most obvious, cyberweapons the least discussed. It does not quite add up to a new Obama Doctrine, but the methods are defining a new era of nearly constant confrontation and containment. Drones are part of a tactic to keep America's adversaries off balance and preoccupied with defending themselves. And in the past two and a half years, they have been used more aggressively than ever. There are now five or six secret American drone bases around the world. Some recently discovered new computer worms suggest that a new, improved Stuxnet 2.0 may be in the works for Iran. ''There were a lot of mistakes made the first time,'' said an American official, avoiding any acknowledgment that the United States played a role in the cyber attack on Iran. ''This was a first-generation product. Think of Edison's initial light bulbs, or the Apple II.'' Not surprisingly, the Iranians are refusing to sit back and take it -- which is one reason many believe the long shadow war with Iran is about to ramp up dramatically. At the White House and the C.I.A., officials say the recently disclosed Iranian plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States -- by blowing up a tony Georgetown restaurant frequented by senators, lobbyists and journalists -- was just the tip of the iceberg. American intelligence officials now believe that the death of a Saudi diplomat in Pakistan earlier this year was an assassination. And they see evidence of other plots by the Quds Force, the most elite Iranian military unit, from Yemen to Latin America. ''The Saudi plot was clumsy, and we got lucky,'' another American official who has reviewed the intelligence carefully said recently. ''But we are seeing increasingly sophisticated Iranian activity like it, all around the world.'' Much of this resembles the worst days of the cold war, when Americans and Soviets were plotting against each other -- and killing each other -- in a now hazy attempt to preserve an upper hand. But Iran is no superpower. And there are reasons to wonder whether, in the end, this shadow war is simply going to delay the inevitable: an Iranian bomb or, more likely, an Iranian capability to assemble a fairly crude weapon in a matter of weeks or months. For understandable reasons, this is a question no one in the Obama administration will answer publicly. To admit that Iran may ultimately get a weapon is to admit failure; both George W. Bush and Barack Obama vowed they would never let Iran achieve nuclear arms capability, much less a bomb. Israelis have long argued that if Iran got too close, that could justify attacking Iran's nuclear sites. Reports in Israel last week suggested that such a pre-emptive attack is once again being debated. The worries focus on renewed hints from top Israeli officials that they will act unilaterally -- even over American objections -- if they judge that Iran is getting too close to a bomb. (It is worth noting that they have made similar noises every year since 2005, save for a brief hiatus when Stuxnet -- which appears to have been a joint project of American and Israeli intelligence -- was doing its work.) To many members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government -- and, by the accounts of his former colleagues, to the Israeli leader himself -- the Iran problem is 1939 all over again, an ''existential threat.'' ''WHEN Bibi talks about an existential threat,'' one senior Israeli official said of Mr. Netanyahu recently, ''he means the kind of threat the United States believed it faced when you believed the Nazis could get the bomb.'' Israelis worry that as Iran feels more isolated by sanctions and more threatened by the Arab Spring, which has not exactly broken Tehran's way, it may view racing for a bomb as the only way to restore itself to its position as the most influential power in the Middle East. The fate of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi may strengthen that impulse. ''One should ask: would Europe have intervened in Libya if Qaddafi had possessed nuclear weapons?'' the Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, said on army radio last week, referring to the Libyan leader's decision to give up his program in 2003. ''Would the U.S. have toppled Saddam Hussein if he had nuclear weapons?'' To many in the Obama administration, though, the Iranian threat seems more akin to 1949, when the Soviets tested their first nuclear device. That brought many confrontations that veered toward catastrophe, most notably the Cuban Missile Crisis. But ultimately the Soviets were contained. Inside the Pentagon and the National Security Council, there is a lot of work -- all of it unacknowledged -- about what a parallel containment strategy for Iran might look like. The early elements of it are obvious: the antimissile batteries that the United States has spent billions of dollars installing on the territory of Arab allies, and a new Pentagon plan to put more ships and antimissile batteries into the Persian Gulf, in cooperation with six Arab states led by Saudi Arabia. It was the Saudi king who famously advised American diplomats in the cables revealed by WikiLeaks last year that the only Iran strategy that would work was one that ''cut off the head of the snake.'' The big hitch in these containment strategies is that they are completely useless if Iran ever slips a bomb, or even some of its newly minted uranium fuel, to a proxy -- Hezbollah, Hamas or some other terrorist group -- raising the problem of ascertaining a bomb's return address. When the Obama administration ran some tabletop exercises soon after coming to office, it was shocked to discover that the science of nuclear forensics was nowhere near as good in practice as it was on television dramas. So if a bomb went off in some American city, or in Riyadh or Tel Aviv, it could be weeks or months before it was ever identified as Iranian. Even then, confidence in the conclusion, officials say, might be too low for the president to order retaliation. The wisdom of a containment strategy has also taken a hit since the revelation of the plot to kill the Saudi ambassador. Emerging from a classified briefing on the plot, a member of Congress said what struck him was that ''this thing could have gotten Iran into a war, and yet we don't know who ordered it.'' There is increasing talk that it could have been a rogue element within the Quds Force. If so, what does that say about whether the Iranian leadership has as good a hand on the throttle of Iran's nuclear research program as Washington has long assumed? That issue may well come to a head this week after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog that has been playing a cat-and-mouse game with Iran's nuclear establishment for a decade now, issues what may be one of its toughest reports ever. IF the leaks are an accurate predictor of the final product, the report will describe in detail the evidence the I.A.E.A. has amassed suggesting that Iran has conducted tests on nuclear trigger devices, wrestled with designs that can miniaturize a nuclear device into the small confines of a warhead, and conducted abstruse experiments to spark a nuclear reaction. Most likely, the agency will stop short of accusing Iran of running a bomb program; instead, it will use the evidence to demand answers that it has long been refused about what it delicately calls ''possible military dimensions'' of the nuclear program. Much of the work on those ''possible military dimensions'' is done, the I.A.E.A. believes, by scientists who have day jobs at Iran's major universities, including one just across the street from what is believed to be the nuclear project's administrative center. Among the scientists was Mr. Abbasi, the survivor of last November's bomb attack, who was named in 2007 to the United Nations' list of Iranian scientists subject to travel bans and economic sanctions because they were believed to be central to the bomb-development effort. Mr. Abbasi, according to people familiar with the I.A.E.A.'s investigation, worked on calculations on increasing the yield of nuclear explosions, among other problems in manufacturing a weapon. He was a key scientist in the Iranian covert nuclear weapons program headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, an academic and strong supporter of Iran's nuclear weapons program. For the past decade, Mr. Fakhrizadeh has run programs -- with names like ''Project 110'' and ''Project 5,'' they seem right out of a James Bond movie -- that the West believes are a shell game hiding weapons work. Suspicions have been heightened by Iran's refusal to allow him or his colleagues to be interviewed by the United Nations' nuclear inspection teams. And since last year's attacks -- and another this past summer -- Mr. Fakhrizadeh has gone completely underground. No one expects the United Nations' revelations of the evidence to prompt more action against Iran. Most governments have had access to this evidence for a while. The Iranians will say it is all fabrication, and because the agency will not reveal its sources, that charge could stick. The Chinese and the Russians have already protested to the I.A.E.A. head, Yukiya Amano, that revealing the evidence will harden Iran's position. They oppose any new sanctions. While the Obama administration may act unilaterally to shut down transactions with Iran's central bank, officials concede that the only economic step that could give the mullahs pause would be a ban on Iranian oil exports. With oil already hovering around $93 a barrel, no one in the administration is willing to risk a step that could send prices soaring and, in the worst case, cause a confrontation at sea over a blockade. For all the talk about how ''all options are on the table,'' Washington says a military strike isn't worth the risk of war; the Israelis say there may be no other choice. But they have said ''this is the last chance'' every year since 2005. All of which raises the question: how much more delay can be bought with a covert campaign of assassination, cyberattacks and sabotage? Some more, but probably not much. It has taken the Iranians 20 years so far to get their nuclear act together -- far longer than it took the United States and the Soviets in the '40s, the Chinese and the Israelis in the '60s, the Indians in the '70s, and the Pakistanis and the North Koreans in more recent times. The problem is partly that they were scammed by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani who sold them his country's discards. The assassination and the sabotage have taken a psychological toll, making scientists wonder if every trip to work may be their last, every line of code the beginning of a new round of destruction. Stuxnet was devilishly ingenious: it infected millions of computers, but did damage only when the code was transferred to special controllers that run centrifuges, which spin at supersonic speed when enriching uranium. When operators looked at their screens, everything looked normal. But downstairs in the plant, the centrifuges suddenly spun out of control and exploded, like small bombs. It took months for the Iranians to figure out what had happened. But now the element of surprise is gone. The Iranians are digging their plants deeper underground, and enriching uranium at purities that will make it easier to race for a bomb. When Barack Obama was sworn into office, they had enough fuel on hand to produce a single weapon; today, by the I.A.E.A.'s own inventory, they have enough for at least four. And as the Quds Force has shown, sabotage and assassination is a two-way game, which may ratchet up one confrontation just as Americans have been exhausted by two others.  "
British Tabloid Apologizes to Actress for Hacking,"LONDON -- The News of the World formally apologized to the actress Sienna Miller on Tuesday for systematically, and illegally, intercepting her cellphone messages in the mid-2000s and using the information to publish articles about her private life. The apology comes as part of a settlement between Ms. Miller and the newspaper, which also agreed to pay her $:100,000 in legal fees and damages, about $164,000. It is the latest development in a long-running drama in which the newspaper has had to contend with growing evidence that its practice of hacking into the cellphones of public figures, politicians and celebrities was widespread and pervasive.  At least four other people who say their phones were hacked into have reached out-of-court settlements with the newspaper; numerous lawsuits against it are still pending. The newspaper has offered to settle with at least seven other possible victims of its phone-hacking practices. For several years, News of the World said that its phone hacking had been limited to a single case -- that involving its former royals editor, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator hired by the paper, Glenn Mulcaire, both jailed in 2007 for illegally intercepting voice mail messages of members of the royal household. But that claim began to lose credibility as more evidence came to light, and this year the company admitted that it had hacked the phones of eight public figures, including Ms. Miller, in the mid-2000s. Meanwhile, the police are conducting a criminal investigation. Two News of the World editors and a reporter have been arrested in connection with the case. The apology, read aloud in London's High Court by a lawyer for News Group Newspapers, the subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News International that publishes the News of the World, was notable for how thorough, and how abject, it was. The company, said the lawyer, Michael Silverleaf, ''acknowledges that the information should never have been obtained in the manner it was'' and that ''the private information should never have been published.'' The paper, he added, ''has accepted responsibility for misuse of private information, breach of confidence and harassment.'' Ms. Miller was not in court and did not make a statement. But her lawyer, David Sherborne, said that in 2005 and 2006, the News of the World published articles containing ''intrusive and private information'' about her. She did not know ''whether someone close to her was leaking information or whether her mobile telephone was somehow being hacked into,'' Mr. Sherborne said. ''Both possibilities were extremely distressing.'' He said that she had become suspicious about the security of her cellphone when she missed a number of voice mail messages and received calls from people who hung up. The information was used for at least 11 articles about Ms. Miller's private life, including details about her relationships with the actors Daniel Craig and Jude Law. One article drew on discussions between Mr. Law and Ms. Miller about the possibility of their having children together. The two have since split up. News Group said that it would lay out the full extent of its phone-hacking operation to Ms. Miller privately. Her case relied on notes, seized from Mr. Mulcaire after his arrest, with details about Ms. Miller's cellphones, including phone numbers, PINs and passwords, as well as similar details about the phones of her mother, her publicist and Mr. Law.  "
MI5 References Emerge In Phone Hacking Lawsuit,"A British private detective at the center of the phone hacking scandal that has shaken Rupert Murdoch's media empire cited the MI5 file of a close friend of Princes William and Harry in notes he kept on his work for the tabloid The News of the World, according to a suit filed in London. But the court papers, released to The New York Times, do not clearly indicate whether the detective, Glenn Mulcaire, accessed the highly classified intelligence file directly, was told of its contents or was simply noting its existence.  The documents, dated Sept. 23, accuse Mr. Mulcaire and the now-closed News of the World of invading the privacy of Guy Pelly, a London nightclub owner and a confidant of the princes. The defendants, the suit says, hacked Mr. Pelly's cellphone, set up an e-mail address in his name and flew him to Las Vegas on false pretenses to trick him into revealing details about his royal friends. But the most intriguing accusation relates to at least two references to Mr. Pelly's MI5 profile in Mr. Mulcaire's detailed records. He kept copious notes covering his conversations with his employers at the tabloid, his sources, his methods and the information he gleaned. One reference, the suit said, was in an electronic file titled ''Project Guy W. Pelly,'' which ''included his mobile number, his parents' landline number, his parents' address and a further reference to the MI5 profile.'' Somewhat ambiguously, the suit states: ''It is to be inferred that individuals close to members of the Royal Family have MI5 profiles and that this information was obtained unlawfully by the Defendants.'' Daisy Dunlop, a spokeswoman for News International, the British arm of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, said that the company's interpretation of the evidence is that Mr. Mulcaire found out about the MI5 profile from an intercepted voice mail message. There is no basis, she said, ''to conclude that Mulcaire or NOTW had access to MI5 files.'' A lawyer for Mr. Pelly, Mark Thomson, who is seeking further information on Mr. Mulcaire's activities through the courts, declined to comment. Sarah Webb, a lawyer for Mr. Mulcaire, said he was unable to respond, citing a continuing criminal investigation and civil proceedings. The suit is one of dozens to emerge from a scandal that has revealed disturbingly close ties among elements of Britain's news media, political leaders and law enforcement officials. It has led to the resignations of two top Scotland Yard officers and the arrests of 16 of The News of the World's former employees, including its former editor Andy Coulson, who served as Prime Minister David Cameron's chief spokesman until he was forced to resign this year. MI5 and its foreign intelligence counterpart MI6 are highly respected and have sweeping powers to collect information in pursuit of national security. Their legendary emphasis on secrecy is enshrined in British law. It is a criminal offense for their agents to leak ''any information, document or other article relating to security or intelligence.'' Tom Watson, a British lawmaker who has been prominent in Parliament's investigation into phone hacking, said the mere existence of notes citing MI5 material raised serious questions. Parliament will ''urgently'' want to know, he said, whether the police, who hold Mr. Mulcaire's notes, told MI5 that there was a potential breach in its security -- and if so, whether MI5 acted to inform a judicial inquiry into the tabloid's wrongdoing. Further, Mr. Watson said, ''If operatives working for a tabloid newspaper have been accessing the files of MI5 illicitly, then that is a very, very serious, massive breach of security.'' A spokesman for the department that oversees MI5, the Home Office, cited a policy to decline to comment on issues pertaining to the agency. Scotland Yard also declined to comment.  "
PUSH COMES TO SHOVE: Technology helps ignite change (as in Tunisia). Except when it bolsters oppression (as in Iran).,"Scott Shane, a reporter in The Times's Washngton bureau, is the author of ''Dismantling Utopia: How Information Ended the Soviet Union.'' WASHINGTON -- Fear is the dictator's traditional tool for keeping the people in check. But by cutting off Egypt's Internet and wireless service late last week in the face of huge street protests, President Hosni Mubarak betrayed his own fear -- that Facebook, Twitter, laptops and smartphones could empower his opponents, expose his weakness to the world and topple his regime. There was reason for Mr. Mubarak to be shaken. By many accounts, the new arsenal of social networking helped accelerate Tunisia's revolution, driving the country's ruler of 23 years, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, into ignominious exile and igniting a conflagration that has spread across the Arab world at breathtaking speed. It was an apt symbol that a dissident blogger with thousands of followers on Twitter, Slim Amamou, was catapulted in a matter of days from the interrogation chambers of Mr. Ben Ali's regime to a new government post as minister for youth and sports. It was a marker of the uncertainty in Tunis that he had stepped down from the government by Thursday.  Tunisia's uprising offers the latest encouragement for a comforting notion: that the same Web tools that so many Americans use to keep up with college pals and post passing thoughts have a more noble role as well, as a scourge of despotism. It was just 18 months ago, after all, that the same technologies were hailed as a factor in Iran's Green Revolution, the stirring street protests that followed the disputed presidential election. But since that revolt collapsed, Iran has become a cautionary tale. The Iranian police eagerly followed the electronic trails left by activists, which assisted them in making thousands of arrests in the crackdown that followed. The government even crowd-sourced its hunt for enemies, posting on the Web the photos of unidentified demonstrators and inviting Iranians to identify them. ''The Iranian government has become much more adept at using the Internet to go after activists,'' said Faraz Sanei, who tracks Iran at Human Rights Watch. The Revolutionary Guard, the powerful political and economic force that protects the ayatollahs' regime, has created an online surveillance center and is believed to be behind a ''cyberarmy'' of hackers that it can unleash against opponents, he said. Repressive regimes around the world may have fallen behind their opponents in recent years in exploiting new technologies -- not unexpected when aging autocrats face younger, more tech-savvy opponents. But in Minsk and Moscow, Tehran and Beijing, governments have begun to climb the steep learning curve and turn the new Internet tools to their own, antidemocratic purposes. The countertrend has sparked a debate over whether the conventional wisdom that the Internet and social networking inherently tip the balance of power in favor of democracy is mistaken. A new book, ''The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom,'' by a young Belarus-born American scholar, Evgeny Morozov, has made the case most provocatively, describing instance after instance of strongmen finding ways to use new media to their advantage. After all, the very factors that have brought Facebook and similar sites such commercial success have huge appeal for a secret police force. A dissident's social networking and Twitter feed is a handy guide to his political views, his career, his personal habits and his network of like-thinking allies, friends and family. A cybersurfing policeman can compile a dossier on a regime opponent without the trouble of the street surveillance and telephone tapping required in a pre-Net world. If Mr. Mubarak's Egypt has resorted to the traditional blunt instrument against dissent in a crisis -- cutting off communications altogether -- other countries have shown greater sophistication. In Belarus, officers of the K.G.B. -- the secret police agency has preserved its Soviet-era name -- now routinely quote activists' comments on Facebook and other sites during interrogations, said Alexander Lukashuk, director of the Belarus service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Last month, he said, investigators appearing at the apartment of a Belarusian photojournalist mocked her by declaring that since she had written online that they usually conducted their searches at night, they had decided to come in the morning. In Syria, ''Facebook is a great database for the government now,'' said Ahed al-Hindi, a Syrian activist who was arrested at an Internet cafe in Damascus in 2006 and left his country after being released from jail. Mr. Hindi, now with the United States-based group CyberDissidents.org, said he believes that Facebook is doing more good than harm, helping activists form virtual organizations that could never survive if they met face to face. But users must be aware that they are speaking to their oppressors as well as their friends, he said. Widney Brown, senior director of international law and policy at Amnesty International, said the popular networking services, like most technologies, are politically neutral. ''There's nothing deterministic about these tools -- Gutenberg's press, or fax machines or Facebook,'' Ms. Brown said. ''They can be used to promote human rights or to undermine human rights.'' This is the point of Mr. Morozov, 26, a visiting scholar at Stanford. In ''The Net Delusion,'' he presents an answer to the ''cyberutopians'' who assume that the Internet inevitably fuels democracy. He coined the term ''spinternet'' to capture the spin applied to the Web by governments that are beginning to master it. In China, Mr. Morozov said, thousands of commentators are trained and paid -- hence their nickname, the 50-Cent Party -- to post pro-government comments on the Web and steer online opinion away from criticism of the Communist Party. In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez, after first denouncing hostile Twitter comments as ''terrorism,'' created his own Twitter feed -- an entertaining mix of politics and self-promotion that now has 1.2 million followers. In Russia, Mr. Morozov noted, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin has managed to co-opt several prominent new-media entrepreneurs, including Konstantin Rykov, whose many Web sites now skew strongly pro-Putin and whose anti-Georgia documentary about the Russia-Georgia war of 2008 went viral on the Web. Mr. Morozov acknowledges that social networking ''definitely helps protesters to mobilize.'' ''But is it making protest more likely? I don't think so.'' In Egypt, it appears, at least some activists share Mr. Morozov's wariness about the double-edged nature of new media. An anonymous 26-page leaflet that appeared in Cairo with practical advice for demonstrators last week, The Guardian reported, instructed activists to pass it on by e-mail and photocopy -- but not by Facebook and Twitter, because they were being monitored by the government. Then Mr. Mubarak's government, evidently concluding that it was too late for mere monitoring, unplugged his country from the Internet altogether. It was a desperate move from an autocrat who had not learned to harness the tools his opponents have embraced.  "
Password Service Warns of Possible Hacking Attack,"LastPass, a service for managing passwords, said late Wednesday that out of concern about a possible hacking attack, it would force its more than 1 million users to change their master passwords, which they use to retrieve passwords for other sites across the Web. The news comes in the wake of several recent high-profile hacks of computer-security companies, including another maker of technology designed to make Web sites more secure, RSA Security. In a blog post, LastPass, which offers free and paid products, said that it had detected two ""traffic anomalies,"" including one leaving the company's database, and could not explain the causes. That sparked fears that intruders may have accessed user information.  ""We're going to be paranoid and assume the worst,"" LastPass said. It said its analysis so far suggests hackers could have acquired users' e-mail addresses and might be able to decipher their master passwords using ""brute force"" methods, if those passwords are simple enough.  In addition to requiring its users to set new master passwords, LastPass said it would confirm that users of its system are legitimate by matching the numerical Internet Protocol addresses tied to their computers with IP addresses used by them in the past, or by validating them through e-mail.

Citi Says Credit Card Customers' Data Was Hacked,"12:49 p.m. | Updated Citigroup acknowledged on Thursday that unidentified hackers had breached its security and gained access to the data of hundreds of thousands of its credit card customers in North America. ""During routine monitoring, we recently discovered unauthorized access to Citi's account online,"" the bank said in an e-mailed statement. ""We are contacting customers whose information was impacted."" The bank said about 1 percent of its North American credit card holders had been affected, putting the total count of customers exposed in the hundreds of thousands, based on its annual report for 2010, which said it had about 21 million credit card customers in North America. While information concerning customers' names, credit card numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses was exposed, the bank said that data like the ""Social Security number, date of birth, card expiration date and card security code were not compromised."" Citi is notifying cardholders who have been affected via mail, as well as via their online accounts. Most customers will also received a replacement card, the company said.  ""Citi has implemented enhanced procedures to prevent a recurrence of this type of event,"" the bank said. ""For the security of these customers, we are not disclosing further details."" While no group has claimed responsibility for the breach, it is part of a spate of recent cyberattacks. Sony has reported a series of assaults on its PlayStation network and several Sony Web sites -- one hacker site says there have been 18 so far -- after the company sued, and then settled with, a programmer who had cracked the PlayStation code.  Other attacks have hit PBS, Fox and an F.B.I. affiliate known as Infragard. And most worrying of all, perhaps, they compromisedthe security system of RSA, maker of the popular SecurID. But none of those breaches appears to pose as direct a threat to consumers as the one reported by Citi.  A spokesman for the bank said that only credit card customers had been affected, not debit card holders, and that law enforcement had been alerted. The Financial Times earlier reported the breach. Two people associated with the hacker collective Anonymous said they did not believe the group was involved.   ""Anonymous kind of moved off the banks,"" one said, adding that it was ""because they were bored."" Anonymous has become known for prominent denial-of-service attacks that disable and deface the Web sites of companies the hackers dislike; for example, the group disrupted service at Visa and MasterCard after they stopped allowing donations to WikiLeaks. ""For-profit attacks are always foreign,"" one of the people said. ""I've never heard of an American group doing that. You can deface a Web site, but once you start stealing money ... we understand the FBI.  They can kick your door down for downloading torrents."" Citigroup was reported to have been breached by hackers tied to a Russian group in 2009, and before that in 1995. One of the members of Anonymous questioned Citigroup's security as the bank described it on its Citi Card site, saying the 128-bit encryption the bank boasts of is ""really not that big a deal.""  ""Two-hundred-and-fifty-six bit would take someone a lifetime to decrypt,"" the person said.  ""The security is so weak right now, if you know a couple attacks, you can just go around and see what works.""   "
The Week in Privacy (Just Between Us),"Do you believe in the theory of the insidious plot to flood the minds and bodies of the American public with ever-more-mesmerizing and shinier technological gadgets and distractions so that those who already mostly control the world can for their own benefit further monitor and control the behaviors of the powerless masses, and that said powerless masses will be too busy operating or figuring out how to operate their new personal devices to even know what happened?  Me neither. But it certainly has been a troubling few weeks for those who ponder such things. Here is a look around at various news and opinion in the privacy landscape.Facebook and Your Face: A Los Angeles Times editorial weighs in on Facebook's not quite transparent implementation of an automated facial recognition system: In its latest privacy intrusion, the Silicon  Valley powerhouse has built a gargantuan photo collection of the faces of Facebook users - and non-users. For now, the company is using the database and facial recognition software only to help users identify the people in the snapshots they upload to the social network. Nevertheless, it's just the kind of repurposing of personal information that companies should obtain users' permission for - a step that companies don't like to take because it results in fewer people participating.Facebook's users collectively upload millions of photos daily, and the company has long encouraged them to add digital tags identifying the people in them. What it didn't tell users was that it was using that information to build a database of facial images. Late last year it started using this database to identify people automatically, although the person uploading the photo still had to confirm the tag.Orwellian-sounding, no? Privacy groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission over Facebook's automated facial recognition technology, calling it ""unfair and deceptive."" They are not very happy about it in Europe either, where the European Union has promised to investigate the matter. Your Citi Credit Card (One Month Later): Kim Zetter at Wired's Threat Level reports: ""Citigroup has been forced to reveal that a recent hack of its network exposed the financial data of more than 360,000 customers, a much higher number than the bank originally disclosed."" The company said last week that hackers who breached Citi Account Online on May 10 had acquired the personal information of about 1 percent of its 21 million North America customers, or approximately 210,000 credit card holders. But in a note posted to its website late Wednesday, the company revealed the new number, and said that it had known the number of customers affected was much higher as early as May 24. The note didn't indicate why the company hadn't disclosed the higher number before, but The New York Times reports that the revelation comes after Connecticut's attorney general and several other state regulators have opened investigations into the breach and begun demanding more information about it. The N.S.A.'s Hacker Wars: At The Atlantic Wire Adam Clark Estes writes, in ""Prepare to Have Your E-mail Read by the N.S.A.,"" that the Department of Defense ""is mounting it's first strike back at the hackers - a preemptive strike that will increase online surveillance at defense contractors by partnering with internet service providers for privileged access to the rivers of data flowing through their cables. AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink are all on board."" The rest of Estes' post, though, is more nuanced than his headline, as it looks at the delicate balance in this case between privacy and national security. He notes that the department insists that the tracking will be limited to the contractors working with the government, and takes into account the constant attempted breaches of the Pentagon's computer systems - an estimated 250,000 per hour: We all saw ""Men in Black."" And ""Hackers."" And ""The Matrix."" Sometimes, in the face of an invasion, the government ought to protect itself and its citizens from danger. That's basically why an institution like the Department of Defense exists--nobody will argue with that. But another sort of danger is the fact that, in the context of cybercrime, the public understands so very little about the terms of the government's efforts. Poll Middle America about what ""DDoS attack"" or Stuxnet-like weapons are. Even the term ""fingerprints of malicious code"" from The Washington Post coverage of the NSA surveillance program leaves lots of leeway for better informed officials to define the rules of engagement.  . The other line of narrative around the internet and government protecting the people is a presumably more docile one: the struggle for privacy in the age of Facebook. As enterprising Senators go head to head with the social network and the Google and everyone, lambasting them for  deceitfully monitoring American citizens with their confusing privacy policies and location tracking programs, news of a clandestine agreement between internet service providers and the NSA, the most secret of the secret agencies, feels kind of icky. Liberal Blogger as Enemy of the State?: The privacy-related story that got perhaps the most attention this week was this one by James Risen of The Times: A former senior C.I.A. official says that officials in the Bush White House sought damaging personal information on a prominent American critic of the Iraq war in order to discredit him. Glenn L. Carle, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was a top counterterrorism official during the administration of President George W. Bush, said the White House at least twice asked intelligence officials to gather sensitive information on Juan Cole, a University of Michigan professor who writes an influential blog that criticized the war. In an interview, Mr. Carle said his supervisor at the National Intelligence Council told him in 2005 that White House officials wanted ""to get"" Professor Cole, and made clear that he wanted Mr. Carle to collect information about him, an effort Mr. Carle rebuffed. ... Intelligence officials disputed Mr. Carle's account, saying that White House officials did ask about Professor Cole in 2006, but only to find out why he had been invited to C.I.A.-sponsored conferences on the Middle East. The officials said that the White House did not ask for sensitive personal information, and that the agency did not provide it. Cole, whose traffic at his blog, Informed Comment, must be spiking noticeably, had this, among other things, to say:It seems to me clear that the Bush White House was upset by my blogging of the Iraq War, in which I was using Arabic and other primary sources, and which contradicted the propaganda efforts of the administration attempting to make the enterprise look like a wild shining success. Carle's revelations come as a visceral shock. You had thought that with all the shennanigans of the CIA against anti-Vietnam war protesters and then Nixon's use of the agency against critics like Daniel Ellsberg, that the Company and successive White Houses would have learned that the agency had no business spying on American citizens. What alarms me most of all in the nakedly illegal deployment of the CIA against an academic for the explicit purpose of destroying his reputation for political purposes is that I know I am a relatively small fish and it seems to me rather likely that I was not the only target of the baleful team at the White House. After the Valerie Plame affair, it seemed clear that there was nothing those people wouldn't stoop to. Spencer Ackerman at Wired's Danger Room seemed baffled why a Bush team that had so much on its hands would even bother: All Cole did was say mean things about the Bush team on the Internet. He wasn't a militant, he wasn't even an activist. He blogged. To devote precious intelligence resources, especially from counterterrorism officials, to silencing him is laughably solipsistic. If you don't like what someone says about you on the Internet, stop Googling yourself. Trolling: Ur doing it wrong. Of course if this story turns out to be true then Cole will have earned the distinction of being the first blogger to be targeted as an enemy by an American Presidential Administration. Steve Clemons at the Washington Note, wrote that he was ""deeply disturbed"" but ""not surprised at all by this news"" about his friend Cole. Also not surprising was that Clemons and many others took the opportunity to brandish their old anti-Bush chops. Clemons: ""The George W. Bush administration ignored the fact that no WMDs were found in Iraq and invaded nonetheless; went after Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame - lying about who did what and who knew what at very high levels of government; created a Kafkaesque international legal purgatory in Guantanamo where normal rules didn't apply and where torture became a [routinized] part of managing high value detainees; and engaged in massive domestic spying on US citizens."" Oliver Willis: ""If you ever [wonder] why conservatives try so hard to disappear the Bush presidency, it is because they were a bunch of unethical, dangerous, crooks."" Andrew Sullivan: ""History, I suspect, will treat them as the nemeses of American decline. They helped undermine America's soft and hard power and permanently tainted its moral standing. I wonder what else Mr. Carle is going to reveal in his forthcoming book. What many of these ruthless men forgot is that other decent men and women were among them. And one day we'll hear more of their stories."" Same Fears, Different President: But are Bush-bashers being a wee bit self-righteous? What about the here and now? After all the United States has had a different president for the past two years and change, and one could plausibly argue that the Obama administration has provided more of the same. For instance, this post by Julian Sanchez at Cato@Liberty, which seemed to go largely unnoticed, on the reach of National Security Letters, a provision of the Patriot Act (the extension of which Obama signed remotely last month, with an ""autopen."") The latest report to Congress on the Justice Department's use of foreign intelligence surveillance powers has just been released,  and it shows a truly stunning increase in the number of Americans whose  sensitive phone, Internet, and banking records were obtained by the FBI  - without judicial oversight - pursuant to National Security Letters. In 2009, a total of 14,788 NSL requests were issued targeting U.S. persons - a number that excludes requests for ""basic subscriber information"" as opposed to phone or  e-mail logs - and 6,114 different Americans were affected by those  demands for information. In 2010, the number of NSL requests targeting  Americans rose to 24,287. What's really shocking, however, is the number of people affected. A whopping 14,212 American citizens and permanent residents had records of their financial, telephone, and online activity seized  last year.  The previous record, set in 2005, was 9,475. Were you one of  those 14,212? If so, what did the FBI get? Thanks to the gag orders  that come with NSLs, you will almost certainly never get to find out.  But even if the Bureau decides there's no reason to continue  investigating you, whatever data they obtained - lists of phone numbers,  credit card purchases, financial transactions, e-mail correspondents,  or IP addresses visited - are likely to remain in a massive government  database indefinitely Another story that perked up privacy watchers was this one by The Times's Charlie Savage that reported that the F.B.I. ""is giving significant new powers to its roughly 14,000 agents, allowing  them more leeway to search databases, go through household trash or use  surveillance teams to scrutinize the lives of people who have attracted  their attention."" The F.B.I. soon plans to issue a new edition of its manual, called the Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide,  according to an official who has worked on the draft document and  several others who have been briefed on its contents. The new rules add  to several measures taken over the past decade to give agents more  latitude as they search for signs of criminal or terrorist activity...  Some of the most notable changes apply to the lowest category of  investigations, called an ""assessment."" The category, created in  December 2008, allows agents to look into people and organizations  ""proactively"" and without firm evidence for suspecting criminal or terrorist activity. All of which moved Tom Maguire at Just One Minute to exclaim: ""The last lib would have leapt from a ledge if this were happening under Evil BushCo."" It also prompted Sen. Jon Tester of Montana to write at the Huffington Post:  That's not how we do things in Montana or anywhere else in America. And that's why the FBI should abandon those plans. We've seen what happens when the government oversteps its bounds. We get laws like the Patriot Act, which threatens our constitutional freedoms under the guise of security. I've always opposed the Patriot Act, and voted proudly last month against an extension of the controversial law. And I'll keep fighting to make sure the federal government doesn't give away our freedoms in the name of security. Because when that happens, the terrorists get exactly what they want. (Wait, I thought they wanted us to stop shopping ...) At Emptywheel, Marcy Wheeler, one of the blogosphere's most dogged privacy watchers, doesn't hedge in her post ""F.B.I. Aspires to be the Stasi."" She paints this scenario: Taken together, these rules would allow the FBI to search through existing databases (potentially including telecommunications metadata showing who a person communicated with and hung out with, as well as some financial information) to find potential snitches. The agent could search those databases with no apparent limits or record. And then the agent could sift through the potential informant's trash to get the evidence to blackmail him to become an informant. These rules seem ripe to snare a bunch of totally innocent people in the FBI's investigative web. And even if it doesn't, it may well serve to increase the paranoia of average people. (She's talking about me, I just know it.) If you have an opinion on any of this, don't hesitate to leave a comment. Don't worry. It's totally secure.  Promise.  "
"F.B.I. Seizes Web Servers, Knocking Sites Offline","9:22 p.m. | Updated  Adding additional comments from DigitalOne. 6:16 p.m. | Updated  Adding that the F.B.I. did not comment. 6:55 p.m. | Updated  Adding comments from Curbed Network and Instapaper. 7:35 p.m. | Updated  Adding comment from DigitalOne. The F.B.I. seized Web servers in a raid on a data center early Tuesday, causing several Web sites, including those run by the New York publisher Curbed Network, to go offline. The raid happened at 1:15 a.m. at a hosting facility in Reston, Va., used by DigitalOne, which is based in Switzerland, the company said. The F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the raid. In an e-mail to one of its clients on Tuesday afternoon,  DigitalOne's chief executive, Sergej Ostroumow, said: ""This problem is caused by the F.B.I., not our company. In the night F.B.I. has taken 3 enclosures with equipment plugged into them, possibly including your server -- we cannot check it."" Mr. Ostroumow said that the F.B.I. was only interested in one of the company's clients but had taken servers used by ""tens of clients."" He wrote: ""After F.B.I.'s unprofessional 'work' we can not restart our own servers, that's why our Web site is offline and support doesn't work."" The company's staff had been working to solve the problem for the previous 15 hours, he said. Mr. Ostroumow said in response to e-mailed questions that it was not clear if the issues would be resolved by Wednesday. A government official who declined to be named said earlier in the day that the F.B.I. was actively investigating the Lulz Security group and  any affiliated hackers. The official said the F.B.I. had teamed up with  other agencies in this effort, including the Central Intelligence  Agency and cybercrime bureaus in Europe. Mr. Ostroumow  declined to name the company  targeted by the F.B.I. and  said that he did not  know why it had drawn  their interest. It was  also unclear why the agents took  more servers  with them than they  sought, he said. The sites of the Curbed Network, including popular blogs covering real estate, restaurants and other topics, were all unavailable Tuesday evening. Lockhart Steele, Curbed's president, said his team realized that the company's sites were down at around 3 a.m. and contacted DigitalOne.  After initially declining to say what had happened, DigitalOne explained that the F.B.I. had raided the data center, Mr. Steele said. ""Our servers happened to be in with some naughty servers,"" he said, adding that his sites were not the target of the raid. Curbed is working to get its sites back online, probably by Wednesday. The raid also affected a server used by Instapaper, a popular service that saves articles for later reading. Marco Arment, Instapaper's founder, said he lost contact with a server hosted by DigitalOne early on Tuesday. Instapaper's Web site is still operating but has slowed somewhat. Mr. Arment said he had not heard from DigitalOne or law enforcement, and had no reason to believe that Instapaper was a target of  the raid. Pinboard, a bookmarking site, was operating on a backup server and some of its features were turned off, a post on its site said. DigitalOne  provided all necessary information to pinpoint the servers for a specific I.P.  address, Mr. Ostroumow said. However, the agents took entire server racks,  perhaps because they mistakenly thought that ""one enclosure is = to one server,""  he said in an e-mail. DigitalOne had  no employees on-site when the raid took place. The data center operator, from  which DigitalOne leases space, passed along the information about the raid three  hours after it started with the name of the agent and a phone number to  call. Before learning  of the raid, Mr. Ostroumow, who is in Switzerland with the rest of his team,  thought the problem was a technical glitch. Nick Bilton contributed reporting.  "
Hacker Group Releases Government Files,"The hacker group Lulz Security appears to be keeping its promise of continued mayhem. This weekend the group, also known as LulzSec, said it would dissolve and return back to the larger hacker collective Anonymous, where it would pursue activities under a new banner dubbed AntiSec,  dedicated to fighting against ""censorship and corrupt governments."" Early Tuesday, the AntiSec Anonymous cell posted several sets of government files, and promised more later in the day. Files it posted online appeared to include passwords for several sites associated with the Brazilian government as well as contents of databases belonging to the governments of Australia, Anguilla and Zimbabwe. It also posted what it said were 2,800 names of members of the right-wing Columbian Black Eagles Special Police Unit.  LulzSec has taken a special interest in Brazil. A key member known as Sabu has trumpeted his opposition to  censorship there, and the group has a Brazilian offshoot. In posts about its leaks on its Twitter feed, the group said the Zimbabwean material comprised ""about everything about Zimbabwe government on Internet there is to know"" and took a swipe at President Robert Mugabe, who has clung to power in the African state since disputed presidential elections in 2008. The files appeared to be associated with the government's Web portal. The group also claimed to have exposed a set of e-mail credentials. Anonymous has a history of opposing the Mugabe regime and focusing on sites affiliated with it for denial-of-service attacks and defacements. It was less clear why the group went after Australia and Anguilla, other than to fulfill its anarchic AntiSec goal to ""steal and leak any classified government information."" Meanwhile, the main Anonymous operations arm said in a blog post Tuesday that it planned to focus on  Israeli government sites with denial-of-service attacks, which are attacks designed to flood sites with traffic until they are unavailable. No attacks have been detected so far, according to the security firm Arbor Networks. And another part of Anonymous said  it took down MasterCard's site in a denial-of-service attack. MasterCard said in an e-mailed statement that its corporate Web site ""experienced intermittent service disruption, due to a telecommunications/Internet service provider outage that impacted multiple users"" and that it was ""continuing to monitor the situation closely.""  "
Anonymous Promotes Legal Boycott of PayPal,"12:03 p.m. | Updated   3:36 p.m. | Updated  The hacker group Anonymous took an unusual approach to its online activism on Wednesday, asking its thousands of members and supporters to publicly boycott PayPal, the payment Web site that it has criticized in response to the WikiLeaks incidents. The boycott was announced after 14 Anonymous members were arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week. Anonymous outlined its grievances against PayPal in a joint letter that was signed by Anonymous and Lulz Security, another hacking group that has been responsible for dozens of attacks on companies and government Web sites over the past several months. The letter said the boycott was meant to show both of the groups' displeasure with the latest actions by PayPal and the F.B.I. ""We encourage anyone using PayPal to immediately close their accounts and consider an alternative,"" the letter said, adding that PayPal's apparent willingness to work with the F.B.I. ""should be proof enough that they don't deserve the customers they get."" The letter continued, ""They do not deserve your business, and they do not deserve your respect."" During December 2010 last year, Anonymous members performed a distributed denial of service attack against PayPal, sporadically hampering the company's Web site. Anonymous said the attacks were in retaliation for PayPal's refusal to process credit card payments supporting WikiLeaks. In Wednesday's letter, Anonymous maintained its frustration with PayPal and its handling of WikiLeaks payments. ""PayPal continues to withhold funds from WikiLeaks, a beacon of truth in these dark times,"" the group wrote in the letter. A PayPal spokesperson said the boycott was not affecting the company operations, noting via e-mail, ""We haven't seen any changes to our normal operations (including account opening and closing)."" Anonymous and LulzSec also asked people who join the boycott to share pictures of their account closures on Twitter and other Web sites. British police said Wednesday that they had arrested a 19-year-old man who goes by the name Topiary online and is said to be the spokesman of LulzSec.   "
Mobilizing Help for People Accused of Hacking,"When Senator Joseph R. McCarthy held hearings in the 1950s to question witnesses about their supposed ties to communism, critics accused him of fomenting a Red Scare hysteria.  Decades later, the term Green Scare was used to describe a series of sweeping federal prosecutions of people involved in radical environmental and animal rights groups. Now, perhaps, comes the Nerd Scare. That is the phrase used by the National Lawyers Guild to describe a wave of subpoenas and indictments aimed at people thought to be members of activist hacker groups like Anonymous and LulzSec, which are known for waging cyberattacks against corporations including Sony, Amazon and Visa.  On Monday, the guild unveiled a Web site, www.anonlg.com, meant to help people or groups accused of hacking to find free legal representation. In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested more than a dozen suspected Anonymous members accused of using a tool called the low orbit ion cannon to carry out a denial of service attack against PayPal. The attack took the company's Web site off line for four days in December.  It was carried out, according to members of Anonymous, in retaliation for PayPal's refusal to process credit card payments to Wikileaks, a whistle-blowing organization that has made public hundreds of thousands of sensitive documents from the United States military and the State Department.   Law enforcement authorities say the electronic attacks have cost millions of dollars.  But others have said that they caused little lasting harm and should be treated more like a political protest than a serious economic crime. That view fits with the history of the lawyers guild, a national group that the F.B.I. has admitted to trying to disrupt with counterintelligence programs and warrantless searches from 1940 to 1975.  Since the 1930s, members of the guild, which has headquarters in Manhattan, have represented a host of defendants tied to left-leaning causes.  Clients have included producers and screenwriters who refused to testify before a House committee investigating communist infiltration, protesters at national political conventions and people accused of being environmental extremists. ""It became pretty clear to us that this was a new wave of activism, protesting the growth of corporations' power,"" the guild's executive director, Heidi Boghosian, said, referring to the Anonymous attacks. ""And it seemed to us that it would also be a new chapter in the Justice Department's view."" Ms. Boghosian said that she was concerned that those accused of hacking were facing harsher penalties than their alleged actions might otherwise warrant because the cyberattacks were aimed at prominent companies and were motivated by sympathy for Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, whose publication of secret documents was condemned by the Obama administration.  An indictment unsealed last month in San Jose, Calif., where PayPal is situated, said that 14 Anonymous members used an open source computer program to bombard PayPal computers with messages, thus denying service to legitimate users. The defendants are charged with intentionally damaging protected computers, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and with conspiracy, which carries an additional 5 years and $250,000 for each count.   The Justice Department has said that the investigation into Anonymous, which has involved more than 75 searches in at least 10 states, is continuing. In the spring, as word of the investigation spread, the lawyers guild decided to help the hackers. The new Web site offers advice for those who are served with subpoenas or whose homes are raided and includes a phone number to call for help in finding a lawyer. It also has links to a primer by the Electronic Frontier Foundation called ""Surveillance Self-Defense"" and an illustrated pamphlet called ""If an Agent Knocks"" by the Center for Constitutional Rights. Over the last several weeks, the guild has sent messages to members across the country asking for pro bono volunteers to represent accused Anonymous members.  Among those who responded was Omar Figueroa, in Sebastopol, Calif., who said that he was looking forward to exploring issues of government monitoring of law and technology that had not yet been heavily litigated. Mr. Figueroa, who said that he was representing one of those indicted but would not reveal the name of his client, said that he questioned whether it was fair to say that Anonymous members had hacked PayPal computers when they had never penetrated the network, only flooded it with messages.  ""They are trying to accuse someone of breaking and entering, when all they have done is ring the doorbell,"" Mr. Figueroa said, ""albeit in an annoying fashion."" A guild member in San Francisco, John Hamasaki, said that his client had been indicted, and he described the investigation into Anonymous as ""the almighty power of the federal government cracking down on ordinary citizens in a situation where nobody was hurt.""  The client, Keith Downey, a 26-year-old carpenter in Jacksonville, Fla., declined to discuss the charges against him.  But, he said, he was surprised by ""the government putting all of these resources into something so minor"" and added that he was still shaken by his arrest several weeks ago. ""I woke up and literally had an assault rifle in my face,"" he said. ""It was the last thing I expected on a random Tuesday morning.""   "
"Anonymous to BART: We Hack. We Organize, Too","Anonymous, the loosely affiliated group of computer hackers, is planning a flesh-and-blood demonstration Monday afternoon in San Francisco to protest the Bay Area Rapid Transit cutting off underground cellphone service to thwart protesters. Since Thursday, when BART temporarily shut down cellphone service in its tunnels to prevent a protest against police violence, the group has gone on the offensive. It hacked into myBart.org, a Web site for BART riders, and leaked the names, phone numbers and passwords of users. Now it is calling for people to gather at the San Francisco Civic Center Bart Station at 5 p.m., wearing shirts stained with blood or paint. In addition to putting a call out on Twitter, the group said that it has sent an e-mail to the approximately 120,000 people it found on BART's own mailing list, asking them to attend. ""Remember to bring your mask, and remember that this is a peaceful protest. Anonymous does not support violent action and it is discouraged,"" the group said in a video posted online. While Anonymous's target is ostensibly the agency, leaking the names and passwords of riders has the potential to alienate those who it claims to support. The group acknowledged this danger, but ultimately blamed BART's poor security for the breach. ""We apologize to any citizen that has his information published, but you should go to BART and ask them why your information wasn't secure with them. Also do not worry, probably the only information that will be abused from this database is that of BART employees,"" the group wrote on the Web site where it posted the leaked information. Linton Johnson, a spokesperson for the BART police department, jumped on the chance to portray the agency as a victim, saying that Anonymous had violated riders' privacy. He said that BART has called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies to investigate the attack.  Anonymous has been very active in recent months, attacking the Web sites of major corporations and government agencies. But this action has been in the form of hacking attacks, not physical demonstrations. The group has held several large-scale demonstrations in the past, perhaps most notably a series of protests against the Church of Scientology in 2008. But previous protests took weeks of planning, said Gregg Housh, an advocate affiliated with Anonymous who played a role in physical demonstrations in the past. The speed at which such actions can be organized is changing rapidly, a trend that has been on display across the globe this year. ""It used to be months, then weeks, now it's days,"" he said. ""Soon it will be hours."" Of course, it is unclear how many people will actually show up on Monday. But BART is not taking any chances. On Sunday, it posted an alert on its Web site warning riders of possible disruptions due to the protest. Mr. Johnson, the agency spokesperson, said that as BART prepares for protests this afternoon and in the future, it would not rule out cutting cellphone service again. He said that the criticism the agency has received for its actions last week were misguided. ""The fact that people want to focus on the cellphone service, I think it's an interesting argument, but people are forgetting the other constitutional right that allows government agencies to put people's right to safety ahead of their right of expression,"" he said. ""We are allowed to designate the time, place and manner of free speech.""   "
Hackers Take Over NBC Twitter Account,"A Twitter account belonging to NBC News was hacked on Friday evening by an entity that claimed, falsely, that an airplane had crashed at the site of ground zero in New York.  The account was swiftly taken offline and the news division apologized. The incident was deemed serious enough that the news anchor Brian Williams read the apology out loud on the ""NBC Nightly News."" ""The NBC News Twitter account was hacked late this afternoon and as a result, false reports of a plane attack on ground zero were sent to @NBCNews followers,"" the statement issued by the news division and read by Mr. Williams said. ""We are working with Twitter to correct the situation and sincerely apologize for the scare that could have been caused by such a reckless and irresponsible act."" The NBC Twitter account had about 130,000 followers, only a fraction of whom likely saw the Twitter message when it was posted. Still, the false claim rippled across the short messaging Web site in a matter of minutes, alarming some people on a day of heightened anxieties about potential terrorist attacks. Authorities have warned of a nonspecific bomb threat possibly tied to the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The attacks will be commemorated at ground zero on Sunday. The false claim was knocked down with impressive speed on Friday, suggesting that both Twitter and news organizations are learning how to grapple with such incidents.  Ryan Osborn, the director of social media for NBC News, said he saw the hackers' Twitter message appear online about 40 seconds after it was posted. He was already logged into the account and quickly realized that the password had been changed. ""We are taking this breach very seriously,"" said Mr. Obsorn, who said the organization has existing security and password policies in place. Mr. Osborn contacted officials at Twitter, and he said they suspended the account within eight minutes, including the account that claimed responsibility for the hack. What helped minimize the spread of misinformation was that employees inside NBC News -- and others on Twitter who recognized that the account had been hacked -- immediately sent out tweets saying so. ""We have a great community throughout this building and throughout the Web,"" Mr. Osborn said. ""It was great to see people correct such terrible misinformation."" He added, ""For anyone who works in journalism, it is terrifying to see people not respect facts. It is scary."" Twitter declined to comment on the incident, citing a policy against commenting on individual accounts. In July, when a Twitter account belonging to Fox News was hacked and was used to disseminate false claims about President Obama, the Web site issued this series of tips about account security. Twitter said earlier this week that it now had about 100 million active users each month, some of whom depend on the service for news and information.   "
"Hacker, Cyclist, Executive, Spy"," Electricite de France, the giant power utility and the world's biggest operator of nuclear power plants, was found guilty on Thursday of spying on Greenpeace in a bizarre and convoluted computer hacking case that also ensnared the disgraced American cyclist Floyd Landis.  A court in Nanterre, near Paris,  fined E.D.F. 1.5 million euros, or about $2 million, for complicity in concealing stolen documents and complicity to intrude in a computer network. It also sentenced two E.D.F. security officials and two security consultants to prison terms and ordered E.D.F. to pay Greenpeace 500,000 euros ($680,000)  in damages.  The company had argued that it had itself been the victim, with the security consulting firm that it hired acting illegally without its knowledge.  The court also handed down suspended sentences of 12 months each to Mr. Landis  -  who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France victory after testing positive for elevated levels of testosterone  - and his coach, Arnie Baker. Both men, who have always maintained their innocence, were tried in absentia for having received stolen documents.  I wrote in detail about this unusual case two years ago, but to sum up, E.D.F. security officials, concerned about the environmental organization's anti-nuclear campaigns, paid a middleman to break into the computer of Yannick Jadot, the former campaign director of Greenpeace France. They ended up with a copy of his entire hard drive.The spying was only discovered after the French police began investigating a 2006 electronic break-in at a French antidoping laboratory, a trail that led them to Mr. Landis and to his coach, Arnie Baker, who were then fighting to clear Mr. Landis's name. The hacker turned out to have been hacking Greenpeace as well.  The judgment comes at an awkward time for E.D.F. As I noted in a post on Wednesday, the company is fighting public unease about the nuclear industry in the wake of Japan's Fukushima Daiichi disaster. What is more, the Greenpeace activists were focusing partly on E.D.F.'s troubled European Pressurized Reactor project, and the company is unlikely to welcome the renewed scrutiny.  Adelaide Colin, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace France, said the case ''should send another signal to any country considering building reactors that the nuclear industry can't be trusted.''  Carole Trivi, a spokeswoman for E.D.F., said the company had no comment. Mr. Landis, who has always maintained his innocence, could not be reached for comment.  Mr. Baker said he had nothing to do with any hacking.  ''I appreciate that a French court has exonerated me, found me not guilty, of hacking of the French National Anti-Doping Laboratory that tested Floyd Landis in the 2006 Tour de France,'' he wrote. ''The court has convicted me of having knowingly received hacked documents revealing testing irregularities from the French National Anti-Doping Laboratory that tested Floyd Landis in the 2006 Tour de France''  - documents that Mr. Baker acknowledges having, but that he says he thought had been obtained legally.    "
Hack a Mole,"MONTREAL - Something is amiss in Venezuela's Twittersphere: all of a sudden, opposition figures with a long history of criticizing the government of President Hugo Chavez have flipped, posting hearty praise for Chavismo and streams of invectives against their own camp. Has the government made a great leap in winning over new followers? Hardly. Instead, one after another, opposition figures have had their accounts taken over by progovernment hackers.  From comedians and TV scriptwriters to journalists and pollsters, all sorts of prominent tweeters have been targeted. It's happened so often that, as one joke has it, you're a nobody in the Venezuelan opposition if your Twitter account hasn't been hacked.At first it was easy to spot the tampering: overnight, the tweets went from broadly critical of the government to virulent, obscenity-laden ALL CAPS attacks on the opposition. In recent days, however, the hackers have become more sly. When the opposition-linked pollster Luis Vicente Leon lost control of his account last week, the messages on his feed criticizing Maria Corina Machado, one of the opposition's presidential candidates, were measured enough to be mistaken for Leon's real opinion. (The fake tweets questioned whether shots had indeed been fired at an event where she appeared.) As Venezuelan Twitter users wise up to the prevalence of tweet hacking and become more skeptical of out-of-character messages, the hackers are adapting their tactics for maximum impact.  That the Venezuelan government should be concerned about Twitter's explosive growth isn't surprising. As Arleen Ponce, a social-networks researcher at U.C. San Diego, puts it, ""people can find themselves in trouble if they're too open,"" and so anonymous accounts limit the risk of political engagement. Social networking tools have also considerably lowered the cost of organizing people.  The nongovernmental organization Radar de los Barrios (""Shantytown Radar"") brings together community activists in some 600 Caracas shantytowns. ""Working-class settlements here don't communicate much with one another,"" the group's director, Jesus Torrealba, says. Community activists often have little insight into what is happening in the next barrio just a few miles away. Twitter cuts through this isolation, helping create a network among independently minded activists who contest the government's policies. Though it hasn't been possible to pinpoint the source of the recent Twitter attacks, suspicion has naturally fallen on the government itself, not just because it often plays dirty to silence dissident voices but also because it owns and operates the Internet's backbone in Venezuela. After Milagros Socorro, the editor of the opposition news site CodigoVenezuela.com, had her account hacked, she received an anonymous email from a sympathizer working inside the Ministry of Science and Technology. It said that an entire floor of the ministry, staffed largely by Cubans, was devoted to tracking and hacking into opposition activists' online activities.  And the government didn't exactly dispel the distrust when it featured a communique by a self-described ""independent hacker group"" claiming responsibility for the attacks during prime viewing hours on the country's main propaganda television channel. Citing the prevalence of opposition voices as evidence, the statement claimed that Twitter was part of a U.S. government plot to destabilize the Chavez regime.  The use of underhanded tactics to disrupt the opposition's presence on Twitter is par for the course for Chavez's people. ""What they did to us on Twitter is just version 2.0 of the kind of thing the government has been doing for years in the 1.0 world -- the offline one,"" is how Torrealba puts it.  And to hear Torrealba, having your Twitter account hacked can be a blessing in disguise. Within minutes of being unexpectedly locked out of his own Twitter account, in early September, his feed was filled with vitriolic anti-opposition tweets. But the immediate and furious reaction of his followers crystallized how central Twitter had become to his organization's communications. ""Until then, I'd used it casually, almost in an amateurish way,"" Torrealba says. ""But after we were hacked, I realized our users saw it as a public service, a key way of getting out information about their communities they had no other way to expose.""  A few days after setting up a replacement account, Torrealba already had as many followers as with the previous account, and his organization was rethinking how to use Twitter from top to bottom. It is also picking more secure passwords.   "
Daily Report: A Legal Battle Over a Twitter User's Identity,"  Twitter once again finds itself at the center of a conflict over the right to anonymity on the Web, this time in a case involving a sympathizer with the Boston offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The Boston Globe reports that in a court hearing on Thursday in Boston, a lawyer working on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts will attempt to have a subpoena issued to Twitter quashed on First Amendment grounds. The police in Boston and the Suffolk County district attorney issued the subpoena in an effort to get information about the Twitter account @P0isAn0N and other activity on the social network related to the Occupy Boston protests. The owner of the @P0isAn0N account had also linked to personal information about Boston police officers that had been stolen in a hacking attack. Twitter has been a strong defender of its users' rights to protect their anonymity, a stance that puts it in conflict with others who say the Web would be a better place if anonymity was discouraged or disallowed. Last month the company lost a fight to withhold information about three users who were supporters of WikiLeaks. ReadWriteWeb reported on Tuesday that in the Boston case, Twitter apparently ignored the authorities' request that it keep the existence of the subpoena a secret. A link to a copy of the subpoena was posted by  @P0isAn0N, which taunted the Boston police about it. A Twitter spokesman said it was company policy ""to notify our users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so.""  The authorities in Boston face a challenge on another level. As BoingBoing pointed out, the subpoena appears to have been drawn up by someone who is unclear on the difference between a Twitter account and a hashtag.  "
Researchers Show How a Car's Electronics Can Be Taken Over Remotely,"With a modest amount of expertise, computer hackers could gain remote access to someone's car -- just as they do to people's personal computers -- and take over the vehicle's basic functions, including control of its engine, according to a report by computer scientists from the University of California, San Diego and the University of Washington. Although no such takeovers have been reported in the real world, the scientists were able to do exactly this in an experiment conducted on a car they bought for the purpose of trying to hack it. Their report, delivered last Friday to the National Academy of Sciences' Transportation Research Board, described how such unauthorized intrusions could theoretically take place.  Because many of today's cars contain cellular connections and Bluetooth wireless technology, it is possible for a hacker, working from a remote location, to take control of various features -- like the car locks and brakes -- as well as to track the vehicle's location, eavesdrop on its cabin and steal vehicle data, the researchers said. They described a range of potential compromises of car security and safety. ''This report explores how hard it is to compromise a car's computers without having any direct physical access to the car,'' said Stefan Savage of the University of California, San Diego, who is one of the leaders of the research effort. Given that the researchers were able to do it, they are now trying to pinpoint just how hard it might be for others, he said. The car security study is one of a growing array of safety concerns that are emerging as the Internet comes in contact with almost every aspect of daily life, be it through financial systems or industrial controls. Computer security researchers have long argued that wholesale computerization and Internet connectivity of complex systems present new risks that are frequently exploited first by vandals with malicious intent. The new report is a follow-on to similar research these experts conducted last year, which showed that cars were increasingly indistinguishable from Internet-connected computers in terms of vulnerability to outside intrusion and control. That project tried to show that the internal networks used to control systems in today's cars are not secure in the face of a potential attacker who has physical access to the vehicle. Their latest study was the first time that independent computer security researchers have tried to show how potential attackers could hack into a car from a remote location. As in their first experiment, the research teams bought a car they described as a representative example of a moderately priced sedan. (They declined to identify the brand, saying that advanced telematics are rapidly becoming commonplace within the automotive industry.) ''In the case of every major manufacturer, if they do not have this capacity in their mainstream products, they're about to,'' said Tadayoshi Kohno, an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. For example, services like General Motors' OnStar system, Toyota's Safety Connect, Lexus's Enform, Ford's Sync, BMW's Assist and Mercedes Benz's Mbrace all use a cellular connection embedded in the vehicle to provide a variety of automated and call center support services to a driver. These subscription services make it possible to track a car's location, unlock doors remotely and control other functions. In their remote experiment, the researchers were able to undermine the security protecting the cellular phone in the vehicle they bought and then insert malicious software. This allowed them to send commands to the car's electronic control unit -- the nerve center of a vehicle's electronics system -- which in turn made it possible to override various vehicle controls. ''These cellular channels offer many advantages for attackers,'' the report said. ''They can be accessed over arbitrary distance (due to the wide coverage of cellular data infrastructure) in a largely anonymous fashion, typically have relatively high bandwidth, are two-way channels (supporting interactive control and data exfiltration), and are individually addressable.'' The researchers declined to speculate about the worse situations, such as interfering with a vehicle's control system to make it crash. However, they noted that their research showed how a next-generation car thief might operate: instead of using today's so-called smash and grab tactics, the thief might be able to simply dial up a parked car, unlock its doors and turn on the engine, then arrive on the scene and drive off. In addition to the cellular telephone vulnerability, the report details similar weaknesses in other systems that allow remote access, including short range wireless networks like Bluetooth, network ports used for car maintenance and even internal CD players. The researchers noted that their report was about potential vulnerabilities and said there was no evidence that the safety loopholes they discovered had been used by criminals. They also said they believed that the automotive industry was treating the threats responsibly and working to improve the security of modern automobiles. ''Everyone has taken this extremely seriously,'' said Dr. Savage.  "
Google Accuses Chinese Of Blocking Gmail Service,"SHANGHAI -- Google has accused the Chinese government of disrupting Gmail in the country, making it difficult in the last few weeks for users here to gain access to the company's popular e-mail service.  Google said that it was not having any technical problems with Google's main Web site or Gmail service in China. ''There is no issue on our side; we have checked extensively,'' Google said in a statement released Sunday. ''This is a government blockage, carefully designed to look like the problem is with Gmail.'' Analysts who track Web developments say that the Chinese government may be intentionally disrupting access to Google and other Web services as part of a campaign to tighten Internet controls and censor material. Calls to China's Foreign Ministry were not returned Sunday. Beijing has long had some of the world's strictest Internet controls. But after pro-democracy demonstrations broke out in the Middle East in January, the Chinese government seems to have intensified effort to censor Web content and disrupt Web searches related to calls for similar protests in China. The controls come about a year after Google removed its Chinese language Internet search engine from China and relocated it to Hong Kong, where Beijing has few controls. Google said its decision had been prompted by a series of major attacks on its Web site by Chinese hackers. Google suggested at the time that the sophisticated hacking attacks had the backing of the Chinese government. The hackers stole some Google source code and also gained access to the private Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights advocates. Last March, the government sharply criticized Google's decision to relocate its search engine. In a statement to the official Xinhua News Agency, the government said: ''Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks.'' Google's search engines and Gmail are still accessible in China, but the government has the ability to block them. Many popular social media sites, including YouTube, which is owned by Google, as well as Twitter and Facebook, are blocked here.  "
"Russians Riled by Attacks on Blogging Service, Place for Unfettered Debate","MOSCOW -- For a few hours this week, the cacophonous discourse that typically reverberates through the Russian Internet went silent when cyberattacks crippled the country's top blogging service, Livejournal.ru. The attacks were short-lived, and it is unclear who was behind them. But they provoked such outrage here that President Dmitri A. Medvedev, who has his own Livejournal blog, personally ordered the police to look into the matter. With nearly five million users, Livejournal is immensely popular in Russia. Invented by an American college student, and now owned by a Russian company, Livejournal differs little from such services the world over, offering large helpings of celebrity gossip and racy photos.  Yet, in a country where press freedoms and public displays of dissent have been curtailed over the years, it has also come to serve a crucial social function. ''Livejournal is actually the only uncensored, uncontrolled and unmoderated channel for discussion,'' said Anton Nossik, a prominent Internet specialist and blogger. ''It is equally used by all sides of our political landscape, not only by the opposition, but by the president.'' Indeed, many government ministers and governing party officials now have Livejournal blogs, and they have become the targets not only of opposition leaders, but also of cynical teenagers and the occasional disgruntled retiree. Debates can be fierce and sometimes spill from the virtual world into the real, as when Oleg Kashin, a government critic famous for attacking officials on his Livejournal blog, was beaten nearly to death in November. Because of restrictions on the press here, it is often up to bloggers to expose corruption and other misdeeds by the authorities. Some, like Aleksei Navalny, a prominent anticorruption crusader, have become political forces in their own right. ''For me, there are no opportunities to publish materials about corruption in, say, Gazprom or Transneft,'' Mr. Navalny said, referring to Russia's large government-owned energy companies. ''Through Livejournal, I can bring this information to a few million people, which is comparable to a television audience.'' Unlike in countries like China and some other former Soviet republics, access to the Internet has largely remained unfettered in Russia. But for many, the recent cyberattacks have undermined a long-held assumption here that the Internet would remain free no matter how strictly other forms of media were controlled. Livejournal was hit twice this week by so-called distributed-denial-of-service attacks, which take down a target's server by overwhelming it with requests. It was attacked in a similar way on March 30. The Web site of the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta was also shut down for most of Friday, reportedly by attackers. Though the perpetrators remain unknown, many immediately blamed Russia's security services. ''Bloggers have obviously begun to represent a threat to many political forces and official media outlets,'' Oleg Kozyrev, a prominent blogger, wrote on Livejournal. ''Those who are independent and not indifferent have sent a challenge to the swamp of corrupt officials.'' Such fears were heightened on Friday when a representative of the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor of the K.G.B., suggested regulating use of online services like Gmail and Skype. ''The uncontrolled use of such services could represent a large-scale threat to the security of Russia,'' said Aleksandr Andreyechkin, the head of the agency's information security branch, the RIA Novosti news agency reported. Such statements would seem to contradict policies promoted by Mr. Medvedev. An iPad-toting blogger himself, Mr. Medvedev has spent much of his time in office promoting technological modernization, and sharply criticized the recent attack on Livejournal in his own blog post. ''I think these actions are outrageous and illegal,'' Mr. Medvedev said of the attacks in a statement posted Thursday. ''The administration of Livejournal and law enforcement agencies must sort this out.'' Ilya Dronov, the director of development at SUP, the Russian company that owns Livejournal, said the company was readying for new assaults. ''Someone wants Livejournal to cease to exist as a platform,'' Mr. Dronov said in a statement on his blog. ''The question now is whether we will succumb or not. This is war, and, alas, will not be without casualties.''  "
Sony Says PlayStation Hacker Got Personal Data,"Christopher Miller's PlayStation Portable game console had been broken for most of two years. So when his parents got him a new one for his 25th birthday on April 18, he was elated -- but only briefly. Last week, Sony's online network for the PlayStation suffered a catastrophic failure through a hacking attack. And since then, the roughly 77 million gamers worldwide like Mr. Miller who have accounts for the service have been unable to play games with friends through the Internet or to download demos of new games.  Then, on Tuesday, after several days of near silence, Sony said that as a result of the attack, an ''unauthorized person'' had obtained personal information about account holders, including their names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and PlayStation user names and passwords. Sony warned that other confidential information, including credit card numbers, could have been compromised, warning customers through a statement to ''remain vigilant'' by monitoring identity theft or other financial loss. Law-enforcement officials said Tuesday that Sony had reported the breach to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Diego, which specializes in computer crime. The breach comes after an incident earlier this month, when Epsilon, a marketing firm that handles e-mail lists, suffered a security breach that put millions of people's e-mail addresses at risk. In some instances, customers' names were also stolen. Last year, an AT&T breach exposed the e-mail addresses of at least 100,000 owners of the AppleiPad. Even before Sony's disclosure, complaints about the system failure had been mounting on Web sites, including Sony's own. ''It's ridiculous,'' said Mr. Miller, a 3-D animation student from Saline, Mich., in an e-mail. Other customers -- who have come to take the gaming network for granted -- said they were astonished by the failure's duration and its target, Sony, a globally recognized technology company. Some suggested that the incident, already a severe blow to Sony's reputation, would give its top video game rivals, Microsoft and Nintendo, a leg up in the console wars. ''Sony is pretty much doing everything wrong,'' said Carl-Niclas Odenbring of Releasy Customer Management in Sweden, which helps companies manage social media. Mr. Odenbring said his daughter, age 6, misses playing games on her Sony console, but is now playing on an iPad. ''She doesn't have any direct purchasing power, but her indirect influence in what my wife and I buy is enormous,'' he said. ''Sony is losing the battle over her.'' Last weekend, after the attack, Sony said it would rebuild the network to make it more secure. The Sony Qriocity service, which is used to stream audio and video to high-end Sony televisions, Sony Blu-ray players and other Web-enabled Sony devices, was also knocked offline. ''It is very unusual for Sony to completely rebuild a system after a security breach, rather than just stopping the bleeding and going back to some kind of restricted network,'' said Mark Seiden, a longtime information security consultant. ''The fact that two separate networks are involved in this security breach suggests Sony discovered a major underlying problem that already existed.'' It remains unclear who the hackers were. Anonymous, a well-known hacking group that has been blamed for previously attacking the Sony and PlayStation Web sites, denied any responsibility; the group's Web site stated, ''For once we didn't do it.'' Last Wednesday, Sony began posting sporadic messages that the PlayStation Network was down. In its first detailed statement on the attack, Sony told its customers on Tuesday afternoon that it had discovered that an ''illegal and unauthorized intrusion'' into the network had taken place between April 17 and 19. ''If you have provided your credit card data through PlayStation Network or Qriocity, out of an abundance of caution we are advising you that your credit card number and expiration date may have been obtained,'' Patrick Seybold, senior director for corporate communications at Sony, wrote in a post on the PlayStation Web site and in an e-mail to customers. Sony representatives declined to give further details. Sony said it expected to restore some services -- but apparently not all -- within a week. Shortly after Sony's announcement Tuesday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, sent a letter to Sony asking why customers had not been notified immediately about the security breach and not told for nearly a week about the extent of the attack. Mr. Blumenthal also cited concerns that many PlayStation users are children. The letter said Sony should provide PlayStation customers ''financial data security services, including free access to credit reporting services.'' One group of gamers who were particularly vociferous were the members of DC Universe Online, an online game. The game has been out of operation since the attack, affecting gamers who have paid for the service for months in advance. Other customers said they had had trouble connecting to the popular online streaming service Netflix through the PlayStation console. Daniel McGuire, a PlayStation user in London, in an e-mail criticized Sony's initial silence. ''Most PlayStation users would never cross over to the Xbox,'' he said, referring to Microsoft's rival console, ''but this situation is pushing people. If ever Xbox wanted to snatch PlayStation users, this would be the time.''  "
White House Wants Tougher Penalties for Computer Breaches,"WASHINGTON -- Almost two years after outlining a broad strategy intended to strengthen the security of the nation's computers and networks, the Obama administration said Thursday that it was sending proposed legislation to Congress that would strengthen penalties for any invasion of private computer systems. But the White House, in a briefing for reporters, said it had elected not to seek authority for stringent top-down regulations that would require companies to erect specific barriers to computer intrusions -- which corporations feared would be enormously costly and soon be outdated.  Instead, the administration is hoping to offer incentives that will persuade private industry to improve computer security voluntarily and have those standards reviewed by the Department of Homeland Security. ''The private sector has a huge incentive to secure its own systems and an incentive to do that work better by sharing that information more broadly,'' said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a policy group here. The administration made no mention of seeking authority for the president to hit a ''kill switch'' that would essentially shut off access to the Internet in the event of a national emergency or a broad-based computer attack meant to shut down financial markets or power plants. But administration officials said the Department of Homeland Security would designate certain privately run computer systems as part of a ''critical infrastructure'' over which the department would have enhanced authority. While the proposed legislation will address new American defenses against computer crime, it does not appear to deal with a growing cyberoffense capability in the American intelligence agencies and in the military. Billions are being spent on building weapons for attacking computer networks -- in part to deter cyberattacks on the United States. While those programs are highly classified, the United States is believed to have played a major role in the software-based attacks on Iran's nuclear program, and recently Iran announced the creation of a cyberforce of its own. The international component of the strategy will be addressed on Monday, according to several policy specialists, who have been invited to a White House briefing with John O. Brennan, the deputy national security adviser. The White House said it would release proposed language for the new legislation on Thursday evening, and the text of different sections of the proposal were placed online by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, during the day. By increasing and clarifying the penalties for computer crimes, and giving the homeland security agency a clear mandate for the protection of the government's own networks, the administration hopes to reverse a growing perception that the penalties for attacks on government, corporate and personal computers have been comparatively trivial. Just in the past few months, companies including the EMC Corporation and Sony have experienced major breaches of security. In some cases, the digital identity information for millions of customers has been stolen. In addition to giving the Department of Homeland Security new authority over federal computer systems, the proposed legislation calls for the agency to work with energy companies, water suppliers and financial institutions to rank the most serious threats and find ways to counter them. The new law would require each business to have an independent commercial auditor assess its plans, and, in the case of financial firms, report those plans to the Security and Exchange Commission. A senior homeland security official, who declined to be identified during a telephone news briefing on Thursday under ground rules set by the administration, said the administration had shied away from a stronger regulatory approach because it believed ''it did not have all the answers.'' ''Nor do we believe that it's appropriate for the government to say, 'Thou shall do X, Y and Z', '' he said. Privacy groups said that the administration's proposals did not appear to put in place strict enough controls to protect personal information against potential government surveillance. ''There should be legal standards, not voluntary guidelines,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington policy group. Six major bills addressing computer security have been introduced in the past two years and the administration must now work to get Congress to adopt its language. On Thursday, members of Congress welcomed the administration's draft while saying that it did not cover as much ground as legislation that has already been proposed. ''I commend the president for sending us a package of cyberinitiatives,'' said Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York ''This is a good step forward, but we must also address the growing international cyberthreat.''  "
"Internet Piracy and How to Stop It: A Senate bill has commendable goals, but needs some work before it can be law","Online piracy is a huge business. A recent study found that Web sites offering pirated digital content or counterfeit goods, like illicit movie downloads or bootleg software, record 53 billion hits per year. That robs the industries that create and sell intellectual products of hundreds of billions of dollars.  The problem is particularly hard to crack because the villains are often in faraway countries. Bad apples can be difficult to pin down in the sea of Web sites, and pirates can evade countervailing measures as easily as tweaking the name of a Web site. Commendably, the Senate Judiciary Committee is trying to bolster the government's power to enforce intellectual property protections. Last month, the committee approved the Protect IP Act, which creates new tools to disrupt illegal online commerce. The bill is not perfect. Its definition of wrongdoing is broad and could be abused by companies seeking to use the law to quickly hinder Web sites. Some proposed remedies could also unintentionally reduce the safety of the Internet. Senator Ron Wyden put a hold on the bill over these issues, which, he argued, could infringe on the right to free speech. The legislation is, therefore, in limbo, but it should be fixed, not discarded. The bill defines infringing Web sites as those that have ''no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or facilitating'' the illegal copying or distribution of copyrighted material in ''substantially complete form'' -- entire movies or songs, not just snippets. If the offender can't be found to answer the accusation (a likely occurrence given that most Web sites targeted will be overseas), the government or a private party can seek an injunction from a judge to compel advertising networks and payment systems like MasterCard or PayPal to stop doing business with the site. The government -- but not private parties -- can use the injunction to compel Internet service providers to redirect traffic by not translating a Web address into the numerical language that computers understand. And they could force search engines to stop linking to them. The broadness of the definition is particularly worrisome because private companies are given a right to take action under the bill. In one notorious case, a record label demanded that YouTube take down a home video of a toddler jiggling in the kitchen to a tune by Prince, claiming it violated copyright law. Allowing firms to go after a Web site that ''facilitates'' intellectual property theft might encourage that kind of overreaching -- and allow the government to black out a site. Some of the remedies are problematic. A group of Internet safety experts cautioned that the procedure to redirect Internet traffic from offending Web sites would mimic what hackers do when they take over a domain. If it occurred on a large enough scale it could impair efforts to enhance the safety of the domain name system. This kind of blocking is unlikely to be very effective. Users could reach offending Web sites simply by writing the numerical I.P. address in the navigator box, rather than the URL. The Web sites could distribute free plug-ins to translate addresses into numbers automatically. The bill before the Senate is an important step toward making piracy less profitable. But it shouldn't pass as is. If protecting intellectual property is important, so is protecting the Internet from overzealous enforcement.  "
3 Detained in Spain In PlayStation Attack,"The Spanish police said on Friday that they had apprehended three men suspected of computer hacking in connection with recent attacks on Sony's PlayStation Network as well as corporate and government Web sites around the world. The National Police identified the three as the local leadership of the shadowy international network of computer hackers known as Anonymous, which has claimed responsibility for a wide variety of attacks. Anonymous is composed of people from various countries organized into cells that share common goals, the police said, with activists operating anonymously in a coordinated fashion.  One of the three suspects, a 31-year-old Spaniard, was detained in the southern Spanish city of Almeria sometime after May 18, the police said. He had a computer server in his apartment in the northern Spanish port city of Gijon, where the group is believed to have attacked the Web sites of the Sony PlayStation online gaming store. The same computer server was also believed to have been used in coordinated attacks against two Spanish banks, BBVA and Bankia; the Italian energy company Enel; and government sites in Algeria, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Libya, Iran, Spain and New Zealand, the police said. The two other men, both also Spaniards in their early 30s, were picked up in Barcelona and Valencia. The police statement did not make clear the timing of those detentions, but a police spokeswoman said all had occurred recently. The spokeswoman, who did not want to be identified in accordance with department policy, said all three were subsequently released, without bail, pending formal charges. They were expected to be charged with forming an illegal association to attack public and corporate Web sites, a charge that carries a potential sentence of up to three years in prison. The police opened their investigation last October, after hackers overwhelmed the Spanish Ministry of Culture's Web site to protest legislation increasing punishments for illegal downloads. It was not immediately clear how much of a role the group may have played in the recent attacks on Sony. About a dozen Sony Web sites and services around the world have been hacked; the biggest breaches forced the company, which is based in Tokyo, to shut down its popular PlayStation Network for a month beginning in April. The Japanese company has acknowledged that hackers compromised the personal data of tens of millions of user accounts. Earlier this month, a separate hacker collective called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, said it had breached a Sony Pictures site and released vital source code. Sony has estimated that the hacker attacks will cost it at least 14 billion yen ($175 million), in damages, including spending on information technology, legal costs, lower sales and free offers to lure back customers. Mami Imada, a Sony spokeswoman in Tokyo, said she had no information on the detentions and declined to comment. The police said that they had analyzed more than two million lines of chat logs since October, as well as Web pages used by the group to identify the leadership in Spain ''with the capacity to make decisions and direct attacks.'' Members of Anonymous used a computer program called L.O.I.C. to crash Web sites with denial-of-service attacks, the police said. Among recent attacks, the hackers also brought down the site of the Spanish National Electoral Commission last month before regional and municipal elections. It was that attack, on May 18, that led to the detention of the suspect in Almeria. The movement against the antipiracy law has been closely linked to the broader youth-led political movements that have occurred in Puerta del Sol, the central square in Madrid, and in other city squares since May 15. These protests have called for a complete overhaul of Spain's political system and laws aimed at stopping illegal downloading.  "
How Greek Debt Could Hurt U.S.,"Europe is still embroiled in Greece's sovereign debt crisis. It has been more than a year in the making, allowing many American financial firms time to slash even their indirect exposure. But money market funds are still sitting on $360 billion worth of European bank short-term debt. That leaves open a trans-Atlantic channel for Greek turmoil to play havoc with United States markets. True, the largest money market funds, which American savers see as alternatives to deposit accounts, have cut back lending to banks in peripheral countries like Italy and Spain and shut the door on those in Portugal and Ireland. But they've carried on their love affair with bigger European banks.  Moody's last week put Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale on notice for a possible downgrade because of their potential exposure to a Greek default. Yet money market funds have loans outstanding to French banks of around $200 billion, according to JPMorgan estimates. That's about 12 percent of the assets under management, a proportion that hasn't changed much over the last year, according to a Fitch survey of the 10 largest prime money market funds, despite Greece's financial woes. This indirect exposure creates a potential flashpoint for American money market funds. As the events of 2008 showed, if a fund falls below par value -- known colloquially as breaking the buck -- investors can be badly rattled. And the temporary federal government backstop put in place during the crisis is no longer in force. Money market funds probably wouldn't sit tight if a Greek default looked certain. They might not immediately start dumping European debt, but they'd be apt to lend for much shorter periods of time -- a sign of stress that broader financial markets could amplify. Meanwhile, another European rescue for Greece is in the works. That would ease the pressure on European banks and American funds. But a Greek default could still be inevitable in the end. It's odd that money market funds haven't yet taken advantage of several reprieves to minimize their exposure. It may simply be that they find it tough to find alternative places to invest. But whatever the reason, there's still at least one financial Trojan Horse lurking in United States territory. Anti-Hacking Overkill Amid a global blitz of computer crime, accidental hackers risk going to prison. An American anti-hacking law is so broad that it may make any breach of an employer's computer policy a crime. Recent attacks against Citigroup, Sony, the International Monetary Fund and others feed demand for stiffer penalties. But prosecutors should avoid overkill with fat-fingered users of PCs and Macs. Take the case against David Nosal, an executive recruiter. He is accused of getting information from his former employer's computer system through an ex-colleague and using it to help his competing business. If that's how it happened, the move violated the company's policy and possibly amounted to the theft of trade secrets. But hacking? That's essentially the charge Mr. Nosal faces under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or C.F.A.A., an anti-hacking law that prohibits unauthorized use of computers. A California federal appeals court upheld the charge in April, but was asked last week to reconsider. The panel previously said employers' policies defined what was ''authorized,'' allowing prosecutors to argue that Mr. Nosal's breach was criminal. Saying it is criminal for a Social Security Administration employee to fish unauthorized through confidential databases sounds reasonable. But allowing arbitrary corporate policies to define the law can easily seem excessive. That was true in Mr. Nosal's case, as well as in an earlier conviction under the law, that involved a case of bullying by computer. In that case, Lori Drew, a Missouri homemaker, was convicted of breaching MySpace's policies. That was overturned, after a judge found that the federal statute was too vague when applied in that case. The problem with the act remains. If violating any company or Web site policy is potentially illegal, then even someone who checks personal e-mail or a racy Web site at work could theoretically end up in prison. That's surely not the intended result. Rather than fix that problem, the Obama administration and lawmakers want to toughen the law. The House on May 25 considered a proposal to make all violations of the act felonies and increase maximum sentences to 20 years from five. But if Congress wants to get serious about hacking, it should first define the crime sensibly. For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.  "
British Police Charge Teenager in Connection With Hacking Attacks,"LONDON -- As suspects go, Ryan Cleary did not look dangerous: a pale 19-year-old who looked five years younger, wearing a white skateboarding T-shirt and track pants, standing nervously in a courtroom here on Thursday. But charges by the British police link Mr. Cleary to a hacking group called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, which has been on an Internet crime spree in recent weeks, attacking Web sites and computer networks including those of the United States Senate, the Central Intelligence Agency and Sony.  The British tabloids have been quick to cast Mr. Cleary as the young criminal mastermind behind LulzSec, calling him ''Hack the Lad'' in front-page headlines. His mother, Rita, has said her son is highly intelligent but has a history of mental illness, including agoraphobia. His lawyer, Ben Cooper, described Mr. Cleary as ''a vulnerable young man.'' Though it is not clear how much notoriety he deserves, Mr. Cleary's arrest has made him a focus of the public fascination with a wave of computer hacking cases, carried out by amorphous online collectives. The police say Mr. Cleary is guilty of illegally using a computer to perform denial of service attacks -- bombarding Web sites with so many automated messages that they shut down. They say his targets were organizations including the British Serious Organized Crime Agency. In the hierarchy of computer hacking, the accusations against Mr. Cleary and the actions of LulzSec fall broadly into the category known as hacktivism. Hackers of this type are not motivated by money, but are mainly interested in protesting against or antagonizing their targets, or in showing off technical skills. Hacktivists, according to computer security experts, are a different breed from mainstream cybercriminals, who seek financial gain. Such criminals, for example, manipulated Citigroup's Web site to steal the personal information of credit card holders. The third category, experts say, are warriors, either working in the ''cybercommands'' of governments like those of the United States and other countries, or for mercenary or terrorist groups. They defend computer networks, power grids and state secrets of their own country, while devising tactics to attack enemies. Hacktivists tend to portray their activities as digital sit-ins, a form of protest. But security experts say their attacks often cause real damage to computer networks and financial losses. LulzSec has been more aggressive than most, and more brazen in its choice of targets. ''This is organized criminal activity that is typically distributed across many different countries,'' said Mark Rasch, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department, who is director of security for CSC, a computer services company. ''It's a serious crime.'' On Thursday evening LulzSec released what it said were hundreds of internal documents from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, including material related to border patrol and counterterrorism operations. It said it was taking aim at the agency because of Arizona's anti-immigrant policies. A Department of Public Safety spokesman, Capt. Steve Harrison, said the documents appeared to be authentic but were sensitive, not confidential. Hacking has been a pursuit of mischievous young men -- and they are nearly all men -- since shortly after computers were invented. But the Internet made it an increasingly international pursuit. The intruders quickly became power users of online bulletin boards and Internet chat software, using those tools to communicate and organize activities. ''Hackers were among the first to figure out the benefits of social networking,'' said Alan Brill, a senior managing director of Kroll, a security consulting firm. The far-flung hacker networks present a formidable challenge for law enforcement. But in recent years, they and prosecutors have more and more formed their own international networks of communication, sharing information across borders. Mr. Cleary's arrest, for example, involved cooperation between Scotland Yard and the F.B.I. LulzSec, on a Twitter feed that it uses to communicate with more than 250,000 followers, has said that Mr. Cleary is ''at best mildly associated with us.'' The group did not respond to a Twitter message seeking comment for this article. LulzSec, experts say, is a splinter group from Anonymous, another online hacking collective. Anonymous is best known for its attacks last year in support of WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange. The group went after the Web sites of companies like MasterCard and PayPal, which had refused to process donations to WikiLeaks after it disclosed confidential diplomatic cables. Earlier this year, said Barrett Brown, a former Anonymous activist, ''some of the most prominent leaders and hackers broke off and are now LulzSec.'' The two hacker groups certainly strike different poses. LulzSec's statements and its actions display a spirit of exuberant anarchic glee. Lulz, in essence, means mean-spirited laughter, and LulzSec's Web site describes the group as ''a small team of lulzy individuals who feel the drabness of the cybercommunity is a burden on what matters: fun.'' The group is strongly antagonistic to the media. When a TV journalist for Russia Today asked for an interview, she was told it would be granted only if she and her producer wore shoes on their heads and wrestled in mud while singing. They declined. There seems to be far less glee in the Anonymous culture. In a YouTube video describing the group, a voice intones: ''There is no control, no leadership, only influence. The influence of thought.'' Later, the video adds that Anonymous's actions have ''brought justice to our world.'' LulzSec's exploits have riled others in the hacker world who object to its activities, particularly exposure of personal information of innocent Internet users. Those people are now working to stop LulzSec by investigating its members' identities and providing information to the F.B.I. The core LulzSec group, according to Mr. Brown, the former Anonymous activist, numbers between five and 10. Mr. Brown said the members he had dealt with -- known by online nicknames like Topiary and Sabu -- are mostly men in their early 20s. Mr. Brown said he had dealt with Mr. Cleary, and that he believed -- contrary to LulzSec's statement -- that he was involved with the group. But a person involved with Anonymous, who declined to be named for fear of prosecution, said Mr. Cleary was peripheral. On Thursday the court agreed to delay Mr. Cleary's application for bail while police investigated. Hacker networks and their activities are murky by design, said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer of the British company BT Group. LulzSec, Mr. Schneier said, ''is a badge, a name you call each other if you're one of the cool hacker kids now.''  "
Sony Cuts Howard Stringer's Pay Package as Chairman by 15%,"The Sony Corporation, reeling from Japan's biggest earthquake and a huge data breach, cut the pay of its chairman, Howard Stringer, and his probable successor.  Mr. Stringer's salary and bonus fell 15 percent, to 345 million yen ($4.3 million) for the 12 months ended March 31. That was a drop from 408 million yen a year earlier, Sony said in filings to the government. Sony also pared compensation for Kazuo Hirai, Sony's executive deputy president, who is Mr. Stringer's top lieutenant and possible successor. Mr. Hirai's pay was set at 101 million yen, excluding stock options, down from 110 million yen in the previous period. Mr. Stringer told shareholders at an annual meeting on Tuesday that online services would continue to be a main source of growth for Sony even after hacker attacks crippled its PlayStation Network. The company, losing ground to Apple and Samsung Electronics, last month reported its widest annual net loss in 16 years and predicted that the March 11 earthquake and the online attacks would erode about $2 billion from operating profit this fiscal year. Mr. Stringer, 69, a Welsh-born American citizen who joined Sony in 1997, was made chairman and chief executive in 2005. Over the six years that ended March 31, Sony has lost more than 37 percent of its market value. He was also granted 500,000 shares as stock options last year, unchanged from the previous period, according to the documents. Sony had earlier this month proposed an 11 percent cut in salary and bonuses for board members and corporate executive officers in the year ended in March, according to an invitation for the annual shareholders meeting posted on its Web site.

Sony Cuts Its Forecast For the Year After a Loss,"TOKYO -- Sony slashed its annual profit forecast after sinking to a quarterly loss of 15.5 billion yen, or $199 million, on Thursday, as the lingering effects of the Japanese earthquake, a punishingly strong yen and lackluster TV sales affected its bottom line. The electronics and entertainment company, which is based here, said in a statement that it now expected net income of 60 billion yen ($770 million) for the fiscal year that ends March 31, 2012, revising an 80 billion yen ($1 billion) projection it made just two months ago.  Sony also cut projected sales for the year to 7.2 trillion yen ($92.4 billion) from a previous forecast of 7.5 trillion yen ($96.3 billion). The company said that its net loss for the April through June period, the first quarter of its fiscal year, compared with a profit of 25.7 billion yen ($330 million) for the same quarter a year earlier. The slide was significantly higher than the loss of 2.5 billion yen ($32 million) estimated in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts. Sony said that the quake and tsunami damage to factories in northeastern Japan came to about 5.3 billion yen ($68 million) for the quarter, though some of that cost would be offset by insurance. It also said the recovery from the March 11 quake was progressing ''faster than anticipated.'' Meanwhile, Sony has been battling weak demand for its high-end Bravia TVs amid growing global economic woes and heightened price competition. Though Sony had brisk sales in Japan before the country's switch this month from analog to digital broadcasting, sales in the United States and Europe were sluggish, the company said. Slower personal computer and video camera sales helped to bring sales of Sony's consumer products division to 732.3 billion yen ($9.4 billion), down 17.9 percent from the same period the previous year. A strong yen -- about 13 percent stronger against the dollar in the latest quarter, compared with the previous year -- further hurt Sony's profit. A strong Japanese currency makes Sony products more expensive, and therefore less competitive, overseas. It also erodes the company's overseas earnings when they are repatriated. Sony also suffered a series of hacker attacks on its Web sites and online services, including its popular PlayStation Network, which the company was forced to shut down in April. The network was fully restored this month, but not without damaging the reputation of Sony's online business. The company said that user logins to the PlayStation Network in North America had returned ''to a similar level as before the cyberattacks.'' Sony Ericsson, Sony's long-suffering mobile phone joint venture with the Swedish telecommunications giant, posted a dismal quarter, with sales down 32.1 percent from the comparable period last year. Sony said the poor performance resulted from a lack of critical components in the wake of the earthquake and from a decline in shipments of cellphones as consumers shifted to more advanced smartphones. Sony's movie division was a bright spot, with sales up 9.3 percent in the quarter from the previous year to 144.4 billion yen ($1.86 billion) on home entertainment releases of titles like ''The Green Hornet.'' Sales at Sony's music division fell 0.6 percent to 109.6 billion yen ($1.4 billion), however, despite a new release from Beyonce and albums tied to the hit TV show ''Glee.'' Still, Sony has two products in its pipeline that it hopes will lift sales. The company has said it will soon sell its first tablet computer, joining a flurry of companies trying to recreate the success of Apple's iPad. Sony is also set to introduce its next-generation portable video game player, the PlayStation Vita, later this year. Shares in Sony on the New York Stock Exchange fell 52 cents, or 2 percent, to $25.08 on Thursday. In Japan, Sony shares have fallen 30 percent this year, far underperforming Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average, which has slipped just over 3 percent.  "
"In Blunt Report to Congress, U.S. Accuses China and Russia of Internet Spying","WASHINGTON -- American intelligence agencies, in an unusually blunt public criticism of China and Russia, reported to Congress on Thursday that those two foreign governments steal valuable American technology over the Internet as a matter of national policy. Both China and Russia hide behind the anonymity of proxy computers and dispersed routers in third countries to pilfer proprietary corporate information to accelerate their own economic development, according to the new intelligence assessment. They have also targeted the computer networks of government agencies and universities, the report said.  American officials have for years hinted that China and Russia were leading suspects in the Internet theft of economic secrets, and those accusations have appeared as scattered commentary in government reports. Google has accused China twice in two years of broad Internet intrusions targeting its users. However, American officials, when pressed, have said that pinpointing the culprits remained difficult in cyberspace, and they also usually emphasized that specific complaints of computer-network espionage were best raised in private government-to-government channels. In contrast, the new intelligence study, compiled as a report to Congress on foreign economic and industrial espionage over the past two years, presents a pointed case that China and Russia are the leading actors in the Internet theft of economic secrets. ''The computer networks of a broad array of U.S. government agencies, private companies, universities and other institutions -- all holding large volumes of sensitive economic information -- were targeted by cyber espionage,'' the report said. ''Chinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage,'' it added. ''Russia's intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from U.S. targets.'' The governments in Beijing and Moscow, and their intelligence services, contract with independent hackers to expand their capabilities and cloak responsibility for the computer intrusions, the report said. Even friendly nations spy on the United States via computers. The report warns that ''some U.S. allies and partners use their broad access to U.S. institutions to acquire sensitive U.S. economic and technology information.'' In addition, some of the efforts to steal American economic, technical and trade secrets are conducted by foreign corporations, by organized criminal groups and by individuals. Internet espionage exists within the United States, but it is subject to domestic criminal law, and intelligence officials underscored that the United States does not conduct economic espionage as a matter of national policy. Senior officials in China also state unwaveringly that their government opposes computer-based espionage. In July, during a news conference in Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said, ''The Chinese government opposes hacking in all its manifestations.'' Most computer-network espionage against American economic targets has focused on these areas, according to the study: information and communications technology; assessments of supplies of scarce natural resources; technologies for clean energy and health care systems or pharmaceuticals; and military data, especially maritime systems, and air and space technologies. The report is the collective assessment of 14 American intelligence agencies and was compiled by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, which reports to the director of national intelligence. Although it described the theft of economic and trade information as a national security threat, the study says there are no reliable estimates of the monetary value of the losses. ''Many companies are unaware when their sensitive data is pilfered, and those that find out are often reluctant to report the loss, fearing potential damage to their reputation with investors, customers and employees,'' the study said. The report concludes with a series of recommendations for strategies to determine how open a company needs to be on the Internet, programs for assessing threats from inside a company, efforts to manage data more effectively, and an emphasis on network security and auditing. That last category could include real-time monitoring of computer networks for intrusions, muscular software to protect files, the encryption of corporate information as well as better programs to authenticate users.

Congress Asks Sony to Address Unanswered Questions; Bits,"A House subcommittee sent a followup letter to Sony on Tuesday after the company failed to answer a number of questions regarding an attack on its PlayStation Network last month. In the letter, which was addressed to Kazuo Hirai, the head of Sony's consumer electronics business, lawmakers thanked Sony for answering some of the previous questions the group asked last month, but said it still had a number of questions to answer. The original letter was sent on April 29. Both letters were written by the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, and signed by the group's chairwoman, Representative Mary Bono Mack, Republican of California. The committee has been actively discussing bringing new legislation to Congress that would protect consumers in future privacy breaches.  Although Sony responded to the first letter, it said it was unable to answer several of the subcommittee's questions as it was still actively investigating the type of consumer  information stolen during the attacks. Ms. Bono Mack said in the latest letter that the subcommittee was asking the questions again because  ""more time has passed, enabling further investigation of the incident, and particularly in light of the news that Sony restarted its PlayStation Network on May 14, 2011."" Sony also declined to testify at a recent privacy hearing held by the committee. This post has been updated to correct Kazuo Hirai's title.  "
Q&A: Deauthorizing iTunes From Afar,"Q.I had purchases from the iTunes Store authorized on three of my computers -- one personal computer and two machines at work. The office I.T. guys swapped out my work computers but I forgot to deauthorize iTunes on them before they wiped the hard drives clean. Now what, since Apple only lets me authorize a few computers? A.Apple lets you ""authorize"" up to five computers at a time to play copy-protected music, movies and other content purchased with your iTunes Store account. (Music in the iTunes Plus format does not contain digital-rights restrictions, but songs purchased before early 2009 and most commercial videos have it built in.)  So what do you do when you hit that five-computer limit and you no longer have access to all of your authorized machines? Start by logging into your iTunes Store account on one of the computers you can still get to; click on the Account link on the iTunes Store home page to get there.  In the account sign-in box, enter your iTunes Store user name and password and click on the Account Info (or View Account) button. The top part of the Account Information screen lists the number of computer authorizations you have made. When you have five computers authorized, you should see a Deauthorize All button. Click the button to deauthorize all your computers at once. (Apple notes you can only use the Deauthorize All button once a year.) Now that you have deauthorized all your machines, you can re-authorize each one you still have by clicking on a copy-protected purchase in your iTunes library and entering your iTunes Store name and password. Apple has more information on iTunes Store authorizations here.  "
"Even at the Laugh Factory, Losing Data Is No Laughing Matter","Jamie Masada will never forget the phone call last year that alerted him to the erasing of a chunk of his business and of his life. The call came from a manager at the online backup-storage company to which Mr. Masada had entrusted what might well have been the world's most valuable collection of stand-up comedy video - 1,500 hours of acclaimed comics performing on the stage of Mr. Masada's groundbreaking Hollywood comedy club, The Laugh Factory. Some of the video was historic, including Rodney Dangerfield's earliest performances and stars like Dave Chapelle and Dane Cook honing their acts before hitting it big. And much of it existed only on the servers of the data storage company. Or had existed, because the manager was calling to tell Mr. Masada that his data had been lost, irretrievably, in a catastrophic series of mishaps. ""I had copies of some of it, but not all of it,"" Mr. Masada said. ""I hung up the phone and wept."" For Mr. Masada, the ordeal was particularly tough to take, not only because of the volume and value of the lost data but also because he had actually taken the trouble to safeguard it by entrusting it to a professional backup service. (Mr. Masada declined to identify the service, insisting he doesn't badmouth anyone as a matter of policy.)  To be sure, such professional outfits are generally pretty good at what they do, and the chances that an established backup service like Carbonite or Mozy will lose your data is less than tiny - especially compared to the chances that you'll lose it yourself if you don't back it up at all or if you keep it backed up on disks in your office or home that can be lost to theft, flood, fire or a malfunctioning device. But as Mr. Masada can tell you, online storage isn't a fail-safe solution. Mr. Masada is an ebullient wiseguy who sounds as if he could hardly have ended up anywhere else in life but in comedy. Although you wouldn't guess it to listen to his nonstop kidding, he also runs a pretty sophisticated enterprise. ""I love technology,"" he said. ""Whenever anything new comes out from Apple, Google, Intel or anyone, I'm all over it. I learn what I can about it."" With a second Laugh Factory in Long Beach, Calif., and a third opening in Chicago in a few weeks with yet another to follow in Las Vegas, Mr. Masada realized a few years ago that he needed to be able to run the business remotely, so he brought in two tech specialists to help him. ""I know some Disney wizards who help me, too,"" he said. Today, Mr. Masada can be anywhere in the world and get up-to-the-minute updates on how many people are entering each of his clubs and how many drinks they are consuming. The drink data is also compared to liquor inventory data and the cash take at the bar, information that helped Mr. Masada quash what turned out to be a substantial employee-pilferage problem. And he can get a live video feed of the performances, too. ""If I see a good comic isn't killing, I have to figure out why,"" he said. ""Maybe he's a low-energy comic, and we shouldn't have put him on after a high-energy one. I'll call the booker right away and say, 'Do me a favor, have this guy lead off next time, O.K.?'"" He also runs a slick Laugh Factory Web site. And he's cut a deal to have live performances streamed to smart televisions in 3-D. ""Anyone anywhere will be able to see the show like they're in the front row,"" he said. ""They'll be able to tell who's sweating."" From the beginning, he has also been videotaping performances religiously, switching to high-definition as soon as it was available several years ago. At about 10 gigabytes per hour of HD video, Mr. Masada's trove of data grew rapidly. And he was also smart enough to know that sort of valuable data deserved special protection, which is why after asking around for advice he decided to pay an online storage service $1,200 a month to keep the best of it safe for him. Oops. After the disaster, the backup company explained to Mr. Masada the unlikely chain of equipment and procedure failures that led to the loss and assured him they had taken herculean measures to try to recover the data, all to no avail. The loss wasn't insured, but rather than taking legal action - suing, after all, is a form of badmouthing  - Mr. Masada rethought his data protection strategy. Understandably, he became determined to keep a close eye himself on his remaining video library, as well as on the rapidly growing volume of video he continues to accumulate. Once again he asked around, and this time he decided to buy a $7,500 storage drive from Drobo, choosing a model that holds more than 1,000 hours of HD video. He keeps it right in his office, where he can watch the lights glow, letting him know all is safe. ""I could have gotten a cheaper unit,"" he said. ""But with this I can sleep at night."" Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Masada relies entirely on the Drobo for backup - he has no backup for his backup, online or otherwise. Drobo's somewhat pricey drives are highly regarded, and let's hope he won't be so astoundingly unlucky as to suffer another freak loss of data. But I suspect the lesson here for most of us isn't related to the choice of online versus local hard drive backup - either way, chances are strong you'll be fine. Rather, the lesson is that given the growing value of our data, it makes sense to avoid putting all of your eggs in one basket. Personally, I back up online, to an external hard drive and then again to DVDs kept in a fireproof safe. What do you do?   "
RIM Reacts to Bring-Your-Own Devices Policies,"OTTAWA -- The maker of the BlackBerry announced details on Tuesday of how it will try to bring some BlackBerry features to Apple iPhones and iPads as well as smartphones and tablet computers running Google's Android operating system. Research in Motion operates its own highly secure global network for BlackBerry services. When it works, that network gives corporations and institutions that use BlackBerrys high data security. For consumers with BlackBerrys, it also speeds up Web browsing, lowers their data charges and make the popular BlackBerry Messenger service possible. Failures in that network, such as a widespread one last month, can leave BlackBerry users in the dark, however. While Tuesday's announcement was followed by a rise in the price of RIM's shares, analysts said that the new service, which will not be available until March, is unlikely to significantly alter the company's fortunes. In a Webcast primarily aimed at corporate and government customers, Alan Panezic, the vice president for enterprise product management and marketing at RIM, said the move was driven by the large number of corporations that are letting employees choose their own smartphones. Currently those companies must operate both RIM's BlackBerry Enterprise Server software and also buy software to support iPhones and Android phones from a company like Good Technology to ensure security of corporate data. In contrast, BlackBerry Mobile Fusion, an expanded version of BlackBerry Enterprise Server software, will allow companies to support all of those phones with a single piece of software, Mr. Panezic said. Among other things, corporations will be able to remotely shut down phones operating through the system, monitor activity on individual handsets and switch applications on and off. It will still be necessary, however, to use a BlackBerry handset to gain access to full BlackBerry mail, which is more efficient and faster than other wireless e-mail systems. The new software will also allow companies to remotely control BlackBerry PlayBooks, RIM's struggling tablet computers, once a long delayed software update for the PlayBook is released next year. It is supposed to include significant features, such as an e-mail program, which are missing from the current version. While RIM's network is often overlooked, except when it fails, it is a significant part of the company. Some analysts calculate that subscriptions and other fees generated by various services based around the network produce about $1 billion a month in cash for RIM. If so, it is providing the company with a significant cushion as it continues to lose market share in North America. It hopes to reverse that trend with a new line of phones based on a new operating system next year. In a note to investors, Mike Abramsky, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that while the announcement was positive, the challenge ""to RIM's enterprise device share from Apple/Android is expected to intensify, particularly in the absence of more competitive BlackBerry devices."" While some companies and other institutions will most likely buy BlackBerry Mobile Fusion, the rise of Android phones and iPhones has prompted others to question the cost and value of RIM's network, particularly for organizations that do not deal in highly confidential information. While RIM is not yet disclosing the cost of Mobile Fusion, the current version of BlackBerry Enterprise Server software costs about $4,000 for 20 users. Technical support and setup charges add to that expense, and sometimes additional servers need to be bought. Last month, Purdue University said that it would shut down its BlackBerry Enterprise Server at the end of 2012. While it cited a sharp decline in the number of BlackBerrys on campus as the primary reason for the decision in its announcement, the university also cited the cost of operating the special server. The university said that there were only 284 BlackBerry users on its system, 300 fewer than in January. It now supports more than 8,000 phones using other operating systems.   "
"Batman, the Flash Drive","Batman, the crime fighter who protects the streets of Gotham, can now protect your data. Mimoco has added Batman to its line of Mimobots, the USB flash drives that look, well, flashy.  Fans love Mimobots because they combine pop culture with functionality: they hold 2 GB to 16 GB of data, and they look stylish sitting on your desk or plugged into your laptop. As a bonus, the Mimobots, which cost from $20 to $60, come preloaded character-specific content, including wallpaper, screen savers, avatars and sound features. Mimoco's licensing deal with Warner Brothers includes Batman, Robin, the Joker, Catwoman and a limited-edition Batman, clad in a vintage 1939 black-and-gray costume. Additional characters from DC Comics, including Green Lantern, Superman and the Flash, are expected soon. The Mimobot line also includes original characters as well as licensed characters from the ''Star Wars'' movie franchise and Sanrio, the creator of Hello Kitty. Collaborations with artists include designs from FriendsWithYou, Tokidoki, David Horvath and Gary Baseman. The sound features, which include sound effects, music and random quotes, are surprisingly fun. The Yoda Mimobot, for instance, says things like ''You must feel the Force around you'' and ''Beware of the dark side'' when you plug it in or remove it from a computer. Alas, the Batman Mimobot does not include sound features. Typical Batman, stoic as ever. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Complaint Seeks Punishment for Classification of Documents,"WASHINGTON -- In a rare symbolic strike against unnecessary government secrecy, the government's former classification czar has filed a formal complaint against the National Security Agency and Justice Department seeking punishment of officials who classified a document that he says contained no secrets. The former official, J. William Leonard, said that in his 34 years with the federal government he saw routine overclassification of government documents, rarely saw it challenged and never saw it punished. But now that the Justice Department is seeking to imprison government workers for leaking classified information to the news media, Mr. Leonard said, it is especially critical to make sure that only genuine secrets are protected by law.  ''If you're talking about throwing someone in jail for years, there absolutely has to be responsibility for decisions about what gets classified,'' said Mr. Leonard, who directed the Information Security Oversight Office from 2002 to 2007. He said in an interview Monday that he filed a formal complaint on Saturday with his former office, seeking to force the two agencies to take disciplinary measures against officials who violated classification rules. Under the executive order governing classification, the punishment could include dismissal, suspension without pay, reprimand or loss of a security clearance. The document Mr. Leonard singled out was an N.S.A. e-mail entitled ''What a Success'' that was among classified material Thomas A. Drake, a former senior N.S.A. official, was accused of illegally storing at home and disclosing to The Baltimore Sun. Before Mr. Drake's scheduled trial in June, prosecutors dropped the major charges against him under the Espionage Act. Mr. Drake admitted to a misdemeanor, got no prison time and paid no fine. The judge, Richard D. Bennett of Federal District Court in Maryland, berated prosecutors for how they handled the case. Mr. Leonard had agreed to testify for the defense without pay as an expert in government classification, saying the e-mail should never have been classified. The N.S.A. declassified the e-mail before trial, but its contents are still protected by court order. Mr. Leonard was allowed to read the e-mail but cannot disclose its contents other than to say it contained no secrets. ''I've never seen a more deliberate and willful example of government officials improperly classifying a document,'' he said. Even after the criminal case against Mr. Drake collapsed, Mr. Leonard said, he was outraged by the fact that the document had been classified in the first place and then used as the basis for a felony charge. He petitioned Judge Bennett for permission to use the still-protected e-mail in his complaint to the Information Security Oversight Office, and Judge Bennett agreed to allow that in a court order on Friday. Spokeswomen for the N.S.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment. According to the information security office, officials classified nearly 77 million documents last year, a 40 percent increase in one year, though the office said the jump resulted in part from improved reporting by government officials. Many government veterans agree that far too much information is classified. ''Depending on who you ask, overclassification is either very widespread or extremely widespread,'' said Steven Aftergood, an expert on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. ''Everybody from the director of national intelligence to President Obama has acknowledged the problem.'' The Obama administration's crackdown on leaks has hugely raised the stakes for whistle-blowers. Mr. Drake is among five people charged with disclosing secrets to the news media under Mr. Obama, compared with three under all previous presidents. While bureaucrats regularly get in trouble for failing to classify information their bosses think should be secret, Mr. Aftergood said he had never heard of anyone being punished for unjustified classification. He praised Mr. Leonard's complaint as an effort to restore some balance. Under Mr. Obama's 2009 order on classification, all agencies are supposed to review secret material by next June to see what can be declassified. But Mr. Aftergood said there was little evidence that agencies were working hard toward that goal. ''My hope is that Mr. Leonard's complaint will lend some impetus to the process,'' he said.  "
Q&A: Keeping Adobe Reader Secure,"Q. Adobe Reader seems to want to update itself a lot. What is it doing and do I have to do all these updates?A.Like many software makers, Adobe updates its Reader and Acrobat software to fix bugs, patch security holes and occasionally add new features. The updates are typically quarterly, but may be more frequent if the need arises. Some of the more recent updates for Adobe Reader are intended to fix security issues in the software, so it is a good idea to download and install these patches to keep your computer as protected as possible. Adobe's in-house security blog at blogs.adobe.com/psirt gives full explanations of what the company is fixing in its Acrobat and Reader software, as well as for Flash player updates. When updating or reinstalling its Reader software, you should download the updates through the Reader program with the Check for Updates item under the Help menu - or by configuring the program's Updater settings to automatically download updates. In an Adobe blog post, Adobe warns that messages offering Reader upgrades by e-mail or asking for registration information are part of a phishing scam; Adobe advises its users to always download the software free from its site.

"Hackers Gained Access to Nasdaq Systems, but Not Trades","Computer hackers have breached the systems of the company that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange in New York but did not penetrate the part of the system that handles trades, Nasdaq said Saturday. The exchange's operating company, Nasdaq OMX, said in a statement that it had discovered suspicious files on its United States servers, and that it immediately began conducting an investigation in conjunction with outside firms and federal law enforcement agencies. Government and law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation said it was being handled by the F.B.I.'s cybercrimes branch along with the Justice Department. These officials also said it appeared that the trading platform was not breached.  An attack on banks and other pillars the financial system has long been a top fear of government officials because of the potential for harm to the economy. Nasdaq is one of the country's largest stock exchanges, and many of the nation's most important companies use it to list their shares for trading. If there were evidence that hackers could breach the inner trading systems, it could cause jitters among the companies listed on the exchange and the traders and investors who buy and sell millions of shares each day. But Nasdaq and market experts said there was an important distinction between the parts of the system that are connected to the Web, and thus more vulnerable, and the architecture for the trading platform, which Nasdaq says operates independently. The company said it had determined that a Web-based application on its servers called Directors Desk, on which corporations can store and share information, might have been affected. Nasdaq said the suspicious files ''were immediately removed and at this point there is no evidence that any Directors Desk customer information was accessed or acquired by hackers.'' ''At no point was any of Nasdaq OMX's operated or serviced trading platforms compromised,'' the company said. The company's Web site says Directors Desk has 5,000 users. A spokesman for the company said it discovered the suspicious files late last year. The fact that investigators discovered suspicious files suggests that the breach involved the installation of malicious software, or malware, said Ed Stroz, a former FBI agent who is co-president of Stroz Friedberg, a firm that investigates cyberattacks. In attacks on companies, Mr. Stroz said, hackers often plant malware that acts as a back door, which allows them to deliver other malicious programs to do other tasks, which could include copying sensitive data and delivering it to the intruder. Malware could have been installed any number of ways, including with an attack through the Web interface of Directors Desk or by infiltrating an executive's computer by tricking him into opening an attachment or clicking on a link to a malicious Web page in an e-mail. Nasdaq now handles about 19 percent of stock trading in the United States, compared with 27 percent by the larger New York Stock Exchange and its electronic trading arm. In a statement, the New York Stock Exchange said: ''We take any potential threat seriously and we continue working at the highest levels of security and integrity.'' The N.Y.S.E. would not say whether there had been any attempts to breach its systems or whether it had been contacted by federal investigators. News of the breach was originally reported in The Wall Street Journal. Nasdaq said it had refrained from notifying its customers of the breach at the request of the Justice Department, ''in order to facilitate the continuing investigation,'' but that when the Journal article appeared it consulted with authorities and decided to send out notice. The Journal article said the investigation showed some evidence pointing toward Russia. One government official said investigators were specifically looking into that possibility, although the official said, ''I don't know what the basis for the belief is.'' The stock exchanges and the trading that takes place on them have become increasingly computerized, potentially making them more vulnerable to manipulation or attack. Like Nasdaq, the N.Y.S.E. has also adopted more electronic trading. And in the last five years or so, other electronic exchanges like Direct Edge and BATS Exchange have arisen, intent on prying trading away from the two bigger markets. Direct Edge and BATS each handle about 10 percent of the market. A spokesman for the BATS Exchange said it had never had any hacking issue of this kind. A spokesman for Direct Edge, Rafi Reguer, said it was continually monitoring its systems but was not aware of any serious attempt to penetrate its computers.  "
7 Charged In Web Scam Using Ads,"It was a subtle swap: a cheesy advertisement for a vacation timeshare atop the home page of ESPN.com, in a spot that might have been claimed by a well-known brand like Dr Pepper. Those who saw swapped advertisements, federal prosecutors say, might never have known that their computer had been drawn into a complex Internet advertising scam that they say generated $14 million for its creators. Over the last four years, a group of men in Eastern Europe quietly hijacked millions of computers worldwide and diverted unsuspecting users to online advertisements from which they could profit, federal law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.  Six men, all in their 20s and early 30s, are under arrest in Estonia for what the United States attorney's office in New York called ''a massive and sophisticated Internet fraud scheme.'' A Russian suspect in the case remains at large. The malicious software infected four million computers, including 500,000 in the United States, the prosecutors said. The software was so subtle that most people using an infected computer were probably unaware of it. It was a two-pronged scheme, prosecutors said. One component involved redirecting clicks on search results to sites that were controlled by the defendants. A search for ''I.R.S.,'' for instance, would lead a user to the Web site of the tax preparer H&R Block. The sites to which users were directed would pay the swindlers a referral fee, prosecutors said. The more traffic they could redirect, the more fees they collected. The other way the group made money, according to the indictment, was to swap legitimate online advertisements on certain Web sites with others that would generate payments for the defendants. Prosecutors said that Web sites for ESPN and The Wall Street Journal were affected -- but only when viewed on the infected computers. ''On a mass scale, this gave new meaning to the term false advertising,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a press conference in Manhattan. The security firm Trend Micro, which was among several private companies that helped federal officials with the investigation, called it the ''biggest cybercriminal takedown in history.'' The group running the scheme had 100 command-and-control servers worldwide, the company said, one of which was in a data center run in New York. The scheme came to light after 100 computers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration were found to have been infected. The malicious software spread through infected Web sites. The most serious aspect of the scheme was that it attacked part of the scaffolding of the Internet: the domain name system, or D.N.S., which links the numerical addresses of Web sites with more user-friendly addresses like irs.gov. ''When people start attacking infrastructure, it creates the potential for a rogue version of the Internet,'' said David Dagon, a computer security expert at the Georgia Tech College of Computing who helped federal authorities in the investigation. Unlike more traditional malware that ferrets out valuable personal information, the group's program was not designed to steal data, so it was not easily detected, private security consultants said. It manipulated the infrastructure of the Web to do what it does every day in great volumes: display advertising. All six of the Estonian defendants were in the custody of Estonian police. Four of them also face charges in that country. One of them, Vladimir Tsastsin, 31, has been previously convicted of money laundering in Estonia, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He is identified with a company called Rove Digital, which investigators say ran the operation's infrastructure. According to the indictment, the malware also staved off antivirus software updates, which meant that an infected computer could not detect that it was infected. This also made the machine vulnerable to other security bugs. The malware affected both Windows and Mac operating systems. On its Web site, the F.B.I. outlines how to detect this particular program and how to get rid of it. Mr. Bharara described the scheme as ''cyber infestation of the first order'' that reflected the global nature of Internet fraud.  "
A Temporary Decline in Spam?,"Call it a Christmas gift from the cybercrime underground. The number of spam e-mail messages circulating on the Internet tumbled at the end of December after the world's largest spamming operation mysteriously went dark on Christmas Eve. A network of malware-infected computers known as the Rustock botnet, which is widely believed to be Russian-operated and had been responsible for about half of all spam across the globe, ''appears to have completely gone of the map and is yet to resume,'' said Matt Sergeant, senior anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs, a unit of the security-software maker Symantec.  Rustock simply stopped sending spam, he said, adding that no one really knows why. It has, though, he said, continued to engage in another type of online crime known as click fraud, in which bogus clicks are used to defraud advertisers who pay for Web traffic by the click. At the same time, two other smaller botnets known for sending spam also dropped off for unknown reasons. The Lethic botnet went quiet on Dec. 28, and the Xarvester botnet on Dec. 31. ''Did the people in charge of these botnets suddenly go on vacation? Symantec wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. ''Currently there are no explanations on why these botnets stopped spamming.'' The upshot, though, is that global spam volumes dropped to about 30 billion messages a day from about 70 billion before Christmas, according to MessageLabs. The decline added to a downward trend under way since August, when spam peaked at some 200 billion spam messages a day, or 92.2 percent of all e-mail. The firm attributes the general decline to a reduction in spamming by botnets, which accounted for 88 percent of spam until their activity began trailing off in the latter part of the year. One theory for why Rustock and the other botnets stopped spamming is that an important source of business may have dried up. In late September, a large spam ring, SpamIt.com, ceased operations, after an investigation by Russian authorities. SpamIt had paid spammers to promote online pharmacies primarily. Without SpamIt, perhaps, ''at least for now, there's no content to fill the spamming cannons that Rustock has,'' said John Reid, of Spamhaus, a nonprofit group that tracks spammers. Or they could be intimidated. In addition to going after the man behind SpamIt, Russian authorities recently arrested two spammers in Taganrog, a port town in southern Russia, who had a database of nearly two billion United States and European Union e-mail addresses they had used to spread malicious programs, according to a December report by the HostExploit blog. ''Even if the people were unrelated, the chilling effect of arrests can cause others to lay-low for a while,'' Mr. Reid said, adding, ''But all this is speculation.'' Or it could just be the calm before the storm. ''They might be revamping for some new campaign,'' said Andre' M. Di Mino of The Shadowserver Foundation, a group that tracks malicious online activity. ''They might be taking a break for awhile. But the infrastructure is still there. This just looks to be a pause.'' Internet security experts did not think the decline will be permanent. ''I honestly think the impact of this will be short lived,'' Mr. Sergeant of MessageLabs said, pointing out that spamming is a lucrative business. Others will likely pick up where these groups left off, he said, and these groups could return to spamming at any time. ''All we can do is enjoy this current calm and wait for it to start back up again,'' he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"Spam, a Lot","For a moment, it seemed as if the new year might just deliver us from spam. Last summer, spam volumes started declining around the world, from about 250 billion messages a day in July -- almost 40 for each woman, man and child in the world -- to about 100 billion a day in November. Then, on Dec. 25, the Rustock botnet, the biggest spam generator, vanished from the Internet. (Two other smaller ones dropped off, too, a few days later.) Volume plummeted to fewer than 30 billion a day.  We are sorry to shatter your hopes. Rustock kicked back into operation on Monday, bombarding the world with 14 billion pieces of spam, mostly about pharmaceuticals, through a vast network of infected computers that generate spam without their owners knowing. Internet safety experts caution that the rebound will probably continue. In 2008, spam plunged by three-quarters when McColo, a hosting company in California, was shut down. But the hosting was simply moved to other servers and spam levels recovered quickly. This time security experts don't understand quite what was driving the decline. Some suggested the controllers of Rustock might have just gone on vacation. Governments are struggling against this nuisance. In December, Canada was the last of the wealthy nations in the Group of 8 to pass legislation that would penalize businesses that distributed unsolicited commercial e-mail in Canada. The problem is that products pitched with spam are often as shady as the networks, and everyone involved is unlikely to fear such fines. Spam is hard to stamp out because it is so cheap to send. In 2008, researchers estimated that it cost $80 for each million messages. The trick is how to make it more expensive. In April 2002, the South Korean Internet portal Daum created an online stamp system to charge bulk e-mailers up to 0.8 cents per message to send e-mail to its subscribers. Inbound bulk e-mail fell by more than half in the first few months of the fee. Service providers responded by boycotting Daum's service until it dropped the bulk e-mail fee a few years later. And spam returned.  "
"Lion's Upgraded, Robust Security Features","New bells and whistles aren't the only reason to upgrade to Lion. The new version of Apple's operating system for the Mac also includes updated security features. Macs have long been safer than Windows PCs, because they are very rarely targeted for attack, likely due to the Mac's much smaller marketshare and to crooks' extensive expertise in writing malware for Windows. But now, they are also more secure than PCs, thanks to several key security improvements in the operating system itself, Mac OS X 10.7 ($30 download from the Mac App store). So says Dino A. Dai Zovi, an independent security consultant. Those operating-system features now put Lion ahead of Windows 7, the latest version Microsoft's operating system, whose leadership was forged from the fire of relentless attacks by hackers and malware writers, he says. The move comes while OS X remains a virtual malware-free zone, but concerns are rising that that won't last. Quite a few Mac users were hit by ""scareware"" program known as MacDefender this spring. Amid rising cybercrime and Mac's growing marketshare, many experts expect more to come.  Amid an increasing need for caution, ""Apple put a lot of security features in the iPhone,"" Mr. Dai Zovi says. ""But on the Mac they haven't really put in a lot of security features until now."" After all, why bother with locks if no one is trying to get in? But today, there is good reason: dissuading attackers from ever trying, and knocking them back if they do. ""They're increasing the security protections as the bull's-eye gets bigger,"" he says. Here are the top three new Mac security measures, according to Mr. Dai Zovi: Sandboxes - Apple has embraced ""sandboxing,"" technology that restricts what an application can and can't do and forces it to play only in its own little sandbox. Apple's take on sandboxes-applications cannot read or write data in any app but their own-is stricter than that of Microsoft and Adobe, Mr. Dai Zovi says.  Many Apple applications are sandboxed in Lion, including the Safari Web browser and the Preview application that's used to view PDF files and images. This is welcome, considering that Web sites and Adobe files are the favorite vehicles of malware today. It means that a virus from the Web would be stuck in Safari and unable to grab assets elsewhere in your computer. Even better, says Mr. Dai Zovi, starting in November, Apple will require that all applications sold in its Mac App store use this sort of sandbox by default. The requirement will end what has been an honors system in which Apple trusts, but does not enforce that requirement. In the past, for example, Apple could not be sure that Skype won't read cookies stored in your browser and log into your Gmail account. Sandboxed, Skype wouldn't be capable of that-and neither would that random product purchased from a fly-by-night start-up.  Apps sold in the store will also be subject to security checks by Apple, which could make the Mac App store the safest place to buy software for your Mac. It will work a lot like Apple's store for mobile apps, where nary a malicious application has been seen. Address Space Layout Randomization - It's a mouthful, but it's very good for you. ASLR, which involves rearranging memory in an application, makes it significantly harder for hackers to exploit software vulnerabilities because they don't know where their potential targets are located.  Snow Leopard used ASLR in a limited way, and ""if it's not complete, it's almost a waste,"" Mr. Dai Zovi says. Lion, however, implements ASLR fully, catching Macs up to Windows and Linux.  So far, most Mac attacks have involved ""social engineering"" to trick users into installing something malicious, not the sort of automated download that ASLR defends against. ""Apple is being proactive here,"" he says. ""It's likely that, as the Mac platform gains marketshare, they will see this type of malware."" FileVault 2 - Lion includes Apple's second stab at data encryption for your computer. In Snow Leopard, FileVault only encrypted users' home directories, the place where most user files are kept. The program was also slow and didn't work well with Time Machine, the Mac backup system.  With Lion, however, FileVault delivers full-disk encryption and encrypted data in Time Machine backups and on removable drives. This change means that if your laptop (or USB stick) is lost or stolen-arguably Mac users' biggest security risk-your data is safe. You do have to be careful not to get locked out yourself. As a safety net, you can have Apple store a recovery key for you, should you forget your password, or you can print it out and stash it in a safe place. So is all this a reason to upgrade to Lion immediately? Not necessarily.  With the security threats so limited, it isn't vital to have these features right now, Mr. Dai Zovi says. ""There are always a few rough edges in an initial release, and there might be some incompatibilities with various applications,"" he says. ""These kinks are usually worked out by the .1 or .2 releases, and that would be a better time for most users to upgrade.""  "
Facebook Fights a Nasty Spam Attack,"Facebook said a deliberate spam attack was behind a flood of graphic images that some users had reported seeing in their news feeds. The issue, which first surfaced last week, had largely been resolved by late Tuesday, said Frederic Wolens, a spokesman at the company. Mr. Wolens said the attack lured users into copying and pasting a Web address into their browser with the promise of showing them a neat video or telling them who was viewing the profile. Instead, that Web site installed malicious software that began filling their news feeds with violent and pornographic images without their knowledge. Mr. Wolens declined to say how many users had been affected, but did say it was ""a small minority."" Facebook said no user data or accounts were compromised during the attack. ""Our team responded quickly and we have eliminated most of the spam caused by this attack,"" the company said. ""We are now working to improve our systems to better defend against similar attacks in the future."" Some around the Web have speculated that Anonymous, the hacker movement, might be responsible for the attack. But Facebook said it the attack had been designed for financial gain. The junk posts sent users to affiliate sites that could generate revenue for the spammers.    "
"Creating Art Via Webcam, Secretly","E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt For three days last month, an artist named Kyle McDonald secretly programmed computers at two Apple stores in Lower Manhattan to shoot a webcam picture every minute. As people squinted, frowned, glared, grinned, grimaced, snarled and other ways looked at the screens, their pictures were snapped, silently. Then the photos were automatically sent to Mr. McDonald's server. Having collected 1,000 pictures, Mr. McDonald, 25, created another little program and returned to the two stores, one on 14th Street and the other on Prince Street. This time, after a picture was taken, it was immediately put into an array of older photos that would begin running across the screens.  Suddenly, people sitting at the computers were looking at pictures of themselves that dissolved into photos of others who also had gazed into the screens. ''Most people instinctively quit the app less than 10 seconds after recognizing their own face,'' Mr. McDonald wrote on a Web site for the project, titled, ''People Staring at Computers.'' No one in the stores got angry, he said: ''During the exhibition, people were just confused and laughed.'' Apple, however, was not amused. On July 7, two days after Mr. McDonald posted his project on the Web, he was awoken by Secret Service agents at his home in Brooklyn. They had a warrant to search for evidence that he violated the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and they left with his laptop. Then lawyers for Apple contacted Web sites that hosted video made by Mr. McDonald, including Vimeo and Tumblr, and told them the material might violate the law, that a criminal investigation was going on, and that they'd better take down ''People Staring at Computers.'' They did. Cyberspace may be vast, even infinite, but every centimeter of it is being contested by businesses, botnets, governments, lawyers, artists, technologists, ethicists, soldiers, scientists and spies, among others. So far, the territory appears to be ungoverned by any power except brute force or ingenuity, and then only fleetingly. Invisible hackers can take over the Web sites of Murdoch papers for a few hours; Apple's lawyers can shut down an art exhibit with sternly worded letters to server hosts; pirates can confiscate music, movies and writing without the slightest nod to intellectual property rights; big businesses can force the removal of parodies that embarrass them. Hosni Mubarak can try to unplug the Internet, but a disconnected country quickly turns out to be as unendurable for the powerful as it is for the powerless. What about taking pictures of people without their permission in the Apple stores? On the Mashable Web site, where Mr. McDonald's story has been closely followed, many commenters debated the ethics or etiquette of taking pictures of unsuspecting people. WAS it reasonable for people in a commercial space -- private property -- to expect privacy? Web sites are always collecting data on users without telling them, as an extraordinary series of articles in The Wall Street Journal showed last year. Yet these were Apple's computers: did Mr. McDonald have the right to use them for his own project? Well, the Apple retail stores in New York are filled at all hours with people who have come in to try out the latest and greatest, but also by wandering armies who use the stores, with their broadband connections, as free auxiliary offices. ''There are no limitations or conditions when you use those computers,'' said Gerald Lefcourt, a prominent lawyer who is representing Mr. McDonald. ''He was using that which was available to him or to anyone else. He didn't violate the law, and he certainly had no intention to violate it.'' Apple did not reply to a request for comment, and a spokesman for the Secret Service said the agency would not discuss the investigation. The main host of the ''Staring at Computers'' project was the Web site of a group of artists, Free Art & Technology, and it, too, received the letter from Apple demanding that it be removed. ''I don't want to unduly put Kyle in any more trouble than he already is in, and it didn't seem like the time to fight a free speech issue that we don't have the money to fight anyway,'' said Evan Roth, who administers the site. Forced to censor the project, Mr. Roth came up with a low-cost response. He kept the pictures from the stores on the Web site -- but posted a mask on each one. The face on all the masks: Steve Jobs.

About Two Dozen Arraigned in Credit Card Fraud Scheme,"About two dozen people have been charged with stealing credit card data and using it to make counterfeit credit cards that they used to buy and resell goods across the country, according to an indictment filed on Tuesday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  The ring stole nearly $1 million, using the forged credit cards to buy items like iPods and MacBooks in cities including New York; Los Angeles; Indianapolis; Orlando, Fla.; and Las Vegas, according to court documents. The defendants, some of whom were arraigned on Tuesday, have been charged with numerous counts of grand larceny and possessing forged instruments. The top count of second-degree grand larceny carries a sentence of up to 15 years. The indictments were the result of a joint investigation by the Cybercrimes Unit of the Manhattan district attorney's office and the United States Secret Service. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, is expected to announce the indictments at a news conference on Wednesday. Shaheed Bilal, one of the defendants, used a Yahoo e-mail account to receive, send and store the stolen credit card information, according to the indictment. Even after he was jailed last May, the indictment says, Mr. Bilal still directed the operation by giving instructions by telephone to Ophelia Alleyne, who has also been charged. Thousands of stolen credit card numbers were recovered in the e-mail account of Mr. Bilal, said Elizabeth Roper, an assistant district attorney who spoke in court. One of the primary members of the operation, Ms. Roper said, was Gil Einhorn, who had hundreds of thousands of dollars moving in and out of his bank accounts. Mr. Einhorn was seen on surveillance footage accepting ''large bundles of items believed to be stolen electronic goods,'' she said. Mr. Einhorn's lawyer, Steven Kartagener, said, ''I'm confident in the end, when all the facts come out, this fundamentally decent young man will be vindicated.''  "
Guilty Plea in Theft of Data About iPad Owners,"1:49 p.m. | Updated Adding no comment from AT&T and the amount of Mr. Auernheimer's bail. A  San Francisco man who was accused of  taking  information on 114,000 iPad 3G owners from AT&T's servers pleaded guilty on Thursday. According to the New Jersey attorney general's office, Daniel Spitler, 26, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computers connected to the Internet, and one count of identity theft. Mr. Spitler is expected to be sentenced on Sept. 28. Each charge could result in up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Mr. Spitler was arrested last year along with Andrew Auernheimer, known online as Weev, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that they had collected  e-mail addresses and unique identification numbers that could be tied to iPad 3G owners. The two men said they had gained access to the data through a loophole on AT&T's Web site.   Mr. Auernheimer is expected to be arraigned later this year. He is currently free on $50,000 bail. The case gained national attention because the stolen e-mail addresses included those of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and employees of the Justice Department, NASA and the Department of Homeland Security. There were also a number of celebrities on the list. Mr. Auernheimer passed the information along to the gossip blog Gawker. An AT&T spokesperson declined to comment about the case. The charges were filed in New Jersey because AT&T's servers are housed in the state. The attorney general's office said the investigation was led by the F.B.I.'s Newark Cyber Crimes Task Force, which investigates computer crimes including data breaches and identity theft.  "
Hackers Claim Small Breach on Apple Site,"A group of hackers who have attacked a number of Web sites in recent months said Sunday that they had stolen a small number of internal passwords and usernames from an Apple server. The information was supposedly taken from a server used by Apple for online surveys and did not belong to the public or Apple customers. The data was posted publicly on pastebin, a file-sharing Web site. Anonymous, the group claiming responsibility for the attack, is believed to be working closely with hackers who were involved in Lulz Security, a hacker group that disbanded last week after attacking a number of sites over the past two months, including PBS.org, the United States Senate, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the Web site of a company associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The latest breach, which only contains 27 internal Apple usernames and passwords, is a relatively small amount of data compared with attacks on other companies, but it underscores the potential for other attacks by Anonymous. Apple could not be reached for comment to confirm whether the information was stolen from the company. In the Twitter message about the data breach, hackers said Apple could become a larger target but that members were currently busy with other goals. ""Apple could be target, too. But don't worry, we are busy elsewhere,"" the group wrote in the message. Earlier this month Lulz Security claimed it had breached Apple's iCloud servers, which are used for the company's cloud music and photo service that is expected to begin later this year, but the group never posted any information online. This breach and other recent attacks on corporate and government Web sites are part of a growing movement by hackers called Anti Security, or AntiSec online. The public stated goal of this movement is to expose loopholes and software vulnerabilities on corporate and government Web sites and servers. Security experts and law enforcement see the string of AntiSec-labeled attacks as a justification by hackers to wreak havoc online.  "
AntiSec Hackers Hit F.B.I. Contractor,"Hackers who have claimed responsibility for a spate of recent break-ins said on Friday that they had infiltrated the networkof IRC Federal, an engineering contractor that works for federal agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and stole internal documents from its database and e-mail system. The group, which is a part of the hacktivist collective Anonymous and includes members of the defunct group Lulz Security, also said it had defaced IRC Federal's Web site. The firm has taken the site down.  A spokesman for IRC Federal said it was investigating the claim. ""We reported it to the authorities, and otherwise we have no comment.""  In a statement online that was decorated with a digital drawing of a mushroom cloud, the group complained that IRC Federal had been ""selling out their 'skills' to the US empire. So we laid nuclear waste to their systems, owning their pathetic windows box, dropping their databases and private emails, and defaced their professional looking website."" The group, which has been waging a campaign called AntiSec against what it calls corrupt corporations and governments, said it found within IRC Federal's e-mails documents that included a proposal to develop for the F.B.I. a ""Special Identities Modernization (SIM) Project"" that it said would protect records associated with ""trusted individuals,"" while revealing the identities of individuals who might pose a terrorist or criminal risk to the United States. It claimed it also found fingerprinting contracts for the Justice Department and biometrics development for the military. It also cited ""strategy contracts"" for the ""National Nuclear Security Administration Nuclear Weapons Complex.""  The F.B.I. declined to comment. The incident follows arrests earlier this week of 15 alleged members of Anonymous in Italy and Switzerland, aged 15 to 28, in raids in which 32 homes were searched by police. Last month, three men in Spain and 32 people in Turkey were arrested in connection with online attacks by Anonymous.  The collective has promised to retaliate, and has claimed break-ins at Italian universities and to have brought down hundreds of Turkish Web sites.  "
Bug Labs and Ford Team Up on Geeky Gear for Cars,"Get ready to start hacking your own car. Bug Labs, an open-source hardware and software company, has teamed up with Ford Motor to experiment with ways to let people add new electronic components to their cars. The New York-based Bug Labs makes a product called a Bug that lets people tack together a number of plastic modules, including GPS systems and cameras, that can be used to create personalized electronic gadgets. Ford now hopes to apply the same concept to its cars. The companies announced the new partnership Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco.  Peter Semmelhack, founder of Bug Labs, said in a phone interview that the goal was to allow Ford owners to plug in new hardware - cameras, fuel monitors, GPS - without a need for  programming skills or an engineering degree. ""It's going to be as simple to update your car as it is to use a Bug: just plug it in, download some software and you're good to go,"" Mr. Semmelhack said. Ford will adopt a technology called OpenXC for its cars that Bug Labs is using as a research platform.  Mr. Semmelhack said OpenXC would allow developers to  work on hardware and software for cars without having to learn a new platform. K. Venkatesh Prasad, a director in Ford's Infotronics Research & Advanced Engineering labs, detailed some possible Bug-Ford scenarios. ""We've been experimenting with a an in-car fuel monitor, so you can see how green your driving is,"" he explained in a phone interview. ""But we've also added connectivity to the Internet so you can see how your fuel consumption compares to other drivers."" Mr. Prasad said Ford could eventually offer plug-and-play hardware for older cars, where people could purchase inexpensive hardware components and then download apps for their car.   "
Ex-Citadel Employee Charged With Stealing Trade Secrets,"5:03 p.m. | Updated  A former employee of the hedge fund Citadel has been arrested and charged by federal authorities in Chicago with stealing trade secrets from the investing powerhouse. The criminal charges come six weeks after an Illinois civil court granted a restraining order against the employee, Yihao Ben Pu, 24, who was accused of taking information off of Citadel's trading systems and then trying to hide it. Authorities contend that Mr. Pu, hired as a quantitative engineer at the firm last year, illegally uploaded sensitive information about Citadel's computer-driven trading strategies to personal devices in August before attempting to destroy the evidence. Citadel, the giant hedge fund founded by Kenneth C. Griffin, has one of the most sophisticated computer systems in the investment world. One of its major moneymakers is housed in its computer trading division, which attempts to read the markets through complex algorithms and then execute lightning-fast trades with no human intervention. This case involving a purported breach of security is not the first time Citadel has come down hard on those whom the firm suspects of compromising its highly secret system. A civil court in Chicago previously awarded Citadel $2.2 million from a former employee it accused of breach of contract and illegally destroying evidence. In this case, the criminal complaint outlines in detail what it says was Mr. Pu's efforts to destroy evidence. The complaint says that Mr. Pu was confronted by Citadel on Aug. 26, a day after employees at the hedge fund noticed an unusual amount of data associated with his computer profile.  But when asked to explain himself, Mr. Pu said he was only uploading personal information from his Citadel computer, and not the firm's proprietary trading information, the complaint says. The firm asked him to retain all of his files. But according to an unnamed friend of Mr. Pu, cited in the complaint as Individual A, that same evening Mr. Pu began attempting to destroy evidence. Individual A and another person loaded a computer, hard drive and other equipment into Individual A's car, the complaint says. The next day, Aug. 27, Mr. Pu cleaned the hard drives of information at Individual A's house, according to the complaint. Finally, on Aug. 28, Mr. Pu asked Individual A to ""dump everything,"" according to the complaint. Individual A drove around before deciding to dump the trash bag filled with hard drives into a sanitary canal near Wilmette Harbor, the complain states. The next day, Individual A drove a private forensic team investigating the incident to the canal. Divers later recovered six drives there. Mr. Pu remains in custody until a detention hearing in Federal District Court in Chicago on Friday. If convicted, Mr. Pu could face up to 10 years in prison for theft of trade secrets. A lawyer for Mr. Pu declined to comment on the case, as did a representative of Citadel. Criminal Complaint Against Yihao Ben Pu   "
Hackers Struck Computers In Canadian Government,"OTTAWA -- A federal cabinet minister said Thursday that hackers, perhaps from China, compromised computers in two Canadian government departments in early January, leaving bureaucrats with little or no Internet access for nearly two months. The minister, Stockwell Day, the president of the Treasury Board, told reporters that hackers had infiltrated computers in his department, which supervises the bureaucracy and government operations, as well as in the Department of Finance, which is responsible for the government's budget and fiscal policy. ''Every indication we have at this point is that our sensors and our cyberprotection systems got the alerts out in time, that the information doors were slammed shut,'' Mr. Day said.  He added that the attack, the latest in a series of confirmed assaults on government computer systems, was more directly focused than were previous strikes against Canada. ''It was a significant one -- significant that they were going after financial records,'' he said. After the attack was discovered in early January, the government largely isolated computers in the two departments from the Internet. The computers have, for the most part, remained disconnected while security officials searched individual computers for evidence in case of a criminal investigation and to remove the compromising software. While the attack was not confirmed until late Wednesday, shortly before a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report about it, signs that something was wrong have been evident for some time. For the past six weeks, thousands of public servants employed by the two departments have either been staying home to use Internet connections or slipping out of their offices to use wireless Internet connections at nearby cafes. The employees were not told why they had been returned to the pre-Internet age, creating what one Treasury Board employee earlier called a ''weird'' situation in which it was difficult to complete work. There are concerns that the hackers may have gained advance knowledge of the federal budget, to be released next month. Because Canadian budgets are generally not amended after being presented to Parliament, they are prepared in great secrecy to prevent advance knowledge of their contents from being used for financial gain. Vic Toews, the minister of public safety, said in an e-mail that ''we have no indication that budget security has been compromised.'' Mr. Toews and other officials have declined to publicly outline the nature of the attack. But a government computer specialist who was briefed about the attack confirmed the CBC's report on the condition that he not be identified because of the government's policy of not discussing computer security issues. According to the CBC and other Canadian news organizations, the attackers adopted the same approach as the one used by a China-based computer espionage ring that stole information from the Indian Defense Ministry. That gang was exposed last year by a team of researchers from the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. The hackers used a technique that is sometimes known as ''executive spear phishing.'' First they took control of computers used by senior officials in the affected departments. Once inside, the hackers generated messages that appeared to be from those officials to the departments' information technology section, which provided the hackers with passwords to various government computer systems. At the same time, other employees in the departments received e-mails that falsely appeared to come from the senior officials that included Adobe PDF attachments. Once opened, those attachments started hidden programs that hunted for information on the government network to send back to the hackers. While security scanning software is supposed to catch and block destructive software hidden in attachments, the hackers either developed programs that were unknown to software security companies or found a novel method of hiding their unwanted computer code. The Canadian news reports said that the government had traced the hackers to an Internet address in China. Rafal A. Rohozinski, one of the Munk School researchers who documented the earlier Chinese attack, said it should be possible for the Canadian government to determine if the attack originated in China or if the hackers had merely disguised their location by using Chinese servers. Nevertheless, Mr. Rohozinski said that China was the most likely source of the attack, although that did not necessarily indicate that it was a government-sanctioned action. ''There are more people online in China than anywhere else,'' he said. ''Most of them are young, so you see a lot of digital promiscuity coming from China.'' Ma Zhaoxu, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, rejected suggestions of a link to China, Reuters reported. ''What you mentioned is purely fictitious and has an ulterior motive,'' he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Rohozinski was skeptical that Canadian government investigators could demonstrate that no information was stolen from the systems. The government adopted a new computer security plan last fall, but he said that very little of the plan had been put in effect, leaving security largely uncoordinated and varying in quality from department to department.

Behind A Coup of Cybercrime,"FOR sheer entertainment purposes, one of the best subgenres of business books has been the computer-hacker narrative, the kind of technological detective story found in books like ''Takedown,'' by Tsutomu Shimomura with John Markoff (1996), and my personal favorite, ''The Cuckoo's Egg,'' by Clifford Stoll (1989). When done well, these books do what the best business stories do: take readers into strange new worlds to learn strange new things, and not have it taste like cough syrup. It's been a while since I've picked up a memorable hacker book. A new one crossed my desk recently, ''Kingpin: How One Hacker Took Over the Billion-Dollar Cybercrime Underground,'' by Kevin Poulsen, a senior editor at Wired magazine (Crown Publishers, $25). It tells the story of a gangly 6-foot-5 San Francisco hacker named Max Butler, known online as Max Vision, among his many noms de chat room, and, on its face, it's a pretty good yarn. No, Mr. Butler didn't actually take over the ''cybercrime underground.'' That's standard publishing hyperbole, something that irritates me to no end. What he did do, though, is almost as amazing.  Back in the 1990s, Mr. Butler was a troubled high school student outside Boise, Idaho. He was found to be bipolar, and was sentenced to jail for attempting to choke his girlfriend when she tried to leave him. Migrating to the Bay Area upon his release, he found work as a ''white hat'' computer consultant, testing corporate systems for security gaps, and moonlighting as an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As hackers go, he was exceedingly skilled, though his moral compass swung madly. One day, he was helping the F.B.I.; the next he was illegally hacking into a major bank. When the F.B.I. learned of his dark side, it threw the book at him, leading to a second term behind bars, in a California minimum-security prison. While inside, Mr. Butler met an Orange County con man, and once they were released they joined forces. Mr. Butler bought stolen credit card numbers online; his confederate imprinted them onto blank cards, then bought merchandise he sold on eBay. It was lucrative, if small time. In the early 2000s, computer crime was on the rise. Cybercriminals grew so bold that they formed two online clearinghouses that served their every need, offering online tutorials, want ads and a store that sold virtually anything that could be procured illegally online, including credit card numbers -- the mainstay -- and hacking tools. The first of these Web sites served the growing Russian and Eastern European hacking world; a second duplicated these services for their Western brethren. To make a long story short, it took a few years, but the F.B.I. and its overseas counterparts cracked down. One site was shut. Another closed under pressure. Here's where Mr. Butler comes in. A half-dozen sites popped up to replace the lost ones. Mr. Butler, now calling himself Iceman, ran one named Carders Market out of a cramped apartment in downtown San Francisco. When he tired of his competition, he hatched a jaw-dropping ploy to best them. He found a way to hack into all five of the competing sites. Then, in one daring checkmate, he not only wiped clean each of their databases, but also herded almost all their customers to Carders Market. The scheme wasn't perfect -- one site limped back to life. And while Mr. Butler didn't ''take over'' cybercrime, for a while the scheme did make him a very big name in the online underworld. Until, of course, the F.B.I., in the person of a Pittsburgh agent who went undercover online, sniffed out what had happened and took him down. Mr. Butler is now in federal prison for wire fraud and identity theft. ''Kingpin'' rises to the challenge of books like ''Cuckoo's Egg'' -- which describes efforts to track down the person who hacked the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory -- but doesn't quite reach the same class. The author, Mr. Poulsen, has the technical command expected from a Wired editor. He can kick around techno-acronyms like hacky sacks, and most of the time I actually understood what was happening. He is especially adept at conjuring a world that very few will ever hope to understand. The notion of cybercrime is something that most of us know as some vague and vaguely Russian-dominated thing, but Mr. Poulsen sketches in history, major cases and context to make it all sharp and clear. He had me laughing a time or two at the sheer brazenness of the schemes. One hacker site called itself the International Association of Criminal Activity. Another took the name Theft Services. You gotta love these guys. IF the author is expert at the gadgets, however, he's not as good with the people. Mr. Butler cooperated with the book, yet he never comes alive as a character, and neither do his confederates. Mr. Butler's internal life remains opaque, which is a shame, because a reader would love to enter this man's head. One character who gave the author much information, the undercover F.B.I. agent, comes across in the book as bland as can be; he trolls hacker chat rooms while watching ''Saturday Night Live.'' ''Kingpin'' thus lacks the crucial human element that ''Cuckoo's Egg'' and other good hacker narratives used so artfully. That said, the book remains a brisk and entertaining tale. Mr. Poulsen's prose is fat-free, largely devoid of padding and wandering tangents. About the only writing flaw is an occasional tendency to lapse into groovy slang. Here a con man doesn't steal money; he is ''looking to scam zeros.'' His proceeds are not cash; they are ''serious bank.'' It's a small thing, and unlikely to divert you, but a serious book doesn't deserve ''serious bank.''  "
Indictment of 55 In Cybercrime Expected Friday,"The Manhattan district attorney's office plans on Friday to announce the indictment of 55 people who it said stole over $2 million as part of a cybercrime ring.  Some of the ring's major targets were donors to UJA-Federation of New York, including some of the city's top philanthropists, whose financial information was stolen by an employee of the nonprofit organization, according to a person with direct knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. UJA-Federation, the person said, was highly cooperative with prosecutors, and helped bring down the rogue employee. Representatives of UJA-Federation did not respond to requests for comment Thursday night. The hundreds of victims came not only through the nonprofit agency, but also a Brooklyn car dealership and a real estate company, among others, the person said. Their customers had their bank account information stolen and then exploited by what appears to be a criminal cottage industry, according to this person. Some ring members made counterfeit checks; others opened fake bank accounts; still others recruited new participants in the scheme or brokered the stolen information, said the person. Among the suspects, said the person, are bank tellers who turned a blind eye to the fraud. The money, said the person, was used to buy merchandise from luxury retailers like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Salvatore Ferragamo, as well as electronics, some of which were sold on the black market. Several defendants are linked to a Brooklyn street gang called the Outlaws, the person said. At least one person who was under investigation was killed during the 18-month inquiry. The link to the gang is significant because it may show a change in tactics for street criminals, who may have adopted cybercrime to bring their activities indoors, the person said. This is one of a series of large-scale cybercrime cases brought by the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., in recent weeks. More than 90 people were indicted in a theft from TD Bank this month, and in November, 28 people were indicted in a scheme involving skimming credit card information from steak-house patrons.  "
"After Hacking Revelations, a Boycott Spreads Online","11:58 a.m. | Updated As new allegations about voice-mail hacking by The News of the World rippled through newspapers and the British Parliament, a campaign to pressure companies to withhold their ad dollars spread through social media. The campaign began almost by accident. After returning home from work on Monday evening, Melissa Harrison, a freelance magazine editor, urged some of her followers to join her in taking action against The News of the World. ""I have never gotten involved in any kind of activism before,"" said Ms. Harrison, 36, who lives in south London and uses @the_Z_Factor as her Twitter handle. ""I have never even been on a march. But this was so upsetting to everyone here. We said that we just can't have this."" In a post on her Twitter account, Ms. Harrison suggested that they begin identifying the biggest advertisers and urge them to withdraw their spending.  ""We decided that it had to be a financial thing,"" she said. Her message was picked up and shared by another Twitter user, Andy Dawson, who uses the handle @profanityswan. He asked his 4,700 followers to help him gather a list of the advertisers. Ms. Harrison then put them in a spreadsheet and included a link to the document in dropbox.com.  Meanwhile, another Twitter user, Paul Friend,  generated a Google document with e-mail addresses of the chief executives for the companies that advertise in the paper. The document was used by hundreds of people who then sent e-mails to executives with their complaints. Then, another Twitter user, Tony Kennick, known as @thegreatgonzo, with computer programming skills, offered to build a Web page overnight with a feature that would allow people to easily post their complaint about The News of the World directly to advertisers on Twitter. It was up and running Tuesday morning. Later that day, it had received more than 41,000 hits.  Posts to companies were sent with simple automated messages like this: ""Will you be reconsidering your advertising spend with News of the World now that we know that they have hacked Millie Dowler's phone?"" At least two other Facebook pages were created with similar missions to put pressure on those companies spending money with The News of the World. Since then, Mitsubishi, Virgin Holidays and the Halifax bank have withdrawn their advertising spending. Ms. Harrison said that social media platforms were easy tools for people to organize and demand results. ""If I hadn't done it, I think someone else would have started it within the hour. People were so angry and they were looking for just something practical to do.""  "
Scotland Yard to Expand Phone Hacking Contacts,"After reopening its investigation into telephone hacking by the News of the World, Scotland Yard said Wednesday that it was going to contact more people who may have had their voicemail messages illegally intercepted by reporters at the London newspaper.  This included some people who had previously been told by the police that their personal details were not among a trove of evidence seized by the police in 2006 from a reporter and private investigator for the newspaper who were eventually imprisoned for illegally intercepting phone messages of members of the royal household. The police found evidence then that hundreds of other celebrities, government officials and sports stars may have had their telephone messages intercepted. But Scotland Yard chose to limit its investigation and informed only a small number of potential targets about the hacking. Since then, a number of other people who suspected that their phones had been hacked -- including the actress Sienna Miller -- have sued the tabloid's parent company, News International, leading to more information from the investigation being made public in court documents. Last month, The News of the World, which had maintained that the hacking was solely the work of the reporter and private investigator, dismissed its assistant editor for news, Ian Edmondson, after finding ''material evidence'' linking him to the accusations of phone hacking. Mr. Edmonson has denied any wrongdoing. News International handed over the new material to the police. On the same day, Scotland Yard, facing criticism for what some people called a lax investigation, said it was reopening its inquiry to consider the new material and to review the evidence seized in 2006 and some of the decisions taken then. It is that review which led to Scotland Yard's announcement Wednesday that it would now contact everyone whose names or other personal details were among the evidence. The statement said there was no immediate proof that these individuals' phone messages had been intercepted, but that this possibility would be investigated. In a statement, deputy assistant commissioner Sue Akers, who is leading the reopened investigation, said anyone whose name was mentioned in the cache of material would get to see all of the relevant information. ''We are determined to ensure that we conduct a robust and thorough investigation which will follow the evidence trail to its conclusion,'' she said. She would not say how many people would be contacted. But, according to an article in The New York Times published in September 2010, the police in 2006 seized what one police investigator called ''a massive amount of evidence'' -- dozens of notebooks and two computers containing 2,978 complete or partial cell phone numbers and 91 telephone PIN codes. Last month, Andy Coulson, the editor of The News of the World between 2003 and 2007, resigned as Prime Minister David Cameron's director of communications. Mr. Coulson said that he had known nothing about the hacking, but that continued speculation about whether he had a role in the affair made it impossible for him to do his job.  "
Advisory Firm Urges Ouster Of Murdoch and His Sons,"8:00 p.m. Updated A major investor advisory firm recommended Monday that shareholders of the News Corporation vote against the re-election of a vast majority of the media conglomerate's board, including Rupert Murdoch and his sons, who control the company. The firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, wrote in a report that the News Corporation's incumbent directors, 13 out of 15 board members, failed to prevent the company from stumbling into a morass of corporate troubles.  Chief among these is the phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has led to the arrests of several News Corporation executives, parliamentary hearings and a public apology by Mr. Murdoch. The scandal flared up in July, when The Guardian newspaper of London reported that reporters for a News Corporation publication, News of the World, had hacked into the voice mails of a 13-year-old murder victim, Milly Dowler. It eventually grew to encompass charges of widespread hacking and illicit bribes paid to British police officers. The scandal has cost the News Corporation financially. The company eventually closed News of the World after 168 years and scuttled plans to buy control of a major satellite television provider, British Sky Broadcasting, for about $12 billion. Institutional Shareholder Services wrote that the phone-hacking revelations had exposed ''a striking lack of stewardship and failure of independence by a board whose inability to set a strong tone-at-the-top about unethical business practices has now resulted in enormous costs - financial, legal, regulatory, reputational and opportunity - for the shareholders the board ostensibly serves.'' Only two of the News Corporation's director nominees, Joel I. Klein and the venture capitalist James Breyer, received the advisory firm's approval, since they have served on the board for only a few months. Mr. Klein, who formerly served as the chancellor of New York City's public schools, is helping supervise the phone-hacking inquiry. Firms like Institutional Shareholder Services can hold great sway over public companies' investors. Many large shareholders often follow proxy advisers' recommendations. Still, the firm's call to arms is largely symbolic, since Mr. Murdoch, the News Corporation's chairman and chief executive, controls about 40 percent of the company's voting shares. Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who owns about 7 percent of News Corp.'s stock, publicly backed the company's management in July. Institutional Shareholder Services also took issue with the News Corporation's executive compensation plans, particularly the near-tripling of Mr. Murdoch's cash bonus for the 2011 fiscal year to $12.5 million. It noted that Chase Carey, the News Corporation's deputy chairman and chief operating officer, received a tax benefit when his contract was renewed, although his base salary was cut in half to $4.05 million. The firm recommended voting against the executive compensation proposal, although it is only advisory. As expected, the News Corporation took issue with the recommendations, saying it ''strongly disagrees'' with them. ''The company takes the issues surrounding News of the World seriously and is working hard to resolve them,'' Teri Everett, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''However, I.S.S.'s disproportionate focus on these issues is misguided and a disservice to our stockholders. Moreover, I.S.S. failed to consider that the company's compensation practices reflect its robust performance in FY 2011 driven by its broad, diverse group of businesses across the globe.'' Shares in the News Corporation closed up more than 4 percent on Monday, at $16.97. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Britain Reopens Its Inquiry Of Phone Hacking Reports,"The Crown Prosecution Service said Friday that it would reopen the investigation into allegations of phone hacking by the newspaper The News of the World. The prosecutors said they would ''conduct a comprehensive assessment'' of all evidence turned up by Scotland Yard during its original criminal investigation into phone hacking at the newspaper in 2006 and any material that had come to light since then.  ''The purpose of this assessment is to ascertain whether there is any material which could now form evidence in any future criminal prosecution relating to phone hacking,'' the prosecutors said in a statement. It said the move was prompted by developments in the civil courts in Britain, where several people whose phones were hacked have filed lawsuits against The News of the World's parent company. The newspaper, one of Britain's largest circulation publications, is owned by News International, part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire. Evidence has emerged in those cases suggesting that the phone hacking may have been more widespread than The News of the World had admitted. In 2007, a News of the World editor, Clive Goodman, and an investigator employed by the newspaper, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed after pleading guilty to having illegally intercepted voice-mail messages of Prince William, Prince Harry and their chief aides. The case was reopened by Scotland Yard in September after The New York Times Magazine published an article quoting former employees as saying that the phone hacking went beyond Mr. Goodman and Mr. Mulcaire and was condoned by the newspaper's top editors. The article also raised questions about whether the police had fully investigated evidence pointing to widespread hacking at the paper. Last month, the prosecution service said that there was not enough evidence to bring charges against Andy Coulson, the newspaper's former editor. Mr. Coulson, who is now Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director, has denied any knowledge of phone hacking. Scotland Yard has defended its original inquiry and has said there is no need to reopen the case. But in a letter made public by the prosecution service on Friday, Assistant Police Commissioner John Yates said that ''there remain outstanding public, legal and political concerns.'' In a statement, The News of the World promised to ''cooperate fully'' with prosecutors, The Associated Press reported.  "
Top Cameron Aide Quits Over Phone-Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- In an embarrassing blow to Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government, Downing Street's communications director, Andy Coulson, resigned on Friday amid continued questions about his possible involvement in the illegal hacking of celebrity telephone messages when he was editor of the tabloid newspaper The News of the World. Mr. Coulson left the paper in 2007 after one of its reporters, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator were jailed for intercepting messages left on the cellphones of members of the royal household. Mr. Coulson said he knew nothing about the messages and was hired by Mr. Cameron, then leader of the Conservative opposition.  But the issue has continued to dog Mr. Coulson and the newspaper. Several prominent figures, including the actress Sienna Miller, have filed suit accusing The News of the World's reporters of hacking into their voice mail when Mr. Coulson was the paper's editor. Others have received large settlements from the paper and agreed not to discuss the matter. Last week, following new revelations, British prosecutors said they would conduct a ''comprehensive reassessment'' of the material that had been collected by the police. In his resignation statement, Mr. Coulson reiterated that he had been unaware of the hacking, but said that the scandal had proved too distracting for him to do his job. ''I stand by what I've said about those events, but when the spokesman needs a spokesman, it's time to move on,'' he said. Executives at News International, which owns The News of the World and is a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, have maintained that Mr. Goodman was a ''rogue reporter'' who hired the investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to hack into telephone messages without the approval of his editors. But recent information made public in two court cases connected to the affair have cast doubt on that claim. In December, Ian Edmondson, the paper's news editor, was suspended when it emerged that the name ''Ian'' had been scribbled across notes written by Mr. Mulcaire that were contained in court papers related to Ms. Miller's lawsuit. Mr. Edmondson has denied doing anything wrong. Earlier this week, lawyers for Andy Gray, a television commentator who has filed his own suit, said that notebooks belonging to Mr. Mulcaire showed that he had written ''Greg'' in one that had been seized by the police -- next to a record of Mr. Gray's PIN, password and cellphone number. Mr. Gray's lawyers said the name was a reference to Greg Miskiw, The News of the World's former assistant editor for news. Mr. Miskiw has also denied any wrongdoing. The lawyers said that Mr. Mulcaire had a habit of noting the names of editors involved in hacking jobs. Mr. Gray and the actor Steve Coogan are suing in an effort to force Mr. Mulcaire to reveal who ordered him to hack into their phones. Mr. Gray, who works for Sky Sports, has been the subject of a number of embarrassing News of the World stories about his sex life, including one titled ''Randy Andy's Teeny Weeny Tartan Hanky Spanky With Me.'' The Guardian newspaper, which has written extensively about the scandal, was the first to reveal that the hacking operation was more widespread than had originally been thought and that News International had secretly paid large sums to several of the victims in exchange for their silence. An article in The New York Times Magazine last year quoted a former reporter, Sean Hoare, and an unnamed former editor as saying that Mr. Coulson had known about and encouraged the hacking. The article described a newsroom in which reporters used any means possible to get stories, and said the Metropolitan Police had failed to interview editors and reporters at the paper after Mr. Goodman's arrest, limiting the investigation to his and Mr. Mulcaire's behavior. Britain's sharp-elbowed tabloids seem to have abandoned some of their more outlandish practices since Mr. Coulson worked at The News of the World. But politicians and many British reporters and editors say that few standards apply in a world where reporters think nothing of concealing their identities when pursuing stories and tabloids routinely pay thousands of dollars to sources willing to provide evidence of celebrities' extramarital affairs. Tabloid editors are also known to keep close watch over their reporters. ''No one who knows how a newspaper works, let alone a well-run British newspaper, has ever been able to understand for one second why a very effective editor wouldn't have at least asked his royal reporter where a stream of very strong scoops had come from,'' said an editor at another tabloid who asked not to be quoted by name because he was not authorized to speak publicly to the press. Mr. Coulson had talked about quitting Downing Street for some time, according to people familiar with his thinking, but he may have decided to act after the scandal's return to the news. ''Clearly, the drip-drip-drip of new information has caused Andy Coulson to resign, because it's been growing stronger by the day,'' said Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of Parliament who serves on the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Mr. Farrelly called for an independent review of the matter, saying that both the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan Police had failed to investigate properly. A close and trusted adviser to Mr. Cameron, Mr. Coulson has been especially effective in helping smooth Downing Street's relationship with London's tabloids and with Mr. Murdoch, whose media holdings here include The News of the World, The Sun and The Times of London. Mr. Murdoch's endorsement of the Conservative Party was an important factor in its defeat of the Labour Party and its formation, with the Liberal Democrats, of the coalition government. Mr. Cameron went out of his way on Friday to praise Mr. Coulson, calling him ''a brilliant member of my team.'' Tom Watson, another Labour member of the culture committee and a persistent critic of Mr. Murdoch's media empire and of Mr. Coulson, said it was ''not the end'' of the scandal. ''It's just the end of the beginning,'' he said.  "
News Corp. Scandal Could Hurt BSkyB Deal,"Amid the widening phone-hacking scandal, the News Corporation may find its deal-making ambitions diminished. As new details emerge about the controversy, regulators are calling for a closer look at the media company's bid to buy the British Sky Broadcasting Group, the latest challenge for the much-delayed and troubled acquisition. ""In the light of the current public debate about phone hacking and other allegations, Ofcom confirms that it has a duty to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that the holder of a broadcasting license is 'fit and  proper,' "" the communications agency said in a statement on Wednesday. Ofcom still has the power to block the deal, regardless of its previous stance that the media company's bid for BSkyB would not unduly harm media plurality in Britain.  If the investigation into allegations of phone-hacking by The News of the World showed that its parent was tied to the wrongdoing, the agency could put a stop to the acquisition because it would not be a ""fit and proper"" owner of a broadcaster, a person familiar with the matter said.   Since Monday, shares of BSkyB have fallen to 811 pence a share in London, down 4.5 percent from their peak this week. Shares of News Corporation dropped 66 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $17.40 in New York on Wednesday. The regulator's concerns come as allegations swirl that The News of the World, part of Rupert Murdoch's vast media empire, hacked the phones of deceased soldiers, a murdered 13-year-old girl, a lawyer involved in Princess Diana's inquest and others. The latest objections by Ofcom reframe the debate about the deal. For months, the agency had focused on the issue of ""media plurality,"" worried that the acquisition would allow one company to dominate the media industry. With the new standard of ""fit and proper,"" the agency is looking at whether a company complies with media licensing conditions and the broadcasting code. ""It is clearly not for Ofcom to investigate matters which properly lie in the hands of the police and the courts, however we are closely monitoring the situation and in particular the investigations by the relevant authorities into the alleged unlawful activities,"" Ofcom said. The Conservative government has maintained that News Corp.'s bid for BSkyB has met the necessary criteria to safeguard media plurality. But it has not laid out a timeline for granting its final approval.   The culture minister, Jeremy Hunt, extended public consultation on the deal until Friday, at which point he said he would review submissions. If they have arrived en masse, as local media reported, it could lengthen the approval process.   The minister ""will take as long as is needed to reach a decision,"" Mr. Hunt's office said in an e-mailed statement. ""There is no 'delay' since there has been no set timetable for a further announcement.""   "
British Official Refers BSkyB Deal to Another Regulator," As a phone-hacking scandal threatens to derail News Corporation's bid to buy BSkyB, a British official has referred the merger to the Competition Commission for approval, which could delay approval for months. Rather than continuing to review the deal, Jeremy Hunt, the secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport in Britain, said on Monday that the Competition Commission would now take up the review process.  ""It will mean that the Competition Commission will be able to give further full and exhaustive consideration of this merger taking into account all relevant recent developments,"" Mr. Hunt said in a statement.  The development -- amid the phone-hacking controversy at The News of the World tabloid -- comes after News Corp. decided not to spin off Sky News, a concession it had earlier made in an effort to assuage regulators.  ""News Corporation today announces that it is withdrawing its proposed undertakings in lieu of reference to the Competition Commission with respect to its proposed acquisition of BSkyB,"" the company said in a statement on Monday. It also said it ""is ready to engage with the Competition Commission on substance.""  "
Updates on British Phone-Hacking Scandal,"On Tuesday, The Lede is following developments in the phone-hacking scandal in Britain, as fresh revelations of misconduct by journalists continue to come to light.   6:11 P.M. | Along With Anger, Scandal Prompts Comedy and Song The Lede is going to wrap for the day, but join us again on Wednesday morning at 7 a.m. ET, when we'll begin with live updates on what promises to be an interesting edition of Prime Minister's Question Time in the House of Commons. In the meantime, here is some phone-hacking themed evening entertainment for you. First, there's this satirical news report on the scandal from Don't Panic magazine, which manages to incorporate several absurd but factual aspects of the scandal into its otherwise fictional narrative. Then there is also a new Billy Bragg song inspired by the crisis, ""Never Buy the Sun,"" which calls on Britons to follow the lead of fans of Liverpool Football Club, who have been boycotting the tabloid for decades.  Mr. Bragg, of course, has been trying to sound the alarm about the influence of tabloid newspapers on British social and political life for decades, as this 1984 clip from a BBC breakfast television show reminds us: Thanks for all your comments and tips. 5:48 P.M. | Former Police Officer Plans to Sue News Corp. One of the more sordid allegations against Rebekah Brooks, raised in the House of Commons last week by Tom Watson, a member of Parliament (see the end of our 9:26 a.m. update), is that during her tenure as editor of The News of the World she was warned by Scotland Yard that her newspaper was interfering with a police officer's investigation of a murder. According to Mr. Watson's statement in Parliament, in 2002, Ms. Brooks was told by senior police officers ""that News of the World staff were guilty of interference and party to using unlawful means to attempt to discredit a police officer and his wife. She was told of actions by people she paid to expose and discredit David Cook and his wife, Jacqui Hames, so that Mr. Cook would be prevented from completing an investigation into a murder. News International was paying people to interfere with police officers and doing so on behalf of known criminals."" The man accused of the murder Mr. Cook was investigating later worked for The News of the World as an investigator. On Tuesday, a lawyer for the detective, Dave Cook, told Reuters that he plans to sue the publishers of The News of the World and ""seek damages for both him and Jacqui Hames for hacking into his phone and for harassment."" Reuters explains: The alleged harassment occurred when Cook was leading an investigation into the murder of Daniel Morgan, for which Jonathan Rees, Morgan's then business partner, was later charged. Morgan was found dead with an axe embedded in his head in a pub car park in south London in 1987. Investigated for 24 years, it became one of Britain's longest murder inquiries. Rees has emerged as a key figure in the News of the World affair because former editor Andy Coulson has been reported to have hired him as an investigator in 2005....  Rees had also worked between 1993 and 2000 as an investigator for the News of the World and other publications. After a long legal process that involved five inquiries the case against Rees collapsed in March this year when prosecutors said important evidence had not been disclosed to the defense. 5:07 P.M. | Guardian Reporter Says 'the Police Are on the Ropes' Here is an analysis of Tuesday's testimony by senior British police officers to a parliamentary committee by Nick Davies, the Guardian reporter whose July 8, 2009 article first revealed that phone hacking at The News of the World was more widespread than the initial police investigation suggested: A Guardian interacive timeline explaining how the scandal  reminds us that when Mr. Davies revealed in July 2009 that News Corporation had paid more than $1.5 million to settle lawsuits that would have exposed the fact that more than just one reporter at The News of the World had hacked into phones, the company assured the public: ""All of these irresponsible and unsubstantiated allegations against News of the World and other News International titles and its journalists are false."" The same week, John Yates, the senior police officer asked to examine The Guardian report, concluded: ""This case has been the subject of the most careful investigation by experienced detectives.... No additional evidence has come to light. I therefore consider no further investigation is required."" 4:10 P.M. | Speculation Murdoch Could Sell Papers to Save TV Bid As Adam Curtis made clear in a brilliant blog post earlier this year - which used archival BBC footage to trace the history of Rupert Murdoch's contentious relationship with the British establishment - the Australian-born media tycoon has had mixed feelings about the country where his newspapers wield such power for decades. Now that those same newspapers threaten his bid to take full control of a much more important business, the satellite television network BSkyB, several observers have speculated in recent days that Mr. Murdoch could decide to sell his three remaining British titles to make sure that News Corporation is allowed to complete its $12 billion takeover of the broadcaster. Writing on The New Yorker's Web site, John Cassidy, who worked for two of Mr. Murdoch's papers for nearly a decade, suggests that the idea might not be as unlikely as he thought just days ago. Selling the newspapers, or spinning them off into a new company in which News Corp. maintained a minority stake, would remove the main barrier to the BSkyB takeover. Could Murdoch bring himself to do it? He'd hate the idea of being bested by people and institutions he sees as his liberal enemies, such as the Guardian and the New York Times. But he prides himself on being able to rise above personal feelings. Plus, he's always had a love-hate relationship with Britain. Even back when I used to work for his newspapers, he sometimes complained that the Brits didn't appreciate all he'd done for their country-all the money and time he'd invested there; all the hatred he'd incurred for breaking the Luddite print unions; all the effort he'd expended in attacking the stultifying British class system. ""Sometimes, I don't know why I bother,"" I recall him saying once, seemingly only partly in jest. In recent years, Murdoch has been spending less time in Britain, leaving his son James to handle matters there. Despite the fact his papers supported the Conservatives in last year's election, his relationship with David Cameron is more remote than those he enjoyed with Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. At the age of eighty, with scarcely a voice to be heard defending him from Inverness to Brighton, maybe Murdoch has finally had his fill of the Poms. This video report from Britain's Channel 4 News explains that both Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg now plan to vote in favor of opposition leader Ed Miliband's motion, calling on Mr. Murdoch to drop his bid for BSkyB entirely, which will be put to the House of Commons on Wednesday: 2:54 P.M. | News Corp. Defends Story on Brown's Son's Illness In a statement published Tuesday on the Web site of News Corporation, its British newspaper division, News International, rejected the allegation that one of its tabloid's, The Sun, had illegally obtained information from the medical files of Gordon Brown's infant son, Fraser, in 2006.  On Monday, The Guardian reported that Rebekah Brooks, who was The Sun's editor in 2006 and is now the chief executive of News International, had called Mr. Brown to tell him that the newspaper had obtained information about his four-month-old son's illness and planned to publish it. In an interview with The BBC on Tuesday morning, Mr. Brown said he had no idea how the newspaper had obtained such private and sensitive information about his young son's health. The News International statement claims that the newspaper did not illegally access Fraser Brown's medical files: Following allegations made yesterday by Gordon Brown against The Sun, we have been conducting an inquiry. This is in line with normal practice and procedure. We are able to assure the Brown family that we did not access the medical records of their son, nor did we commission anyone to do so. The story The Sun ran about their son originated from a member of the public whose family has also experienced cystic fibrosis. He came to The Sun with this information voluntarily because he wanted to highlight the cause of those afflicted by the disease. The individual has provided a written affidavit this afternoon to a lawyer confirming this. 2:26 P.M. | More Background on the Scandal Thanks to a reader who pointed out that The BBC's Democracy Live Web site - which carried the live video stream of the parliamentary committee hearing we linked to this morning - has an extensive video archive of the hearings and debates in the House of Commons on the phone hacking scandal since allegations that it was far more widespread than initially revealed came to light. Here, for example, is video from that page of a Commons debate on September 6, 2010, one day after The New York Times Magazine published an article on the initial, flawed police inquiry into the affair by my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Graham Bowley: 1:38 P.M. | Officers Questioned About Flawed Initial Police Inquiry Readers who might feel that they have come in on the phone hacking drama during its second or third act, and are in need of a good summary of the problems with the initial police investigation of the matter in 2006, might want to read a magazine article on that flawed inquiry by my colleagues Don Van Natta Jr., Jo Becker and Graham Bowley, published last September in The New York Times Magazine. The article includes this important context: At Scotland Yard, the task of investigating the case fell to the counter­terrorism branch, which was responsible for the security of the royal family. It was an extraordinarily busy time for the unit, which was dealing with the aftermath of the 2005 London transit bombings and was now involved in a complex surveillance operation of two dozen men believed to be plotting to bomb transoceanic airliners. Several former senior investigators said the department was dubious about diverting resources. ""We were distracted, obviously,"" one former senior Scotland Yard investigator said. Scotland Yard also had a symbiotic relationship with News of the World. The police sometimes built high-profile cases out of the paper's exclusives, and News of the World reciprocated with fawning stories of arrests. Within days of the raids, several senior detectives said they began feeling internal pressure. One senior investigator said he was approached by Chris Webb, from the department's press office, who was ""waving his arms up in the air, saying, 'Wait a minute - let's talk about this.' "" The investigator, who has since left Scotland Yard, added that Webb stressed the department's ""long-term relationship with News International."" The investigator recalled becoming furious at the suggestion, responding, ""There's illegality here, and we'll pursue it like we do any other case."" In a statement, Webb said: ''I cannot recall these events. Police officers make operational decisions, not press officers. That is the policy of the Metropolitan Police Service and the policy that I and all police press officers follow.''  That fall, Andy Hayman, the head of the counterterrorism branch, was in his office when a senior investigator brought him 8 to 10 pages of a single-spaced ""target list"" of names and mobile phone numbers taken from Mulcaire's home. It read like a British society directory. Scotland Yard officials consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service on how broadly to investigate. But the officials didn't discuss certain evidence with senior prosecutors, including the notes suggesting the involvement of other reporters, according to a senior prosecutor on the case. That initial investigation led to the conviction of just one News of the World reporter, the royal correspondent Clive Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire. News International, the British newspaper division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, insisted at the time that the hacking had been the work of one rogue reporter.   The Guardian, whose reporter Nick Davies brought allegations that the phone hacking was far more widespread to light in 2009, also has an excellent timeline of the various inquiries into the scandal on its Web site. On Tuesday, two of the senior officers involved in that 2006 investigation, Peter Clarke, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and Andy Hayman, Scotland Yard's former assistant commissioner, both appeared before a parliamentary committee to answer questions about the failures of that inquiry. Here, from The Guardian, is video of Mr. Clarke telling a Parliamentary committee on Tuesday that News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation, had not offered ""any meaningful cooperation,"" with his inquiry into phone hacking at The News of the World. Later, in response to a question from a member of the committee about the lack of cooperation from News International, Mr. Clarke said, ""I was not only suspicious, I was as certain as I could be that they had something to hide."" He added: ""This [was] a major global organization with access to the best legal advice, in my view deliberately trying to thwart a police investigation."" Mr. Hayman, who was Mr. Clarke's superior, joined News International, as a columnist for The Times of London, after his retirement from the police force. In 2009, after The Guardian first reported that the scale of the hacking had been far greater than initially revealed by the police, Mr. Hayman asserted in a Times column that the initial inquiry was not a ""half-hearted investigation - we put our best detectives on the case and left no stone unturned as officials breathed down our neck.""  He also wrote: The Guardian has said it understands that the police file shows that between 2,000 and 3,000 individuals had their mobile phones hacked into, far more than was ever officially admitted during the investigation and prosecution of Clive Goodman. Yet, my recollection is different. As I recall the list of those targeted, which was put together from records kept by Glen Mulcaire, ran to several hundred names. Of these, there was a small number - perhaps a handful - where there was evidence that the phones had actually been tampered with. Had there been evidence of tampering in the other cases, that would have been investigated as would the slightest hint that others were involved. Appearing before the parliamentary committee on Tuesday, Mr. Hayman reacted with fury when asked if he had ever been paid by a newspaper for information while he was a police officer, as this video shows: Lorraine Fullbrook, the Conservative member of Parliament who asked Mr. Hayman if he had ever accepted a bribe, also suggested that the public would just see him as ""a dodgy geezer."" 12:49 P.M. | Video of Labour Leader's Meeting With Dowler Family Ed Miliband, then leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, met on Tuesday with Sally and Bob Dowler, whose 13-year-old daughter, Milly, was abducted and killed in 2002. The revelation that Milly's voice mail was hacked into and tampered with by The News of the World during the frantic search for her that year sparked widespread revulsion last week.  Here, from The Telegraph, is video of Mr. Miliband telling the Dowlers, ""I'm sorry that all of the trauma you originally had has been worsened by what has happened and I think my heart goes out to you and I'm sure the whole country's."" One day earlier, during a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Sally Dowler recalled that, during the search, she had been given hope that her daughter was still alive when she discovered that voice mails had been deleted from her account. It later transpired that News of the World operatives had deleted the messages to free up space for more voice mail to be left, to provide the newspaper with more information for stories on the girl. After his meeting with the family on Tuesday, Mr. Miliband told The BBC: ""what the Dowler family was saying to me is there needs to be the comprehensive inquiry, the comprehensive judge-led inquiry getting at all the facts on all the issues, and I think its my responsibility, David Cameron's and Nick Clegg's, to work together now to do justice for them."" He added, that the Dowlers, ""had experiences which suggest that there were contacts going on between the police and newspapers which, frankly, invaded their privacy and were terrible things."" Mr. Miliband is scheduled to meet with both Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg on Tuesday evening to discuss how a public inquiry will be run. 11:37 A.M. | Government Backs Call for Murdoch to Drop Sky Bid The BBC's  chief political correspondent, Laura Kuenssberg reports that the British government has decided to support a motion the opposition Labour Party has tabled for debate on Wednesday in the House of Commons, calling on News Corproation to withdraw its bid to take full control of the BSkyB satellite network. The motion reads: ""This House believes that it is in the public interest for Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation to withdraw their bid for BSkyB."" The BBC adds that Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said: ""It is welcome news that the government will support our motion. Rupert Murdoch must now recognize the strength of public feeling and the will of all the major parties."" As Andrew Sparrow, The Guardian's indefatigable politics blogger observed earlier: If MPs pass this motion, it won't technically have much effect. Murdoch isn't a British citizen, and the House of Commons cannot tell him what to do. In theory, it should not even be relevant to the Competition Commission inquiry into whether the bid should go through. All I can say at this stage is that a Commons vote of that kind won't increase the chances of the News Corp bid being successful. 11:25 A.M. | Thousands of Possible Victims of Hacking Not Alerted In televised testimony to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, Sue Akers, the deputy assistant commissioner of London's  Metropolitan Police who is leading the new investigation of the phone hacking scandal, said that only 170 of about 4,000 suspected victims of phone hacking have been alerted so far. Ms. Akers said that police officers combing through the notes of Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who worked for The News of the World, have found 3,870 names, 4,000 cellphone numbers and 5,000 landline numbers of people who might have been targeted.  10:36 A.M. | Murdochs and Brooks Called to Testify to Parliament Louise Mensch, a member of Parliament for the Conservative Party who serves on the House of Commons committee overseeing the department of culture, media and sport, reports on Twitter that she and her colleagues ""will be summoning Rupert and James Murdoch, and Rebekah Brooks to appear before us,"" next Tuesday, to answer questions regarding prior statements made to the same committee. Britain's Sky News - which is partially-owned by News Corporation - reports that members of the committee ""want to ask Mrs. Brooks about her knowledge of alleged payments to police, Labour politician Tom Watson said."" Here is video - and a transcript - of a prior appearance by Ms. Brooks before the committee in 2003, during which she said: ""We have paid the police for information in the past."" The man sitting next to Ms. Brooks during that appearance in 2003 was her former deputy at The News of the World, Andy Coulson, who resigned in January as Prime Minister David Cameron's media adviser and was arrested last week in connection with a new investigation into bribery. After Ms. Brooks hesitated and said, ""It depends,"" during that appearance, Mr. Coulson interrupted her and told the committee: ""We operate within the code and within the law and if there is a clear public interest then we will. The same holds for private detectives, subterfuge...."" Sky News also reports that the three executives ""could be questioned in Westminster next Tuesday."" A spokesman for News International - the British newspaper division of the Murdoch media empire - told the broadcaster: ""We have been made aware of the request from the CMS Committee to interview senior executives and will cooperate. We await the formal invitation."" The department of culture is currently deciding whether or not to allow News Corporation to proceed with a proposed $12 billion takeover of the satellite television network BSkyB, which is currently owns a minority stake in. On Monday, News Corporation withdrew an offer to put Sky News under some sort of independent control if its bid to own its parent network is successful. 9:51 A.M. | More on Brown's Reaction to Story on Son's Illness Marina Hyde, a Guardian columnist who formerly worked for The Sun, reports on Twitter that she has more information on how Gordon Brown reacted when the editor of The Sun called him in 2006 to say that the paper had obtained information from the medical records of his infant son and was about to publish it.  On Monday, it was revealed that Rebekah Brooks, who was at the time the editor of The Sun and is now chief executive of News International, the British newspaper division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, had personally phoned Mr. Brown to tell him about The Sun's scoop in October 2006. Ms. Hyde writes in a blog post: Gird your stomachs - I have further information on the Gordon Brown story. Are you insufficiently repulsed by the Sun's mysteriously-obtained exclusive on Brown's son's cystic fibrosis? Don't worry - like everything about the hacking scandal, there are always more details to emerge to compound the horror. I've been speaking to a source close to Gordon Brown at the time of the story, who recalls that it was served up with a chaser of threat: ""Gordon insisted - despite a heavy brow-beating from Rebekah - that he was not willing to let his son's medical condition be the stuff of a Sun exclusive,"" recalls this source. ""So he put out a statement on PA to spike their scoop and make clear that despite his condition, Fraser was fit and healthy. The Sun were utterly furious, and Brown's communications team were told that if Gordon wanted to get into No 10, he needed to learn that was not how things were done."" Yes, how DARE the then-chancellor refuse to accept that his child's health was not technically a commercial Murdoch property? I'd like to tell you there's a sick bag located in the rear pocket of the seat in front of you. But I'm afraid you're on your own. 9:26 A.M. | Brown Was 'in Tears' About Paper Exposing Son's Illness In a long interview with BBC News on Tuesday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was asked how he reacted, as a father, when Rebekah Brooks, who was at the time the editor of the News International tabloid The Sun, called to tell him that her paper had discovered that his infant son, Fraser, had cystic fibrosis, and planned to publish the information.  Mr. Brown said that he was ""in tears - your son is now going to be broadcast across the media, Sarah and I were incredibly upset about it, we're thinking about his long-term future, we're thinking about our family. But there's nothing you can do about it, you're in public life and this story appears. You don't know how it's appeared, I've not questioned how it appeared, I've not made any allegations about how it appeared, I've not made any claims about how it appeared, but the fact is, it did appear, and it did appear in The Sun newspaper."" As my colleagues John Burns, Jo Becker and Alan Cowell report, in another part of the interview, Mr. Brown attacked News International, the British newspaper division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, for hiring ""known criminals"" to spy on him and other targets. Mr. Brown told the BBC that near the start of his time in government, when he was chancellor of the exchequer, The Sunday Times, a News International paper, appears to have obtained access to his bank account and legal files. He added:  I'm shocked, I'm genuinely shocked to find that this happened because of their links with criminals, known criminals who were undertaking this activity, hired by investigators who were working with the Sunday Times. And I just can't understand this: if I, with all the protection and all the defenses and all the security that a chancellor of the exchequer or a prime minister has, is so vulnerable to unscrupulous tactics, unlawful tactics, to methods that have been used in the way that we've found - what about the ordinary citizen?  What about the person - like the family of Milly Dowler - who were in the most desperate of circumstances, at the most difficult occasions in their lives, in huge grief, troubled, not knowing where to turn, and then they find as they have found over the last few days, that they are totally defenseless in this moment of greatest grief from people who are employing these ruthless tactics, with links to known criminals. Asked if he was saying that News International had been involved in a criminal conspiracy with the underworld,"" Mr. Brown replied: I believe now, from what I've seen and heard, and what has been told to me by people who have investigated this - and I'm looking at the evidence that has been accumulated by Nick Davies of The Guardian in the most brilliant of research - that the links that made possible the intrusion into people's lives - and particularly the intrusion into the lives of completely innocent citizens who deserve to have the privacy of their lives particularly at times of their greatest grief, at the times when they are most vulnerable [protected] - that News International were using people who were known criminals, people who had in some cases criminal records and that News International as a result were working through links that they had with the criminal underworld.  And I think when people find out that the invasion of their liberties - their privates lives and their private griefs and their private thoughts and their innermost feelings - becoming public property as a result, not of a rogue reporter or a chance investigator or someone saying something out of turn when they meet a friend at the street corner, or when they talk to someone on a bus, but because criminals were hired to do this particular work... and these were known criminals, these were criminals, in some cases with records, in some cases with records of violence, and these links have now got to be explored.  And I find it quite incredible that a supposed reputable organization made its money, produced its commercial results, at the expense of ordinary people by using known criminals, and that is now what's got to be investigated. Mr. Brown's statements on criminality closely echo remarks made last week in the House of Commons by Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who has vigorously pursued the implications of the phone hacking scandal over the past two years.  Last week, Mr. Watson claimed that investigators working for The News of the World when it was edited by Rebekah Brooks, who is now the chief executive of News International, had interfered with a police officer's investigation of a murder to protect a private investigator who worked for the tabloid. Mr. Watson said:     I want to inform the House of further evidence that Rebekah Brooks knew about the unlawful tactics of News of the World as early as 2002, despite all her denials yesterday. Rebekah Brooks was present at a meeting with Scotland Yard when police officers pursuing a murder investigation provided her with evidence that her newspaper was interfering with the pursuit of justice.       The (officers, who) included Dick Fedorcio of the Metropolitan Police, told her that News of the World staff were guilty of interference and party to using unlawful means to attempt to discredit a police officer and his wife. She was told of actions by people she paid to expose and discredit David Cook and his wife, Jacqui Hames, so that Mr. Cook would be prevented from completing an investigation into a murder. News International was paying people to interfere with police officers and doing so on behalf of known criminals. We know now that News International, Mr. Speaker, had entered the criminal underworld. 8:34 A.M. | Yates '99 Percent Certain' His Own Phone Was Hacked Here is ITN video of John Yates, acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (a/k/a Scotland Yard), telling a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that he is ""99 percent certain"" that his own phone was hacked in 2005 and 2006: 8:19 A.M. | Reporters Say Police Tracked Phones for Cash At the end of their latest article on the scandal, my colleagues John Burns, Jo Becker and Alan Cowell report that ""two former journalists for The News of the World - the newspaper at the epicenter of the scandal, which the Murdoch family closed last weekend - said police officers had been bribed to use restricted cellphone-tracking technology to pinpoint the location of people sought by the papers in their pursuit of scoops."" They explain how the process, known as ""pinging,"" worked: an inquiry by The New York Times, which included interviews with two former journalists at The News of the World, has revealed the workings of the illicit cellphone tracking, which the former tabloid staffers said was known in the newsroom as ""pinging."" Under British law, the technology involved is restricted to law enforcement and security officials, requires case-by-case authorization, and is used mainly for high-profile criminal cases and terrorism investigations, according to a former senior Scotland Yard official who requested anonymity so as to be able to speak candidly. According to Oliver Crofton, a cybersecurity specialist who works to protect high-profile clients from such invasive tactics, cellphones are constantly pinging off relay towers as they search for a network, enabling an individual's location to be located within yards by checking the strength of the signal at three different towers. But the former Scotland Yard official who discussed the matter said that any officer who agreed to use the technique to assist a newspaper would be crossing a red line. ""That would be a massive breach,"" he said. A former show business reporter for The News of the World, Sean Hoare, who was fired in 2005, said that when he worked there, pinging cost the paper nearly $500 on each occasion. He first found out how the practice worked, he said, when he was scrambling to find someone and was told that one of the news desk editors, Greg Miskiw, could help. Mr. Miskiw asked for the person's cellphone number, and returned later with information showing the person's precise location in Scotland, Mr. Hoare said. Mr. Miskiw, who faces questioning by police on a separate matter, did not return calls for comment.  8:05 A.M. | Live Video of Parliamentary Committee Hearing Among the many questions being asked about the phone hacking scandal is why an initial police investigation, and a review of that investigation, failed to expose the scope of the abuses. The BBC's Democracy Live Web site is now streaming live video of testimony to the House of Commons' Home Affairs Committee, which is asking senior officers from London's Metropolitan Police force about the investigations into phone hacking at The News of the World. The first witness was John Yates, who is acting deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (a/k/a Scotland Yard). At the start of his appearance, Mr. Yates was asked about his recent mea culpa during an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, a London newspaper, in which he said that that his decision not to do a full review of the initial police investigation in 2009, when he was asked to look at it, ""was a pretty crap one."" Mr. Yates told the committee that he made that statement only after new information about the scope of misconduct at The News of the World was provided to the police last month by News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation. After he was grilled by members of the committee, Mr. Yates was dismissed by Keith Vaz, the chairman, who told him that his statements were ""unconvincing, so you may well be hearing from us again."" Peter Clarke, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, is currently being questioned.   "
News Corporation Looks to Bolster Stock With Buyback Plan,"The News Corporation on Tuesday moved to stanch the accelerating drop in its stock price, announcing a program to repurchase $5 billion in shares. Since last week, when a phone hacking scandal involving one of the company's British tabloids was revealed to be far more widespread than previously known, News Corporation's stock had lost about 15 percent of its value.         Investors, nervous that the widening controversy would imperil the company's bid to acquire the parts of British Sky Broadcasting that it does not already own, have dumped shares over the last several days.  But the announcement of the stock repurchase seemed to boost their confidence in News Corporation on Tuesday. Shares rose more than 1 percent on the Nasdaq and were trading at around $15.70 in late morning. News Corporation had $11.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of March, money that it had planned to put toward the BSkyB purchase. It already owns just under 40 percent of the satellite company, but last year bid for the remainder. The deal is a centerpiece of News Corporation's efforts to expand. But those plans are now delayed for at least several months - time the company hopes will allow for the furor over the hacking to subside. On Monday, News Corporation withdrew its intention to spin off BSkyB's 24-hour Sky News Channel, a move that automatically triggered a more lengthy regulatory review process. The deal appeared in increasing jeopardy in recent days, with members of the British government urging News Corporation's chairman, Rupert Murdoch, to withdraw his bid. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said Monday that Mr. Murdoch should ""do the decent and sensible thing, and reconsider"" his efforts to buy the rest of BSkyB. Mr. Clegg's remarks helped send News Corporation's shares tumbling almost 8 percent on Monday.  "
Congressmen Call for U.S. Investigation of News Corporation,"Two members of Congress are calling for government inquiries in the United States into the conduct of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which is enmeshed in a deepening hacking scandal in Britain. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said in a letter Wednesday that the News Corporation may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States. He said media reports indicated that reporters for a company subsidiary, News International, ""paid London police officers for information, including private telephone information, about the British royal family and other individuals for use in newspaper articles."" Because News Corporation is based in the United States, even employees in other countries may be bound by the act, which forbids payments to foreign officials. On Tuesday another senator, John D. Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, called more generally for inquiries into the phone hacking claims. ""The reported hacking by News Corporation newspapers against a range of  individuals - including children - is offensive and a serious breach of journalistic ethics,"" Mr. Rockefeller said in a statement. ""This raises serious questions about whether the company has broken U.S. law, and I encourage the appropriate agencies to investigate to ensure that Americans have not had their privacy violated."" Mr. Rockefeller concluded, ""I am concerned that the admitted phone hacking in London by the News Corp. may have extended to 9/11 victims or other Americans.  If they did, the consequences will be severe."" In the letter to the heads of the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Lautenberg said the media reports have raised ""serious questions about the legality of the conduct of News Corporation and its subsidiaries,"" and added, ""further investigation may reveal that current reports only scratch the surface of the problem at News Corporation."" He asked both agencies to examine whether formal investigations into the alleged payments were appropriate. Both senators have been critics of subsidiaries of News Corporation in the past. Mr. Rockefeller last year singled out the company's Fox News Channel and one other channel, MSNBC, as polarizing forces in politics. Mr. Lautenberg earlier this year accused the company's local television station in New Jersey of failing to live up to its public service obligations.  "
Law Surprise: News Corp.'s Hiring of Williams & Connolly,"7:19 p.m. | Updated Over the past four decades, two large law firms -- Hogan Lovells and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom -- have served as primary outside counsel to News Corporation, the media conglomerate run by Rupert Murdoch. So the corporate-law world is abuzz over the News Corp.'s surprising decision to hire Williams & Connolly and its star litigator Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. to help it deal with the escalating legal crisis relating to the phone-hacking and police-bribing scandal in Britain.  The move underscores the central role that Joel I. Klein is playing in managing the company's mounting legal problems, and also highlights the void in legal leadership that currently exists at the News Corporation. Mr. Klein, a longtime Washington lawyer, has close ties to Williams & Connolly. Among them: His wife is Nicole Seligman, a former prominent partner at the firm who worked closely with Mr. Sullivan on numerous cases. She now serves as general counsel of Sony Corporation. Mr. Murdoch announced last week that Mr. Klein was taking charge of the News Corporation's internal investigation of phone hacking. It was a surprising turn in the career of Mr. Klein, the former top antitrust lawyer in President Clinton's Justice Department who left his job as chancellor of the New York City public schools to join News Corp. But his role at the media empire was a decidedly non-legal one: Mr. Klein was charged with pursuing ""entrepreneurial ventures"" focused on education. But when the phone-hacking scandal erupted early last week, Mr. Murdoch found himself without a general counsel. Last month Lawrence A. ""Lon"" Jacobs, the company's highest-ranking in-house lawyer, left ""to pursue new opportunities."" That forced Mr. Murdoch to put Mr. Klein, who had also joined the company's board of directors, in charge of the phone-hacking investigation. Mr. Klein and Williams & Connolly have their hands full, as the company's legal problems have spilled over into the United States with criminal investigations, civil lawsuits and other government probes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a preliminary inquiry Thursday into allegations that News Corporation journalists sought to gain access to the phone records of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. On Wednesday, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, suggested that government authorities should examine the case and consider starting a formal investigation, invoking potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act statute as a potential line of inquiry. It is a plum assignment for Williams & Connolly, the prominent Washington law firm known for its high-stakes litigation practice. Mr. Sullivan is no stranger to high-profile cases, having represented, among others, the late former Senator Ted Stevens in a political corruption trial, Richard Grasso of the New York Stock Exchange in an executive compensation case, and Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair. Lawyers within Hogan Lovells and Skadden are disappointed over not getting the phone-hacking assignment from the News Corporation, according to people within both firms who declined to speak publicly about the matter. Internal corporate investigations, especially large ones like this with international and criminal components, are among the more lucrative jobs for a company's outside law firm. A News Corporation spokeswoman declined to comment. Spokesmen for Hogan and Skadden declined to comment. Skadden has done much of News Corp.'s mergers-and-acquisitions work over the past several years, including its 2007 purchase of Dow Jones. The firm also represented the company in its proposed bid of British Sky Broadcasting Group, which News. Corp. dropped on Wednesday under pressure from the U.K. government. Perhaps the bigger blow is to Hogan Lovells, which recently represented the News Corporation in its $500 million settlement with Valassis Communications. The company had accused a News Corp. subsidiary of trying to obtain a monopoly in the in-store coupon business. Hogan became one of the News Corp.'s main outside counsel when it acquired the New York law firm Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Sheinfeld in 2002. Its deep ties to News Corp. date back to 1973, when Mr. Murdoch shifted his focus to the United States and hired the late Howard Squadron as his legal counsel. Mr. Murdoch has credited Mr. Squadron with helping News Corp. become one of the largest media companies in the world. Another Squadron lawyer, Ira S. Sheinfeld, still works at Hogan and is the News Corp.'s longtime tax advisor. Mr. Murdoch has also recruited a series of Squadron lawyers in-house to play senior roles in the News Corporation's legal department. The first was Arthur Siskind, who joined the News Corp. as its chief legal office in 1991. He was succeeded in 2004 by Mr. Jacobs, also a Squadron partner, who left last month. Several other senior News Corporation lawyers started their careers at Squadron, including Mark Jackson, the top lawyer at Dow Jones, and Genie Gavenchak, the company's chief compliance officer. The News Corp.'s hiring of Williams & Connolly also stings the Washington-based Hogan for a historical reason. In 1967, Hogan's star trial lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams, left the firm to start Williams & Connolly.   "
BSkyB Plans Share Buyback and Higher Dividend,"LONDON - British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company partly owned by Rupert Murdoch, said on Friday it would buy back some of its own shares and increase the dividend to compensate investors. BSkyB, as the company is also known, said it planned a share buyback worth 750 million, or $1.2 billion, and would return another 253 million to shareholders through a final dividend of 14.54 pence a share. BSkyB's shares dropped more than 15 percent since News Corporation cancelled its bid this month for the 61 percent of BSkyB it does not own because of political opposition following the growing phone hacking scandal at one of News Corporation's British tabloid newspapers. News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's global media empire, would participate in the share buyback, meaning its 39 percent stake in BskyB would not increase. BSkyB also said its board unanimously voted in favor of keeping James R. Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son and a senior executive at News Corporation, in his job as chairman of BskyB's board. It was the board's first meeting since News Corporation was forced to abandon its BSkyB bid. ""It was obviously a very full discussion,"" BSkyB's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said on a conference call. ""At the end of that, the board was unanimous in its support for James to continue as chairman."" Pressure on James Murdoch and BSkyB's board to replace him had mounted ever since the appearance of new allegations of phone hacking at the British tabloid The News of the World, which fell under James Murdoch's remit at News Corporation. Mr. Darroch told the BBC in an interview on Friday that James Murdoch ""got strong support"" at BSkyB. He added that judging by his work at BSkyB, ""he always acted with the highest degree of integrity."" But some shareholders, including large British pension funds, have criticized BSkyB's choice of chairman in the past, saying they would prefer a chairman who was not directly linked to the company's largest shareholder, News Corporation. There were signs that the phone hacking scandal also hurt other parts of the Murdoch media empire beyond The News of the World, which was shuttered. The Times of London lost some subscribers in the immediate aftermath of the phone hacking scandal, James Harding, editor of the newspaper told the BBC on Wednesday. ""We saw small numbers of people cancelled their digital subscription or print subscription,"" Mr. Harding said. ""Those have largely come back."" BSkyB, which owns several satellite channels, said on Friday that operating profit for the full year that ended in June rose 23 percent to 1.07 billion from 872 million a year earlier. That beat the average 1.06 billion in profit analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters predicted. BSkyB's shares rose 0.5 percent in London on Friday. ""Recent hysteria may have affected the share price,"" Richard Hunter at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London wrote in a note to clients. ""But the underlying business remains defiantly strong.""   "
Shop for Spies and Would-Be Spies,"From its 1,200-square-foot space overlooking  34th Street in Manhattan, Spy Shops offers  customized surveillance installations with five-figure price tags for foreign princes, chart-topping rappers, business tycoons and paranoid husbands.  Its display cases exhibit an impressive pastiche of long-range listening equipment ($249 and up) and matchbook-sized tracking devices ($650), perfect for concealment in an imitation soda can, which the store also offers. Spy Shops even sells a high-definition video camera embedded in a fake B.M.W. key ($249), which might make Agent 007 - a poster of  James Bond hangs on a wall - kvell with delight.  The shop, on the second floor of the building, is one of a handful of New York City businesses devoted to the burgeoning consumer surveillance industry, and all the hidden-camera gadgetry, and dissolvable-paper gimmickry, that it has spawned. It is generally a lucrative industry, employees say, since there is no shortage of New Yorkers with security concerns, whether warranted or paranoia-induced. And it operates in something of a legal hinterland -- certain products come with  disclaimers warning customers of the fine line between lawful surveillance and criminal espionage. Steven Demeter, 32, one of the owners of Spy Shops, likes to say that his is a ""right-now business"" because ""people want on-the-spot results."" And for the last few weeks, ever since the British phone-hacking scandal erupted, Spy Shops' right-now request has been cellphone security, Mr. Demeter said.  ""I knew there was a connection,"" Mr. Demeter's wife and co-owner, Silvia Demeter, said, ""because whenever there's a breaking story like that we get a lot of phone calls. The first couple days it was ringing off the wall."" Requests for cellphone debugging exams ($150), in which phones are examined for tracking devices and software, are up, as are sales of Spy Shops' $1,800 cellphones, equipped with  built-in scramblers to prevent conversations from being monitored.   ""I had a guy come in the other day and buy six of them for his company,"" Mr. Demeter said. The truth, however, is that while Spy Shops and other consumer surveillance outlets, like Spy Store, in the West Village, may specialize in stealth, they have no real way to protect customers against the remote voice mail invasions  perpetrated by The News of the World, the British tabloid that was at the center of the hacking scandal.  Experts caution that the latest phone-hacking technologies are virtually undetectable because they require no hardware or software to be installed on a phone.  ""With these new products they got out, they can hack into your phone and it's a problem,'' said Bob Leonard, an owner of Spy Store. ""I told a guy this morning already: Take your battery out. ""  Ms. Demeter, 40, said she was astonished when she began to comprehend the simplicity with which voice mails could be hacked into with an inexpensive, relatively new product prominently displayed in her store. ""This card will do it,"" she said, pointing to a stack of business cards with ""Caller ID Controller"" printed on them, alongside a personal identification number.  The card, which costs $25, can alter the way a phone number appears on a recipient's caller I.D., she said. This can prove handy for a cheating spouse wishing to disguise his location, a scheme Ms. Demeter said was favored by one of her customers. The card could be used to make a phone number appearing on a recipient's caller I.D. match that person's own number, making it possible to access the voice mail system without entering a password. ""That is unprotectable,"" Ms. Demeter said. ""Totally unprotectable."" As if on cue, Mario Vivas, a Spy Shops manager and technician, hacked into his own voice mail using a Web site offering a free caller I.D.-faking service.  Despite Spy Shops' innovative solutions for everyone from a father eager to monitor the speed and location of his child's car, to an artist needing to film the interior of a tiny sculpture, its employees are admittedly ill-equipped to deal with cellphone hackers. (Certain cellphone providers, but not all, have built-in safeguards requiring the entry of a voice-mail password, even when the call appears to come from the phone itself.)  ""The new technology is great when you want to know something, but when you want to protect yourself, sometimes it gets a little difficult,"" Ms. Demeter said.  And that seemed to trouble customers at Spy Shops the other day, even as they shopped for gadgets with which to eavesdrop on others.  Asked if he had been concerned about the allegations of cellphone hacking, a man, who would only identify himself as Will, said: ""Of course! I don't want people listening."" Yet, Will, as he waited to complete his order, seemed pleased at having found the answer to his personal security problem: a video camera implanted in a functioning alarm clock that would survey his room, and his sticky-fingered roommates, in his absence.   ""We don't have any privacy anymore,"" Will said, as he walked out with a new surveillance gadget.   "
News Corp.'s Independent Directors Have Strong Ties to Murdoch,"When the News Corporation board convenes on the 20th Century Fox Studios lot Tuesday for its first meeting since a phone hacking scandal overseas plunged the company into turmoil, the participants will include many people with deep and personal ties to Rupert Murdoch. One is a former Goldman Sachs president who helped News Corporation broker mega deals. Another is godfather to one of Mr. Murdoch's grandchildren. Another ran Mr. Murdoch's Australian subsidiary, News Limited. And those are just some of the  News Corporation's independent directors, designated as such because they meet criteria intended to ensure that companies maintain a layer of objective oversight.News Corporation considers nine of its 16 directors independent. Many owe their careers to Mr. Murdoch. Others made millions of dollars making him richer. Those include: News Corporation's board is hardly the only one in corporate America that is stacked with independent directors who have close relationships with the companies that shareholders have elected them to serve. But corporate governance experts said that the long history between News Corporation and many of its independent directors is a glaring example of how chumminess in the boardroom can allow and even contribute to mismanagement. ""I keep watching this and thinking that they don't realize we can see them,"" said Lucy P. Marcus, chief executive of Marcus Venture Consulting who writes about corporate governance issues for the Harvard Business Review blog network. ""The reason we have corporate governance is not because it's a nice thing to do. It's because if you actually have a robust board, it can be beneficial. I don't think News Corp. would be in the same trouble that they are in now if they had an independent board."" In order for an overhaul on the News Corporation board or any other corporate board, the rules governing who is eligible to serve as a director would need to change. And right now News Corporation is in full compliance of the rules set by the Nasdaq, the exchange on which its stock is traded, and federal law. Nasdaq's rules state broadly that independent directors cannot have a relationship that ""would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director."" Specifically, the Nasdaq excludes anyone who was employed the company in the past three years. The rules do allow, however, for former employees collecting retirement benefits to serve as independent directors. Some News Corporation shareholders have already started to press the issue. Wespath Investment Management, a division of the board of pension and health benefits for the United Methodist Church and owner of about 1.1 million News Corporation Class A shares, wrote to the board objecting to, among other things, the board's seeming lack of independence. ""As shareholders interested in preserving the long-term value of the company, it is important that the board of directors act quickly to improve its governance standards,"" the letter said. An earlier version of this post erroneously stated that John L. Thornton represented News Corporation in its acquisition of Star TV. Mr. Thornton represented the owner of Star TV.   "
"Accel's Breyer to Join News Corp. Board, as 2 Depart","News Corporation, which is in the midst of a phone-hacking scandal, is reshuffling the board. On Friday, the media conglomerate announced that James W. Breyer of the venture capital firm Accel Partners had been nominated to the board. Two News Corporation directors, Kenneth E. Cowley and Thomas J. Perkins of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, will step down.  Shareholders will vote on Mr. Breyer at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for Oct. 21.  ""Jim has a remarkable track record in the investment community and his background in media and technology will enable him to make significant contributions to News Corporation's board,"" Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation's chief executive, said in a statement.  The changes comes as the media conglomerate continues to wrestle with a wide-ranging phone-hacking scandal that has led to the departure of several top managers and the closure of The News of the World, the company's long-running British tabloid. In August, Mr. Murdoch told investors that he had the support of the board and planned to remain as its chief executive.   With Mr. Breyer, the company will add a prominent Silicon Valley investor to its board, even as it loses Mr. Perkins, one of the founding members of Kleiner Perkins. Mr. Breyer, who also serves on the boards of Wal-Mart Stores and Dell, led Accel's first investment in Facebook in 2005 and was a major player in the firm's investments in Brightcove, Groupon and Etsy, an online e-commerce site. ""I consider it a privilege to be nominated, and I am excited about the prospect of joining News Corp.'s distinguished board at this exciting time in the company's history,"" Mr. Breyer said in a statement.  In its statement, the company did not explain why Mr. Cowley, who has served on the board since 1979, and Mr. Perkins are leaving. Mr. Cowley has long been a part of the News Corp. family, joining the media empire in 1964 to help launch The Australian. He later served as the chief executive of News Limited, a unit of News Corp., from 1980 to 1997. Mr. Perkins, a board member for some 15 years, has been a vocal defender of the company's management. When the scandal broke, he was the first board member to discuss the controversy, telling The New York Times in July that the board ""is fully supportive of the top management."" He added, the board members ""were stunned to discover the magnitude of the scandal."" Still, some analysts say, Mr. Perkins may have been more agitated behind closed doors. He abruptly resigned from Hewlett-Packard's board in 2006 over the company's handling of a separate scandal involving phone records.   "
News Corp. Filing Rebuts Criticism of Board,"News Corporation went on the defensive Tuesday morning after an investor advisory firm urged shareholders to vote against reinstating several key members of the media giant's board of directors, including the chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, and his son James Murdoch. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing the company reminded shareholders ahead of an Oct. 21 vote that News Corp. ""reported a strong performance for fiscal 2011"" and that despite the global economic downturn the company ""delivered extraordinary total shareholder return."" The filing praises the performance of Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey, points out that he has been working under reduced compensation and defends Mr. Murdoch. ""Our CEO is critical to the value we create for our stockholders,"" it says. The filing represented a forceful rebuttal to a report released Monday by Institutional Shareholder Services, which said that 13 of the firm's 15 board members have insufficiently handled News Corp.'s involvement in an ongoing phone-hacking scandal in Britain. Fallout from the scandal included the shuttering of the 168-year-old News of the World tabloid, the arrest of several top executives, a public apology by Mr. Murdoch and widely-followed parliamentary hearings.""A striking lack of stewardship and failure of independence by a board whose inability to set a strong tone-at-the-top about unethical business practices has now resulted in enormous costs - financial, legal, regulatory, reputational and opportunity - for the shareholders the board ostensibly serves,"" the report by the proxy firm said of the phone-hacking scandal. In the S.E.C. filing News Corp. fired back. ""ISS's disproportionate focus on News of the World is misguided,"" the report said. ""The drivers of our business are intact, our position is strong and our future is promising."" The filing also reminded investors that the company is ""fully cooperating"" in the ongoing investigations into its media arm in Britain, News International, which oversaw News of the World.  ""We disagree with recommendations that stockholders should vote against our directors,'' the company advised. ""We respectfully request that stockholders vote 'FOR' all directors.""  Shareholders often take into account the advice of independent concerns such as International Shareholder Services. News Corp. investors will have a chance to vote on this and other matters at next week's shareholder meeting. The company is expected to report its quarterly earnings on Nov. 2. Despite News Corp.'s heated defense, in reality calls to diminish the roles of Mr. Murdoch and his son may not carry much weight. Mr. Murdoch controls 40 percent of News Corp. voting shares. In July Saudi Arabia's Prince Walid bin Talal, who owns 7 percent of the company's voting shares, publicly defended News Corp. management.    "
British Lawmaker Intensifies Pressure on News Corp.,"New accusations of criminal wrongdoing could be lodged at News Corporation executives on Friday at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Los Angeles. Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament who has led efforts to investigate the phone-hacking scandal at News Corporation's British newspaper unit, said Thursday that an investigation into surveillance techniques reportedly used at News Corporation could uncover other illegal activity. Mr. Watson acquired a shareholder proxy to attend the meeting. ""Be in no doubt, this isn't just about phone hacking. This company is facing criminal charges from bribing police officers"" to perjury, Mr. Watson said on a conference call with reporters. ""I don't think investors have been given the full picture, and that's really why I've decided to come out here."" A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. On Wednesday, a parliamentary hearing in London raised new questions about the testimony provided by James Murdoch, News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer. Les Hinton, former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, will testify to Parliament via video conference on Monday. Mr. Watson is one of hundreds of investors who will have the opportunity to address Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation chief executive and chairman, and vote on the company's leadership. Although the vote will be largely symbolic, with Mr. Murdoch controlling nearly 40 percent of shares, shareholder activists have flown to Los Angeles from Australia and the U.K. to attend. Mr. Watson said he plans to allege further illegal activity at News Corporation, though he would not get into specifics, saying he wants to ""save"" something for shareholders on Friday. Several shareholder groups and outside advisory firms have encouraged stockholders to vote against Mr. Murdoch and several other board members, including Mr. Murdoch's sons, James and Lachlan. Mr. Watson echoed that sentiment. ""You've got a $32 billion transglobal media empire that is currently being run like a dysfunctional family firm,"" he said. Mr. Murdoch is expected to defend the company's corporate governance and praise its financial performance. In a symbolic move, the shareholder meeting will be held on the Fox Studios lot, the epicenter of one of the most lucrative pieces of the News Corporation empire. Hit TV shows like ""Modern Family"" and ""Glee"" come from Fox, as do movies like the ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. Additionally, News Corporation's $5 billion stock buyback program that is currently under way has largely eased investors' concerns about phone-hacking, analysts said. In July, News Corporation shuttered its 168-year-old ""News of the World"" tabloid. ""The one thing investors who own News Corporation should care about is the return of capital,"" said Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst at Barclays Capital.   "
Investment Groups Prod Other Companies on James Murdoch's Board Membership,"5:46 p.m. | Updated The problems at News Corporation could eventually impact other companies-in industries ranging from art to health care to baseball. A major United States shareholder group has called for the removal of James Murdoch from the board of the Sotheby's auction house. Other groups have suggested that he be removed from the board of British satellite broadcasting company BSkyB, and the British health care giant Glaxo Smith Kline. On Wednesday, the CtW Investment Group, which works with pension funds for large labor unions like the Service Employees International Union, the Teamsters and the United Farm Workers, sent a letter to Michael I. Sovern, chairman of Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. In it the group called for the removal of Mr. Murdoch, News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer and a Sotheby's board member. On Thursday, Mr. Murdoch will face a second round of questions from British lawmakers about his involvement in a phone-hacking scandal at News Corporation's British newspaper unit. The CtW letter said Mr. Murdoch's ""mishandling of the phone hacking scandal"" makes him ""particularly ill suited to serve in the direction of a reputationally sensitive company such as Sotheby's."" The investment group, whose members handle pensions worth over $200 billion in assets, previously called for Mr.  Murdoch's removal from Sotheby's in an Oct. 21 letter. At a News Corporation shareholders meeting last month, 35 percent of the votes called for Mr. Murdoch's removal from the board, prompting CtW to again urge Sotheby's to remove him, said a CtW spokesman, Ed Keyser. ""While News Corporation -- which is effectively controlled by Murdoch family interests -- may be willing to risk investor opprobrium, Sotheby's, with its shareholding base comprising many of the same funds voicing concerns at News Corporation, cannot ignore the concerns raised over Mr. Murdoch's credibility and competency as an executive and corporate director,"" Richard Clayton, CtW's Research Director, wrote in the letter. A News Corporation spokesman declined to comment. On Oct. 24 Gilbert L. Klemann II, Sotheby's executive vice president and worldwide general counsel, sent a letter responding to CtW's first letter. Sotheby's ""is respectful of the concerns of its shareholders,"" Mr. Klemann wrote, adding that ""James Murdoch is a valued member of Sotheby's Board of Directors."" A spokeswoman for Sotheby's did not respond to requests for comment about the second CtW letter. Last month a British shareholder advisory firm, Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (or P.I.R.C.), called for Mr. Murdoch's removal from the BSkyB board. BSkyB shareholders will vote for board members on Nov. 29. CtW has also called for his removal from the board of Glaxo Smith Kline ""in light of the investor outcry surrounding this year's News Corporation shareholder meeting."" Mr. Murdoch, the 38-year-old son of News Corporation's chairman and chief operating officer, Rupert Murdoch, also serves on the board of Yankee Global Enterprises, the holding company for the New York Yankees.

Children's Investment Fund Takes Stake in News Corp.,"LONDON -- The British hedge fund manager Chris Hohn recently bought an $833 million stake in News Corporation, even as police investigations about the media company's illegal phone-hacking practices continue on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr. Hohn's Children's Investment Fund acquired 53.8 million shares in News Corporation during the three months ended Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The stake represents the fund's largest current domestic equity holding, ahead of other blue chip companies like the Walt Disney Company and Viacom. Mr. Hohn has a track record of shareholder activism, which may lead to extra pressure on Rupert Murdoch as he looks to retain his position as chairman and chief executive at News Corporation.   In 2005, pressure from the Children's Investment Fund and other investors led Werner Seifert to resign his post as chief executive of Deutsche Borse after its unsuccessful takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange. News Corporation has been embroiled in controversy since the disclosure earlier this year that News of the World, one of the company's British tabloids, had illegally accessed the voice mail messages of crime victims and celebrities, including the British royal family. Almost 20 people have been arrested in Britain in relation to police investigations about the phone-hacking scandal. In July, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it had opened a preliminary inquiry on reports that News of the World journalists had attempted to hack the phones of 9/11 victims. After the F.B.I. announcement, the company's share price dropped 15 percent through mid-August. The stock has since recovered and is up almost 6 percent from its price in January.   "
Is James Murdoch Running Out of Denials?,"In almost every Road Runner cartoon, Wile E. Coyote overshoots the edge of a cliff and finds his feet spinning in the air, frantically pawing for the terra firma that he has left behind. Those of us watching know he is about to fall, and even as he continues to flail in midair, deep inside he knows it as well. We might wonder whether James Murdoch, the deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, now finds himself at a Wile E. Coyote moment.  In appearances before Parliament and in public statements, Mr. Murdoch, the head of the British division of News Corporation and once thought to be heir apparent to his father, Rupert Murdoch, has steadfastly maintained that he had no knowledge of widespread hacking at the now-shuttered News of the World. Some of his subordinates have maintained, just as steadfastly, that Mr. Murdoch well understood the scope of the problem and was willing to sign a $1.4 million settlement with the head of the Professional Footballers' Association, Gordon Taylor, who threatened to reveal how widespread hacking was. The settlement, in 2008, allowed the company to maintain the illusion that phone hacking was the province of a single ""rogue reporter."" The ground beneath his argument gave way on Tuesday when an e-mail, which surfaced in News Corporation's own investigation and was turned over to Parliament, indicated that Mr. Murdoch was sent and replied to an e-mail chain that said, among other things, that the legal fallout from the hacking was ""as bad as we feared.""  The first e-mail in the chain, sent by Colin Myler, who was then editor of News of the World, said that a meeting should be held quickly to form a strategy. Three days later, Mr. Murdoch met with Mr. Myler and Tom Crone, the newspaper's legal manager, and agreed to pay a large sum and settle the case quietly. Both men have testified that Mr. Murdoch knew what they were paying for. Ravi Somaya's article on Wednesday in The New York Times makes it clear that evidence of Mr. Murdoch's knowledge of the dimensions of the scandal is mounting. The e-mails do not show conclusively that Mr. Murdoch knew more about the extent of hacking than he has said. But they make clear that his subordinates informed him about the potential fallout at the time they were seeking his approval for an unusually large payment of more than $1 million to a victim of hacking. That victim had obtained evidence that the practice was common at The News of the World. Mr. Murdoch, who replied to the e-mail within minutes, maintained that he did not scroll down through its contents on his BlackBerry. The contents of the rest of the e-mail detailed a toxic cloud over the newspaper, as the Guardian, and others, reported. The forwarded note from the paper's legal manager, Tom Crone, warned of a ""nightmare scenario"" because Taylor had obtained firm evidence of the hacking of one of his colleague's phones which involved at least one other News of the World journalist. Mr. Myler's e-mail also contained a second warning, from another lawyer retained by the News of the World, which added that Mr. Taylor's legal team wanted to demonstrate that phone hacking was ""rife"" throughout News International, the British parent company of the red top title. Mr. Murdoch does have one thing in his favor: His reply does not mirror the alarm of what he had been sent: ""No worries,"" he wrote, ""I am in during the afternoon. If you want to talk before I'll be home tonight after seven and most of the day tomorrow."" As it turned out, there was plenty to worry about. Mr. Murdoch was reduced on Tuesday to sending a statement to Parliament that merely echoed past denials and added, by way of explanation, ""I am confident that I did not review the full e-mail chain at the time or afterwards."" The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corporation, framed the story as a critical inflection point for Mr. Murdoch. The e-mails released Tuesday drive at a key question in the phone-hacking saga: when senior News Corporation executives first became aware of the widespread nature of wrongdoing at the News of the World. Edward Wasserman, a professor of journalism ethics at Washington and Lee University in Virginia, said the hacking investigation would continue to raise fundamental questions about how News Corporation is governed. He wrote in an e-mail: If the issue were one of simple management accountability, he'd be gone. But my sense is that the more overriding issue isn't James' ability to succeed Rupert in the near term - which seems unimaginable - but the future of the founding family's rule over News Corporation. Until the elder Murdoch is willing to relinquish that in the best interests of the company, they might well try to ride this out and hope that this is the worst of it. Unfortunately, just as these e-mails emerged only recently, one can only wonder what other documentary miseries await."" When the scandal mushroomed this summer, I predicted that it would eventually engulf Mr. Murdoch. He has since gone to great lengths to build a ledge that would allow him to put the mess in Britain behind him as he segued back to the United States, but the dimensions of the scandal keep pulling him back in.  The governmental and criminal investigations -18 former News of the World employees have been arrested - continue to produce new evidence and new revelations. Mr. Murdoch next trip to Parliament will not be as disciplined or impressive as his last two as a practical matter. More is known, and there is far less room to maneuver. As Bloomberg Businessweek pointed out, his approach to explaining his nonrole in hacking has already created shareholder dissension. News Corporation shareholders in October lodged a protest vote against Rupert Murdoch, the company's chairman and C.E.O., and his sons, following an annual meeting at which investors called for governance changes and an end to voting practices that cement the family's control. James received the highest percentage of votes against his election to the board, at 35 percent. But the pressure on the investment side is less about the specific effect on the business and more about succession and leadership. In fact, Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research said in a phone interview that many investors saw the troubles in Britain as a net positive. ""If the problems with hacking lead News Corporation to shed newspaper assets, that would be a good thing,"" he said. ""Investors don't buy their stock for the newspapers. Shareholders don't like the newspaper business, which they see as a passion project for the Murdochs and a drag on earnings. So what looks like a bad thing could be a meaningful positive for shareholders."" The problem is less about business management than preserving Mr. Murdoch's credibility as a leader. Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament, did not mince words in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek: ""James Murdoch is slipshod as a manager and News International have been slippery with their evidence to Parliament. The rogue reporter line was a lie, and News International knew it."" By now a truism to the point of cliché, it is still worth pointing out that what imperils Mr. Murdoch is not his connection to hacking, but the possible coverup of same. A week ago, Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator at the heart of the hacking scandal was arrested again and brought in for questioning anew, not just for hacking, but for ""perverting the course of justice."" Clearly, the coverup is very much a part of the investigation. Rebekah Brooks, a close confidante of Mr. Murdoch and the former chief executive of News International, has been arrested as well. British law enforcement will no doubt be questioning her not only about what went on during her watch, but whether those above her were aware of the dimensions of the scandal. And people familiar with the investigation said it was quite possible that Mr. Murdoch could be arrested, or at the very least, questioned under caution, as part of Operation Weeting, the ongoing investigation into the hacking. Whether in responding to the police, Parliament or the press, Mr. Murdoch is out of sacrificial lambs and now in custody of an ugly-looking set of facts. As Wile E. Coyote once told Bugs Bunny, ""We both know very well that there is nothing left in the bag.""   "
Times of London Cancels Comedy Podcast That Mocked Murdoch,"8:06 a.m. | Updated  BUGLE NEWS ALERT: The Bugle will be leaving Times Online in the near future. We will do everything we can to keep The Bugle going...Wed Dec 14 12:00:55 via TweetDeckThe Buglehellobuglers The Times of London, the British daily owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will stop publishing a satirical podcast that ruthlessly mocked the paper's corporate owners over the phone hacking scandal at News Corporation, a producer and one of its stars said on Wednesday. The four-year-old podcast, The Bugle, drew a widening audience over the summer as it directed withering comedic barbs at Mr. Murdoch and other top executives at the company, including Mr. Murdoch's son, James, who heads the European division of News Corporation. But Andy Zaltzman, a British comedian who stars in the weekly show with John Oliver, of ""The Daily Show,"" said he had been informed on Tuesday that their efforts would not be supported by the paper next year. ""Last show possibly this week, but hopefully mid-January,"" he said. ""No lash-out plans. Yet."" In a statement, The Times did not explain the reason for the cancellation but said the show's final episode would be Dec. 30. ""It has been a pleasure to work with John and Andy and we wish them every success for the future,"" the statement read. The freelance producer of the show, Chris Skinner, said the decision had been made for financial reasons and not because the comedians had attacked the boss. ""I think the show has felt a bit of a funny fit ever since the paywall was introduced,"" he said, referring to the subscription required to read the paper online. ""It's not been a great year for the company, and I'm not surprised that they are cutting costs."" He said the other regular podcast the paper produces, a soccer show, would continue. Despite attracting hundreds of thousands of weekly downloads and an increasing number of American listeners, The Bugle never gained a permanent sponsor, Mr. Skinner said. ""Listening figures are up, but media sales in the U.K. as a whole are down,"" he said. The cancellation, announced publicly on Wednesday on Twitter, comes just as the news out of Britain's phone hacking scandal has begun providing new material for the satirists.  James Murdoch said that while he had replied to e-mails about the potential legal fallout from phone hacking by the company's British papers, he still knew nothing about the practice, explaining that he ""did not read the full e-mail chain."" It is just the sort of material the comedians would have pounced on. In the meantime, the show will need to find a new studio space after vacating one in a News Corporation building in Wapping, London. And then there is the pesky question of how to pay for the costs of producing the show, which Mr. Zaltzman said would continue. ""No idea where we'll end up, but I think a subscription model might work,"" he said. ""We might indeed start raiding your wallet."" If we do end up using a pay model, we'd make sure it was easily accessible on as many platforms as possible, and reasonably priced.Wed Dec 14 12:50:02 via TweetDeckThe Buglehellobuglers   "
Year in Media | Phone-Hacking Scandal Rattles the Murdochs," Until this past summer, The News of the World tabloid didn't mean much to readers outside Britain. When it suddenly stood at the center of a phone-hacking scandal, that didn't change much. Even the British weren't that engaged. (The public may lap up chatter about celebrities, but evidently they don't care much about how that gossip was gathered.) But public opinion did change with reports in The Guardian newspaper that a private investigator for The News of the World, part of the News Corporation, had hacked the voice mails of the kidnapped and murdered teenager,  Milly Dowler. (Another allegation, that the investigator erased some of the messages, thereby giving hope to the the Dowler family that Milly was still alive, has been thrown into question in recent weeks.) By July, News Corporation's chairman and chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, closed the 167-year-old newspaper, and Mr. Murdoch and his son James Murdoch were called before Parliament. The scandal not only raised the curtain on news gathering at Britain's oldest tabloid (and the British press in general), but called into question the relationships between the Murdochs and the country's political leaders. The climate in Britain prompted News Corporation to withdraw its $12 billion bid to acquire the portion of British satellite service BSkyB it didn't already own. And, larger still, the scandal has tainted the News Corporation's image, stroked shareholder discontent and called into question who will take over from the 80-year-old Mr. Murdoch. Once the inevitable successor, James Murdoch continues to face scrutiny from British lawmakers. His predicament could lead to a power vacuum at one of the world's largest and most influential media conglomerates. Earlier Media Moments   "
A Hacking Case Becomes a War Of the Tabloids,"LONDON -- It was a classic tabloid scoop: a young woman's account of a two-year affair with the actor Ralph Fiennes, spiced up with racy details of what he liked to do and how he liked to do it. Three newspapers -- The Sunday Mirror, The Mail on Sunday and News of the World -- carried their versions of the tale on Feb. 5, 2006. The first two papers obtained the story via the normal tabloid route, paying the woman, Cornelia Crisan, $:35,000 to tell all. But it appears that News of the World, furious at the prospect of being outmaneuvered, took a sneakier approach: It illegally hacked into the voice mail messages of Ms. Crisan's press agent, Nicola Phillips, and stole the story, according to allegations in a new lawsuit.  The details of how News of the World went about its operation are soon to be made public as part of the lawsuit, brought by Ms. Phillips against the newspaper and its parent company, News Group Newspapers, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News International. Court papers in the case, as described by people familiar with the lawsuit, shed a stark and unflattering light on the newspaper's reliance on phone hacking as a standard reporting method. This conduct is at the heart of a growing array of civil lawsuits and criminal inquiries against the paper and News Group. Until recently, News of the World maintained that the hacking had been limited to a single ''rogue reporter,'' the paper's former royals editor, Clive Goodman. Mr. Goodman was jailed in 2007, along with a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, after both pleaded guilty to illegally intercepting the messages of members of the royal household. But the paper's assertion was undermined last month when it dismissed Ian Edmondson, the paper's assistant editor for news, after he was apparently linked to phone hacking in court papers in a lawsuit brought by the actress Sienna Miller, who also alleges that her messages were illegally intercepted. Also late last month, Mr. Edmondson's former boss, Andy Coulson -- News of the World's editor when hacking seems to have been at its height -- resigned as Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director, saying that continued speculation about his possible role in the scandal was interfering with his job. Mr. Coulson continues to say he knew nothing about the hacking. Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament who believes his phone was hacked and has sued to force a judicial investigation of the police's handling of the case, predicted that with more cases coming up, there would be a flood of new information. ''I think there's a massive scandal still to unfold,'' Mr. Bryant said. Ms. Phillips's lawsuit is just one of many. Among the celebrities suing or considering suing are Ms. Miller; her stepmother, the interior designer Kelly Hoppen; the actor Steve Coogan; a sports agent named Skylet Andrew; and Chris Tarrant, the host of Britain's ''Who Wants to Be Millionaire.'' At least a half-dozen more public figures have consulted lawyers and are said to be preparing suits. After being accused of dragging their feet, the Metropolitan Police have reopened their criminal inquiry, and prosecutors are formally investigating the police's initial response to the case. For years, some reporters at other newspapers have been suspected of hacking messages, but in recent years, only News of the World has been sued by hacking victims. A hearing is scheduled for later this month for Ms. Phillips's lawsuit. Like her case, the other cases beginning to wend their way through the courts bolster the perception that hacking cellphones was a regular part of News of the World's news gathering operation, something its executives have denied for the past five years. Evidence in Ms. Phillips's case also suggests that Mr. Edmondson, the former news editor, had a central role in the hacking operation. The name ''Ian'' appears in court papers on several photocopied pages from the notebooks of Mr. Mulcaire seized by the police in August 2006. The new documents, people familiar with the case say, support allegations that Mr. Edmondson specifically directed Mr. Mulcaire to gain access to Ms. Phillips's phone -- and may have hacked her phone himself. Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Edmondson are named as co-defendants in Ms. Phillips's suit, along with News Group. Reached by telephone, Ms. Phillips, 30, refused to comment or to disclose any details of the suit, saying she did not want to jeopardize her court case. Mark Lewis, the lawyer for Ms. Phillips, also refused to discuss the particulars of the case. Mr. Edmondson, speaking through his lawyers, has denied any wrongdoing. ''We're not making any comment on the current litigation,'' said a spokeswoman for News International, speaking on the condition of anonymity according to company policy. Referring to Mr. Edmondson, she added, ''News International reiterates that, if presented with evidence of wrongdoing, we will take swift and decisive action -- as demonstrated by last week's dismissal of a senior staff member.'' In 2006, when she says her phone was hacked, Ms. Phillips worked for Max Clifford Associates, press agents who mediate between people peddling stories -- the sexier the better -- and papers willing to pay for them. Such checkbook scoops are the bread and butter of Britain's sharp-elbowed tabloids, and News of the World, with its deep pockets and aggressive methods, is among the most eager consumers. But at the time, Mr. Clifford was not doing business with the paper, which had angered him by writing unflattering articles about one of his clients. So when Ms. Crisan, a blond, buxom Romanian singer, came forward to talk about how Mr. Fiennes had cheated on his girlfriend with her, Ms. Phillips took the scoop to News of the World's competitors. She negotiated a deal with The Sunday Mirror and The Mail on Sunday, which together spent $:35,000, or about $62,000, for exclusive access to Ms. Crisan. The money bought many titillating details. ''He Stripped Me Slowly and Then Said, 'Keep Your High Heels On,' '' was the headline in The Sunday Mirror. The Mail on Sunday related how Ms. Crisan irritated Mr. Fiennes by revealing that ''Maid in Manhattan'' was the only movie she had seen him in. When she then rented ''The End of the Affair,'' she said, she found to her dismay that Mr. Fiennes had used the same lovemaking techniques with her that he had used with Julianne Moore in the movie. ''It made me wonder how genuine it was when he did this with me,'' she told the paper. Unbeknown to The Mirror and The Mail, News of the World already had the story, without paying for it. The suit alleges that News of the World found out about Ms. Phillips's negotiations by hacking into the messages on her phone and on the phones of her contacts, including reporters for The Mail and The Mirror, Ms. Crisan and Mr. Clifford. (News International agreed to pay Mr. Clifford $:1 million after he filed his own hacking lawsuit.) Mr. Mulcaire's notes reveal that News of the World also listened to personal messages left by and for Ms. Phillips and her friends. News of the World managed to track down Ms. Crisan on a train from London to Edinburgh in time to publish an article on the same day as the other papers. The headline in its story, under the bylines of Holly Jarvis, Neville Thurlbeck and Neil McLeod, was ''Another Fiennes Mess.'' The suit also reveals how in Britain's dog-eat-dog tabloid world, ethical reporters buy stories, but unethical ones steal them. Brendan Montague, a former freelance journalist who often sold stories to News of the World, claims that the paper hacked into his voice mail messages to spoil his efforts to sell the story of a sex scandal involving a celebrity chef to one of its rivals -- thus depriving him of a $:30,000 fee. Last year, he said he was not surprised by the hacking, but was stunned by ''the fact that this process is so simple, swift and apparently routine,'' he wrote in the newspaper The Guardian.  "
Hacking Suits In Britain To Proceed As Tests,"LONDON -- Confronted with the prospect that dozens more potential phone-hacking victims might emerge and sue the tabloid News of the World, a High Court judge said on Friday that he would proceed with four of the current cases, using them as tests to assess damages for further claims. ''Otherwise we will be going on forever,'' said the judge, Geoffrey Vos. ''Some people may want to, but I don't.'' Judge Vos added that he wanted to ''achieve a resolution of all these cases in the shortest possible time at the minimum possible cost.''  He said he would decide later which cases to bring forward, but that he was inclined to proceed with those brought by the actress Sienna Miller; the designer Kelly Hoppen; Andy Gray, a television sports commentator; and Skylet Andrew, a sports agent. Those cases have advanced further than some others, he said, and represent a range of issues and possible levels of damage. Judge Vos made his remarks at a hearing intended to bring some order to the mushrooming civil actions proceeding against the News of the World. Last week, the newspaper admitted to illegally intercepting the voice-mail messages of eight public figures in the mid-2000's. It apologized and offered to pay compensation. At the hearing on Friday, it emerged that the paper had offered one of the victims, Ms. Miller, about $163,000 in damages, and given her a deadline of 21 days to consider the offer. Her lawyer, Hugh Tomlinson, said she had not yet decided what to do. At least 12 other people have begun cases against the newspaper, and at the hearing a lawyer for the Metropolitan Police said that officers had discovered at least 91 possible victims, and potentially many more. The courtroom was crammed with lawyers: for phone-hacking victims like Ms. Miller and Mr. Andrew; for the News of the World's parent company, News Group Newspapers; for the police department, which has assigned 40 officers to the criminal case; and for Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator hired in the mid-2000s by News of the World. Along with the News of the World's royalty reporter, Clive Goodman, Mr. Mulcaire was jailed in 2007 for hacking into the phones of aides to members of the royal family. Information found in his notebooks, which have been seized by the police, has led in the past few weeks to the detention and questioning of three senior News of the World journalists on suspicion of engaging in phone hacking. At the hearing, Mr. Mulcaire's lawyer, Alexandra Marzec, said he wanted to protect himself against possible criminal charges and was admitting to nothing. ''The admissions which have been made by News Group in the past week are made solely on behalf of News Group, and Mr. Mulcaire does not admit doing anything, and does not associate himself with these admissions,'' Ms. Marzec said. The police said that they were currently going through 9,200 pages of material seized from Mr. Mulcaire. Meanwhile, in a separate but related case, the police said they were considering opening an investigation into whether journalists had paid police officers for information. The move stems from remarks made in 2003 by Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World editor and now the chief executive of News International, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch and is News Group's parent company. Mrs. Brooks told the culture and media committee at the time that ''we have paid the police for information in the past.'' Asked this week about the remark, Mrs. Brooks said in a letter to a different parliamentary group, the home affairs committee, that she had been speaking generally. ''I was responding to a specific line of questioning on how newspapers get information,'' she wrote. ''My intention was simply to comment on the widely held belief that payments had been made in the past to police officers. If, in doing so, I gave the impression that I had knowledge of any specific cases, I can assure you that this was not my intention.'' In a letter to the home affairs committee, Assistant Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said that a senior officer had been assigned ''to conduct a scoping exercise to establish whether there are now any grounds for beginning a criminal investigation resulting from the comments made by Rebekah Brooks'' in 2003. A spokeswoman for News International said the company had no comment.  "
General Counsel of News Corp. Resigns in Wake of Settlement,"The general counsel for News Corporation, Lawrence A. Jacobs, is leaving ''to pursue new opportunities,'' the company said Wednesday. Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive, said he was grateful for Mr. Jacobs' ''wise counsel'' over the more than 15 years he was with the company.  ''I know this was a difficult decision for him to make, but I understand his desire to try new challenges,'' Mr. Murdoch said. Mr. Jacobs's resignation comes at a time when News Corporation is still dealing with the repercussions of a far-reaching phone hacking operation at one of its London newspapers, The News of the World. While Mr. Jacobs is not known to have had any involvement in the matter, he was the highest ranking legal officer in the media conglomerate during a period when the subsidiary that owns The News of the World, News International, was forced to apologize and pay out settlements to celebrities and others who had their phone voice mail systems hacked. The latest admission of fault in the matter came Tuesday when a lawyer for the newspaper offered ''sincere apologies'' to an actress, Sienna Miller. The paper had already agreed to pay her a $:100,000 settlement, about $164,000. In 2007, The News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, and an investigator employed by The News of the World, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed after pleading guilty to having illegally intercepted voice mail messages of Prince William and Prince Harry and their aides. People who have left the paper have described a reckless culture to how exclusive news is obtained, raising questions about whether illegal activities were overlooked as long as they delivered scoops. The other properties in News Corporation's large portfolio, which includes The Times of London, The Wall Street Journal and Fox News, have not been implicated in the scandal. Mr. Jacobs, 56, was named group general counsel and senior executive vice president in 2004. His tenure included another frustrating incident for the company: a $500 million settlement to Valassis Communications, which had accused a News Corporation subsidiary of trying to obtain a monopoly in the in-store coupon business. A News Corporation spokesman said the company would be looking at both internal and external candidates to fill the position, saying that ''we will decide on the right candidate at the appropriate time.''

"British Tabloid Hacked Missing Girl's Phone, Lawyer Says","LONDON -- The cellphone of a British schoolgirl who went missing in 2002 and whose murdered body was discovered six months later was repeatedly hacked by the News of the World tabloid at a time when no one knew what had happened to her, a lawyer for her family said Monday. According to the lawyer, Mark Lewis, the newspaper not only intercepted messages left on the phone of the girl, Milly Dowler, 13, by her increasingly frantic family after her disappearance, but also deleted some of those messages when her voice mailbox became full -- thus making room for new ones and listening to those in turn. This confused investigators and gave false hope to Milly's relatives, who believed it showed she was still alive and deleting the messages herself, Mr. Lewis said.  In a statement, Mr. Lewis called the newspaper's actions ''heinous'' and ''despicable'' and said the Dowler family had suffered ''distress heaped upon tragedy'' upon learning that News of the World ''had no humanity at such a terrible time.'' The disclosures, reported first in The Guardian, came as part of a broader police investigation into News of the World's routine practice of intercepting the cellphone messages of celebrities, politicians and other public figures in the mid-2000s. The newspaper has admitted that it did so in some cases, and has paid damages to the actress Sienna Miller and others. Numerous other people who say that their phones were hacked are suing the paper. But the revelations about Milly Dowler are significant for two reasons. The first is that the alleged hacking in this case occurred in 2002 -- five years before News of the World's chief royal reporter, Clive Goodman, was jailed along with Glenn Mulcaire, an investigator hired by the paper, after they were found guilty of intercepting the phone messages of members of the royal family. The Dowler case is the first to indicate publicly that similar behavior had occurred before. The second is that in 2002, the editor of News of the World was Rebekah Brooks, a confidant and favorite of Rupert Murdoch, whose corporation owns the paper. Ms. Brooks, who is now chief executive of News International, the British newspaper division of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, has always denied knowing anything about phone hacking at any Murdoch-owned papers. If Mr. Lewis's accusations about hacking during the Dowler case prove accurate, it would mean either that Ms. Brooks had no idea how the paper she edited was obtaining information about the Dowler family for its articles, or that she knew about the hacking and allowed it. Evidence that News of the World had hacked into Milly's cellphone and into the phones of her family members was found in notebooks belonging to Mr. Mulcaire that were turned over to the police as part of a wider investigation, The Guardian reported. Mr. Lewis told the BBC that the police had notified Milly Dowler's parents that ''News of the World, or Glenn Mulcaire, was hacking into Milly Dowler's phone while she was a missing person.'' ''You have to ask the question: who was at the News of the World thinking it was appropriate to try and hack into the phone of a missing young girl, and what was Glenn Mulcaire thinking of at the time to take those instructions?'' he said. ''Both of them should have had common decency, moral right, to turn around and say, no, they weren't prepared to do that.'' In a statement, News of the World said it was cooperating with the police and added, ''This particular case is clearly a development of great concern.''  "
"Murdered Girl, Hacked Phone, Eyes on Tabloid","LONDON -- Political pressure is bearing down on Rebekah Brooks, a top executive of the News Corporation in Britain, following allegations that one of the company's newspapers hacked the cellphone of a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in 2002, when Ms. Brooks was its editor. Prominent politicians chastised the company and Ms. Brooks, and Ford Motor Company suspended advertising in The News of the World, the tabloid that has faced a long-running scandal over the widespread interception of voice mail messages of celebrities and other public figures. Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said Tuesday that Ms. Brooks should ''consider her conscience and consider her position'' after the disclosures.  ''It wasn't a rogue reporter,'' Mr. Miliband said. ''It wasn't just one individual. This was a systematic series of things that happened, and what I want from executives at News International is people to start taking responsibility for this.'' News International is the News Corporation's British newspaper division, and Ms. Brooks is now its chief executive. Prime Minister David Cameron took time out from a visit to British troops in Afghanistan to lament what he called a ''truly dreadful situation.'' The police, he added, ''should investigate this without any fear, without any favor, without any worry about where the evidence should lead them.'' Adding to the pressure, Ford Motor Company said it was suspending advertising until the newspaper concluded its investigation into the episode. ''We are awaiting an outcome from The News of the World investigation and expect a speedy and decisive response,'' Ford said in a statement released to news agencies. Under an onslaught of Twitter messages demanding a boycott of the paper, several other companies said they were reviewing their advertising policies. Late Tuesday, The Guardian reported that the police would review every highly publicized murder, kidnapping or assault involving a child since 2001 for evidence of phone hacking. That would include the notorious case of Madeleine McCann, the 3-year-old who disappeared while her family was on vacation in Portugal in 2007. In another development, Channel 4 reported on Tuesday that Ms. Brooks met with the police in 2002 over accusations that the tabloid had placed a senior Metropolitan police detective under surveillance. The detective was investigating the murder of a private investigator who had been found dead with an ax buried in the back of his head. The chief suspect at the time was the dead man's business partner, a private investigator who earned a six-figure salary supplying The News of the World with confidential information. Nothing apparently came of the inquiry into The News of the World's surveillance. Scotland Yard detectives were also investigating whether the phones of some families of victims of the bombings of three London subway trains and a double-decker bus in July 2005 had also been hacked, The Telegraph reported. In his remarks, Mr. Cameron did not mention Ms. Brooks, but his comments were notable because, like other British politicians, he has cultivated social connections with News Corporation executives like Ms. Brooks and Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of the company. Mr. Cameron, along with Gordon Brown, the Labour prime minister at the time, was a guest at the reception following Ms. Brooks's marriage to her second husband, Charlie Brooks, in 2009. Ms. Brooks vowed to ''pursue the facts with vigor and integrity,'' saying she had no intention of quitting. ''I am aware of the speculation about my position,'' she said in a memo to News International employees. ''Therefore it is important you all know that as chief executive, I am determined to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues.'' The allegations center on one of the most sensational Fleet Street stories of the last decade, the disappearance of Milly Dowler in 2002. The case was the subject of many tabloid front pages over the last decade, culminating last month in the conviction of Levi Bellfield, a former nightclub doorman, on charges of kidnapping and murder. The allegation that investigators working for The News of the World may have had ordinary people like the Dowlers, not just celebrities, in their sights has raised the level of alarm in Britain over tabloid newspaper excesses. ''The Milly Dowler story has taken this from an issue for people who are concerned about media ethics to one that is of broader concern to the general public,'' said Tim Luckhurst, a journalism professor at the University of Kent. ''News Corporation thought they could put a lid on this, and this has blown the lid right off.'' According to Mark Lewis, a lawyer for the Dowler family, The News of the World not only intercepted messages left on Milly Dowler's phone by her increasingly frantic family, but also deleted some of those messages when her voice mailbox became full -- thus making room for new ones and listening to those in turn. This confused investigators and gave false hope to Milly's relatives, who believed it showed she was still alive and deleting the messages herself, Mr. Lewis said. In a statement, Mr. Lewis called the newspaper's actions ''heinous'' and ''despicable,'' and said the Dowler family had suffered ''distress heaped upon tragedy'' upon learning that The News of the World ''had no humanity at such a terrible time.'' Public revulsion over the affair has been so intense that a private investigator at the center of the phone hacking, Glenn Mulcaire, felt compelled to provide a statement to The Guardian on Tuesday evening, his first public comment in the five years since the scandal broke. In it he apologized ''to anybody who was hurt or upset,'' and said he was speaking out because of the ''vilification'' he and his family had been subjected to in the past 24 hours. Mr. Mulcaire, who worked for The News of the World and served prison time for his role in hacking the phones of members of the royal family, blamed ''relentless pressure'' at the paper for his mistakes, saying ''there was a constant demand for results.'' He added: ''I knew what we did pushed the limits ethically. But, at the time, I didn't understand that I had broken the law at all. A lot of information I obtained was simply tittle-tattle, of no great importance to anyone, but sometimes what I did was for what I thought was the greater good, to carry out investigative journalism.'' If Mr. Lewis's accusations about hacking during the Dowler case prove accurate, it would mean either that Ms. Brooks had no idea how the paper she edited was obtaining information about the Dowler family for its articles, or that she knew about the hacking and allowed it. Ms. Brooks, in her memo, did not deny the allegations, but said she had had no knowledge of phone hacking on her watch. ''I hope that you all realize it is inconceivable that I knew or worse, sanctioned these appalling allegations,'' she said. The scandal has already claimed the job of one former high-ranking News Corporation official, Andy Coulson, who was Ms. Brooks's deputy at The News of the World in 2002 and who later moved into the top editor's role. The allegations in the Dowler case appeared as the British government weighs an important business matter affecting News Corporation: its proposed acquisition of British Sky Broadcasting, a pay-TV company in which it is already the largest shareholder. Government officials have indicated that they intend to approve the plan, and say the Dowler case allegations should have no bearing on the matter. ''It really doesn't have anything to do with the hacking inquiry,'' Vince Cable, the business secretary, said on BBC television. There has long been speculation that other British papers may have engaged in similar tactics. So widespread was the practice that even Ms. Brooks, in a surprising twist, is apparently among the victims of phone hacking. News International said last month that Ms. Brooks had been informed by the police that her voice mail messages had been intercepted by Mr. Mulcaire. The hacking apparently took place around 2005, when Ms. Brooks was editor of another News Corporation tabloid, The Sun, and when there was considerable interest in her personal life. In November 2005, she was detained by the police in a domestic dispute with a British actor named Ross Kemp, her husband at the time. Ms. Brooks, then known under her maiden name, Rebekah Wade, was not charged, and the two later divorced.  "
The Greater Evil,"Outrage is a word badly weakened by overuse. This is unfortunate because it would be good to have now, at full strength, for the despicable things the British tabloid News of the World is accused of doing to a murdered 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, and to her family and friends.  Milly's disappearance in 2002 was a sensation in Britain. News of the World, a sex-and-celebrity pillar of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, dove in -- though it shoved its snout far deeper into the muck than anyone knew. A lawyer for Milly's family, Mark Lewis, said that after she vanished but before her body was found, News of the World hacked into her cellphone, recording anguished voice messages from relatives and friends desperate to hear from her. When the phone's memory was full, the paper's operatives deleted some messages to make room for new ones. This baffled the police and made Milly's family think she was alive, deleting the messages herself. News of the World faced prosecutions and lawsuits for hacking phones of movie stars and British royals. That was slimy. The news that it violated the privacy of a family during a criminal inquiry sends it off a moral precipice. Rebekah Brooks, News of the World's editor then and now a top executive in the News Corporation, its owner, played dumb. ''I hope that you all realize it is inconceivable that I knew,'' she said. Glenn Mulcaire, the investigator accused of the hacking, apologized vaguely: ''A lot of information I obtained was simply tittle-tattle, of no great importance to anyone, but sometimes what I did was for what I thought was the greater good, to carry out investigative journalism.'' He asked the news media ''to leave my family and my children, who are all blameless, alone.'' Blameless children. The greater good. Mr. Mulcaire found the right words, almost a decade late.  "
Murdoch Facing Parliament's Ire In Hacking Case,"CORRECTION APPENDED LONDON -- Britain's Parliament on Wednesday collectively turned on Rupert Murdoch, the head of the News Corporation, and the tabloid culture he represents, using a debate about a widening phone hacking scandal to denounce reporting tactics by newspapers once seen as too politically influential to challenge. But though he joined in the chorus of outrage, Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative Party benefits from Mr. Murdoch's support, stopped short of calling for an immediate investigation into behavior by the Murdoch-owned News of the World and other tabloids. Such an inquiry would have to wait, he said, until the police had concluded their own criminal investigation. From all sides of the House of Commons the disgust came thick and fast, as the legislators recited the most recent allegations against The News of the World: that its executives had paid police officers, lied to Parliament and hired investigators to intercept voice mail messages left on the cellphones of murdered children and terrorism victims. Legislators also attacked the news media in general for employing many of the same tactics.  The scandal posed new hurdles for Mr. Murdoch's proposed $12 billion takeover of the pay-television company British Sky Broadcasting, as many legislators criticized the deal, and Britain's media regulatory agency, Ofcom, said it was ''closely monitoring the situation.'' ''We have let one man have far too great a sway over our national life,'' said Chris Bryant, a Labour member of Parliament. In addition to The News of the World, Mr. Murdoch's media holdings include The Times of London; The Sun; and a large stake in BSkyB, as it is called, as well as several other international newspapers and television networks. Meanwhile, John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons culture and media committee, rehearsed in tones of high indignation how executives from The News of the World and its parent company, News International, had thwarted legislators' efforts to get to the bottom of the phone hacking affair by stonewalling, refusing to testify and even lying outright during parliamentary hearings. Zac Goldsmith, another Conservative legislator, said that Mr. Murdoch was guilty of ''systemic abuse of almost unprecedented power'' and had run roughshod over Parliament. ''There is nothing noble in what these newspapers have been doing,'' he said. ''Rupert Murdoch is clearly a very, very talented businessman -- he's possibly even a genius -- but his organization has grown too powerful and has abused that power. It has systematically corrupted the police and in my view has gelded this Parliament, to our shame.'' A number of legislators, including Nicholas Soames, a Conservative, said Wednesday that in light of the recent developments, the government should intervene to delay or even stop Mr. Murdoch's plan to acquire all the shares of BSkyB. ''I urge the government to look at whether we should pause things given what has come to light,'' said Anna Soubry, a Conservative member of Parliament. Before this week, the deal had passed virtually every government hurdle. But Ofcom, the media regulator, said in a statement that it was watching developments in the case, ''and in particular the investigations by the relevant authorities into the alleged unlawful activities.'' Many legislators also focused their outrage on Rebekah Brooks, a former News of the World editor who is now News International's chief executive and a protege of Mr. Murdoch. She is a close friend of Mr. Cameron's -- the two have country houses near each other and have often socialized -- and has been a strong champion of his premiership. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said flatly that Ms. Brooks should resign. But Ms. Brooks said she would stay put, and on Wednesday her boss, Mr. Murdoch, took the unusual step of issuing a statement on the matter. Calling the recent allegations involving phone hacking and paying off the police ''deplorable and unacceptable,'' Mr. Murdoch pledged that the company would ''fully and proactively cooperate with the police in all investigations.'' He added: ''That is exactly what News International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah Brooks's leadership.'' He said that Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor and current head of the News Corporation's education unit, would ''provide important oversight and guidance'' in the company's response to the investigations. New allegations swirled around Ms. Brooks's old paper, The News of the World, including reports that it might have hacked into the voice mail messages of murdered children and victims of the 2005 London subway bombings. On Tuesday, The Guardian reported that the phone of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl murdered in 2002, was hacked by The News of the World after she disappeared but before her body was found, hampering the police investigation and adding to the distress of her parents. On Wednesday, the father of a man who was killed in the 2005 terrorist attacks on the London subways said that he had been contacted by the police as a possible hacking victim. The man, Graham Foulkes, said he had been informed that numerous personal details, including his phone number, had been found in notes seized from Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who was jailed in 2007 for hacking into the phones of aides to the royal family on behalf of The News of the World. It was not clear whether his own phone was actually hacked after the 2005 attacks, Mr. Foulkes told the BBC, but the idea filled him with revulsion. After the explosions, he said, it was some time before he knew that his son, David, had indeed been killed. ''We were in a very dark place, and we were using the phone frantically trying to get information about David and where he may have been,'' he told the BBC. ''We were talking a lot to family and friends and talking very personally, about very intimate issues. The thought that these guys may have been listening is just horrendous. It fills me with horror.'' In a separate development, news reports this week indicated that Andy Coulson, editor of The News of the World in the mid-2000s, appeared to have authorized illegal payments to police officers during his time at the paper. News International has confirmed that the information is contained in e-mails it has disclosed to the police. A person with knowledge of the matter said that it appeared that other senior News of the World journalists were also involved, but that Ms. Brooks was not among them. The disclosure is relevant because of Mr. Coulson's close ties to the Conservative Party. After resigning from The News of the World in 2007 after an earlier phone hacking investigation, Mr. Coulson was quickly hired by Mr. Cameron as the Conservative Party's chief spokesman. The move gave Mr. Cameron an in with Britain's tabloids, and cemented his ties to Mr. Murdoch's empire. Mr. Coulson's canny approach helped Mr. Cameron get elected last year, and he was installed as the government's chief spokesman. But in January he resigned from that job, too, when it became clear that phone hacking had been routine when he was The News of the World's editor. Mr. Coulson has always denied knowing about hacking; these new disclosures are the first to link him directly to any wrongdoing. In Parliament, Mr. Miliband, the Labour leader, assailed Mr. Cameron for a ''catastrophic error of judgment by bringing Andy Coulson into the heart of his Downing Street machine.'' It is unclear how the recent developments will affect The News of the World financially, but numerous advertisers, including Ford, the Halifax bank, Vauxhall, Mitsubishi and Virgin Holidays, have announced plans to suspend advertising in the paper. Thousands of people took to Facebook and Twitter not only to express their outrage over the hacking allegations but also to put pressure on companies to withdraw their advertising dollars from The News of the World. In a statement, the Cooperative Group, a food retailer and financial services provider, said that it, too, had decided to suspend its advertising. The company said that it ''adheres to strong ethical standards,'' and that the allegations had been ''met with revulsion by the vast majority'' of people who have contacted it.

A Variety of Methods Can Be Used to Tap Into Phones,"LONDON -- The term ''phone hacking'' dominating headlines around the world refers broadly to a variety of methods journalists at The News of the World and other British newspapers could have used to listen to thousands of voice mail messages until the scandal came to light.  A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, the force investigating the matter, said it was defining the practice as ''the illegal interception of messages relayed by telecommunications that were not intended for the person who has intercepted them,'' without providing specifics. In practice, as court documents and interviews with those involved have demonstrated, the hacking involved a number of techniques. They took advantage of default codes -- like 1111 or 4444 -- that cellphone providers in Britain gave users to retrieve their voice mail. Many customers did not change this standard number to a more secure code, allowing hackers to use it in one of two ways. In the first way, according to current and former tabloid journalists interviewed for an investigation by The New York Times Magazine into the practice, one reporter would call the intended victim's phone, engaging the line. A second reporter would call simultaneously, and would be directed to the voice mail system. There, the default codes could be entered, potentially allowing access to messages (which were then often deleted to prevent other rival newspapers from hearing them). The second method was detailed on a recording obtained by The New York Times as part of the same investigation. In the recording, Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective jailed for six months in 2007 for phone hacking, described a method of calling into a voice mail system by dialing an external number provided for checking messages from other telephones, like land lines. It, too, required the default code to be entered. If any of the intended victims had changed their codes, the hackers would resort to what they called ''blagging'' -- calling cellphone companies, pretending to be authorized users or company insiders, and requesting that the access code be reset to the default. Britain's major cellphone companies -- Orange, Vodafone, O2, Three and T-Mobile -- said in interviews on Wednesday that their voice mail access procedures had become more stringent since the early 2000s, the heyday for phone hacking. Orange, Three and T-Mobile no longer provide default voice mail pass codes; users must set their own. O2 and Vodafone will allow codes to be set only from the cellphones they supply. If that number is reset, the new code is also sent directly to the phone. Vodafone alerts customers if three failed attempts are made to enter the number, and O2 locks voice mail services.  "
"A Murdoch Loyalist Hangs On, Raising Questions About a Corporate Strategy","LEICESTER, England -- Despite the scandal burning around News International, its top executive, Rebekah Brooks, rebuffed numerous calls for her to resign on Friday, raising questions about the strategy of its parent company, the News Corporation, in defending itself against a barrage of police inquiries and lawsuits stemming from phone hacking at one of its British tabloid newspapers. After Prime Minister David Cameron -- a close personal friend of Ms. Brooks -- said that if he were her boss he would have accepted her resignation as chief executive because of the conduct of journalists under her watch, her position looked increasingly untenable. But Ms. Brooks subsequently told her employees that she would not resign, suggesting that she retained the backing of Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation's chairman.  Legal experts and other analysts familiar with the company expressed surprise that Ms. Brooks had not been suspended or removed earlier, given that she was the top editor at The News of the World when some of the hacking took place. The fact that she has stayed, they said, suggested that Mr. Murdoch's backing may go beyond loyalty, possibly amounting to a calculation that dismissing Ms. Brooks could end up exposing other, higher-ranking executives to scrutiny about decisions they made related to the hacking scandal. ''If she goes, the next question is who else knew?'' said a former counsel at another prominent newspaper who requested to remain anonymous because he is not privy to the News Corporation's deliberations. ''You want her on the inside and not on the outside.'' Ms. Brooks has repeatedly denied knowing anything about phone hacking during her editorship of The News of the World early last decade when, police investigations have revealed, employees of the newspaper were blatantly hacking the private voice mail messages of numerous people to gather material for sensational news stories. Her position looked more vulnerable on Friday after the British police arrested Andy Coulson, her former deputy and the man who succeeded her as editor of The News of the World. It is unclear how retaining Ms. Brooks will affect the regulatory decision-making on News International's most important business goal in Britain, its attempt to take full control of British Sky Broadcasting. Some analysts said it could further complicate the bid because regulators are likely to consider the track record of News International's top executives when considering whether the company passes a so-called fit-person test to assume full ownership of a major broadcaster. But if there are risks in retaining Ms. Brooks, there may be risks in removing her from her post as well, analysts said. She has been a close confidante of both Rupert Murdoch and his son James, people who have worked with the Murdochs said. If the company acknowledges, directly or implicitly, that she was responsible for the wrongdoing at The News of the World, it could be difficult to maintain that she alone made poor choices in the matter. ''If it was not resignation by agreement on both sides, Rebekah Brooks would have some very interesting insights about the Murdochs,'' said Adam Price, a former member of Parliament who played a central role in the parliamentary investigation into phone hacking. ''She is the barrier. If you take her away, who is left?'' Ms. Brooks has worked side by side with James Murdoch, who is now in charge of the News Corporation's European operations. He came to Britain after the period when the phone hacking took place. But he approved out-of-court settlements to hacking victims, including Gordon Taylor, a former professional soccer player. For a time, James Murdoch had a more direct role in managing the fallout of The News of the World's problems than Ms. Brooks had. When he approved the Taylor payment, she had moved to run another News International newspaper, The Sun. ''James Murdoch is in a very vulnerable position for having signed on the Gordon Taylor deal,'' said Brian Cathcart, professor of journalism at Kingston University who has been a prominent advocate for a public inquiry. Another executive who could face greater scrutiny if Ms. Brooks were to leave is Les Hinton, who currently runs Dow Jones for the News Corporation in the United States. A powerful player in the Murdoch empire, Mr. Hinton held Ms. Brooks's current post during the period when journalists at The News of the World were hacking voice mail messages. He told before a parliamentary committee that he knew of no hacking at the newspaper beyond what was done by a single reporter and an investigator, both of whom where jailed in 2007. Legal experts said that whatever the company's internal rationale for retaining Ms. Brooks, she and other top executives would be unlikely to escape heavy scrutiny in the coming months. ''The prime minister has agreed to the public inquiry, and this will have the power to subpoena any person, including Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks,'' said Geoffrey Robertson, an expert on media law.  "
Pressure Mounts on British Premier as Ex-Aide Is Held in Tabloid Inquiry," LONDON -- The phone hacking scandal that has enmeshed the Murdoch media empire, British politicians and the police accelerated Friday with the arrest of a former aide to Prime Minister David Cameron and new accusations of obstruction of justice against executives of News International, the parent of the disgraced News of the World newspaper. For Mr. Cameron, the day's events took an ominous turn that suggested he may be embroiled in the scandal for months, or even years, as he struggles on a broader front to make historic cuts in public spending, his government's primary goal. He announced plans for two public inquiries, one to be led by a judge that will investigate the phone hacking and what the prime minister called the ''abysmal failure'' of the police to effectively investigate it over the past five years, and another into the ''culture, practices and ethics'' of British newspapers.  But as he did so, his former media chief at 10 Downing Street, Andy Coulson, previously the editor of The News of the World, the Murdoch paper at the heart of the scandal, was arrested for police questioning on suspicion of conspiracy in the phone hacking and of corruption in approving payments of tens of thousands of dollars that the paper is alleged to have made to a small group of midlevel police officers who traded in confidential information. The day brought further bad news for the Murdoch empire, with the head of the government agency that regulates broadcast media, Ofcom, writing to John Whittingdale, chairman of the parliamentary committee that monitors broadcast issues, to say that the agency intended to conduct a rigorous review of Rupert Murdoch's proposed $12 billion bid for outright ownership of British Sky Broadcasting, Britain's most lucrative cable network. The deal requires the agency's approval, including whether the company's executives are judged ''fit and proper,'' ethically as well as financially, to own one of the country's most powerful media companies. Reflecting criticism that the Cameron government, and Ofcom, have taken too accommodating a view of the Murdoch bid, the agency signaled that it might be prepared, after reviewing the phone hacking scandal, to veto the bid. The letter cited the ''fit and proper'' rule and said that Ofcom was ''very conscious of the level of concern'' in the country about the News of the World misdeeds. The 43-year-old prime minister, in office just a year, appeared to time his remarks at a morning news conference on Friday in an effort to steal the headlines from the arrest of Mr. Coulson and a former News of the World reporter, Clive Goodman, who has already served a jail term for his role in the paper's hacking of the royal family's cellphones. But he struggled to overcome a series of shocking disclosures, including a report in The Guardian that police were investigating reports that an executive with News International, the British arm of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, had tried to delete millions of e-mails from a News of the World archive ''in an attempt to obstruct Scotland Yard's inquiry into the affair.'' The report was strongly denied by a Murdoch spokesman. Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International, hinted at still more damaging disclosures to come when she told reporters and editors at The News of the World's headquarters on Friday that the criminal investigation would lead to ''a very dark day for this company'' and help explain why Murdoch executives decided Thursday to shut the paper down after 168 years. Ms. Brooks, editor of the paper when its employees hacked the cellphone of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old who was abducted and murdered -- something she has said she knew nothing about -- again rejected demands that she resign, a step that Mr. Cameron, reticent on the matter until Friday, had urged at his new conference. Ms. Brooks, a friend of Mr. Cameron's, enraged many of those attending The News of the World meeting, according to some of those who attended, by appearing to equate her plight -- still employed, but an object of withering public censure -- with those of the paper's 600 employees who will lose their jobs after it publishes its last issue on Sunday. ''This is not exactly the best of times in my life,'' she said. ''I feel exactly the same as you.'' Ms. Brooks's discomfort paralleled that of Mr. Cameron. For the second time in three days, after a raucous melee in the House of Commons on Wednesday, he sought to cast himself at his news conference as the man to rescue Britain from a scandal that he described as ''simply disgusting'' -- allegations that The News of the World, Britain's most widely read Sunday paper, hacked into the voice mail messages not just of Milly Dowler, but of relatives who lost family members in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and others who lost loved ones in the July 2005 terrorist bombings on London's transit system. Facing the biggest crisis to hit a British leader since Tony Blair defied public opinion and carried Britain into the Iraq war, Mr. Cameron answered critics -- in his own Conservative Party, as well as the Labour opposition -- who have questioned his judgment, and even his honesty, in hiring Mr. Coulson to work on his personal staff only months after the former media chief had been forced to resign in the first round of scandal over phone hacking at The News of the World, in 2007. His principal defense was that he acted in the belief that the former editor deserved ''a second chance'' after his demise at the tabloid, when he told police that he had no knowledge of the tabloid's phone hacking. To that, the prime minister added the argument that The News of the World scandal was the product of a wider malaise in the relations between Britain's newspapers, police and politicians, which he said had ill served the public for years by creating a ''cozy'' compact in which all of those involved collaborated to serve their personal interests while tolerating a pattern of press abuses. ''As we're considering the devastating revelations of the past few days, it is no good just pointing the finger at this individual journalist, or that individual newspaper,'' he said. ''It's no good, actually, just criticizing the police. The truth is, we've all been in this together -- the press, politicians and leaders of all parties -- and yes, that includes me.'' Party leaders, Mr. Cameron said, had been ''so keen to win the support of newspapers, we turned a blind eye to this sort of issue, to get on top of the bad practices, to change the way our newspapers are regulated.'' He added: ''The people in power knew things weren't right. But they didn't do enough, quickly enough, until the full mess of the situation was revealed.'' ''It's on my watch that the music has stopped,'' he said. But the one specific reform that Mr. Cameron said he favored -- the scrapping of the newspaper industry's self-regulatory body, the largely toothless Press Complaints Commission, and its replacement by a much tougher, independent body with statutory powers to punish abuses -- won him no respite from his harshest critics, including the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, a 41-year-old in his first year at the party's helm. After a lackluster start as Labour chief that prompted murmurings in his party about dumping him, Mr. Miliband has ridden the scandal to a new level of approbation among many of Britain's most influential political commentators. He has staked out ground -- demands for a judge-led public inquiry into the scandal and the resignation of Ms. Brooks, as well as an excoriating rebuke of Mr. Cameron for taking Mr. Coulson ''into the heart of Downing Street'' -- that has left Mr. Cameron scrambling to catch up. On Friday, he dismissed Mr. Cameron's latest moves. ''We have a prime minister today who still doesn't seem to get it,'' he said. ''He couldn't even bring himself to admit that he made a mistake in hiring Andy Coulson.'' When Mr. Coulson left the Lewisham police station in London at dusk, pushing his way through reporters shouting questions like ''Are you the fall guy?'' he offered no comment on his day's questioning, beyond a remark that suggested that he may be nursing revelations about Ms. Brooks and the circle of News of the World executives who knew about the phone hacking, about other secrets of the Murdoch empire, or about his years as an intimate of Mr. Cameron's. ''There's an awful lot that I'd like to say, but I can't,'' he said.

"From the Gutter, Into the Sewer","London INTELLECTUALS in Britain have always regarded Rupert Murdoch with suspicion. His rise to prominence on the media scene in the 1980s coincided with a brutal yearlong lockout of newspaper workers, aimed at breaking the traditional hold of their labor unions. In the dominant position he subsequently gained, with four major newspapers and a large stake in television, he began to exercise significant influence over the political scene, and even greater influence on the down-market end of the press. One anomalous feature of British journalism is its long history of scurrilous, muckraking weekly scandal-sheets, the tabloids or ''gutter press,'' which since the Victorian era have delighted blue-collar readers with stories of murders and sexual misconduct.  Mr. Murdoch's achievement was to take the tabloid press from the gutter into the sewer, widening its range from coverage of celebrity scandals to the performance of criminal acts. Some of the latter, such as hacking into the phones of crime victims and their families, were appalling. There is no redeeming feature in the scandal that has engulfed Mr. Murdoch's British fief, News International, other than that it has now killed his biggest-selling newspaper, The News of the World. This tabloid made its money by regularly crossing the line of decency; the revelation that it also regularly crossed the line of legality surprises no one, for no one expected any better. What has horrified the British public is the nature of the illegalities. Murdoch journalists not only hacked into the phones of child murder victims and their parents, but of the families of victims of terrorist attacks and of soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. And in search of sexual and political scandal they hacked into the phones of thousands of others; the London police say they have a list of 4,000 people who might have suffered their attentions. Discovery of these serious crimes has brought forward a crisis that was already culminating. News International's bid to take control of the television company British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, was, in the opinion of many, a step too far, given that, even before the hacking revelations, its influence on politics and public conversation had become deeply corrosive. The Murdoch media have influenced every election in Britain since the Thatcher era. Both major political parties have courted Mr. Murdoch in hope of his support, and when he gave it, they flourished at the polls. In return, he was allowed to take control of increasing stretches of the media landscape, meanwhile dissuading government from regulation that would hamper his operations. He already owns 39 percent of BSkyB; his reason for wishing to own it all is, as he has publicly indicated, to make it more like its American counterpart, Fox News. Mr. Murdoch's influence over successive governments has long been a concern. His hostile attitude toward the European Union and his ingratiating attitude toward China, to name but two examples, have influenced politicians eager to please him. That the former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, was, until the hacking scandal broke, Prime Minister David Cameron's trusted director of communications, is only the latest instance of this unseemly influence. Mr. Coulson is now under arrest for being part of the hacking crimes. Significantly, when the scandal emerged in 2005 under the Labor government, the police did little to pursue it; only now, under public pressure, have they begun to alert hacking victims to what happened back then. Tabloid practices have always had a corrupting effect on the public conversation, but they reached new depths under the editorship of The News of the World by Mr. Murdoch's much-favored deputy, Rebekah Brooks. The cynicism of tabloid technique is well understood: Splash a rumor as news on the front page, then print a one-line retraction on an inside page two weeks later. By then, the victim has been thoroughly damaged, with other papers, and the graffiti wall of blogs and Twitter, transmitting the allegations globally. Realists accept that scandal and gossip sell, that conflict is entertainment, and that an adversarial stance attracts spectators. But the Murdoch tabloids have championed this approach beyond the breaking point. The soiling of the public debate, and the distorting influence of one foreigner on the political landscape, were barely supportable before the hacking revelations; they are now insupportable. No doubt over-optimistically, many in Britain hope that the current scandal will at last persuade their government and fellow citizens alike to end Mr. Murdoch's freedom to poison the well from which they drink. At the very least, they hope that culpable heads will roll. No one believes that senior managers at News International were ignorant of their employees' crimes. Ms. Brooks claims that she was. If that is true, she failed dramatically in her role as manager; if that is false, she and others are liable for criminal prosecution. If there proves to be a silver lining to this debacle, it would be the defeat of Mr. Murdoch's effort to take control of BSkyB, and a diminution of his influence in British affairs. Alas, the anxiety is that the transgressions of News International will prompt a bout of media regulation that will impinge on press freedoms in the wrong way, making it harder to expose the wrongdoings of companies like News International rather than protecting us from them. If this happens, Mr. Murdoch's degrading influence will have reached well beyond the damage it has already done.  "
Redefining the Rules for the Press in Europe,"PARIS -- A widening phone-hacking scandal is prompting a broad reassessment of the balance between press freedom and privacy in Britain, even as France grapples with the consequences of its tradition of protecting the powerful. If Dominique Strauss-Kahn walks free now that the sexual assault case against him in New York seems to be weakening, will the French public have a right, or, indeed, an appetite to know more than what emerged in American courts? And if less-exalted people in Britain feel that their secrets should be protected too, how should they shield themselves from unscrupulous journalists hacking into their most intimate voice mails? The questions underscore the contrasts between cultures that, in the past, have made Britain a temple to strident disclosure and France a whispered haven of discretion. In both countries, the debate has reached what might, at first, seem like a tipping point. In London, a tabloid newspaper, The News of the World, was accused of eavesdropping on the cellphones of a kidnapped and murdered schoolgirl, the relatives of people who died in the 2005 London transit bombings and possibly the families of British war dead in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Such was the public revulsion that an embattled prime minister, David Cameron, was forced on Friday to order two separate inquiries -- one into the phone-hacking scandal itself and the other into the behavior of the freewheeling British press. In a news conference, Mr. Cameron insisted that the British press tradition of self-regulation had failed. ''I believe we need a new system entirely,'' he said, prompting an outcry on Saturday from British journalists who have long resisted statutory restrictions on their freedoms, arguing that the press is able to police its own affairs. ''As a politician, Mr. Cameron can perhaps be forgiven for trying to shift the blame,'' said a columnist, Stephen Glover, in the conservative newspaper The Daily Mail. ''He can't be allowed to shackle a free press.'' Yet, the broad rules remain freighted with ambiguity, governed by two apparently conflicting clauses of the European Convention on Human Rights: one endorses the right to privacy, another the right to free expression. In recent months, that legal chasm has been filled by judges' rulings in favor of high-profile clients seeking to keep their private lives under wraps. But Mr. Cameron has voiced unease. ''It is an odd situation if the judges are making the law rather than Parliament,'' he said this year. On Friday, Mr. Cameron went much further, calling not only for a new form of press regulation, but also for an end to the cozy relationships between news organizations that are seen as wielding huge influence and politicians who are desperate to harness the support of the press for electoral advantage. ''Of course it is vital that our press is free,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''That is an essential component of our democracy and our way of life. But press freedom does not mean that the press should be above the law. ''While it's vital that a free press can tell truth to power, it is equally important that those in power can tell truth to the press.'' France -- like much of Continental Europe -- has long chosen a different, less swashbuckling attitude toward matters of privacy, offering the powerful a degree of protection that would be unthinkable in Britain or the United States. French politicians have been able to hide behind some of Europe's tightest privacy laws, protected by what amounted to a code of silence about the transgressions of the mighty. Sexual activity among male politicians, indeed, is still seen as a sign of vigor rather than a cause for moral concern. The sexual reputation of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, for instance, was known to many journalists but rarely publicized. The extent of that knowledge emerged only when he was arrested in New York in May and charged with trying to rape a hotel housekeeper at the Sofitel in Manhattan. Then, just last week in France, a novelist, Tristane Banon, 32, filed a criminal complaint in which she claimed that Mr. Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her eight years ago -- an accusation that Mr. Strauss-Kahn has dismissed as ''imaginary.'' In France and Britain, the past days and weeks have shown both models of reporting to be strained to the point of failure, leaving journalists in both countries to define the role they ought to play. The epiphany, said Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian in London, which has taken a lead in exposing the phone-hacking scandal, represents ''the most severe crisis in the past two or three generations.'' And, as the author Christophe Deloire put it in Paris, ''If tomorrow the French people, readers or voters, accuse us again of having kept a secret among ourselves, of accepting different standards for the powerful than for the humble, what will we tell them?'' ''It should be our ambition to say nothing but the truth -- but the whole truth,'' he concluded. In a way, the malaise in both countries represents the logical conclusion to longstanding and contrasting definitions of tolerance. Only when The News of the World stood accused in Britain of hacking the phones of ordinary people in their moments of pain did public rage ignite. In France, the spectacle of a single powerful man brought low provoked an equally passionate debate. But as prosecutors revealed doubts about the credibility of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's accuser in New York, many of his allies in the Parisian elite -- particularly men -- began to talk of a political comeback. Before the episode at the Sofitel, Mr. Strauss-Kahn was widely viewed as the most likely Socialist Party challenger in France's presidential election next year. So the question arises: Is France still so magnanimous toward the sexual adventures of the powerful that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, would be permitted to re-enter public life without an accounting of events that his lawyers say did not involve force or criminal behavior? Some journalists say the affair will -- or at least should -- break the mold of silence. ''More than ever, the rule of journalism should be to speak out,'' wrote the blogger Jean Quatremer, ''and the exception should be to remain silent.'' But there is some skepticism about whether the culture will change in France to the extent that Mr. Cameron is seeking in Britain. ''Journalists will pay a bit more attention to private lives'' of powerful figures, said Lucas Delattre, an author and a former Le Monde correspondent, ''but not much.'' In Britain, journalists might well conclude that those who claim a right to call the elite to account could soon face much the same scrutiny themselves.  "
Murdoch Tabloids' Targets Included Downing Street and the Crown,"LONDON -- The scandal that has enveloped Rupert Murdoch's media empire in Britain widened substantially on Monday with reports that two of his newspapers may have bribed police officers or used other potentially illegal methods to obtain information about Queen Elizabeth II and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Others on the police payroll have been bribed to use restricted cellphone-tracking technology to pinpoint the location of people sought by the papers in their restless pursuit of scoops, according to two former journalists for the tabloid shut on Sunday, The News of the World. As Mr. Murdoch assumed command of damage-control efforts at his London headquarters, the day brought a torrent of new revelations, including reports that newsroom malpractice extended to two other newspapers in his British stable -- The Sunday Times, an up-market broadsheet, and The Sun, the country's highest-selling daily tabloid.  Phone-hacking and other illegal or unethical methods have been common at many British newspapers that are not Murdoch-owned. But the focus for now is on News International and its parent company in the United States, the News Corporation, which confronted what many have called an existential threat to the Murdoch empire on Monday by revising its $12 billion takeover bid for Britain's most lucrative satellite television company, British Sky Broadcasting, in ways that appeared to delay it for at least six months. Many commentators in Britain said Mr. Murdoch appeared to be playing for time, in the hope that public and political anger over the current scandal will abate, making room for politicians and regulators to judge the takeover on its business merits, and not on the basis of retribution for the hacking scandal. The revelations about the intrusive activities directed at the queen and Mr. Brown have seized the headlines, driving home the realization that nobody, not even the most powerful and protected people in the land, has been beyond the reach of news organizations caught up in a relentless battle for lurid headlines and mass circulations. A wide segment of British society, from celebrities to ordinary families wrestling with personal tragedies, has been shown to be potentially vulnerable to the newspapers' use of cellphone-hacking, identity theft, tracking technology and police bribery -- perhaps even clandestine property break-ins, if some reports circulating in recent days are true. The BBC and The Guardian, in their Monday reports, cited internal e-mails from a News of the World archive in which requests were made for about $1,600 to pay a royal protection officer -- one of several hundred Scotland Yard officers eligible to serve in the palace security detail -- for classified information about the queen, Prince Charles and other senior members of the royal family in what a Scotland Yard official described as a major security breach. The Guardian article said two officers on the royal detail were involved and that the e-mails from an archive assembled by The News of the World were exchanged by a senior executive and a reporter, neither of whom it identified. The accounts said the money was used to obtain a copy of a contact book used by the royal protection service -- a volume known as the Green Book, according to the BBC -- that contained information about the queen, Prince Charles, other senior royals and their friends and contacts. A report in The Evening Standard newspaper said the information included ''phone numbers, and tips about the movements and activities'' of the queen and her husband, Prince Philip. A Guardian report said the police had informed the palace that the cellphones of Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, may have also been hacked. Prime Minister David Cameron said he was outraged, describing the alleged police involvement in the palace intrusion as ''a dereliction of duty'' and adding, ''We need to get to the bottom of that if it is true.'' Mr. Brown said on his Web site that he was also a target. A person close to Mr. Brown said in an interview that the former prime minister believed that people working for News International, Mr. Murdoch's British subsidiary, tried to hack into his personal voice mail and obtained other personal information, including financial accounts, tax records and the medical details of his son Fraser, now 5, who suffers from cystic fibrosis. The person close to Mr. Brown said that Mr. Brown asked Scotland Yard last year whether his personal details were among the 11,000 pages of notes seized from Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator working for The News of the World who was jailed in 2007 for hacking the phones of the royal household. Scotland Yard confirmed that, the source said. The Guardian reported that Mr. Brown's bank, Abbey National, alerted him that someone acting for The Sunday Times had posed in his name -- a practice commonly referred to as identity theft, or blagging -- to obtain details of his account six times in 2000, when he was chancellor of the Exchequer. The BBC said that the effort was made as part of an inquiry by the paper into allegations that Mr. Brown had bought a property in his native Scotland at below-market value, something Mr. Brown has strongly denied. But the most damaging aspect of the affair involved Mr. Brown's son. The person close to Mr. Brown said he believed that The Sun gained access to his son's medical records for an article about his cystic fibrosis that ran in November 2006, four months after the boy's birth. The BBC, quoting its sources, said the information about the boy's condition had been obtained first by The Sunday Times, and passed to The Sun. It said that Rebekah Brooks, then The Sun's editor and now News International's chief executive, called Mr. Brown and his wife, Sarah, to tell them that the paper knew of the boy's condition, which they had believed was something known only to themselves and medical professionals who were caring for their son. Separately, an inquiry by The New York Times, which included interviews with two former journalists at The News of the World, has revealed the workings of the illicit cellphone-tracking, which the former tabloid staffers said was known in the newsroom as ''pinging.'' Under British law, the technology involved is restricted to law enforcement and security officials, requires case-by-case authorization, and is used mainly for high-profile criminal cases and terrorism investigations, according to a former senior Scotland Yard official who requested anonymity so as to be able to speak candidly. According to Oliver Crofton, a cybersecurity specialist who works to protect high-profile clients from such invasive tactics, cellphones are constantly pinging off relay towers as they search for a network, enabling an individual's location to be located within yards by checking the strength of the signal at three different towers. But the former Scotland Yard official who discussed the matter said that any officer who agreed to use the technique to assist a newspaper would be crossing a red line. ''That would be a massive breach,'' he said. A former show-business reporter for The News of the World, Sean Hoare, who was fired in 2005, said that when he worked there, pinging cost the paper nearly $500 on each occasion. He first found out how the practice worked, he said, when he was scrambling to find someone and was told that one of the news desk editors, Greg Miskiw, could help. Mr. Miskiw asked for the person's cellphone number, and returned later with information showing the person's precise location in Scotland, Mr. Hoare said. Mr. Miskiw, who faces questioning by police on a separate matter, did not return calls for comment. A former Scotland Yard officer said the individual who provided the information could have been one of a small group entitled to authorize pinging requests, or a lower-level officer who duped his superiors into thinking that the request was related to a criminal case. Mr. Hoare said the fact that it was a police officer was clear from his exchange with Mr. Miskiw. ''I thought it was remarkable and asked him how he did it, and he said, 'It's the Old Bill, isn't it?' '' he recalled, noting that the term is common slang in Britain for the police. ''At that point, you don't ask questions,'' he said. A second former editor at the paper backed Mr. Hoare's account. ''I knew it could be done and that it was done,'' he said. Speaking on condition that his name be withheld, he said that another way of tracking people was to hack into their credit card details and determine where the last charge was made. He said this tactic yielded at least one major scoop, when The News of the World tracked down James Hewitt, a former army officer and lover of Princess Diana's, who had fled to Spain amid the media firestorm that followed the publication of his book about the affair.  "
Tabloid Sought Phone Messages Of Investigators,"LONDON -- Shortly after Scotland Yard began its initial criminal inquiry of phone hacking by The News of the World in 2006, five senior police investigators discovered that their own cellphone messages had been targeted by the tabloid and had most likely been listened to. The disclosure, based on interviews with current and former officials, raises the question of whether senior investigators feared that if they aggressively investigated, The News of the World would punish them with splashy articles about their private lives. Some of their secrets, tabloid-ready, eventually emerged in other news outlets. Those damaging allegations, about two of the senior officers' private lives, involved charges that one had padded his expense reports and was involved in extramarital affairs and that the other used frequent flier miles accrued on the job for personal vacations. ''If it is true that police officers knew their phones had been hacked, it is a serious matter that requires immediate investigation,'' said John Whittingdale, the chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which investigated phone hacking. ''It would be shocking.''  The lead police investigator on the phone-hacking case, Andy Hayman, left the Metropolitan Police in December 2007 after questions were raised in the news media about business expenses he had filed and the nature of his relationship with a woman who worked for the Independent Police Complaints Commission. At the time, Channel 4 News reported details of 400 text messages and phone calls that Mr. Hayman had sent to her. John Yates, the assistant commissioner who has become a lightning rod for the police's handling of the phone-hacking case, had reportedly used frequent flier miles earned in the line of duty to pay for flights for his relatives. The outlets that reported these allegations have not been implicated in the hacking. Members of Parliament will question Mr. Hayman, Mr. Yates and several other senior police officials at a hearing on Tuesday of the Home Affairs Select Committee to try to determine why the Metropolitan Police decided to strictly limit the initial phone-hacking inquiry in 2006. One area of inquiry is whether the fact that the officials' phones had been hacked had any impact on the scope of their initial investigation, according to two members of the committee. They are also concerned about whether the investigators had a conflict of interest because they themselves were victims of the people they were investigating. Among the 11,000 pages of documents seized from the home of The News of the World's phone-hacking specialist, Glenn Mulcaire, in August 2007, the investigators also found the names of Sir Ian Blair, then the Metropolitan Police commissioner, and at least two other senior police officials involved in the inquiry, according to several former senior Scotland Yard officials. The officials declined to reveal the names of the other investigators. Sir Ian declined to comment on Monday. In the autumn of 2006, the police notified only a handful of victims that their cellphone messages had been hacked, even though there was evidence that News of the World journalists might have gained access to the messages of nearly 4,000 people. The top police officials learned they had been hacked after an 8-to-10-page list of potential victims was assembled that fall for Mr. Hayman, several former Scotland Yard officials said. In January 2007, Mr. Mulcaire and Clive Goodman, the paper's royalty reporter, pleaded guilty to gaining access to the messages of aides to the royal family and were sentenced to prison. The inquiry was then concluded. For years after that, Scotland Yard officials, including Mr. Yates, insisted that there was no evidence of further hacking, a claim he repeated in 2009. A Scotland Yard spokesman declined to discuss whether any senior officials' phones had been hacked. ''We will not comment on media speculation or give a running commentary on our investigation,'' the spokesman said. In an interview published by The Telegraph on Sunday, Mr. Yates apologized for the initial Scotland Yard inquiry, acknowledging that it was lax and ineffectual. ''I have regrettably said the initial inquiry was a success,'' Mr. Yates said. ''Clearly now that looks very different.'' In Parliament on Monday, two Labour Party lawmakers, Chris Bryant and Tom Watson, accused Mr. Yates of lying and renewed calls for his resignation. At Tuesday's hearing, the Parliament panel is also scheduled to question Sue Akers, who is leading the Metropolitan Police's new phone-hacking inquiry, known as Operation Weeting, which began last January. At the same time, Scotland Yard is also investigating allegations that News of the World reporters had passed more than $:100,000 in bribes (about $160,000 at current exchange rates) to police officers in exchange for inside information. Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor, was arrested on Friday. Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International, which published The News of the World, is expected to be interviewed by the police this week. More arrests are expected in the coming days, officials said Monday. Allegations of further improper connections between Scotland Yard and The News of the World are still emerging. Reports from the BBC and The Guardian suggested Monday that officers in the Specialist Operations branch, which protects the royal family -- and which Mr. Hayman commanded when he was conducting the initial inquiry into the hacking -- had sold information about members of the royal family to Mr. Goodman, the News of the World royalty reporter. But why the initial Scotland Yard inquiry was so limited is a main focus of Tuesday's hearing. Mark Lewis, a lawyer who represents a number of high-profile hacking victims, said in an interview that he believed that Mr. Hayman was unwilling to investigate phone-hacking because he feared that the newspaper would reveal his relationship with a woman who worked at the Independent Police Complaints Commission. ''He feared that if News International had become displeased with the investigation, there would be very serious consequences for him,'' Mr. Lewis said. In evidence given to the Home Affairs Committee, Mr. Lewis wrote, ''It became public knowledge that throughout the period of the investigation into voice mail hacking, Mr. Hayman was involved in a controversial relationship with a woman who worked for the Independent Police Complaints Commission and was claiming expenses.'' Mr. Hayman did not respond to several messages seeking comment on Monday. He said last year that he had done nothing wrong, but declined to comment further for an article in The New York Times Magazine. After leaving the police in December 2007, Mr. Hayman was hired by News International as a columnist for The Times of London. He has written nearly 100 columns for the newspaper, including one in 2009 that defended the original phone-hacking inquiry, saying that only top detectives had been assigned to it and that the inquiry had left ''no stone unturned.'' It is not known whether The News of the World has targeted the phones of two additional senior Scotland Yard officials who worked on the initial criminal inquiry in 2006, Peter Clarke and Philip Williams. Mr. Clarke is also scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the select committee in Parliament. The relationship between Scotland Yard and News International is another area of the committee's inquiry. Former and current senior Scotland Yard officials told The New York Times Magazine last year that one reason the criminal inquiry was not aggressively pursued was that senior police officers enjoyed a close relationship with editors at The News of the World. In September 2006, Scotland Yard's deputy commissioner at the time, Paul Stephenson, had dinner with Neil Wallis, who was then the deputy editor of The News of the World, The Mail on Sunday has reported. The meeting occurred just one month after the arrests of Mr. Mulcaire and Mr. Goodman.  "
Murdoch Ties Start to Chafe British Leader,"LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron is usually the nimblest of politicians, radiating self-assurance and blessed with an almost Reaganesque ability to deflect criticism. But as the phone hacking scandal spreads, Mr. Cameron has been placed in the unaccustomed position of appearing vulnerable and behind the curve. He has been maneuvered into embarrassing U-turns nearly every step of the way, and on Tuesday performed the latest one: suddenly joining the opposition Labour Party, his bitterest foes, in calling for Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to withdraw its $12 billion bid to buy British Sky Broadcasting, known also as BSkyB. Mr. Cameron's opponents in turn have seized on the chance to inflict damage on the once-unassailable prime minister. The scandal has given new life to the Labour Party and its leader, Ed Miliband, and there are signs, too, of cracks in the governing coalition between the Conservatives and their until-now toothless Liberal Democrat partners. The Liberal Democrat leader, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, on Monday asserted a new independence by heaping moral outrage on Mr. Murdoch and urging him to rescind his BSkyB bid -- a full day before Mr. Cameron would do the same.  But the prime minister's problems go deeper than failing to read the political signs as quickly as other parties. More seriously, his critics say, the affair raises questions about Mr. Cameron's character and judgment in cultivating multiple ties to News International, Mr. Murdoch's British subsidiary, which helped put him in office but which is currently about as politically popular as a basket of snakes at a summer picnic. Mr. Cameron is especially on the defensive about his relationship with his former chief spokesman, Andy Coulson, whom he hired in 2007, soon after Mr. Coulson resigned as the News of the World editor after the initial phone-hacking revelations. Recent disclosures indicate that Mr. Cameron was repeatedly warned not to bring Mr. Coulson with him to Downing Street last year, but did so anyway. ''Unless the prime minister can explain what happened with Mr. Coulson and apologize for this terrible error of judgment in employing him, his reputation and that of the government will be permanently tarnished,'' Mr. Miliband said on Monday in the House of Commons. Mr. Coulson, who gave Mr. Cameron a useful link to the tabloid news world and an invaluable connection to the Murdoch empire, had the full support of the prime minister until last week, when he was arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and paying the police for information and documents while editor of The News of the World. Last Wednesday, Mr. Cameron called Mr. Coulson his friend and said that Mr. Coulson had always assured him he had done nothing wrong. But this Monday, he said: ''If it turned out that those assurances were untrue, if I had been lied to, I would be incredibly angry.'' It turned out he had deflected numerous warnings about Mr. Coulson, from both allies and opponents. These went beyond the initial flurry of opprobrium that greeted Mr. Cameron's initial decision to hire someone so close to an unfolding scandal. In February 2010, the deputy editor of The Guardian, Ian Katz, said he telephoned Steve Hilton, Mr. Cameron's director of strategy, with some worrisome information. According to The Guardian's reporting, Mr. Katz said, Mr. Coulson and The News of the World had uncomfortably close connections to a corrupt private investigator with a criminal record named Jonathan Rees. Mr. Katz told Mr. Hilton that the paper could not yet print every detail, because the matter was still in court, but enumerated a number of nasty disclosures that would eventually emerge. And indeed they did. Mr. Rees, who had earlier been imprisoned for conspiring to plant cocaine on a woman, was rehired after his release as an 150,000-pounds-a-year investigator by The News of the World, edited at the time by Mr. Coulson, The Guardian reported. And he was to be tried as a suspect in an even worse crime: conspiring in the murder of his former business partner, who was chopped to death with an ax in a pub parking lot in 1987. (The trial fell apart this spring, charges were dismissed, and Mr. Rees's location is unknown.) Mr. Coulson had to pass through numerous layers of vetting before coming to Downing Street, and none found any criminal connections. On Monday, a spokesman for the prime minister's office told The Guardian that ''the prime minister has said that he was not given specific information'' about Mr. Katz's warnings. Mr. Katz was not the only one with concerns. Nicholas Soames, a senior Conservative lawmaker, said that he expressed his displeasure about Mr. Coulson to Mr. Cameron ''through the usual channels.'' The Conservatives' coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, were unhappy, too. In opposition, they had long inveighed against Mr. Coulson, an easy strategy because they are the only party without special ties to Mr. Murdoch. Soon after the election last year, Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he also contacted Mr. Cameron's office with worries about Mr. Coulson. ''I was aware that there was likely to be more to this than Mr. Coulson was at this stage revealing,'' said Lord Ashdown, who has felt the sting of the Murdoch press in the past. As it happened, Mr. Coulson resigned from his government job in January, following a new round of revelations in the scandal. The evolution of Mr. Cameron's statements about Mr. Coulson is just one example of the policy contortions the prime minister has had to perform this week. First he said there was no need for a new phone-hacking inquiry; then he said there was. First he said there was nothing he could do to delay Mr. Murdoch's takeover of BSkyB; then he said there was, finally calling on Mr. Murdoch to withdraw the bid. First Mr. Cameron continued to support his close friend Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's News International; then he said she should leave her job. He has also had to shed his numerous associations to News International as swiftly as if he were taking off an overcoat. These include friendships not just with Ms. Brooks but with Mr. Murdoch's children Elisabeth and James, and others in the Murdoch inner circle near the village of Chipping Norton in the Oxfordshire countryside. And they include political sympathy so acute that Mr. Murdoch was Mr. Cameron's second visitor to Downing Street after he became prime minister. In addition, Mr. Cameron's government has been relentlessly and publicly bullish about Mr. Murdoch's BSkyB bid until now. ''He is not a sleazy corrupt individual himself, but he has not shown terribly good judgment getting into bed with these people,'' said Gerry Alcock, who runs the Web site chippingnorton.net. In a way, Mr. Cameron is unlucky. Successive governments, most recently the Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, courted Mr. Murdoch with almost as much fervor as the current one. Mr. Cameron's happened to be the government in power and without a chair when the music stopped.  "
Britain's Press Scandal: The last thing Britain needs is more restrictions on a free press. Just enforce the law.,"The phone hacking scandal in Britain that has already brought down The News of the World and now hangs over at least two other newspapers has exposed a culture of illegal intrusions, systematic bribes to corrupt police officials and thuggish threats of damaging publicity to silence criminal investigators. It is not over yet.  Hard lessons must be drawn. Investigations into criminal behavior must be taken to their conclusions, wherever they lead. Honest journalists -- and they abound in England, as elsewhere -- should not fear those inquiries. But there is one course of action the authorities most emphatically must not pursue: the new system of press regulation that Prime Minister David Cameron darkly hinted at last week. Mr. Cameron, whose own judgment has been called into question by the scandal, may pine for a tamer press. But now especially, British public life needs the disinfecting sunlight of a free press, not the chilling shadow of official oversight. And Mr. Cameron should keep this in mind: the scandal is not about journalism and whether it should be allowed to flourish, it is about intentional lawbreaking -- including by public officials. The News of the World episode revealed a widespread practice of illegal hacking of private phones and e-mails. The paper's alleged targets included a teenage girl later found murdered, families of fallen soldiers, police investigators, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Queen Elizabeth II. While the story has mainly focused on illegal methods attributed to The News of the World, the latest accusations implicate two other leading newspapers: The Sun, a tabloid, and The Sunday Times, a broadsheet. Both, like The News of the World, are owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International. But other British media organizations appear to condone similar practices. This sordid affair is about more than the press and the police. Andy Coulson, until recently Mr. Cameron's communications adviser, resigned as editor of The News of the World in the wake of a 2007 scandal involving hacking into the voice mail of the royal household. Last week, Mr. Coulson was arrested on charges of approving phone hacking and payoffs to the police during his editorship. As his arrest demonstrates, phone hacking and bribing police officers are already criminal offenses. Britain does not need new laws, it just needs to better enforce the ones it already has. In other areas, Britain's press already faces more hurdles than are healthy in a democracy. An Official Secrets Act lets the government decide what news can and cannot be printed. Libel laws heavily weighted toward complainants chill the publication of unflattering facts. Enacting further government restrictions on news gathering and publication would be a terrible idea -- blinding the public in the name of protecting it.  "
Victim's Family Appears Amid Rage at Tabloids,"LONDON -- On the day when Rupert Murdoch retreated from the biggest media takeover bid in Britain's history, the wider significance that many here see for the way that power in the country is wielded found its most poignant expression in the sight of an ordinary family standing silently, subdued but assuaged at last, at the door of 10 Downing Street. It had taken less than 10 days for the anger that swept Britain over the story of Milly Dowler's cellphone to build into the political earthquake that forced Mr. Murdoch, the 80-year-old tycoon, to abandon the latest, and what could be the last, of his great business coups -- an attempt to acquire the rest of British Sky Broadcasting for the News Corporation, the corporate giant that makes Mr. Murdoch one of the world's most powerful news media figures. The Dowlers had been shielded, until Wednesday, by their lawyer, Mark Lewis. He has fielded a frenzy of media questions since the news broke last week that, according to the police, a Murdoch-owned tabloid, The News of the World, had hacked into the voice-mail messages of the 13-year-old Milly after she was abducted in 2002 and while her family waited for some sign that she was still alive.  That sign came, the family thought, when the police told them that some of the messages they had left on the cellphone that Milly was carrying had been deleted. In reality, the police said, the messages were erased at the newspaper's behest, to make room for more messages that could be hacked to embellish articles on her disappearance. Ms. Dowler was later found murdered. In the years since, a faltering police investigation pointed to the Dowler case as only one of scores, possibly thousands, of cases in which ruthless newspapers, mainly The News of the World, have been accused of engaging in phone hacking in their relentless pursuit of scoops -- as well as other covert newsroom tactics that may have included identity theft and bribery of police officers. But now, the Dowlers were in the eye of the nation, greeted at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister David Cameron. They had been invited earlier for a meeting with the opposition leader, Ed Miliband, and welcomed as honored guests in the visitors' gallery at the House of Commons. They became witnesses to the day when the cascading accusations about wrongdoing by newspapers in Mr. Murdoch's British stable brought not only the withdrawal of his $12 billion bid for British Sky Broadcasting, but also what many politicians hailed, perhaps without too much overstatement, as the day when the country's long-skewed democratic balance began to be restored. On the Downing Street pavement, Mr. Lewis, speaking to a news media throng, said that after what had been ''an earth-shattering week for everybody,'' the family was pleased with the withdrawal of the British Sky Broadcasting bid. It demonstrated, the family's lawyer said, that ''however big an organization is,'' it could be held to account in a society under law. ''Politicians and the public,'' he said, ''are saying, 'Enough is enough.' '' The words could have been the theme for what was happening 500 yards away in the House of Commons, where something not witnessed in decades was happening. In recent times, the 700-year-old chamber has been mired in conflict and embarrassment over an expenses scandal that ended the careers of dozens of lawmakers in the prelude to last year's general election. But Mr. Murdoch's abandonment of the takeover in the face of political pressure -- in particular, the united will of an outraged House of Commons -- generated a sense of something like a liberation from Britain's rampaging tabloids. The lawmakers were celebrating having curbed, at least for now, the influence of editors and reporters who had become something of a parallel power with little accountability -- even if the lawmakers themselves sometimes empowered the tabloids by seeking their support. Mr. Cameron described the end of the BSkyB bid as ''a victory for the good, decent people of Britain.'' But he also sought to halt the slump in his own fortunes by trying to explain, once again, why he had hired as his chief spokesman Andy Coulson, who was the editor of The News of the World when, the police say, much of the phone hacking and at least some of the bribery appears to have taken place. The prime minister's defense cut little ice, particularly with Mr. Miliband, the Labour leader, who called it ''a catastrophic error of judgment'' and brought hoots of approval from Labour backbenchers when he said of Mr. Cameron, ''He just doesn't get it, Mr. Speaker.'' But amid the sparring, the mood on all sides of the Commons was of a new chapter beginning. John Whittingdale, chairman of a parliamentary committee, has scheduled a hearing next Tuesday on the scandal, and summoned Mr. Murdoch; his son James, chairman of his British subsidiary, News International; and Rebekah Brooks, the subsidiary's chief executive, to be the principal witnesses. ''The position of the press will never be the same again,'' Mr. Whittingdale said. Mr. Miliband said lawmakers had ''for too long just shrugged our shoulders and done nothing'' in the face of the tabloid abuses, and added that, like the Dowlers, Parliament had to show that ''nobody is above the law.'' Almost every speaker demanded a new era of tighter regulation for newspapers, one in which politicians and ordinary people would no longer live in fear -- a word that occurred often -- of having their families, lives and careers destroyed by get-the-story-at-all-costs journalists. Making what many of those present considered the best parliamentary speech of his career, the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the victim of a 2006 scoop in The Sun about his infant son's cystic fibrosis, unleashed what may have been the most damning diatribe against Mr. Murdoch ever heard from a prominent British politician. He said that Mr. Murdoch and his papers had ''descended from the gutter into the sewers'' and ''let the rats out'' against public figures like himself and ordinary people who could not defend themselves. He said they had created ''a criminal-media nexus,'' and if action was not taken against them now ''our friends across the world who admire our liberties will ask what kind of a country we have become.'' ''What should have been the greatest defenders of our freedoms have become the greatest abusers,'' he added.  "
Murdochs Agree to Testify Before Parliamentary Panel,"LONDON -- Facing the unpleasant prospect of being represented by a pair of empty chairs and a period of silence at a parliamentary committee hearing on phone hacking next week, Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, and his son James reversed themselves on Thursday and said that yes, they would testify at the hearing after all. The select committee on culture, media and sport will now have the chance to interrogate not only the two Murdochs but also Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, the company's British newspaper subsidiary. Ms. Brooks had agreed from the outset to testify. Word that the Murdochs had shifted course came as one of several other moves by the News Corporation on Thursday that signaled the company was adopting a more assertive strategy to deflect the condemnation being hurled its way. It brought on outside public relations help for the crisis, hired a prominent white-collar defense lawyer and was said to be planning to run full-page apology advertisements in newspapers across Britain.  The elder Mr. Murdoch made his first extended comments on the matter, phoning a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, which he owns, to defend his company's handling of the crisis. He said the matter had been handled ''extremely well in every way possible,'' and rejected claims that his son James had moved too slowly to address concerns about the hacking. He added that he was eager ''to address some of the things that have been said in Parliament, some of which are total lies,'' and said reports that the News Corporation was contemplating spinning off its newspapers into a separate entity were ''pure rubbish.'' Meanwhile, the company's woes increased on Thursday when yet another former senior editor of its tabloid The News of the World, now defunct, Neil Wallis, became the ninth person since January to be arrested in the phone-hacking scandal. Mr. Wallis also appears to have unusually close ties to top officers at the Metropolitan Police Service, and worked for them as a public relations consultant last year. Next Tuesday's meeting will be the first time the Murdochs and Ms. Brooks will have to publicly answer questions about the affair. With evidence mounting by the day of criminality and dubious journalistic practices at The News of the World and other News Corporation newspapers here, the company not only has summarily closed the paper, but also has withdrawn its $12 billion bid for British Sky Broadcasting. In response to earlier letters from the culture committee, Rupert Murdoch at first announced he was ''not available'' to attend the hearing, while James Murdoch said that next week would not work for him, either, but that he would be available sometime in August, if that was convenient for everyone else. Not convenient, the angry committee retorted. Using only rarely invoked powers, the committee's chairman, John Whittingdale, responded by ordering that the Murdochs be presented with formal summonses to appear. Mr. Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament, also declared that he was fully prepared to ''empty-chair'' the Murdochs by holding their portion of the hearing without them, using two chairs as stand-ins. After waiting a while for them to turn up, he said, he then planned to ask that they be declared in contempt of Parliament. Rupert Murdoch's hasty U-turn reflects the company's confusion in handling the crisis and a sense that its chairman has been unable to properly judge the public mood. By cooperating with the committee, people close to Mr. Murdoch believe, he can demonstrate that he is taking the scandal seriously. The public relations firm Edelman confirmed on Thursday that it had been hired here by News International to provide ''communications and public affairs support and counsel,'' another sign that the company was trying to develop a better strategy to help it navigate the crisis. News International also flew staff members from Rubenstein Associates, the powerful New York public relations firm that already advises Mr. Murdoch, to London to help out. The criminal lawyer they hired, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. of Williams & Connolly in Washington, has defended Richard A. Grasso, the former chief of the New York Stock Exchange, and Oliver North. Mr. Wallis's arrest, while bad news for the company, is also doubly worrying for the Metropolitan Police Service. The police are already under attack for failing to adequately pursue the phone-hacking inquiry in 2006, and again for failing to reopen the investigation in light of new evidence in 2009. While Mr. Wallis is not the most important figure yet to be arrested -- that would be Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World who until January was Prime Minister David Cameron's chief spokesman -- he is close to Scotland Yard. After leaving The News of the World in 2009, Mr. Wallis became a media consultant, whereupon he was immediately hired to ''provide strategic communication advice'' to Scotland Yard officials from October 2009 to September 2010, according to a police spokesman. His firm offered the lowest rate, the spokesman said, explaining how he got the job. But his ties to the police went back longer. In September 2006, one month after The News of the World's royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, was arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and the paper Mr. Wallis worked for was supposedly under investigation, Mr. Wallis had dinner with Sir Paul Stephenson, then Scotland Yard's deputy commissioner, and Dick Fedorcio, its chief spokesman. Sir Paul, now the police commissioner, said on Thursday that he was ''very satisfied with my own integrity.'' More recently, Assistant Commissioner John Yates, another top police official, told a parliamentary committee in March that he could not remember exactly when he last had lunch with Mr. Wallis, but that it ''may well'' have been in February. A police spokesman said he did not know the precise date of this engagement. But if it was indeed in February, that meant that it took place after the police had already opened Operation Weeting, the investigation into phone hacking under which Mr. Wallis has now been arrested. Late Thursday, London's mayor, Boris Johnson, summoned Sir Paul to City Hall for a stern lecture about his decision to hire Mr. Wallis in 2009, local news outlets reported, and Mr. Johnson said he would press for a full investigation. Meanwhile, the House of Commons' culture committee is gearing up for its confrontation with the Murdochs and Ms. Brooks at next week's hearing. Judging from the outraged remarks lawmakers have been making about the News Corporation and its officers in raucous, angry sessions in Parliament the last few days, it is not likely to be a friendly discussion. But it is unclear how much the trio will say, in the end. In a letter to Mr. Whittingdale in which she agreed to testify, Ms. Brooks declared that it ''might not be appropriate'' to answer questions about the police investigation for fear of prejudicing it. ''As a result this may prevent me from discussing these matters in detail,'' she said. Mr. Whittingdale said in response: ''We'll see.''  "
"A Day of Apologies for the Murdochs, And of New Questions for Cameron","LONDON -- As Rupert Murdoch's newspaper empire on Saturday published full-page ads in every national newspaper in Britain under the words ''We are sorry,'' the government of Prime Minister David Cameron released information documenting the prime minister's close ties to Murdoch company executives that continued even as the phone-hacking scandal grew. The apology by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation was a U-turn from his previously defiant handling of the crisis. The banner headline in Saturday's editions of The Times of London read ''Day of Atonement,'' and it was all the more striking for the fact that it ran in the 226-year-old newspaper that is the flagship of the print empire that Mr. Murdoch has assembled in Britain over the past 40 years.  At the end of a week that rocked the interwoven worlds of the press, politicians and the police in Britain, and spread across the Atlantic with the opening of an F.B.I. investigation into allegations of associated abuses in the United States, penitence was the buzzword far beyond the London headquarters of Mr. Murdoch's British-based newspaper subsidiary, News International. The crisis seemed far from over for Mr. Murdoch, as the scandal that began over illegal phone hacking by one of his newspapers, The News of the World, now defunct, widened to include a second newspaper in his stable, The Sunday Times, officials said Saturday. Nor was the crisis abating for Mr. Cameron. As presses rolled Friday night with the Murdoch bid for redemption in the ''sorry'' ad, and with front-page stories telling of his face-to-face, head-hanging apology to the parents of a murdered girl whose cellphone voice mails were hacked, Mr. Cameron's aides released a diary of his meetings with executives and editors of News International. The diary shed light on what Mr. Cameron acknowledged last week was the ''cozy and comfortable'' world in which politicians, the press and the police in Britain have functioned for decades, one he said had to yield to much greater public scrutiny. The diary showed that since taking office in May 2010, Mr. Cameron has met 26 times with Murdoch executives, including Mr. Murdoch; his son James, the top official of News International; and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of the British subsidiary and editor of The News of the World, who resigned on Friday. Her resignation was quickly followed by that of Les Hinton, the News Corporation executive and former chief of News International who had been publisher of The Wall Street Journal, another Murdoch property, since 2007. All four executives are expected to testify before a parliamentary oversight committee on Tuesday. Most of the meetings cited in the diary took place at the prime minister's London headquarters at 10 Downing Street, or at Chequers, his official country residence northwest of London. His meetings with the Murdoch officials exceeded all those with other British media representatives put together. Ms. Brooks was the only person on the guest list for Chequers who had been invited there twice. Another guest was Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who resigned as Mr. Cameron's Downing Street media chief under the pressure of the phone-hacking scandal in January. That visit occurred in March, two months after he resigned. Downing Street officials noted that Ms. Brooks and her husband have a country home near Chequers. As for Mr. Coulson, they said, he and his family had been invited for an overnight stay to thank him for his work for the government and the Conservative Party, where he held a similar post before the election. The list did nothing to assuage the questions about Mr. Cameron's judgment in maintaining close ties with executives of a media enterprise that has been under a faltering police investigation for years and has come under intense scrutiny. The ties to Mr. Coulson, in particular, have been assailed by the Labour opposition leader, Ed Miliband, but have also spread dismay among Mr. Cameron's Conservatives. Foreign Minister William Hague defended those ties on Saturday, telling the BBC that inviting Mr. Coulson to Chequers was ''a normal, human thing to do'' and that it was ''not surprising that in a democratic country there is some contact'' between political leaders and media officials. ''Personally I'm not embarrassed by it in any way,'' he said. Mr. Cameron hired Mr. Coulson in 2007, shortly after he resigned at The News of the World and against the strong urging of some other Conservatives. His defense has been that Mr. Coulson deserved ''a second chance,'' and he has said that if Mr. Coulson's assurances of guiltlessness in the phone-hacking scandal prove to have been false, he should be prosecuted. While the police investigation has largely centered on cellphone hacking by journalists at The News of the World, it has now spread to the investigative unit of The Sunday Times, a person familiar with internal News Corporation discussions said. That person, as well as a person with knowledge of the scope of the inquiry, said the investigation would expand to include hacking into e-mail accounts and other online privacy invasions. One target of the investigation is Jonathan Rees, a private detective employed by The News of the World with ties to corrupt police officers and a criminal record. Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament who has been briefed on the inquiry, said the police had evidence that Mr. Rees was paid by News International and that he had claimed to have met with members of The Sunday Times investigation unit.  "
Tabloid Scandal Topples Leader at Scotland Yard,"LONDON -- Britain's top police official resigned on Sunday, the latest casualty of the phone-hacking scandal engulfing British public life, just hours after Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's News International, was arrested on suspicion of illegally intercepting phone calls and bribing the police. The official, Sir Paul Stephenson, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, commonly known as the Met or Scotland Yard, said that he had decided to step down because ''the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met's links with News International at a senior level'' had made it difficult for him to do his job. But he said that he had done nothing wrong and that he would not ''lose sleep over my personal integrity.'' He also said that because he had not been involved in the original phone-hacking investigation, he had had no idea that Neil Wallis, a former News of the World deputy editor who had become a public-relations consultant for the police after leaving the paper, was himself suspected of phone hacking.  Mr. Wallis, 60, was arrested last Thursday. The commissioner's resignation came as the London political establishment was still digesting the stunning news about the arrest of Ms. Brooks -- who apparently was surprised herself. A consummate networker who has always been assiduously courted by politicians and whose friends include Prime Minister David Cameron, Ms. Brooks, 43, is the 10th and by far the most powerful person to be arrested so far in the phone-hacking scandal. Her arrest is bound to be particularly wounding to Mr. Murdoch, who, asked early last week to identify his chief priority in the affair, pointed to Ms. Brooks and said, ''This one.'' Ms. Brooks has not yet been formally charged, but it is significant that she is being questioned in connection with two separate investigations. One, called Operation Weeting, is examining allegations of widespread phone hacking at the News of the World, the tabloid at the center of the scandal, where Ms. Brooks was editor from 2000 to 2003. The other is Operation Elveden, which is looking into more serious charges that News International editors paid police officers for information. Ms. Brooks has always maintained that she was unaware of wrongdoing at The News of the World, which was summarily closed by Mr. Murdoch a week ago in an unsuccessful damage-control exercise. But the tide rose against her, and on Friday she resigned, saying in a statement that her presence was ''detracting attention'' from the company. The arrest was a shock to the News Corporation, the parent company of News International, and the other properties in Mr. Murdoch's media empire, which is reeling from the traumas of last week: the forced withdrawal of its cherished $12 billion takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting and the resignations not only of Ms. Brooks but also of Les Hinton, a longtime Murdoch ally and friend who was the chairman of Dow Jones and the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Speaking of Ms. Brooks, an official at News International said: ''When she resigned on Friday, we were not aware that she would be arrested by the police.'' Another person briefed on the News Corporation's plans said that on Friday, when the company was preparing to announce her exit and the departure in New York of Mr. Hinton, the possibility of her arrest was not discussed. Investor unease about the scandal appeared to be affecting News Corporation shares, which were down nearly 6 percent in early Monday trading on the Australian exchange in Sydney. Until Ms. Brooks arrived at a London police station by prearranged appointment on Sunday, she believed she would merely be helping the police as a witness, her spokesman said. ''She was very surprised, I think, to then be arrested,'' said the spokesman, David Wilson, chairman of the Bell Pottinger public relations firm. Mr. Wilson said it all happened so quickly that both her lawyer and he were brought in to handle her case over the weekend. Ms. Brooks was arrested ''under caution,'' he said, meaning that she was read her rights and treated as a suspect. ''She maintains her innocence, absolutely,'' he said. She was released on bail after about 12 hours in police custody, news services reported.For months, Ms. Brooks had been willing to talk to the police but had been rebuffed, Mr. Wilson said. ''As recently as last week, she was told she wasn't required to do so and she wasn't on their radar.'' No formal charges have yet been brought against Ms. Brooks, or indeed against any of the others -- mostly former editors and reporters at The News of the World -- arrested in the phone-hacking case so far. These include Andy Coulson, who resigned as the paper's editor in in 2007, was then hired by the Conservative Party, and most recently worked as the chief spokesman for Mr. Cameron's government. Under British law, suspects can be detained 24 to 36 hours without being charged. Sir Paul, who took over the top police job in 2009, stepped down in large part because of a furor over his contacts with News International officials. The New York Times reported over the weekend that he met for meals 18 times with News International executives and editors during the phone-hacking investigation, and that other top other police officials had had similar meetings. These included meeting Mr. Wallis eight times while he was still working at The News of the World. Both Theresa May, the home secretary, and Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said they were angry that he had not disclosed these meetings earlier. In his statement, Sir Paul explained that he had withheld information about his contacts with Mr. Wallis, even after Mr. Wallis became a phone-hacking suspect, because he ''did not want to compromise the prime minister in any way by revealing or discussing a potential suspect who clearly had a close relationship with Mr. Coulson'' -- Mr. Cameron's friend and former employee. ''Unlike Mr. Coulson, Mr. Wallis had not resigned from News of the World or, to the best of my knowledge, been in any way associated with the original phone-hacking investigation,'' Sir Paul said, in what appeared to be a criticism of the prime minister. Mr. Cameron is in the awkward position of counting two of the arrested parties -- Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks -- as personal friends. As leader of the opposition, he attended Ms. Brooks's wedding in 2009 (Rupert Murdoch and Gordon Brown, then the prime minister, of the Labour Party, were also guests). Mr. Cameron was friendly enough with Ms. Brooks to socialize with her twice in December, according to records released by Downing Street last Friday. Once was at a cozy family dinner at her country house over the Christmas holiday; James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch's son and the head of News Corporation's European and Asian divisions, was also present. The meetings took place while Mr. Cameron's government was considering, favorably, the News Corporation's bid to take over the part of BskyB that it did not already own. Oddly enough, both Sir Paul and Ms. Brooks were due to give testimony on Tuesday to different Parliamentary committees looking into phone hacking. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs committee, where Sir Paul was due to be questioned, said that there was no reason the session should not still proceed. But Ms. Brooks's appearance, at the committee on culture, media and sport, is now in doubt. Before her arrest, she had warned that because of the investigation, she might be limited in what she could say. Now, it is unclear whether she will come at all. Although they will still get to question her former bosses, Rupert and James Murdoch, committee members seem disappointed at the prospect of losing Ms. Brooks. Some even said that they wondered if the timing of the arrest was intended to ensure that she was unavailable to answer their questions. ''Being of a suspicious mind, I do find it odd that they should arrest her now by appointment,'' said Chris Bryant, a Labour member of the committee, who suspects his phone was hacked by The News of the World. He said the arrest brings the scandal closer to the top. ''The water is now lapping around the ankles of the Murdoch family,'' he said.  "
Murdoch Aides Long Obscured Scandal's Scale,"LONDON -- Two days before it emerged that The News of the World had hacked the cellphone of a murdered schoolgirl, igniting a scandal that has shaken the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, his son James told friends that he thought the worst of the troubles were behind him. And he was confident that the News Corporation's $12 billion bid for the satellite company British Sky Broadcasting would go through, according to a person present. Now, with their most trusted lieutenant, Rebekah Brooks, arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and paying the police for information, the broadcasting bid abandoned, the 168-year-old News of the World shuttered, and nine others arrested, Rupert and James Murdoch are scheduled to face an enraged British Parliament on Tuesday. It is a spectacle that Rupert Murdoch's closest associates spent years trying to avoid.  Interviews with dozens of people involved in the hacking scandal, including current and former News Corporation employees, provide an inside view of how a small group of executives pursued strategies for years that had the effect of obscuring the extent of wrongdoing in the newsroom of The News of the World, Britain's best-selling tabloid. And once the hacking scandal escalated, they scrambled in vain to quarantine the damage. Evidence indicating that The News of the World paid the police for information was not handed over to the authorities for four years. Its parent company paid hefty sums to those who threatened legal action, on condition of silence. The tabloid continued to pay reporters and editors whose knowledge could prove embarrassing even after they were fired or arrested for hacking. A key editor's computer equipment was destroyed, and e-mail evidence was lost. Internal advice to accept responsibility was ignored, former executives said. John Whittingdale, a Conservative member of Parliament who is the chairman of the committee that will question the Murdochs, said they need to come clean on the depth of the misdeeds, who authorized them and who knew what, when. ''Parliament was misled,'' Mr. Whittingdale said. ''It will be a lengthy and detailed discussion.'' Mr. Murdoch has indicated he wants to cooperate. ''We think it's important to absolutely establish our integrity in the eyes of the public,'' he said last week. ''It's best just to be as transparent as possible.'' Ms. Brooks's representative, David Wilson, said she maintained her innocence and looked forward to clearing her name, but declined to answer specific questions. As a trickle of revelations has become a torrent, the company switched from containment to crisis mode. Ms. Brooks and others first made the case that other newspapers had also hacked phones, and they sought to dig up evidence to prove it, interviews show. At a private meeting, Rupert Murdoch warned Paul Dacre, the editor of the rival Daily Mail newspaper and one of the most powerful men on Fleet Street, that ''we are not going to be the only bad dog on the street,'' according to an account that Mr. Dacre gave to his management team. Mr. Murdoch's spokesman did not respond to questions about his private conversations. Former company executives and political aides assert that executives at News International, the News Corporation's British subsidiary, carried out a campaign of selective leaks implicating previous management and the police. Company officials deny that. The Metropolitan Police responded with a statement alleging a ''deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation into the alleged payments by corrupt journalists to corrupt police officers.'' Mr. Murdoch was attending a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, early this month when it became clear that the latest eruption of the hacking scandal was not, as he first thought, a passing problem. According to a person briefed on the conversation, he proposed to one senior executive that he ''fly commercial to London,'' so he might be seen as a man of the people. He was told that would hardly do the trick, and he arrived on a Gulfstream G550 private jet. Evidence Was There All Along The storm Mr. Murdoch flew into had been brewing since 2006, when the tabloid's royalty reporter and a private investigator were prosecuted for hacking into the messages of the royal household staff in search of juicy news exclusives. For years afterward, company executives publicly insisted that the hacking was limited to that one ''rogue reporter.'' Andy Coulson resigned as editor of The News of the World after the prosecution, but said he knew nothing. ''If you're talking about illegal tapping by a private investigator,'' Rupert Murdoch declared in February 2007, ''that is not part of our culture anywhere in the world, least of all in Britain.'' But it turns out that almost from the beginning, executives of News International, the British subsidiary that owns the tabloid, had access to information indicating that other reporters were also engaged in the practice. During the royal hacking case, Scotland Yard had seized thousands of pages of records with the names of thousands of possible hacking targets from the home of the private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who worked for the tabloid. While the police largely limited their investigation to the royalty case, lawyers representing people believed to be victims of hacking fought for access to Mr. Mulcaire's records and made them available to the tabloid executives during the litigation. In the initial cases, News International saw documents naming other journalists, according to details of those cases obtained by The New York Times. Notes in Mr. Mulcaire's files include the names ''Ian'' and ''Neville,'' apparent references to the news editor, Ian Edmondson, and the chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. James Murdoch, who oversees Europe and Asia operations for the News Corporation, signed off on a $:700,000 settlement with Gordon Taylor, a soccer union boss who was the first to sue. One condition of the payment was confidentiality. This month, James Murdoch acknowledged he was wrong to settle the suit, saying he did not ''have a complete picture of the case'' at the time. Ms. Brooks personally persuaded Max Clifford, a celebrity publicist, to drop his case in return for even more compensation, Mr. Clifford said. He was paid to provide story tips to the paper -- a deal he said totaled $:1 million. Beyond Mr. Mulcaire's files, another likely source of information about hacking by The News of the World is its internal e-mails. Even as the company faced a flood of claims over the past several years, News International has acknowledged that it did not take any steps to preserve e-mails that might contain evidence of hacking until late last fall. When The News of the World moved offices late last year, the computer used by Mr. Edmondson was destroyed in what the company describes as a standard procedure. The company asserted in court that a vast amount of its e-mails from 2005 and 2006 -- believed to be the height of the hacking activity -- had been lost. Company officials blamed bungling, not conspiracy, for the erasures. News International has subsequently acknowledged that some messages might be recoverable on backup disks, and the police are trying to recover that information now, said Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament. Last year, a forensic computer specialist that the company hired to help it comply with a court order to turn over documents made a surprising discovery: three e-mails sent to Mr. Edmondson containing PIN codes that could allow access to voice mail, as well as names and telephone numbers, one official said. The paper fired Mr. Edmonson and turned over the e-mails to the police. Those e-mails were a factor in the decision to open a new Scotland Yard inquiry into hacking, according to the inquiry's leader, Sue Akers. Mr. Edmondson referred questions to his lawyer, who did not respond. In April, the police arrested Mr. Edmondson, along with Mr. Thurlbeck. A few days later, News International issued a blanket apology, saying, ''It is now apparent that our previous inquiries failed to uncover important evidence.'' News International has for years said a 2007 internal investigation showed that hacking was not widespread, but recent interviews with company officials indicate that the inquiry had a different purpose. It was aimed at defending the company from a lawsuit filed by Clive Goodman, the paper's royalty reporter who had been fired for hacking. He claimed that the dismissal was unfair because others were hacking as well, according to two company officials with direct knowledge. Colin Myler, who succeeded Mr. Coulson as editor of The News of the World, told Parliament in 2007 that News International had turned over as many as 2,500 e-mails to the law firm of Harbottle & Lewis, which the company had retained in the matter. In a letter to Parliament at the time, the firm said it did not find anything in the e-mails linking hacking to three top editors -- Mr. Coulson, Neil Wallis and Mr. Edmondson. But a company official speaking on the condition of anonymity said that the 2,500 e-mails given to the law firm related only to Mr. Goodman and represented only a small portion of the company's e-mail traffic. Since Scotland Yard began its new investigation in January, with access to more internal documents, all three of the editors, who are no longer at the paper, have been arrested. Two company officials said the 2007 internal inquiry was in fact overseen by Les Hinton, then executive chairman of News International and who resigned Friday as chief executive of Dow Jones. Mr. Hinton told Parliament in 2007 that Mr. Myler ''went through thousands of e-mails.'' But Mr. Myler was not given direct access to the e-mails, the company officials said. Mr. Hinton did not respond to a message, but in a statement announcing his resignation, he said he ''was ignorant of what apparently happened.'' While the e-mails reviewed for the internal inquiry in 2007 showed no direct evidence of hacking, according to three company officials they did contain suggestions that Mr. Coulson may have authorized payments to the police for information. Yet News International turned over those documents to the police in recent months, prompting yet another investigation, this one into possible police bribery. It is not clear who at News International saw the e-mails in question, or whether the law firm flagged them. The firm, citing client confidentiality obligations, declined to comment, as did the News Corporation. More recently, as lawsuits and arrests mounted, dissension grew inside News International, interviews show. After Mr. Edmondson was fired and arrested, Ms. Brooks pressed to pay him a monthly stipend, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction. After an internal disagreement, the payments were moved from the newsroom budget to News International's. The company put other journalists on paid leave after their arrests, reasoning that they were innocent until proved guilty, a company spokesperson said. By the middle of last year, News International's lawyers and some executives were urging that the company accept some responsibility, said two officials with direct knowledge. Ms. Brooks disagreed, according to three people who described the internal debate. ''Her behavior all along has been resist, resist, resist,'' said one company official. Effort to Spread the Blame Over the last several months, Ms. Brooks spearheaded a strategy that seemed designed to spread the blame across Fleet Street, interviews show. Several former News of the World journalists said that she asked them to dig up evidence of hacking. One said in an interview that Ms. Brooks's target was not her own newspapers, but her rivals. Mr. Dacre, the editor of The Daily Mail, told his senior managers that he had received several reports from businesspeople, soccer stars and public relations agencies that two News International executives, Will Lewis and Simon Greenberg, had encouraged them to investigate whether their phones had been hacked by Daily Mail newspapers. ''They thought it was unfair that all the focus was on The News of the World,'' said one News International official with knowledge of the effort. The two men have told colleagues they did not make such calls, but two company officials disputed that. Mr. Dacre confronted Ms. Brooks over breakfast at the plush Brown's hotel. ''You are trying to tear down the entire industry,'' Mr. Dacre told her, according to an account he relayed to his management team. Ms. Brooks, known for her tenacity, was not deterred. At a dinner party, Lady Rothermere, the wife of the billionaire owner of The Daily Mail, overheard Ms. Brooks saying that The Mail was just as culpable as The News of the World. ''We didn't break the law,'' Lady Rothermere said, according to two sources with knowledge of the exchange. Ms. Brooks asked who Lady Rothermere thought she was, ''Mother Teresa?'' The scandal that smoldered for years ignited this month with news reports that the tabloid had hacked into the messages of Milly Dowler, a missing 13-year-old girl who was subsequently discovered murdered. Ms. Brooks, who was News of the World's editor during the Dowler hacking, issued an apology, saying that she would be appalled ''if the accusations are true.'' In the last two weeks, a series of leaks landed in other British news media that appeared intended to shift blame from News International's current leadership and onto Mr. Coulson and the Metropolitan Police. According to political aides and News Corporation executives, the leaks most likely came from within the company. Leaks to The Sunday Times, the BBC, and outlets like Mr. Greenberg's former employer, The London Evening Standard, gave details of Mr. Coulson's alleged payments to the police and blamed previous News International management. Mr. Greenberg did not respond directly to messages seeking comment. But a News International spokeswoman referred reporters to a statement from Ms. Akers, the head of the police investigation, praising him and Mr. Lewis for their cooperation with the police. The Metropolitan Police said it was ''extremely concerned'' that the release of selected information ''known by a small number of people'' present at meetings between News International and the police ''could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.'' Late last week, Rupert Murdoch told The Wall Street Journal that the News Corporation had handled the situation ''extremely well in every way possible,'' except for a few ''minor mistakes.'' This weekend, as Mr. Murdoch was coached to face Parliament on Tuesday by a team of lawyers and public relations experts, a full-page advertisement from the News Corporation appeared in every major British newspaper. ''We are sorry,'' it said.  "
Murdochs Deny That They Knew Of Illegal Acts,"LONDON -- It was riveting theater, a newly emboldened parliamentary committee facing off against the 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch, the world's most powerful media mogul, in a series of exchanges designed to get to the bottom of the phone hacking scandal that has engulfed not just Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, but also Britain's political and law-enforcement elite. In two hours of intense questioning broken only by a bizarre incident in which Mr. Murdoch was accosted with what appeared to be a foil pie plate filled with shaving cream, both he and his son James declared repeatedly that they had been shocked to discover something that has become increasingly apparent: that phone hacking and other illegal behavior were endemic at their News of the World tabloid, which is now defunct. Even so, the Murdochs and Rebekah Brooks, a former editor at the paper who resigned from the News Corporation on Friday, only to be arrested on Sunday on suspicion of phone hacking and bribing the police, apologized again and again for the failures at their company.  ''I would just like to say one sentence,'' Rupert Murdoch said, breaking at one point into a long answer by his son, the News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer. ''This is the most humble day of my life.'' But his humility did not extend to declaring that he was at fault or that he should step down from his company. ''I feel that people I trusted -- I don't know who, on what level -- have let me down, and I think they have behaved disgracefully, and it's for them to pay,'' he said. ''And I think, frankly, that I'm the best person to see it through.'' While the elder Mr. Murdoch has long had the reputation of being a hands-on manager, pressing for and savoring the scoops scored by the newspapers he had always felt were the soul of his media empire, he said in his testimony that in the case of The News of the World, he had no knowledge of the specifics of what was going on. He did not know, for example, that his company had paid confidential out-of-court settlements of $:600,000 and $:1 million to two victims of phone hacking. Nor, he said, did he know that the company was paying the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator under contract to The News of the World who was convicted in 2007 of hacking into the phones of staff members of the royal family. James Murdoch said he had not known about paying Mr. Mulcaire's legal fees either, and was ''as surprised as you are that some of these arrangements had been made.'' The Murdochs shut down the tabloid last week in a futile effort to contain a crisis that has also claimed the careers of two high-ranking police officers and two top News Corporation officials, caused the company to withdraw a much-wanted $12 billion takeover bid of a broadcasting company, and led to the arrests of 10 former News of the World editors and reporters. The hearings (Ms. Brooks appeared separately) provided a gripping spectacle of executives who once commanded unassailable political power enduring sustained questioning from lawmakers enjoying a newfound confidence. There was Rupert Murdoch, looking every bit his age, appearing at times to lose his concentration and sometimes taking so long to answer questions that he seemed not to have heard them at all. There was James Murdoch, his 38-year-old heir apparent, sharp, engaged and seeming alarmed at the prospect that his father would lose his way, quick to leap in when the elder Mr. Murdoch wavered or appeared uncertain. Mr. Murdoch's glamorous wife, Wendi Murdoch, 42, sat directly behind her husband in the visitors' section of the hearing room. At one point, a man suddenly rose from his seat and advanced on Rupert Murdoch, striking him with what appeared to be a pie tin filled with shaving cream, or possibly custard. That caused Mrs. Murdoch to rise from her chair and slug the attacker with a swift right swing. The committee chairman, John Whittingdale, a Consevative member of Parliament, hastily declared a short recess. The attacker was later identified in British news reports as Jonathan May-Bowles, a stand-up comedian. According to The Guardian, he was sending Twitter messages about the incident. ''It is a far better thing that I do now than I have ever done before #splat,'' the attacker apparently wrote, in a homage to ''A Tale of Two Cities,'' just before unleashing the foam. He was escorted from the building in handcuffs. Members of the committee tried their best to get the Murdochs to explain why the company had repeatedly claimed that phone hacking was limited to a single ''rogue'' reporter. The answer, James Murdoch said, was that he had received bad advice -- from his own executives, from the police, from his lawyers, even from the Press Complaints Commission. All had told him, he said, that ''there was no illegality,'' and he said he had no reason to doubt their word. It was a matter of ''deep frustration'' and ''real regret'' that the facts had not emerged sooner, he said. He added that in 2010, when the company became aware of potential new victims after a flurry of civil cases began bubbling through the courts, ''the company immediately went to look at additional records'' and turned over the new evidence to the police. Rupert Murdoch said that as the head of a company with 53,000 employees around the world, he could not have been expected to follow every decision made at The News of the World or even at News International, the News Corporation's British newspaper division. He said that he generally called the editor of The News of the World once a month to ask ''what's doing?'' He tends to call the editor of The Sunday Times ''nearly every Saturday,'' he said, but ''not to influence what he has to say.'' He added: ''If there's an editor I'm most in touch with, it's the editor of The Wall Street Journal, because we're in the same building.'' Asked a series of questions about specific instances of wrongdoing by former News of the World reporters and editors (most of them since arrested), he looked blank and at a loss. When his son tried to come to his rescue, Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament and a persistent Murdoch critic, waved the younger Murdoch off. ''It's your father who's been in charge of corporate governance at News Corp.,'' he said. ''I will come back to you in a moment.'' Jim Sheridan, a Labour member of Parliament, tried to draw out Rupert Murdoch on his relationships with politicians. Why, asked Mr. Sheridan, when he was invited to Downing Street as Prime Minister David Cameron's second visitor after the 2009 general election, did Mr. Murdoch enter through the back door? ''I don't know -- I just did what I was told,'' Mr. Murdoch said. His son interjected: ''I don't think my father had any knowledge of arrangements being made for his entrance or exit from any particular building,'' James Murdoch said. After his apparent frailty early in the session, Rupert Murdoch seemed to gain a certain feistiness and combativeness as the hearing went on. He took the opportunity, for example, to make it clear that he had enjoyed a close relationship with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown as well as with Mr. Cameron. ''I had also been asked in the back door many times by Mr. Brown,'' he said. Both Ms. Brooks and Rupert Murdoch spoke in favor of a free press without government restraint, even as both made it clear that they had suffered a bit at the rough hands of the press themselves in recent days. Ms. Brooks said, for example, that a number of stories making the rounds about her -- that she goes riding with the prime minister, that she owns a horse with him, that they share a piece of property -- were not true. For his part, Mr. Murdoch said that he had not really meant to imply, in response to a question earlier in the month, that his main priority in the crisis was the preservation of Ms. Brooks's career. But, he was asked, didn't he point to her and say ''that one'' when asked the question? He answered on Tuesday: ''I walked outside my flat, and I had 20 microphones stuck in my face, and I don't remember what I said.''  "
"Murdoch, 'Surprised and Shocked,' Is Likely to Face More Questions"," LONDON -- Rupert and James Murdoch said repeatedly during their extended testimony before a parliamentary committee in Britain that their involvement in managing the News Corporation's response to the phone hacking scandal was limited. Rupert Murdoch said he felt let down by ''the people that I trusted and then, maybe the people they trusted.'' Even so, the Murdochs' defense of their roles highlighted several issues that continuing investigations by parliamentary committees and the police are likely to examine in greater detail. Among them: PAYMENTS FOR DEFENSE James Murdoch, the 38-year-old News Corporation deputy chief operating officer who oversees News International, the News Corporation's British subsidiary, told members of Parliament that he was ''as surprised as you are'' to learn that the company had been paying the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire, The News of the World's phone hacking specialist, and Clive Goodman, the tabloid's royal reporter. Both men pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges and went to jail in January 2007. At another point, Murdoch described himself as ''surprised and shocked'' when he was told about the legal aid to the former employees.  The statements were surprising because the legal arrangements are costly for the company. Mr. Mulcaire is now listed as a defendant in 37 phone hacking claims, with more being prepared and filed every week, lawyers say. Mr. Mulcaire has at least one full-time lawyer devoted to defending the crush of civil cases and several others working part time, according to two lawyers with firsthand knowledge of the arrangement. James Murdoch also told Parliament that he did not know how much Mr. Mulcaire's legal fees have cost or whether the payments have stopped. Pressed by members of the committee, Mr. Murdoch seemed open to the idea that the company would stop paying Mr. Mulcaire's legal fees. ''I would like to do that,'' he said. ''I don't know what the status of what we are doing now or what his contract was.'' But both he and Rupert Murdoch said such ''contracts'' could make it difficult to stop the payments. They did not provide more detail about the contracts, including who authorized them or whether they had the ability to terminate them. Since his release from jail in the summer of 2007, Mr. Mulcaire has never spoken publicly about his role in phone hacking -- or what his superiors might have known about his activities. With his wife and five children, Mr. Mulcaire lives in a modest home in Cheam, south of London. For four years, he has steadfastly refused constant requests for comment from the news media and has invoked his right against self-incrimination in every lawsuit. PAYMENTS TO THE POLICE Members of Parliament pressed for more information about whether Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who became Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director at 10 Downing Street, had authorized payments to the police in return for information. Mr. Coulson was arrested on July 8. Both James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks, the former head of News International, were asked about reports that for four years, News International had e-mail evidence that it had handed over for review to the London law firm Harbottle & Lewis that included revelations about payments to the police during Mr. Coulson's time as editor. The firm had been hired to help defend the company against a wrongful termination lawsuit. They both said they had become aware of the incriminating information last spring after executives decided to re-examine the 2007 material given to the law firm as the hacking scandal gained momentum. James Murdoch said he was shown the evidence, and agreed ''immediately'' that it should be turned over to the police. Ms. Brooks said that the discovery occurred in April. However, the company turned over the evidence to the police on June 20. Members of Parliament may also seek to question Les Hinton, who resigned on Friday as publisher of The Wall Street Journal and headed News International during the initial phone hacking inquiry. James Murdoch said he ''can't speak'' to what Mr. Hinton knew when the initial phone hacking review was conducted and had not asked him. In response to these comments by James Murdoch and Ms. Brooks, Harbottle & Lewis issued a statement that suggested it had information that would contradict Mr. Murdoch's account, but they were prevented from sharing it. ''We asked News International to release us from our professional duties of confidentiality in order that we could respond to any inaccurate statements or contentions and to explain events in 2007,'' the managing partner, Glen Atchison, said in the statement. ''News International declined that request, and so we are still unable to respond in any detail as to our advice or the scope of our instructions in 2007, which is a matter of great regret.'' PAYMENTS TO VICTIMS The decision by James Murdoch to authorize a confidential $:725,000 settlement ($1.1 million) in the first hacking lawsuit filed against The News of the World also came under scrutiny. A payment intended to settle the case, filed by the soccer union boss Gordon Taylor, came in June 2008 after News International learned of the evidence that he had managed to pry from Scotland Yard. That included a transcript of one of his voice mails marked ''For Neville,'' an apparent reference to The News of the World's chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. Had that been revealed in court, it would have contradicted News International executives' evidence given to the same House of Commons committee that hacking was limited to one ''rogue'' reporter, Mr. Goodman, the royal reporter. James Murdoch said Tuesday that he had been given an oral briefing on the Taylor case and ''did not get involved directly'' in the negotiations. Asked whether he was aware that hacking was illegal, James Murdoch acknowledged, ''That was my understanding.'' He declined to answer a question, put to him several times, as to whether he would release Mr. Taylor and his lawyers from the confidentiality clause in the agreement so that they might speak publicly about their knowledge of the negotiations. ''It is a confidential agreement,'' he said. Mr. Murdoch also denied that the settlement was motivated by a desire to keep the matter from becoming public. His father said he knew nothing about it until he read about it in July 2009, although he stopped short of naming the newspaper that had first published it (The Guardian). James Murdoch said the decision to settle was a pragmatic one because he had been advised by outside lawyers that his newspaper would lose in a judgment at trial, and damages and legal costs were estimated to run as high as $:500,000 to $:1 million, or $800,000 to $1.6 million. At that time, settlements in privacy violation cases typically ran in the tens of thousands of pounds, and legal fees rarely ran that high, lawyers who handle those cases said. Indeed, when the Formula One boss Max Mosely later won a $:60,000 settlement ($96,000) in a privacy case, it was considered a record payout in such cases.  "
"In Court, Suggestions of Hacking Beyond The News of the World","LONDON -- Front pages across Britain featured pictures of Rupert Murdoch apologizing for phone hacking at The News of the World. But further suggestions that the practice spread beyond his newspaper emerged in a small, nondescript courtroom on Wednesday, even as Prime Minister David Cameron broadened an inquiry into the conduct of the British press. At the Royal Courts of Justice in London, lawyers for the actor Hugh Grant and his former girlfriend, the socialite Jemima Khan -- once the subject of relentless tabloid attention -- mentioned The News of the World and unspecified ''other newspapers'' while demanding police information on Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who was jailed in 2007 for hacking into the phones of royal staff members. It was the first suggestion that Mr. Mulcaire, who had an exclusive contract with The News of the World, might have sold his information to other publications. Those publications were not named in the court proceedings, but the judge referred to ''one or more newspaper proprietors.''  The phone hacking scandal at The News of the World has escalated into a political firestorm because it has swept up not only the tabloid's parent company, the News Corporation, owned by Mr. Murdoch, but also exposed close and questionable ties among the press, Scotland Yard and Britain's political elite. But in Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Cameron said it would be naive to think that phone hacking was limited to Murdoch-owned newspapers. He named members to a panel that will have broad power to force newspaper owners, reporters, politicians and the police to give evidence under oath at public hearings into the culture, practices and ethics of the press. It will be led by Lord Justice Brian Leveson, a prominent judge, and includes former journalists, a civil rights campaigner and a retired law enforcement official. Mr. Cameron was not alone in declaring the need for a broader look at Fleet Street. On Tuesday, a member of Parliament accused the CNN anchor Piers Morgan of phone hacking when he was the editor of The Daily Mirror. Mr. Morgan strenuously denied the accusations and demanded an apology. And last week, news reports showed that the actor Jude Law has brought a hacking lawsuit against The News of the World's sister newspaper, The Sun. Five former journalists at The News of The World's rival Sunday newspaper, The People, run by the Mirror group, said in interviews that they regularly witnessed hacking in that newsroom in the late 1990s to early 2000. ''I don't think anyone quite realized the criminality of it,'' said one former reporter at The People, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A former reporter for the Sunday Mirror, another News of the World rival, described the extensive use of private detectives to obtain personal information. A former senior News of the World editor, Neil Wallis, who has been arrested on unspecified accusations of phone hacking, left The People in 2003 to join the Murdoch tabloid. Nick Fullagar, director of communications for Trinity Mirror, the parent company of The Daily Mirror and The People, said, ''Trinity Mirror's position is clear. Our journalists work within the criminal law and the P.C.C. code of conduct,'' referring to Britain's press regulatory body, the Press Complaints Commission. Within Mr. Murdoch's empire, the flagship daily tabloid The Sun has also been accused of hacking phones. The lawsuit by Mr. Law, filed last month, says that four articles published in 2005 and 2006 were based on intercepted voice mail. The suit does not make clear which articles Mr. Law believes came from phone hacking, and News International, the British subsidiary of the News Corporation, has vehemently denied the accusation. A review of The Sun's Web site, cross-referenced against news archives, shows that five articles from that period that cite phone calls, no source or very vague sources for intimate information about Mr. Law are no longer available on the tabloid's Web site. In an article on April 15, the satirical news magazine Private Eye, which has long pursued accusations of hacking across Fleet Street, linked nine other articles at The Sun between 1998 and 2001 with the phone hacking scandal. The articles, which did not cite sources for celebrity gossip and referred extensively to phone calls, also are not available on The Sun's Web site. ''I print everything out now, just in case it disappears,'' said Adam Macqueen, a journalist at Private Eye who tracks the accusations of hacking at The Sun. Mr. Grant's lawsuit is similar to those filed between 2007 and 2009 that first delved into Mr. Mulcaire's notes to reveal the extent of wrongdoing at The News of the World and were the catalyst for the current headlines. Mr. Grant has played an activist role since the scandal broke, secretly recording a former News of the World journalist talking about how widespread the practice was and then publishing the conversation in the British news magazine The New Statesman in April. Mr. Grant told the BBC that he visited a pub owned by Paul McMullan, a former editor for The News of the World, with his own recording device. Mr. McMullan, he said, told him that ''it wasn't just The News of the World, it was all the tabloids.''  "
News Corp. to Stop Paying Legal Fees of Key Figure in Hacking Case,"LONDON -- Under pressure in the widening phone hacking scandal, the News Corporation on Wednesday said that it would no longer pay the legal fees for the private investigator at the center of the hacking and partly lifted a confidentiality agreement on one of its law firms to allow the firm to give evidence to Parliament and to the police. The two concessions, coming a day after the appearance by Rupert Murdoch and his son James before a fractious parliamentary hearing, may shed further light on the extent of knowledge of the illegal phone hacking among executives inside Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper empire and whether some tried to conceal it. A parliamentary committee report published separately on Wednesday criticized executives for trying to ''deliberately thwart'' a police investigation about phone hacking in 2005 and 2006 that ended with the jailing of the private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire.  The News Corporation said that it was immediately terminating ''any arrangement to pay the legal fees of Glenn Mulcaire,'' who pleaded guilty in 2007 to hacking into the phones of staff members of the royal family while under contract to The News of the World, the News Corporation-owned tabloid shut down by Mr. Murdoch this month. The move to end the arrangement raises the question of whether Mr. Mulcaire will break his long silence over the phone hacking scandal that has engulfed the News Corporation. After refusing to speak publicly for four years since leaving jail about his role or about what his superiors at The News of the World might have known about his practices, within hours of the announcement he appeared in front of television cameras for the BBC outside his home to suggest he might speak soon. ''As you can appreciate, we are in the middle of a number of inquiries at the moment,'' he said. ''It's a very fluid and developing situation. Like I said, the developments have been different from day to day, and I have no further comment to make at this stage. However, this may change.'' His trove of detailed private notes, seized from his home by the police in 2006, is at the core of the widening scandal. Names, numbers and details of phone hacking from the notes have come into public view through legal discovery in the courts, and show an array of victims well beyond the royals including celebrities, government officials and most notably a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and killed in 2002. Mr. Mulcaire himself is now a defendant in 37 lawsuits over phone hacking claims, with more suits being prepared and filed every week. Mr. Mulcaire employs at least one lawyer full time, and several others part time, according to two lawyers with firsthand knowledge of the arrangements, and there have been questions about how he could afford so costly a defense. In the hearing Tuesday, James Murdoch confirmed that the News Corporation was paying Mr. Mulcaire's legal expenses, only for the company to move a day later to end the payments. Mr. Mulcaire could not be reached for further comment. Mr. Murdoch also confirmed payment of legal fees for Clive Goodman, the tabloid's royals reporter who was also jailed in 2007, but the News Corporation did not say Wednesday whether it was ending those payments. Mr. Goodman has since been re-arrested in a new police investigation over allegations of police corruption. The Murdochs repeatedly said in their testimony before Parliament on Tuesday that they had not known about the hacking. In a separate, qualified concession, the News Corporation also announced that it would release the law firm Harbottle & Lewis from some of its client confidentiality requirements so that it could address questions from police and parliamentary inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption with respect to ''what they were asked to do.'' The law firm, which has counted the queen among its clients, was embroiled in the scandal because it reviewed The News of the World e-mail that suggested payments to the police. News International, the News Corporation's British newspaper group, did not turn that information over to the police for four years. A full waiver could open up those files to victims of hacking who are lining up to sue the company. The News Corporation's announcement did not say that the law firm could speak publicly on the matter, nor did it make clear whether the law firm could speak about anything beyond the scope of what it was asked to do. Members of Parliament are particularly interested in learning whether the law firm noticed and flagged the e-mail suggesting the police payments, and if so, which company officials it spoke to about the matter. The firm was hired in 2007 in what the News Corporation described as an internal investigation into hacking. But two company officials with direct knowledge said the firm's mandate was in fact to help the company defend itself in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by Mr. Goodman, the reporter whose arrest with Mr. Mulcaire for hacking the phones of people in the royal household set off the scandal. Mr. Goodman argued that he should not have been fired because hacking was widespread. The company handed over 2,500 e-mails to and from Mr. Goodman to disprove this. The law firm wrote a letter, later given to Parliament as proof that hacking was not widespread, that said it could find no evidence that the practice had spread beyond Mr. Goodman. It has since emerged that e-mail suggested that Andy Coulson, the editor of the paper at the time, had signed off on payments to the police. Mr. Coulson, who subsequently became Prime Minister David Cameron's director of communications, was arrested this month in the scandal. The e-mail resurfaced when executives decided this spring to re-examine the evidence given to the law firm as the hacking scandal escalated. Lord Ken Macdonald, a former director of public prosecutions who was hired by News International to help it re-examine the e-mails, has said that the suggestions of criminality they contained were ''blindingly obvious'' after a review of just ''three to five minutes.'' But the News Corporation appears to be holding firm on another confidentiality agreement that binds a different set of lawyers from talking about negotiations in the first hacking lawsuit filed against The News of the World, settled after James Murdoch authorized a confidential settlement worth about $1.17 million, plus legal fees. Mr. Murdoch has said he was not directly involved in the negotiations over that settlement in 2008, which prevented evidence from becoming public that would have contradicted News International's insistence that hacking was the work of one rogue reporter. Asked whether he would release the hacking victim in that case and his lawyers to speak about their impressions, he told Parliament on Tuesday that ''it is a confidential agreement.'' The House of Commons home affairs select committee report also described ''a catalogue of failures'' by the Metropolitan Police Service in its handling of the hacking investigation. But it said it was almost impossible to escape the conclusion that News International was ''deliberately trying to thwart a criminal investigation.'' ''We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for News International to cooperate with the police,'' it said, as it described in withering terms a web of connections between executives at News International and senior police officers.  "
Cameron Tries to Shore Up Support in Phone Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- It was Prime Minister David Cameron's turn to battle for his reputation, and potentially even his job, in the House of Commons on Wednesday in a debate on the phone hacking scandal that has convulsed Britain. And when the daylong political street fighting with the opposition Labour Party was done, he appeared to have at least steadied support within his own party and, perhaps as important, within the ranks of the Liberal Democrats, his nervous coalition partners. The confrontation in the House of Commons -- a day after appearances before a parliamentary committee by Rupert and James Murdoch, whose News of the World newspaper, now defunct, has been at the heart of the scandal -- capped a difficult period in which the politically agile prime minister appeared to lose his normally assured demeanor, allowing Labour to get ahead of him in putting an end to the Murdochs' bid for Britain's top satellite television company. Mr. Cameron flew back from a shortened trade trip to Africa on Tuesday and worked late into the night preparing for the showdown over revelations about the tabloid that have exposed cozy and sometimes corrupt relations among the press, politicians and the police, and that have crystallized into the most serious crisis of credibility and confidence of his 15 months in office.  As the eight-hour Commons showdown ended, the prime minister appeared to have quieted the worst anxieties in his Conservative Party, whose most powerful backbench group gave him a desk-banging thumbs up. Several Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, emerged from the session to say that the emphasis should be on reforms to rid Britain of the excesses of its tabloids, and not on efforts to topple Mr. Cameron, unless there were new disclosures implicating him in efforts to stifle the police investigation of the issue or to mislead Parliament. Only a week ago, the Liberal Democrats seemed to be edging closer to an alternative compact with the Labour Party that could have threatened the government's survival and its program of harsh spending cuts. Still, with police inquiries into the affair accelerating, posing the potential for further revelations and arrests, Mr. Cameron may, at best, have only stalled the Labour onslaught that has sought to link him to the scandal through his close ties to Mr. Murdoch and two former editors of The News of the World, one of whom was Mr. Cameron's communications chief for nine months. After more than two weeks in which Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, outflanked Mr. Cameron at virtually every turn, the prime minister appeared to hit his stride, coupling incensed denials of personal wrongdoing in the affair with a new, hard-edged attitude toward his former media chief, Andy Coulson, one of 10 people linked to the Murdoch newspapers who has been arrested in the scandal. Showing an edge of bitterness toward a man he was describing only days ago as a friend, Mr. Cameron said that ''with 20-20 hindsight and all that has followed, I would not have offered the job, and I expect that he wouldn't have taken it.'' ''You live and you learn,'' he added, ''and, believe you me, I have learned.'' Mr. Cameron also took on Mr. Miliband, saying that most of the abuses now under investigation within the Murdoch newspapers took place when Labour was in power and that the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had taken no action on evidence that serious wrongdoing had occurred. He also said that Labour's ties with Mr. Murdoch and his executives, and the party's pursuit of Mr. Murdoch's political favor, were more extensive than his own. ''I can assure the House that I've never held a slumber party or seen her in her pajamas,'' Mr. Cameron said, referring to Rebekah Brooks, a onetime editor of The News of the World, who resigned as chief executive of News International, the paper's parent company, late last week. The gibe referred to a gathering Mr. Brown's wife held in 2008 at the prime minister's country retreat, which British newspaper accounts have said was attended by Ms. Brooks; Mr. Murdoch's wife, Wendi; and his daughter Elisabeth. A Daily Mail account said guests were told to bring their pajamas ''for the sort of sleepover usually favoured by teenage girls.'' Mr. Cameron's defense on Wednesday -- and his continuing vulnerability -- rested on two potentially explosive issues. First was why he hired Mr. Coulson only months after Mr. Coulson's 2007 resignation as The News of the World's editor, then took him to Downing Street, in the face of a flurry of private warnings, after the Conservatives won the May 2010 general election. The Coulson hiring had raised eyebrows among many in the Conservative Party and elsewhere because of the jailing in 2007 of the paper's former royalty correspondent and a private investigator for tapping the voice mail messages of Prince William. Mr. Coulson has denied knowledge of the phone hacking, as have all other top editors and executives at the Murdoch papers. The second issue that led to waves of hostile questioning from Labour was what role Mr. Cameron played in the government's initial decision to support Mr. Murdoch's $12 billion bid for British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, Britain's most lucrative satellite television network. The questions were prompted, in part, by Downing Street's acknowledgment last week that Mr. Cameron had met 26 times with Rupert Murdoch and other executives and editors of his British media properties in little over a year in office. Last week, as the scandal ballooned, the government joined Labour and the Liberal Democrats in demanding, successfully, that Mr. Murdoch withdraw the bid, which had been viewed as the boldest, and potentially most rewarding, of all the takeover moves Mr. Murdoch has made in 50 years of building his empire. Under prodding from Labour politicians who listed a number of people who said they had privately warned Mr. Cameron not to take Mr. Coulson into the government, the prime minister replied, ''If anybody had brought me credible information that he knew about the hacking, I would have fired him.'' He added that if it was proved that Mr. Coulson lied to him, the courts and Parliament in denying any knowledge of the phone hacking, then Mr. Coulson should go to jail. On the BSkyB bid, he said he had put a firewall between himself and the government's handling of it, never trespassing into ''inappropriate discussions'' of the bid with Mr. Murdoch and his executives, and leaving decisions on the matter to his culture and media secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Mr. Hunt then rose to support Mr. Cameron by saying that ''the discussions the P.M. had on BSkyB were irrelevant because the person who was making the decision was myself,'' but the statement backfired since it appeared to be the first time any government figure seemed to acknowledge that Mr. Cameron discussed the takeover with the Murdochs. That set off a new round of protests from Labour politicians, who seized on the statement as opening the way for a new line of attack. A statement later by Mr. Hunt's aides, as quoted by the BBC, said that he had been talking about general discussions rather than specific talks with any executives of Mr. Murdoch's company, but the explanation seemed unlikely to put an end to the matter.  "
"Former Editor in Hacking Case, Found Living in Florida, Says He Will Return to Britain","LONDON -- A key figure in Britain's widening phone hacking scandal who had worked as an editor at The News of the World surfaced in Florida on Thursday, saying he was preparing to return to Britain and was talking to the British police. The editor, Greg Miskiw, could provide more details about which executives might have known about the illegal hacking at the Murdoch-owned tabloid and how widespread it was.  Separately, the News Corporation on Thursday announced that it had fired a staff member at The Sun, another newspaper in Rupert Murdoch's British media empire. The company said the editor was fired for his previous work at The News of the World. And in another sign of the pressures faced by News Corporation, one of its papers, The Wall Street Journal, reported Thursday that the United States Justice Department was preparing subpoenas as part of its investigation into the company involving alleged foreign bribery and accusations of hacking into the voicemails of Sept. 11 victims. The editor who emerged Thursday in Florida, Mr. Miskiw, worked on the news desk of The News of the World. His name appears on a contract with Glenn Mulcaire, identified by a pseudonym, the private investigator who worked for the newspaper and was sent to jail in 2007 for hacking the voice mail messages of members of the royal household. The contract has been of great interest to the parliamentary committee investigating the phone hacking. Mr. Miskiw was at The News of the World when Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of the paper's parent company, News International, and Andy Coulson, who later worked for Prime Minister David Cameron, were its editors. Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson are among the people linked to the Murdoch newspapers who have been arrested in the scandal. Mr. Miskiw left The News of the World in 2005 and had been living in Manchester, England, but his recent location had not been known. On Wednesday, The Palm Beach Post said he was living in an apartment in Delray Beach. The revelation caused members of the British news media to descend on Delray Beach, eager to hear what Mr. Miskiw had to say about the hacking at Mr. Murdoch's newspapers. Speaking in front of his apartment on Thursday, he said: ''I am returning to the U.K. voluntarily. My solicitor has been talking to the police for some time now so I have effectively been in touch with the police. They know where I am and they know I am returning. That is all I have to say.'' A former reporter for The News of the World told The New York Times this month that Mr. Miskiw had helped him find the location of a source he was seeking by using a cellphone number. He and another reporter said this was part of a practice known as ''pinging,'' in which technology reserved for the police was used to pinpoint locations based on cellphone towers. The reporter said each request cost $500. On Thursday, Scotland Yard said it was considering looking into the accusations following a request by Jenny Jones, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority, the London police oversight body. Mr. Miskiw did not answer calls for comment. On Wednesday, Mr. Mulcaire, the private investigator at the heart of the scandal, broke his long silence a few hours after the News Corporation said it was terminating its arrangement to pay his legal fees in the 37 lawsuits over phone hacking claims that he now faces. His appearance before the television cameras outside his home in a southern London suburb raised questions about whether he, too, might soon provide more details about whether executives at the News Corporation had covered up the hacking, although he refused to provide immediate comment. He made another statement on Thursday through his lawyer, Sarah Webb of the firm Payne Hicks Beach. Mr. Mulcaire indicated that he was cooperating with the police but that he would not speak publicly to say what he knew about the extent of the hacking until after the police inquiry had ended. News International, the British newspaper division of the News Corporation, paid Mr. Mulcaire's legal fees in the civil cases because he had been under contract with the company and it had accepted liability for him. His legal fees in the original criminal case over the hacking of the phones of members of the royal family, which ended with his going to jail in 2007, had been paid by legal aid. The payments in the civil cases are now due to end, although usually there is a notice period for such contracts. Several former News of the World employees said the person fired by the News Corporation on Thursday was Matt Nixson, the features editor of The Sun who had worked until recently for The News of the World. Mr. Nixson was fired ''because of something found in his e-mails,'' the former employees said. Citing the News Corporation, the BBC reported that he had been fired over allegations of phone hacking. Mr. Nixson has told friends that he did nothing wrong, the former employees said. The program ''Newsnight'' on BBC reported late Thursday that three lawyers representing some of the phone hacking victims had themselves been News of the World targets. One of the lawyers, Mark Lewis, said that ''Newsnight'' had informed him he was a target during the first three months of this year.  "
Ex-Executives Dispute Testimony of Murdoch Son,"LONDON -- Two former News International executives publicly contradicted James Murdoch's testimony to a parliamentary committee, saying Thursday that they told him of evidence in 2008 that suggested that phone hacking at one of the company's tabloid newspapers was more widespread. The former executives said they informed Mr. Murdoch at the time that he was authorizing an unusually large secret settlement of a lawsuit brought by a hacking victim. Mr. Murdoch, who runs the News Corporation's European and Asian operations, including News International, the British subsidiary, told the committee on Tuesday that he agreed to pay $:725,000, which was then about $1.4 million, in the case because it made financial sense. He testified that he was not aware at the time of the evidence, which most likely would have become public had the case proceeded and undermined the company's assertion that hacking was limited to ''a lone rogue reporter.''  But Colin Myler, the former editor of the tabloid, The News of the World, and Tom Crone, the former News International legal manager, said Mr. Murdoch was ''mistaken'' in his testimony delivered to the parliamentary committee. They said he knew when settling the lawsuit brought by a soccer union leader, Gordon Taylor, about a crucial piece of evidence that had been turned over to the company: an e-mail marked ''for Neville'' containing the transcript of a hacked cellphone message, apparently a reference to the paper's chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck. ''In fact, we did inform him of the 'for Neville' e-mail which had been produced to us by Gordon Taylor's lawyers,'' Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone said in the statement released Thursday night. The circumstances surrounding the settlement of the Taylor case are a focus of the parliamentary inquiry because they could shed light on whether there was an effort by News International to obscure the extent of the hacking. It was the first lawsuit brought by a hacking victim, and it came while the company, which owned the tabloid, was reeling from the 2007 guilty pleas of Clive Goodman, the paper's royal reporter, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, for hacking the phones of the royal household. Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone's statement seems to mark a round of finger-pointing, coming days after the testimony of Mr. Murdoch and his father, Rupert, the News Corporation chairman, who testified that he was not to blame for the hacking and was let down by people he trusted. Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone spoke out because they were angered that the company was telling reporters that they had failed to tell James Murdoch about critical facts in the civil lawsuit, three executives said in interviews. In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said, ''I stand by my testimony to the select committee.'' On Tuesday, Mr. Murdoch also told the committee that he ''did not get involved in any of the negotiations directly'' and that the settlement seemed reasonable at the time. Beyond Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone, other News International executives, as well as members of Mr. Taylor's legal team, painted a picture of Mr. Murdoch as being quite engaged in keeping the case from going to trial. They say that the size of the settlement he authorized reflected that. In July 2008, News International's chief financial officer, Clive Milner, was asked to endorse a check for $:725,000. He was not told what it was for -- only that ''the check is for James Murdoch,'' according to a company official with direct knowledge of the matter and an account Mr. Milner has shared with friends. The negotiations were so tightly held that only Mr. Crone, Mr. Myler and Mr. Murdoch knew about them, said two company officials. The officials said that even employees who were typically involved in legal decisions did not learn of the settlement until it leaked in a newspaper. ''I was gobsmacked'' at the amount, said one of them. Mr. Murdoch testified on Tuesday that the size of the settlement reflected a judgment ''by distinguished outside counsel'' that the company was going to lose the case and that potential damages that could run up to about $1.6 million at today's rates. But the $1.4 million settlement was a record amount for a privacy case. At the time, cases involving published stories shown to have violated the privacy of claimants were settling for $6,000 to $24,000, lawyers said. Another factor that made the Taylor settlement unusual was that The News of the World had only prepared, but not published, an article about Mr. Taylor. On July 24, 2008, while the negotiations in the Taylor settlement case were drawing to a close, Max Mosley, a former auto racing executive, won a $120,000 judgment over a front-page article in The News of the World that falsely accused him of engaging in ''sick Nazi orgies.'' That settlement was considered a record at the time. In current hacking cases, News International itself has said any settlement beyond about $160,000 is unreasonable. When Mr. Taylor's legal team began negotiations, the company offered about $99,000. But the figure kept rising as the company was made aware of the evidence that Mr. Taylor's lawyer had obtained by court order. The evidence came from a trove Scotland Yard had seized during the investigation of the hacking of the royal household's phones from the home of Mr. Mulcaire, the private investigator who worked for the tabloid. In addition to the ''for Neville'' e-mail, News International lawyers were also shown a draft of the unpublished article about what was said to have been an affair between Mr. Taylor and his assistant. The article was based on a voice mail left on his phone by the assistant that said, ''Thank you for yesterday.'' In fact, the woman's gratitude was for a speech Mr. Taylor gave at her father's funeral, according to his lawyer, Mark Lewis. Among the evidence made available to News International was an audiotape of Mr. Mulcaire instructing a reporter on how to hack phone messages. It turned out that the reporter worked for another newspaper, but at the time, company executives believed he worked for them, said one executive. The turning point in negotiations came in April 2008 after a judge ordered Mr. Mulcaire, in open court, to identify ''Neville'' and the reporter whose voice was heard on the audiotape. That is when News International increased the offer to about $798,000 for Mr. Taylor and $648,000 for legal costs, according to three people with direct knowledge of the talks. The legal fees represented 100 percent of the amount requested by Mr. Taylor's legal team, which occurs only rarely in such cases, the three people said. ''It very quickly became silly money,'' said a person with knowledge of the negotiations. Indeed, counting News International's own legal bills, the total cost to the company exceeded the $1.6 million figure, at today's exchange rates, that Mr. Murdoch testified he worried the company would have to pay if the case went to trial. After Mr. Murdoch insisted that he knew nothing about the underlying facts, Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament, said to him on Tuesday, ''But you paid an astronomical sum, and there was no reason to.'' Mr. Murdoch told the committee that he thought it was ''simply a matter'' relating to Mr. Goodman's actions, and that he acted on the advice of both Mr. Myler and his counsel. Pressed about his lack of knowledge -- at one point Adrian Sanders, a Liberal Democrat member of Parliament, asked him if he ''was familiar with the term willful blindness'' -- Mr. Murdoch explained that he had only just taken over the News Corporation's Europe and Asia operations when he was advised, in early 2008, to settle the case. He said that even with the benefit of hindsight, he would do it again, but added that ''if I knew that what we know now,'' he would also have contacted the police and ''moved faster to get to the bottom of these allegations.''

Murdoch Papers May Lose Exclusive Access to 2012 Athletes,"Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers could lose exclusive access to the country's athletes as they prepare for next year's Summer Games in London because of the phone-hacking scandal that led to the closing of the tabloid The News of the World and testimony before Parliament by Murdoch and his son James.  ''The shuttering of The News of the World means that the terms of the contract could no longer be fulfilled,'' said Andrew Owen, a spokesman for Team 2012, which raises money for British Olympians. He said that the media partnership with Team 2012 and News International, the unit of the News Corporation that owns the newspapers, had not been terminated. Owen said that News International could ''explore remedies'' for its deal with its other newspapers -- The Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun. But it was unclear how much leeway Team 2012 has contractually to end the deal, with The News of the World gone, and seek a new media sponsor. It is also not known how vigorously News International will fight to retain the deal as it copes with the phone-hacking scandal, which has embroiled not only the company but also Scotland Yard. A spokeswoman for News International declined to comment. Team 2012 is a joint venture of the British Olympic Association, the London Olympic organizing committee, the British Paralympic Association and UK Sport. The presenting sponsor of the fund-raising organization is Visa, which is also a worldwide Olympic sponsor. The deal between Team 2012 and News International involved all four of its newspapers, which were all entitled to carry the slogan ''Official Newspaper of Team 2012.'' But the potency of the partnership with News International was diminished by the loss of The News of the World's 2.7 million Sunday circulation. According to a news release last January that announced Team 2012's partnership with News International, the four newspapers were part of a campaign to help the British public ''get behind each of the athletes, their sports and their personal stories.'' At the time, Rebekah Brooks, who was the chief executive of News International, offered a reason for the company's interest in the deal. ''This unique partnership gives our newspapers unrivaled access to the Team 2012 athletes,'' she said, ''and means we will be able to throw our full support behind the team and give our readers the inside track.'' Brooks, who was the editor of The News of the World when the phone-hacking abuses began in 2002, has resigned from the company and testified before Parliament, along with the Murdochs.  "
"Pressure on James Murdoch, Already Rising, Is About to Intensify","LONDON -- After his testimony in Parliament was challenged by two former senior employees and referred by a lawmaker to Scotland Yard for investigation, James Murdoch has come under rising pressure in Britain's phone hacking scandal that is likely to intensify this week. The board of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite broadcaster of which Mr. Murdoch is chairman, convenes on Thursday for the first time since the scandal erupted, as regulators continue their inquiry into whether the hacking scandal means the broadcaster should continue to be considered ''fit and proper'' to hold a broadcasting license. A day later, members of the parliamentary committee investigating the scandal are to meet to consider whether to ask for more information from Mr. Murdoch and whether to call him and former executives back in front of them to answer additional questions. Some former senior executives of News International who until recently held powerful positions in the News Corporation's British subsidiary and were privy to internal deliberations have indicated that they believe Mr. Murdoch knew more about widespread phone hacking at The News of the World than he indicated in his public testimony. If they continue to challenge Mr. Murdoch's account, it could damage his effort to protect his own reputation and that of the parent company run by his father, Rupert.  ''It now seems to be everyone for themselves,'' said Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of Parliament who has been a prominent critic of News International. ''The edifice is cracking; they're all fighting like rats in a sack.'' Last week, the two former executives, Colin Myler, who was editor of The News of the World until it closed this month, and Tom Crone, the former legal manager for News International, accused him of making ''mistaken'' statements to Parliament in his testimony on Tuesday. A third, Jon Chapman, News International's director of legal affairs until this month, said in a statement last week he was also preparing to cooperate fully with the Parliament investigation and wanted to correct ''serious inaccuracies'' in the evidence given by Mr. Murdoch to lawmakers. Mr. Murdoch issued a statement insisting he stood by his remarks. Mr. Murdoch could also face a challenge from another source, according to several lawyers and executives with knowledge of the proceedings. The source is an outside attorney who was also privy to discussions surrounding a confidential settlement to a phone hacking victim in 2008, which Mr. Murdoch approved, according to several lawyers with knowledge of the proceedings. Mr. Murdoch said he had relied on ''outside counsel'' in settling that case. One of the lawyers providing outside counsel was Julian Pike, a partner of the London firm Farrer & Company, the queen's lawyers. Mr. Pike, who is on sabbatical until Sept. 5, was at times directly engaged in discussions with the lawyers for the soccer union leader Gordon Taylor, who was the first victim of phone hacking to sue News International, the lawyers and executives said. File notes that Mr. Pike took of his internal discussions with News International executives during 2008 could be pursued by Scotland Yard as part of a criminal inquiry, said two officials with knowledge of the police inquiry. ''So far, it's two against one,'' said a lawyer with first-hand knowledge of the proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to Mr. Crone's and Mr. Myler's word about the negotiations against Mr. Murdoch. ''But if two more lawyers step forward to contradict Mr. Murdoch's evidence, it would raise even more profound questions.'' Mr. Pike and several of his assistants did not return repeated messages asking for comment. News International would not comment on whether it was prepared to lift client confidentiality restrictions on Mr. Pike or Farrer & Company, as it has with another outside law firm used, so they could speak to the police and Parliament. Mr. Murdoch told the committee that he relied on the advice of ''outside counsel'' when he agreed to settle the case brought by Mr. Taylor for $:725,000, which was then about $1.4 million, a settlement that was far beyond what privacy violation cases were being settled for at the time. Most were being settled for $:3,000 to $:12,000, lawyers with knowledge of such cases said. In Mr. Taylor's case, The News of the World did not even publish a story about him based on the information gleaned from hacked messages, lawyers have said. Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament, said Sunday that he had written to Scotland Yard to look into the conflicting accounts of internal News International discussions surrounding the confidential settlement in 2008 to determine whether there was a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in the settlement of Mr. Taylor's lawsuit. Oversize payments to conceal evidence of a crime by confidentially settling a lawsuit could run afoul of the law, Mr. Watson said. Prior to settling the lawsuit by Mr. Taylor, the company was shown evidence that appeared to implicate another reporter in phone hacking. At the time, the company repeatedly emphasized in public that the hacking had been the work of one rogue reporter, who had been convicted for intercepting the voice mail messages of the royal family. Mr. Watson addressed his letter to Sue Akers, the Scotland Yard chief leading the two police inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption. In his testimony last week, Mr. Murdoch acknowledged that he was aware that hacking was a crime. However, he said he was never told that underlying evidence in the case implicated an additional reporter at the tabloid. He emphasized that he thought the evidence related to Clive Goodman, the former royal reporter, who had already been jailed, and therefore pointed only to an old crime that had been adjudicated. Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone, however, said that Mr. Murdoch was ''mistaken'' and had been shown the underlying evidence in the case. That evidence included an e-mail with transcriptions of Mr. Taylor's voice mail messages marked ''for Neville''; the only Neville at the newspaper was Neville Thurlbeck, The News of the World's chief reporter, who has since been arrested in the hacking investigation. Another key piece of evidence was an audiotape, in which Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who was also involved in hacking at The News of the World, is heard coaching an unnamed reporter on how to hack Mr. Taylor's cellphone. The judge in the case, Justice Vos, ordered Mr. Mulcaire to identify the reporter on the tape and the ''Neville'' named in the document. Within days of making that order in June 2008, lawyers for News International quickly settled the lawsuit and insisted on confidentiality of the settlement's terms. And neither the reporter nor Mr. Thurlbeck was identified. Mr. Murdoch also said he thought the $:725,000 payout to Mr. Taylor, believed to be a record amount many times over at the time, was reasonable. Mr. Watson has asked members of the Parliamentary committee holding hearings into the matter to recall Mr. Murdoch. He also has requested that Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone be called. He said the committee meets on Friday and a decision will be made then. When Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone contradicted Mr. Murdoch on Thursday, it was significant because it marked the first time former News International executives had contradicted a senior executive's evidence. Both Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler have testified previously about the settlement before the same select committee that Mr. Murdoch appeared before on Tuesday. Mr. Chapman was involved in settling the unfair dismissal suit brought by Mr. Goodman in 2007. He also reviewed the trove of internal e-mails between Mr. Goodman and some senior staff members that were forwarded to an external London law firm, Harbottle & Lewis, representing News International. Last December, Mr. Pike said in a statement to the High Court that these e-mails could no longer be retrieved because they were more than six months old. But in March he apologized, saying he had been misinformed by Mr. Crone, who had told him that he had also been misled. The e-mails have since been given to the police.  "
"More Than Kin, and Less Than Kind","Stephen Marche is the author of ''How Shakespeare Changed Everything.''  AT the hearing into the News of the World phone hacking scandal in London this past Tuesday, the commissioner of Scotland Yard did something unusual for a policeman. He quoted Shakespeare. Explaining the swiftness of his resignation, he mangled a bit of Macbeth: ''If 'twere best it were done, 'twere well it were done quickly.'' The reference was perfectly fitting for a scandal whose defining adjective is coming to be ''Shakespearean.'' Many have noted superficial similarities between the scandal and Shakespearean tragedy: overheard messages, hired thugs. There's a hashtag sprawling through Twitter: #shakespeare4murdoch. (My favorite so far: ''remorse, remorse, my kingdom for remorse.'')  Usually comparisons between events in the news and Shakespeare are strained, cropping up with each downfall of a prominent public figure. Eliot Spitzer slept with a hooker. He is not Marc Antony. Tony Hayward, formerly of BP, is not Julius Caesar. Neither is Dominique Strauss-Kahn an aging version of Prince Hal. But in the case of Rupert Murdoch, the comparison is, for once, accurate: the scandal is exactly like a Shakespearean tragedy, in specific and profound ways. The great Shakespeare tragedies fuse crises in families and in states, connecting the most significant historical events with the most delicate psychological realities. In ''King Lear,'' a family squabble about a retiree can be rectified only by a full-scale invasion by France. In ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' the fate of the Roman Empire hinges on a man who likes his Egyptian mistress more than his family. In ''Hamlet,'' Shakespeare makes it clear that Claudius is a capable ruler, but because he has killed his brother and married his brother's wife, the state must fall. The corruption within a family matters more to the health or disease of government than any policy matter. The domestic has always mingled with the political for the Murdochs as well. The children have occupied different outposts of the empire. Rupert Murdoch's marriage to Wendi Deng Murdoch was supposed to open access to Chinese media markets. (On Tuesday, defending her husband against a pie-wielding protester, she provided instead a sweet right hook.) But the real scandal in Britain is how far a modern democracy came to resemble a family. Hacking into a murdered girl's voice mail is grotesque, but the coziness of everyone involved is the bigger danger to society. Perhaps the most damaging revelation about Prime Minister David Cameron is that he had dinner over the Christmas holiday last year at the home of the former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks (often described as another Murdoch daughter) along with Mr. Murdoch's son James. The corrupting power of such connections is one of the core anxieties in Shakespeare's great tragedies. ''Lear'' shows a king dividing his kingdom on the basis of his daughters' love. Goneril and Regan are happy to play the game, but Cordelia refuses to exaggerate her love for her father in order to procure power. Later, the bastard Edmund, after betraying his father in an attempt to take his title, seduces both Goneril and Regan -- the ultimate incestuous political order. Family should not act like politicians, and vice versa. The Murdoch drama is now entering its fifth act, the part when the bodies start to pile up. At the hearing before a parliamentary committee, Mr. Murdoch interrupted his son near the beginning of the proceedings to say: ''This is the most humble day of my life.'' His native Australian optimism may be misleading him, however. The mood in Britain seems to desire nothing less than his complete destruction. Everything he cherishes must be sacrificed. The paper. The BSkyB deal. Rebekah Brooks. Possibly his son's takeover of the company. We go to tragedy to watch a man be destroyed. Macbeth must be destroyed for his lust for power, Othello for his jealousy, Antony for his passion, Lear for the incompleteness of his renunciation. They are tragic precisely because their flaws are all too human. We do not yet know how far Mr. Murdoch is implicated in the crimes of his company, so we do not know which of Shakespeare's tragic heroes he resembles most. If he didn't know the extent of the phone hacking, then he's most like the bungling Richard II, who fails to spot the decay within his kingdom. If he did know, then he's more like the conniving Richard III, whose love of the machinations of power eventually grinds him into the machinery he's created. Regardless, Mr. Murdoch's distinguishing flaw is common ambition -- an outsider's desire to force his way into the establishment. He has been singled out because his flaw is so ordinary, so widespread. Putting aside for a moment the complicity of every single reader of The News of the World, nearly all journalists and politicians played the same game, only Mr. Murdoch played it better. One of the most profound feelings that follows watching a Shakespearean tragedy, once we have witnessed the destruction we crave, is how empty the world seems. The tension of tragedy lays bare a part of our hypocrisy that we should at least recognize in the case of Rupert Murdoch: Maybe he is a monster. Maybe he needs to be punished. But he is being destroyed because we cannot stand seeing ourselves, whether on stage or before Parliament. Correction: July 26, 2011, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Op-Ed article on Monday about the similarities between the Murdoch scandal and Shakespearean tragedies incorrectly described Claudius's actions in ''Hamlet.'' Claudius has married his brother's wife -- not his brother's sister.  "
James Murdoch's Future at Stake as BSkyB Board Meets,"LONDON -- The phone hacking scandal riling the British political and media worlds has posed a significant challenge to British Sky Broadcasting, the lucrative satellite television network that has long been the centerpiece of Rupert Murdoch's European ambitions. On Thursday, BSkyB's board will meet for the first time since the outcry over phone hacking by one of Mr. Murdoch's tabloid newspapers forced his News Corporation to drop its bid to buy the 61 percent of outstanding shares in the network that it does not already own. The future of BSkyB's broadcasting license and the fate of its current chairman, Mr. Murdoch's son James, are on the line, analysts said.  ''The biggest issue is whether James Murdoch is to remain chairman,'' said Steve Liechti, an analyst at Investec Securities in London. ''Given the issues going on with News Corp. and James Murdoch's position within that business, it may be seen that it is not appropriate.'' The meeting comes as Ofcom, the British broadcasting regulator, proceeds with inquiries into whether BSkyB remains ''fit and proper'' to hold a broadcasting license because of the scandal unfolding at the News Corporation. BSkyB's share price has dropped 14 percent since the latest phase of the affair erupted this month. Several former employees of News International, the News Corporation's British newspaper empire, have been arrested in the investigations into telephone voice mail hacking and corruption at The News of the World, which Mr. Murdoch shuttered this month. James Murdoch, who is head of the News Corporation's European operations, which include News International and BSkyB, approved a $:725,000 settlement (about $1.1 million) to a hacking victim in 2008. In Parliament last week, he denied he was ever told that underlying evidence in the case implicated a second reporter at the tabloid, in addition to one convicted in 2007, although two former senior executives of News International have questioned his testimony. Executives at BlackRock, BSkyB's largest shareholder after the News Corporation with a 7.7 percent stake, and other large shareholders declined to comment about the matter, citing company policies not to speak to the news media about their holdings. But some smaller shareholders and corporate governance experts have expressed concerns about the board structure at BSkyB and have raised questions about whether Mr. Murdoch should stay as chairman. A BSkyB spokesman would not say whether the scandal or Mr. Murdoch's position would be discussed at Thursday's board meeting. ''The company is very committed to good governance,'' the spokesman said. A spokeswoman for the News Corporation offered no comment. Theo Blackwell, a councilor for London's Camden district, whose public pension fund invests in BSkyB, said he has requested a review of the investment. Paul Myners, Britain's former government minister for financial services, said BSkyB's 14-member board urgently needs a change because ''a significant number'' -- four members -- have been directors for more than nine years. Four others are on the News Corporation payroll. Mr. Myners said Mr. Murdoch probably should remain on the board but not as chairman. ''Most corporate problems can be traced back to poor corporate governance and this company falls short in that respect,'' he said. Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which offers independent advice to institutional investors, has advised BSkyB shareholders to urge that James Murdoch be replaced. ''His relationship to the controlling shareholder clearly compromises his independence,'' said Alan MacDougall, the firm's managing director. ''Questionable governance practices have been tolerated at BSkyB for a long time, and unfortunately many shareholders have not effectively challenged them. That must change. ''In light of current events, it is time for the board to review whether BSkyB and its shareholders would benefit from a new, independent chair,'' Mr. MacDougall said. At least three shareholders in BSkyB voted against James Murdoch's appointment in 2008: Aviva, Legal & General and Co-operative Asset Management, money managers whose BSkyB investments are mainly part of an index-linked fund. ''There were concerns about him being named and the way he was parachuted in,'' said one of these investors, speaking on condition of anonymity because he prefers not to discuss the issues with the news media. ''These concerns remain.'' Co-operative, which owns a 0.003 percent stake in BSkyB and a 0.1 percent stake in the News Corporation, said in an e-mailed statement that ''radical reform'' was needed at both companies but especially at the News Corporation, ''and indeed in the newspaper industry in the U.K., to stamp out the kind of illegal and grossly invasive practices that are alleged.'' Julian Franks, a finance professor at London Business School, said: ''The board's independent directors have to ask themselves'' what happens if James Murdoch resigns and none of Rupert Murdoch's other children can get into the job? ''Murdoch might think, 'What's the point in me being in that business,' '' and could sell his BSkyB investment, which would hurt the share price, Mr. Franks said. In a letter to lawmakers last week, Ed Richards, Ofcom chief executive, said its judgment on whether BSkyB was fit and proper to hold a broadcasting license did not depend on criminal convictions in the case. A spokesman for Ofcom, Ed Taylor, said the concept of ''fit and proper'' had no fixed definition and it was the regulator's responsibility to interpret it. There was no timeline for ending its inquiries.  "
BSkyB Board Is Said to Keep James Murdoch as Chairman,"LONDON -- James Murdoch won unanimous backing from British Sky Broadcasting's board on Thursday for his role as chairman despite the phone hacking scandal that has roiled the News Corporation, his family's media empire. The board of British Sky Broadcasting, a satellite television company known as BSkyB, discussed Mr. Murdoch's role ''at length'' and decided he should keep the job, said a person with direct knowledge of the decision. The board planned to closely monitor developments linked to the phone hacking scandal, said the person, who declined to be identified because the meeting was private. It was the first time BSkyB's 14-member board had met since a public and political outcry over phone hacking at The News of the World, the now shuttered tabloid, forced the News Corporation, the global media company controlled by Mr. Murdoch's father, Rupert Murdoch, to withdraw its offer for the rest of BSkyB.  The News Corporation owns a 39 percent stake in BSkyB. The board meeting had been initially scheduled to discuss BSkyB's annual earnings, which are to be released on Friday, but the phone hacking scandal had obliged it to also address the question of whether James Murdoch should stay on as chairman. James and Rupert Murdoch faced angry questions from British lawmakers this month about how much they knew about phone hacking practices at The News of the World. Keeping James Murdoch on the board of BSkyB, one of the best-performing and most important parts of the News Corporation's British business, is essential to the Murdoch family's media empire, some analysts said. James Murdoch runs the News Corporation's European operations, which include the BSkyB stake and News International, the newspaper group that published The News of the World. He is also the News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer. Pressure on James Murdoch intensified last week when two former News International executives contradicted testimony he had given to a parliamentary committee. The executives said that in 2008 they had made Mr. Murdoch aware of evidence that suggested phone hacking at The News of the World was more widespread. Mr. Murdoch denied he had ever been told that underlying evidence in the case implicated more than one reporter at the tabloid. James Murdoch became chairman of BSkyB's board, which also includes three other members who are on the News Corporation's payroll, at the end of 2007, amid opposition from some institutional investors and pension funds. Some shareholders criticized the election process and said they would have preferred a chairman who was not linked to BSkyB's biggest shareholder. Lorna Tilbian, an analyst at Numis Securities in London, said James Murdoch's support among BSkyB's board members did not come as a surprise. ''He's done a good job as BSkyB's chairman, and it's innocent until proven guilty,'' Ms. Tilbian said. The phone hacking scandal might affect BSkyB in other ways. Ofcom, the British broadcasting regulator, is proceeding with inquiries into whether BSkyB remains ''fit and proper'' to hold a broadcasting license because of the hacking scandal still unfolding at the News Corporation. The scandal took a toll on BSkyB's share price because some investors were concerned that new investigations into phone hacking and bribery allegations could distract management. BSkyB's shares slumped 16 percent from their peak this month. The shares remained unchanged at 7.2 pounds in London on Thursday. BSkyB's board also discussed whether to either pay a special dividend or buy back its own shares to compensate BSkyB shareholders, which includes the News Corporation, for the recent drop in the share price.  "
Murdoch Tabloid May Have Hacked Phone of Woman Whose Cause It Championed,"LONDON -- Britain was awash in a new surge of outrage over the phone hacking scandal on Thursday as news emerged that Scotland Yard had added to the list of probable victims a woman whose 8-year-old daughter was murdered by a repeat sex offender in 2000. The tabloid at the center of the scandal, The News of the World, aggressively championed the campaign of the grieving mother, Sara Payne, for a law warning parents if child sex offenders lived nearby. Mrs. Payne had written warmly of the paper in its final issue, calling it ''an old friend.'' A statement released on behalf of Mrs. Payne by the Phoenix Foundation, a children's charity she founded, described her as devastated and disappointed.  ''Today is a very sad dark day for us,'' the charity added in a posting on Facebook. ''Our faith in good people has taken a real battering.'' Other postings noted that she was struggling in light of the July 1 anniversary of her daughter's abduction and from the effects of a stroke she suffered 19 months ago, which paralyzed her left side. The Guardian was the first to report Scotland Yard's alert to Mrs. Payne, but the e-mail newsletter Popbitch suggested earlier this month that Mrs. Payne's voice mail had been hacked and that the phone in question might have been provided to her by Rebekah Brooks, then the editor of The News of the World. In a statement, Ms. Brooks confirmed that The News of the World had provided Mrs. Payne with a cellphone ''for the last 11 years'' as part of the campaign for the law, but said that ''it was not a personal gift.'' She said that she found the allegations that Mrs. Payne's voice mail had been hacked ''abhorrent and particularly upsetting, as Sara Payne is a dear friend.'' In recent testimony on the scandal in Parliament, Ms. Brooks cited the measure named after Mrs. Payne's daughter, Sarah's Law, as evidence of the good she had done in her years at the tabloid's helm. Ms. Brooks was The News of the World's editor during periods when hacking appeared to have been widespread, but has maintained she knew nothing of it. She stepped down July 15 from her executive role at News International, the British arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and the owner of The News of the World, and was later arrested on suspicion of phone hacking and payments to the police. The company issued a brief statement on Thursday that said: ''News International takes this matter very seriously and is deeply concerned like everyone. As the facts are established, the Company and the independent Management and Standards Committee will take all appropriate actions, including cooperating fully with any potential criminal enquiries or civil proceedings which may arise.'' Scotland Yard officers told Mrs. Payne that details about her were among the papers held by the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, according to the Phoenix Foundation statement. Mr. Mulcaire, who had an exclusive contract with the tabloid, had a list of about 4,000 potential targets and was convicted on hacking charges related to the paper five years ago. The hacking scandal had been smoldering for years, but ignited in recent weeks after assertions that hacking on behalf of The News of the World had interfered with the investigation into the 2002 murder of a 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler. The man eventually convicted of her killing committed two more murders before he was caught. More revelations appear imminent. Members of Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee said Thursday that they would gather this week to discuss whether to call further witnesses in their inquiries into the scandal and an alleged cover-up by News International. On Aug. 8, previously unseen documents relating to hacking from News International as well as a portion of Mr. Mulcaire's documents held by the police will be released to those who have filed lawsuits. On Aug. 10, the News Corporation -- which has been bolstering its stock price with buybacks -- will announce its quarterly results. In central London on Thursday, the British judge leading the inquiry into the scandal held a news conference, saying that the panel planned to hold its first public hearings in September and that it would have the power to compel witnesses to testify. An initial phase will focus on press regulation and the relationship between the press and the public, said the judge, Lord Justice Leveson. A second, which will begin after the current police investigation is finished, will focus on specific allegations of phone hacking and other journalistic malfeasance. Justice Leveson was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron after it became clear that hacking at The News of the World extended not only to public figures like celebrities and politicians, but also to Milly Dowler and possibly to the families of those killed in terrorist attacks. Mr. Cameron, a Conservative, initially resisted setting up an immediate inquiry, but changed his mind in response to widespread public disgust and growing political pressure from the opposition Labour Party. One of the issues the judge will consider is the coziness of the ties between politicians and the news media -- particularly the relationship between lawmakers and editors and executives at News International. In another sign of how far in British public life News International's influence extends -- or has extended, until now -- it emerged last week that Justice Leveson himself attended two parties last year at the home of Elisabeth Murdoch, a daughter of Mr. Murdoch's, and her husband, Matthew Freud, a powerful public relations executive. Justice Leveson said that because he and the rest of the inquiry panel -- which includes former journalists and a former high-ranking police officer, among others -- had been chosen for their experience, it was inevitable that ''there are such contacts or links, and there should be no apology for this.'' He added: ''Had I had the slightest doubt about my own position, I would not have accepted the appointment, and I also make it clear that I am satisfied that what the panelists have said creates no conflict of interest for them or me.'' In another development that might spell trouble for News International, Tim Godwin, the temporary chief of Scotland Yard, told a committee of lawmakers at City Hall that a new inquiry would most likely be opened into the 1987 ax murder of a private investigator. The case has become newly relevant in light of revelations that Scotland Yard told Ms. Brooks in 2003 that it had evidence that one of her editors at The News of the World had hired people to conduct surveillance of the lead investigating police officer in the case. She was told that there was evidence that the surveillance was ordered as a favor to the chief suspects, Jonathan Rees and Sidney Fillary, investigators who had worked for the tabloid. Efforts to bring them to trial have fallen apart repeatedly.  "
BSkyB Plans Dividend Increase and a Share Buyback,"7:51 p.m. Updated LONDON - British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company partly owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, said on Friday that it would buy back some of its own shares and increase its dividend to compensate investors.  BSkyB, as the company is also known, said it planned a share buyback worth 750 million, or $1.2 billion, and would return another 253 million to shareholders through a final dividend of 14.54 pence a share. BSkyB's shares have fallen more than 15 percent since the News Corporation dropped its bid earlier this month for the 61 percent of BSkyB it did not own because of political opposition after the growing phone hacking scandal at one of the company's British tabloid newspapers. The News Corporation plans to participate in the share buyback, meaning its 39 percent stake in BSkyB will not increase. BSkyB also said its board unanimously voted in favor of keeping James R. Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son and a senior executive at the News Corporation, in his job as chairman of BSkyB's board. It was the board's first meeting since the News Corporation was forced to abandon its BSkyB bid. ''It was obviously a very full discussion,'' BSkyB's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said in a conference call. ''At the end of that, the board was unanimous in its support for James to continue as chairman.'' Pressure on James Murdoch and BSkyB's board to replace him had mounted ever since new allegations emerged about phone hacking at the British tabloid The News of the World, which fell under James Murdoch's purview at the News Corporation. Mr. Darroch told the BBC in an interview on Friday that James Murdoch ''got strong support'' at BSkyB. He added that judging by his work at BSkyB, ''he always acted with the highest degree of integrity.'' But some shareholders, including large British pension funds, have criticized BSkyB's choice of chairmen in the past, saying they would prefer a chairman who was not directly linked to the company's largest shareholder, the News Corporation. There were signs that the phone hacking scandal also hurt other parts of the Murdoch media empire beyond The News of the World, which was closed. The Times of London lost some subscribers in the immediate aftermath of the phone hacking scandal, James Harding, editor of the newspaper told the BBC on Wednesday. ''We saw small numbers of people canceled their digital subscription or print subscription,'' Mr. Harding said. ''Those have largely come back.'' BSkyB, which owns several satellite channels, said Friday that operating profit for the full year that ended in June rose 23 percent, to 1.07 billion ($2.8 billion) from 872 million a year earlier. That beat the average 1.06 billion in profit forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. BSkyB's shares slipped 0.6 percent in London on Friday. ''Recent hysteria may have affected the share price,'' Richard Hunter at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London wrote in a note to clients. ''But the underlying business remains defiantly strong.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Phone Hacker Points Finger at Paper,"The private investigator who went to prison for his role in the phone hacking scandal at The News of the World said Friday that he had acted on instructions from the newspaper.  The investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, was imprisoned in 2007 after the British authorities discovered that he had gained access to voice mail messages on telephones belonging to members of the royal family and others who were the subjects of articles in The News of the World. Senior officials at the newspaper's parent company, News International, a British unit of the News Corporation, insisted for years that the hacking scandal was essentially limited to Mr. Mulcaire and a ''rogue'' reporter with whom he worked, Clive Goodman, who was also imprisoned. But on Friday, lawyers for Mr. Mulcaire released a statement in which they said that he had been ''effectively employed by News of the World'' and specifically acted on the instructions of others at the paper. ''Any suggestion that he acted in such matters unilaterally is untrue,'' the statement said. ''In the light of the ongoing police investigation, he cannot say any more.'' A phone call to the News Corporation seeking comment on Friday night was not immediately returned.  "
2007 Letter Clearing a Tabloid Comes Under Scrutiny,"LONDON -- When a Parliamentary committee first confronted The News of the World with charges of phone hacking in 2007, the paper's owners produced a reassuring, one-paragraph letter from a prominent London law firm named Harbottle & Lewis. The firm had been hired to review the e-mail of the tabloid's royal reporter, who had pleaded guilty to hacking the cellphone messages of royal household staff members. The letter said senior editors were not aware of the reporter's ''illegal actions,'' which helped convince lawmakers that hacking was not endemic at the tabloid. That letter has taken on new significance since it emerged in recent weeks that those e-mails, while not pointing to wider knowledge of hacking, did contain indications of payoffs to the police by journalists in exchange for information. The circumstances behind the writing of that single paragraph are being examined as part of criminal and parliamentary inquiries into whether the tabloid's parent company, News International, the British subsidiary of the News Corporation, engineered a four-year cover-up of information suggesting criminal wrongdoing.  In interviews, two people familiar with both the contents of the e-mails and the discussions between the executives and the law firm provided new details about the possible payoffs. The two people also indicated that both News International and the firm were aware of the information when the reassuring letter was written, yet defined their task as addressing only the hacking issue. In one e-mail, from 2003, the paper's royal reporter, Clive Goodman, complained to the top editor, Andy Coulson, about a management push to cut back on cash payments to sources, saying he needed to pay his contacts in the Scotland Yard unit that protects the royal family. In another e-mail, Mr. Goodman said that he did not want to go into detail about cash payments because everyone involved could ''go to prison for this,'' according to the two people who described the e-mail's contents. The two people also said that in the exchange of e-mails, Mr. Goodman requested permission from Mr. Coulson to pay $:1,000 for a classified Green Book directory, which had been stolen by a police officer in the protection unit. The book contains the private phone numbers of the queen, the royal family and their closest friends and associates -- a potentially useful tool for hacking. In the years since the letter was written, various revelations have confirmed that phone hacking was endemic at the tabloid. Evidence disclosed in the past several weeks of widespread payoffs to the police have given rise to a second, and potentially more potent, front in the scandal. Both Harbottle & Lewis and News International took notice of the e-mails to and from Mr. Goodman containing those initial indications of payoffs in 2007, according to the two people knowledgeable about the events. News International's chief lawyer set them aside for a second look, and they were among the e-mails retained in the files of the law firm. Yet they were not turned over to the police until last month, and no hint of their existence made its way into the firm's single-paragraph letter four years ago. The two people familiar with internal discussions between News International and the firm, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the criminal investigations, said company executives urged Harbottle & Lewis to write a letter giving News International a clean bill of health in the strongest possible terms. The firm had been hired to defend the paper after Mr. Goodman sued, claiming his dismissal over phone hacking was unfair because it was widely known that others were doing it, too. The firm was asked to examine 2,500 e-mails involving Mr. Goodman to defend against his claim that superiors knew about his hacking. The correspondence between the company and the firm over framing the letter does not make reference to the e-mails on police payments, a source familiar with the exchanges said, but it does reflect ''huge anxiety'' about the wording. The final version of the letter, dated May 29, 2007, sent by the firm's managing partner to Jon Chapman, who was head of the legal department for News International, read: ''I can confirm that we did not find anything in those e-mails which appeared to us to be reasonable evidence that Clive Goodman's illegal actions were known about and supported by both or either of Andy Coulson, the editor, and Neil Wallis, the deputy editor, and/or that Ian Edmondson, the news editor, and others were carrying out similar procedures.'' The company rejected earlier drafts by Harbottle & Lewis that were not as broad, according to the two people with access to the correspondence. One of them said that lawyers on both sides seemed to struggle to find language that said the review had found no evidence of wrongdoing. ''They wanted to bury those e-mails, and they wanted Harbottle & Lewis to give them a letter to indicate there was nothing incriminating in the file,'' said one of the people who reviewed the exchanges. ''They knew exactly what they were doing.'' But a former News International official familiar with the matter said that Mr. Chapman was expected to testify to a parliamentary committee that the discussion over the letter had nothing to do with the e-mails suggesting police payoffs and only with finding a way for the firm to say it had looked into Mr. Goodman's allegations about hacking and had found no evidence. The former official noted that neither Mr. Chapman nor the firm's lawyer who reviewed the e-mails are criminal attorneys. Mr. Chapman is expected to testify that while he noticed the e-mails in question, he did not realize that paying the police was a criminal offense, the former official said. He is expected to testify that Mr. Goodman's e-mail mentioning prison seemed to him to be in jest. Like Mr. Chapman, Harbottle & Lewis has been asked to give its account to a select committee of Parliament, and it has said it will cooperate as long as the police say its participation will not harm the criminal investigation. News International recently released the firm from its client confidentiality obligations so it can talk to the authorities. While it is unclear what the firm's opinion on the e-mails was in 2007, client confidentiality would have prevented it from unilaterally reporting them to authorities. Mr. Goodman, who was rearrested this month on suspicion of paying police officers for information, did not return a call requesting comment. Lawyers for Mr. Coulson, who was arrested this month on suspicion of conspiring to hack phones and bribe the police for information, have said that they have told him not to answer questions in the midst of a criminal investigation. News International discovered the e-mails indicating police payoffs as it was responding to lawsuits filed by phone hacking victims and inquiries from the police. As the company assembled its defense team, a law firm it hired retained Lord Ken Macdonald to advise the News Corporation board on whether the e-mails were evidence of a crime and needed to be turned over to the police. Mr. Macdonald had overseen the office that prosecuted Mr. Goodman in 2006. But back then, he had not seen the trove of e-mails reviewed by Harbottle & Lewis, since they were never reported to the authorities. Once Mr. Macdonald saw the e-mails in May, it took him between ''about three minutes, maybe five minutes'' to conclude that it was ''blindingly obvious'' that they were evidence of criminal wrongdoing, he told a select committee of Parliament. Mr. Macdonald advised the News Corporation board to immediately turn the e-mails over to the police, a move that set off the current investigation into the payments made to the police by journalists at The News of the World. The company then trawled through other documents, including its cash authorization records, and found 130,000 pounds' worth of payments to a group of officers over several years, according to officials with knowledge of the inquiry. Included within those records was documentation of a thousand-pound cash withdrawal around the date of Mr. Goodman's e-mail concerning his purchase of the Green Book from a police officer, according to one person with knowledge of the investigation.

Calls for CNN Host to Testify in Phone Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- Piers Morgan, the CNN talk show host and a former editor of the British tabloid The Daily Mirror, faced calls on Thursday from prominent British lawmakers to appear before a parliamentary committee investigating the illegal hacking of cellphone messages. The calls came amid fresh signs that separate parliamentary and police inquiries into investigative practices in British newsrooms are on a course to expand beyond The News of the World tabloid, now defunct, and the executive chain in Rupert Murdoch's stable of British newspapers to rival publications. The inquiries seem sure to encompass two papers owned by the Trinity Mirror group, The Daily Mirror and The Sunday Mirror, the toughest competitors for the Murdoch-owned tabloids here. Mr. Morgan, 46, who in January took over the CNN talk show slot previously held by Larry King, has issued a series of denials in recent weeks that he had any knowledge of phone hacking at The Daily Mirror when he was the editor from 1995 to 2004. He was forced to resign in an uproar over faked photographs that the paper published with an article about accusations that British troops beat Iraqi detainees after the 2003 invasion, but he rebuilt his career on television, making his American debut on NBC's ''America's Got Talent'' in 2006.  On Wednesday night, Mr. Morgan was thrust back into the furor that has already forced the closing of The News of the World and the arrest of 11 people linked to accusations of wrongdoing at the paper. The BBC program ''Newsnight'' reported that a voice mail message left in 2001 by Paul McCartney, the former Beatle, on the cellphone of Heather Mills, then his girlfriend and later his wife, had been intercepted. The BBC report quoted from an article by Mr. Morgan in The Daily Mail in 2006, in which he said he had listened to a tape of ''a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone'' and had found it ''heartbreaking.'' In the article, written as a commentary on the bitter divorce proceedings then under way between Mr. McCartney and Ms. Mills, Mr. Morgan said that he felt ''a mounting sense of guilt'' for having introduced the couple at an awards ceremony in 1999 that was co-sponsored by The Daily Mirror. He said the recording of the message had been played to him at a time when the McCartney-Mills marriage was ''in trouble.'' ''The couple had clearly had a tiff,'' he wrote. ''Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back. He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang 'We Can Work It Out' into the answerphone.'' Ms. Mills said in a BBC interview broadcast Wednesday that a Trinity Mirror group executive -- someone she did not name, though she said it was not Mr. Morgan -- had called her at the time and quoted from the message. ''He said, 'I hear you've had a big argument with your boyfriend,' and I said, 'Why would you know this?' '' she said. ''And he started quoting verbatim from the messages from my machine.'' ''I said, 'You've obviously hacked my phone, and if you do anything with this story, I'll go to the police,' '' she said. ''And he said, 'O.K., O.K., yeah, we did hear it on your voice messages. I won't run it.' '' No reference to the voice message appeared in The Daily Mirror's coverage, and the issue lay dormant until police investigations into the phone hacking practices gained momentum in recent months, when Ms. Mills joined a group of celebrities in Britain who said publicly that they believed that their cellphones had been hacked. In the BBC interview, she said that Mr. Morgan, as The Daily Mirror's editor at the time, must have known about the hacking. ''There was absolutely no honest way that Piers Morgan could have obtained that tape that he has so proudly bragged about unless they had gone into my voice messages,'' she said. A statement issued on Mr. Morgan's behalf by CNN on Wednesday did not mention his reference in The Daily Mail article to having heard Mr. McCartney's message for Ms. Mills. But the statement attacked Ms. Mills's credibility, citing a judge's assessment of her evidence in her divorce from Mr. McCartney as ''inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid.'' The statement added, ''No doubt everyone will take this and other instances of somewhat extravagant claims by Ms. Mills into account in assessing what credibility and platform her assertions are given.'' ''And to repeat,'' it said, ''I have never hacked a phone, told anyone to hack a phone, nor to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone.'' Mr. Morgan declined requests on Thursday for comment by telephone or e-mail on the interception of the McCartney-Mills message. But a CNN executive who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject publicly said the accusations would have no effect on Mr. Morgan's position as the host of ''Piers Morgan Tonight.'' ''This whole thing has taken on an absurd air that has no impact on us,'' the executive said. Meghan McPartland, a spokeswoman for Mr. Morgan, said in an e-mail, ''Piers is not going to answer any more questions at this time, as he feels he has said what he has needed to.'' In Cincinnati, where he was on a concert tour, Mr. McCartney on Thursday made his first comments on the issue in a closed-circuit relay to a news conference in Los Angeles that was held to promote a documentary about a concert in which he performed in New York after the Sept. 11 attacks. He said he planned to speak to the police when he returned to Britain after the tour and would withhold comment. ''I'm going to talk to the police because apparently I've been hacked,'' he said, adding: ''I do think it's a horrendous violation of privacy. I think it has been going on for a long time, and I think that more people than we know knew about it.'' In a separate disclosure, the BBC reported that it had uncovered records showing that the Trinity Mirror group had used private investigators 230 times in a two-year period in the late 1990s - when Mr. Morgan was editor of The Daily Mirror - and paid an agency $120,000 for surveillance of celebrities. In Britain, several members of Parliament urged Mr. Morgan to testify before a House of Commons committee. Two weeks ago, the committee summoned Mr. Murdoch; his son James; and Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's newspaper subsidiary in Britain, to testify on the phone hacking at The News of the World. John Whittingdale, the committee's chairman, said he had no powers to compel witnesses living abroad to return to Britain to testify. ''I would like to see Mr. Morgan come back to this country and answer what are some very serious questions,'' he said. The name of the tabloid newspaper Mr. Morgan edited from 1995 to 2004 is The Daily Mirror, not The Mirror. The BBC reported that it had uncovered records showing that The Daily Mirror and a sister newspaper, The Sunday Mirror -- not the Trinity Mirror group, their parent company -- used private investigators 230 times during a two-year period in the late 1990s. But the BBC did not say that the hiring of those investigators occurred under the ''editorship'' of Mr. Morgan. (He was editor of The Daily Mirror at the time.) The article also included incorrect details about an alleged hacking involving a phone message in 2001 from Paul McCartney to Heather Mills, who were introduced by Mr. Morgan, and who were dating at the time. In an interview Ms. Mills gave to the BBC about phone hacking, she said that a Trinity Mirror journalist -- not an executive -- called her and quoted verbatim from the voicemail. (Mr. Morgan raised questions about the veracity of her account, but in a statement issued by CNN on his behalf, he referred to the conversation she claimed to have had as involving an ''executive.'') It was the BBC that bleeped the name of that person; Ms. Mills did not omit the person's name. And it was the BBC -- not Ms. Mills -- who said that Mr. Morgan was not the person who made that call. It also misstated the role The Daily Mirror played in an awards ceremony in 1999. The newspaper co-sponsored the event, it did not host the ceremony.  "
"High-Ranking Scotland Yard Official, Linked to Tabloid Editor, Is Put on Leave","As the police in London questioned a 12th suspect in connection with Britain's widening phone hacking scandal on Wednesday, Scotland Yard announced that Dick Fedorcio, its longtime director of public affairs, had been placed on extended leave until the criminal inquiries were concluded. Mr. Fedorcio, an 11-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Service in London, was criticized by a parliamentary committee last month for hiring Neil Wallis, a former deputy editor at The News of the World, as a public relations consultant for the police from October 2009 until September 2010.  For much of last year, according to two executives at the newspaper's parent company, Mr. Wallis was secretly serving two masters: Scotland Yard, which had closed its investigation of The News of the World phone hacking despite having evidence that the illegal activity was widespread; and his former bosses at the newspaper, who were eager for the investigation to remain closed. Mr. Wallis, 60, was arrested on July 14 on suspicion of phone hacking and bribing police officers. He and his lawyer have not responded to repeated phone messages. On Wednesday, the police in London arrested Greg Miskiw, a 61-year-old former editor of The News of the World, who had resigned from the tabloid in 2005 and had later moved to Delray Beach, Fla. Mr. Miskiw, who was questioned at a London police station, could provide details about which executives at the tabloid and its parent company, News International, a British subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, might have known about the illegal practices and how widespread they were. Last month, a former reporter for The News of the World told The New York Times that Mr. Miskiw had helped him find a source he was seeking by using a cellphone number. He and another reporter said this was part of a practice known as pinging, in which the police used proprietary technology to pinpoint a person's location based on cellphone towers. The reporter said the police were paid $500 for each request. Scotland Yard has recently widened its hacking inquiry to include pinging. Mr. Miskiw's arrest and the announcement of Mr. Fedorcio's extended leave suggest that as Scotland Yard is aggressively pursuing possible criminal activity at The News of the World, the police are also examining the long and cozy relationship between some of its own senior officials and the news media. Mr. Wallis, as much as anyone in the phone hacking scandal, exemplifies those overlapping relationships. Late on the afternoon of May 26, 2010, Mr. Wallis, then working twice a month as a public relations consultant for Scotland Yard, visited 10 Downing Street for a drink with Andy Coulson, who was then the communications chief for Prime Minister David Cameron. It appeared to be a routine social occasion between two old friends: Mr. Coulson had been the top editor at The News of the World from 2003 to 2007, and Mr. Wallis was his deputy. The prime minister's office declined to say what the two men discussed that afternoon. A spokesman said Mr. Wallis did not meet Mr. Cameron or anyone else in the government on that day. But the meeting took place when there were questions about the illegal telephone hacking at the tabloid under Mr. Wallis's and Mr. Coulson's stewardship. Mr. Wallis had parlayed decades of success in Britain's rambunctious press into a new career as a public relations executive with ties to Scotland Yard, 10 Downing Street and News International. Working for newspapers including the Daily Star, Sun and Sunday People, he deployed an aggressive style and bold story ideas to propel himself to the top of the tabloid culture. When Mr. Wallis emerged from his office, former reporters at The News of the World have said, they grabbed for their phones and chatted into dead air to avoid becoming one of his targets. They cringed, they said, when, after reading what they had written, Mr. Wallis would boom, ''Can we say ...'' followed by suggestions about how to torque up a story. Mr. Wallis left The News of the World in 2009 to start his own media relations company, Chamy Media. In October 2009, Scotland Yard hired him on a contract worth about $3,260 a month. His hiring was approved by Mr. Fedorcio, who testified last month before Parliament's Home Affairs select committee that he had not asked Mr. Wallis about phone hacking at the tabloid before hiring him to assist Scotland Yard's press office. Mr. Wallis helped write speeches for Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police commissioner who resigned last month, and gave strategic advice to John Yates, the assistant commissioner who also resigned last month. Just three months before Mr. Wallis was hired, Mr. Yates had decided not to reopen the police inquiry into phone hacking by The News of the World. Mr. Wallis has known Mr. Yates since at least 2000, and the men saw each other two or three times a year. Mr. Yates called Mr. Wallis ''a friend'' and passed on the resume of Mr. Wallis's daughter to Scotland Yard's human resources department so she could get a job. He had also known Mr. Yates's predecessor Andy Hayman, then an assistant police commissioner. While he was still working for The News of the World, Mr. Wallis met with Mr. Hayman and Mr. Coulson on April 25, 2006, for dinner at Soho House, a fashionable London club, according to diaries that a member of Parliament obtained from Scotland Yard. The dinner occurred while Mr. Hayman was running the initial inquiry into phone hacking at The News of the World. While working for the police, Mr. Wallis maintained his ties to his former journalist colleagues. In the run-up to last year's election, he gave informal, unpaid advice to Mr. Coulson before he had entered Downing Street, a spokesman for the Conservative Party said. During this same period, Mr. Wallis was also reporting back to his former employer, News International, and Rebekah Brooks, who was then its chief executive, two executives with knowledge of the arrangement said. ''It looks very bad for the Met, but I am not that surprised, actually,'' a 30-year veteran of Scotland Yard, recently retired, said about Mr. Wallis's multiple roles. ''The connections between all these people were so deep that I would have been more surprised if they had not tried to use them.'' Mr. Wallis had resigned his job at the police on Sept. 6, 2010, five days after an investigation into the hacking scandal appeared in The Times. At 10 p.m. that day, Mr. Fedorcio said, Mr. Wallis e-mailed him saying, ''With what's going on here, I fear this is going to embarrass you, and I don't want to do that, so I wish to suspend the contract.''  "
Letter Counters Hacking Avowals From News Corp.,"LONDON -- An influential parliamentary committee investigating phone hacking at Rupert Murdoch's now-defunct tabloid, The News of the World, released a potentially damning four-year-old letter Tuesday claiming that hacking was routine and ''widely discussed'' at the paper, a direct contradiction of repeated assertions by the paper's owners and editors that until recently they were unaware of the breadth of the problem. The letter, from Clive Goodman, a former News of the World royal correspondent who briefly went to jail in 2007 for intercepting voice mail messages of members of the royal household, is important because it challenges the claim by Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation that until last December it believed that the hacking was limited to one ''rogue'' reporter -- Mr. Goodman -- and that it had conclusively investigated the matter. Mr. Goodman sent the letter, including the now-redacted names of others he said knew about the hacking, to the company after he was fired.  The disclosure is a further embarrassment to Prime Minister David Cameron, who has already been ridiculed by his political rivals for his decision to hire a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his director of communications. Mr. Coulson resigned from the paper during the initial phone hacking imbroglio in 2007 and from his government job in the wake of new evidence early this year. He was arrested last month on suspicion of conspiracy in the phone hacking and of corruption in approving payments to the police for information. In his letter, Mr. Goodman said that phone hacking was regularly discussed in the paper's daily news conference ''until explicit reference to it was banned by the editor,'' presumably meaning Mr. Coulson. Mr. Coulson has always claimed he knew nothing about phone hacking. Mr. Goodman sent the letter containing his accusations to a human resources official at News International and copied it to Les Hinton, then the executive chairman of News International. Mr. Hinton, a close associate of Mr. Murdoch who went on to become the chairman of Dow Jones after it was bought by the News Corporation, resigned from the company this summer after it became apparent that phone hacking at The News of the World had been endemic during his time at News International. He has always claimed he knew nothing about it. He told Parliament in 2007 that he believed the hacking was limited to Mr. Goodman and a hired investigator. The scandal has already swept through the upper echelons of Britain's political, media and law enforcement worlds, resulting in a dozen arrests, the resignations of top officials from the News Corporation and the Metropolitan Police, the withdrawal of the News Corporation's $12 billion takeover bid for the satellite company BskyB and the summary closing of the 168-year-old News of the World. None of those arrested in the case have yet been formally charged. The parliamentary panel, the Commons committee on culture, media and sport, said that in light of Mr. Goodman's letter and other documents, it would re-call for further questioning at least four former employees of The News of the World. It also said it might re-call Mr. Coulson as well as Rupert Murdoch's son James, who runs the News Corporation's European and Asian operations. Both Murdochs appeared last month before the committee in a dramatic hearing punctuated by a bizarre episode in which a self-described comedian attacked the 80-year-old Rupert Murdoch with a plate of shaving cream, only to be slapped down by Mr. Murdoch's wife, Wendi. Meanwhile, other letters written to the committee at its request in the last few weeks -- including one from an outside law firm hired briefly to advise The News of the World in 2007, a second from a former editor at the paper and a third from a former lawyer for News International, the British newspaper arm of the News Corporation -- all cast doubt on previous assertions by the Murdochs and other company officials. Particularly embarrassing is the letter from the law firm, Harbottle & Lewis, which was hired by News International in 2007 in the wake of Mr. Goodman's court case. The Murdochs and others have repeatedly said that they had relied on the firm to investigate whether the hacking was limited to Mr. Goodman and the investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, who was also jailed for hacking, and that the firm had assured them it was. But Harbottle & Lewis said that was a mischaracterization. For one thing, it said, News International provided it with only a limited selection of e-mails in five electronic folders on the company server; the law firm was ''not given free rein to look through whatever it wanted.'' Moreover, it said, its brief was extremely narrow: merely to provide advice on whether the e-mails contained evidence that ''other people were aware of the phone hacking activities, or were doing the same thing themselves'' that could be relied on by Mr. Goodman in the employment action he had brought against the company to get his job back. After a team of junior associates spent about 46 hours looking through about 2,500 e-mails in the folders, the firm said it had found no such evidence. But there ''was absolutely no question of the firm being asked to provide News International with a clean bill of health which it could deploy years later in wholly different contexts for wholly different purposes,'' Harbottle & Lewis said. In other words, it was not hired ''to find out what the hell was going on,'' as Rupert Murdoch asserted recently, Harbottle & Lewis said. In another letter, Tom Crone, a former News International lawyer, told the committee that in June 2008, he had explicitly informed James Murdoch of a damning internal e-mail about phone hacking containing the words ''for Neville'' -- a likely reference to Neville Thurlbeck, The News of the World's former chief reporter. Mr. Crone has said this before, but the letter provided new details. Mr. Crone revealed the e-mail's existence to James Murdoch, he added, to explain why the company should settle a lawsuit in which a British soccer official, Gordon Taylor, was accusing The News of the World of hacking into his voice mail. The company subsequently paid Mr. Taylor about a million dollars to settle the case. James Murdoch, whose approval was required for the payment, says that no one told him about the e-mail and that he knew nothing about phone hacking beyond Mr. Goodman's case. In a statement issued Tuesday, News International said that ''we recognize the seriousness'' of the materials disclosed to the police and Parliament and that it was ''committed to working in a constructive and open way with all the relevant authorities.'' As for Mr. Goodman, his letter reveals an almost poignant bewilderment at his dismissal from The News of the World since, he says, ''other members of staff were carrying out the same illegal procedures'' and his actions were ''carried out with the full knowledge and support'' of his editors. Mr. Goodman's letter also says that The News of the World's lawyers all knew he was planning to plead guilty to the charges and had in fact assured him that he could have his job back ''if I did not implicate the paper or any of its staff'' during court proceedings. But, he said, The News of the World failed to honor its promise and did not rehire him.  "
Editor Said to Receive Pay After He Took Tory Post,"LONDON -- The former News of the World editor Andy Coulson received hundreds of thousands of dollars in severance pay from his former employer after joining now-Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party as director of communications in 2007, according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report on Monday evening. Mr. Coulson was arrested last month in connection with investigations into phone hacking and payments to police officials under his editorship. Although he has denied any wrongdoing, his role at Mr. Cameron's side from 2007 until he stepped down this year had become the topic of political intrigue and swirling rumors here since the scandal came to dominate headlines last month.  In its report, the BBC said that the severance payments, part of an agreement that included company health care benefits and a car, were received in installments that continued after he joined the Conservative Party in July 2007. A person in the party, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the legal and political sensitivity of the topic, said on Monday that there was confusion in the party over the report. Although some had suspected such an arrangement, the details cited by the BBC were not known, the source said, citing conversations with senior officials. When Mr. Coulson was first hired, the person added, party officials had been uncomfortable over his high wages from the party itself -- around $400,000 a year. Mr. Coulson was widely credited as being crucial to the strategy that saw Mr. Cameron elected prime minister last year, with the endorsement of The News of the World and other British newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. A spokesman for 10 Downing Street directed inquiries on the BBC report to the Conservative Party, which said via a spokeswoman that ''senior party officials have no knowledge of Andy Coulson's severance arrangements.'' She declined to answer further questions. The revelations could well reignite controversies over whether Mr. Cameron ignored signs that one of his closest colleagues might have known about, or even endorsed, hacking, and Mr. Murdoch's influence over Britain's politicians. Mr. Coulson resigned from the weekly tabloid in January 2007 after the arrest and imprisonment of two people who worked for the newspaper, the private detective Glenn Mulcaire and the reporter who covered the royal family, Clive Goodman, for phone hacking. Mr. Cameron has insisted that he gave Mr. Coulson ''a second chance'' by bringing him to the heart of the Conservative Party and then to the heart of government despite the scandal. The payments that Mr. Coulson received after he stepped down as editor also raise questions, according to people familiar with continuing investigations into phone hacking at Mr. Murdoch's companies, about the unusual practice of giving severance to senior staff over time rather than with a one-time payment. It raises, they said, potential issues about buying continued loyalty. The company has admitted that, until recently, it paid Mr. Mulcaire's extensive legal fees long after he ceased to work for it, and in a letter submitted to Parliament last week it became known that Mr. Goodman had also been paid by the tabloid while in prison. Agreements with more junior News of the World staff, who lost their jobs when the tabloid was shuttered last month, will pay a lump sum, not installments, according to former employees. Although it is unclear who authorizes such arrangements, one former journalist said Mr. Murdoch had been involved. A spokeswoman for News International, a British unit of News Corporation, declined to answer questions. Tom Watson, a member of the opposition Labour Party and a leading figure in parliamentary investigations into the scandal, suggested Monday evening on Twitter that the severance payments to Mr. Coulson might be ''an undeclared donation'' from Mr. Murdoch's company to the Conservative Party, and that he would refer the matter to Britain's electoral commission.

"New Phone-Hacking Arrest in Britain, and Renewed Inquiries","LONDON -- A 30-year-old man was arrested Friday as part of investigations into phone hacking, the police said in a statement. He became the 15th person held since a wide-ranging new inquiry into criminality at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World newspaper began early this year.  An official at News International, the parent company of the now-shuttered News of the World, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the man as Ross Hall, a former reporter with the newspaper. A spokeswoman for News International declined to comment. The police statement said that the man was arrested by appointment on Friday afternoon, ''on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages'' and obstructing justice, as part of Operation Weeting, the arm of the investigation focused particularly on phone hacking. The arrest came as the phone hacking scandal, bumped from the front pages here amid widespread riots last month, looks set to resume the steady pace of revelations that had struck the heart of the British media, politics and policing in recent months. On Tuesday, the day after members of Parliament return from their summer recess, the House of Commons will call several former senior executives from The News of the World and News International, including the former editor of the tabloid, Colin Myler, and the company's former legal manager, Tom Crone, to give evidence. The main issue at hand, two people with knowledge of the committee's deliberations said, is whether James Murdoch knew phone hacking was more widespread than acknowledged when he chose to make a record $1.4 million settlement in a 2008 lawsuit brought by the soccer union leader Gordon Taylor, which alleged voicemail interceptions. That settlement included a confidentiality clause. James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son, runs the European and Asian businesses of the News Corporation, the Murdoch global media empire. Documentary evidence indicating that at least one other reporter was involved in phone hacking would likely have become public had the case proceeded, and undermined the company's initial assertion that the hacking was limited to ''a lone rogue reporter.'' James Murdoch testified this year that he was not aware of that documentary evidence at the time and had made the settlement because it made financial sense. Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone later said he was ''mistaken'' in his testimony and was fully aware of the evidence, a claim they will likely expand on during Tuesday's proceedings. Committee members have said they may recall Mr. Murdoch to answer further questions. In light of the accusations, Mr. Murdoch has also faced calls to step down as the chairman of British Sky Broadcasting, also known as BSkyB, a satellite television company of which the News Corporation owns 39 percent. A $14 billion bid by the News Corporation to take full ownership of the broadcaster earlier this year became mired in political controversy as the phone hacking scandal broke, and was eventually withdrawn amid allegations that improper links between politicians and the Murdoch family had tainted the process.  "
Murdoch Son's Testimony on Hacking Is Challenged by 2 Former Executives,"LONDON -- After a month's lull, the phone hacking scandal that has rocked Rupert Murdoch's media empire resumed with fresh intensity on Tuesday. Mr. Murdoch's son James clashed publicly with two former senior news executives over a meeting that parliamentary investigators have identified as a critical milestone in attempts by some of his father's trusted lieutenants to contain the scandal. The two former executives said at a parliamentary hearing that they had informed James Murdoch, chief of News Corporation's European and Asian operations, at a 15-minute meeting in London in 2008 that the hacking of voice mail as a reporting tool went beyond the work by a lone ''rogue'' reporter and a private investigator that the company had acknowledged at the time. The men said they had conveyed that message as part of a plan to win Mr. Murdoch's backing for a record $1.4 million settlement that bound a hacking victim to silence about his case.  The former executives -- Tom Crone, former legal manager for the Murdoch-owned newspapers in Britain, and Colin Myler, former editor of the now-defunct News of the World -- said the settlement had been intended to avoid millions in legal costs, but several members of Parliament suggested that it was part of a cover-up intended to buy the hacking victim's silence and prevent the scandal from spreading. The committee on culture, media and sport, which had summoned Rupert and James Murdoch to a hearing in July, said it would meet again to decide whether to call James Murdoch back for additional questioning. Committee members have said that they will focus on determining whether he testified truthfully in July when he said that there was no indication at the 2008 meeting of a pattern of wrongdoing at The News of the World, which was closed as a result of the scandal. James Murdoch, who has denied that he was told that the hacking involved more than a single case that resulted in two men's going to jail in 2007, almost immediately disputed the former executives' testimony to the committee on Tuesday. In a statement, he rejected the assertions by Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler that they had told him of an internal e-mail from the tabloid's archive -- one showing that the phone hacking had been more widespread and posed a far more serious threat financially and legally -- that justified a payout that would serve to contain the damage. The meeting in 2008 has emerged as a turning point in the saga that has embroiled Britain's news media, politicians and the police. Months of disclosures have damaged Prime Minister David Cameron, who hired a former News of the World editor as his communications chief, only to see him resign and undergo questioning as one of 15 editors, reporters and private investigators arrested in the case. The scandal prompted the resignation of the Scotland Yard commander who was Britain's top police officer, after disclosures about his ties to the Murdoch hierarchy; and forced Rupert Murdoch to shut down The News of the World after 168 years of publication. For Rupert Murdoch, 81, who presides over one of the world's most powerful news organizations, the scandal has posed a more personal threat. James Murdoch, 38, has been fighting for his corporate survival, in the face of deep unease among powerful News Corporation investors. Whether James Murdoch, long considered his father's corporate heir, can survive may depend on what the parliamentary and police inquiries reveal in the months ahead about his stewardship of the British papers as the phone hacking scandal grew. The dimensions of the affair were captured in a closing exchange at the parliamentary hearing, when one of the lawmakers quoted from an e-mail he said had been sent anonymously to committee members by somebody who had once worked at a senior level in News International in which the writer spoke of the possibility that ''a global empire could be blown apart'' by the scandal. As matters stand, whether James Murdoch can withstand the mounting pressures appears to hinge, more than anything, on the differing accounts of the 2008 meeting, and what it reveals of his willingness to confront the scope of the illegal practices. The conflicting accounts of the meeting center on two issues: whether Mr. Murdoch was shown an e-mail in which a junior reporter quoted from transcripts of three hacked voice mail messages, indicating a broader pattern of illegal intercepts; and whether Mr. Murdoch's approval of the record $1.4 million settlement with Gordon Taylor, chief of an organization representing Britain's professional soccer players, was motivated by a desire to save millions in legal costs for News International, the Murdoch newspaper subsidiary, or was, as several members of Parliament suggested, an effort to buy Mr. Taylor's silence and prevent the scandal from spreading. Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler testified that the meeting had centered on the e-mail, which they said they had cited in support of their argument that a settlement should be made with Mr. Taylor. Mr. Crone said he was ''absolutely certain'' he had shown the e-mail to Mr. Murdoch, and had pushed to settle the case because there were four other targets of News of the World phone-hacking who were ''waiting in the wings'' to begin civil damages lawsuits of their own that would draw heavily on evidence in the Taylor case if it were not ended by a financial settlement with a binding confidentiality clause. Mr. Myler testified that all three men at the meeting ''perfectly understood the seriousness and significance of what we were discussing,'' in terms of more civil suits if the Taylor case was not settled and the e-mail was introduced in evidence. James Murdoch said in his statement, however, that his testimony in July was ''an accurate account of events'' and that Mr. Crone and Mr. Myler ''did not show me the e-mail.'' ''As I said in my testimony, there was nothing discussed in the meeting that led me to believe that a further investigation was necessary,'' he said. But the testimony of Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone, as well as two other News International executives who testified on Tuesday, presented a version of the payouts that dovetailed with James Murdoch's. In July, Mr. Murdoch testified that he had approved the payment to Mr. Taylor not to buy his silence but to limit News International's legal costs if the case went to trial. On Tuesday, Mr. Crone said that defending the Taylor suit, and others that might have followed, could have cost more than $3 million each in legal fees. But Tom Watson, the committee's most outspoken member, spoke of the settlement -- more than 10 times the previous record for an award in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit -- as a ''cover-up'' and a move intended to buy Mr. Taylor's silence. ''You were desperate to see that nobody knew that phone hacking was standard practice at The News of the World,'' Mr. Watson said.  "
James Murdoch to Be Called Before Parliament Again Over Phone Hacking Inquiry,"LONDON -- A parliamentary panel investigating the phone hacking scandal in the British outpost of Rupert Murdoch's media empire said on Tuesday that it would recall his son James Murdoch to answer more questions about the case. Committee officials said they expected to schedule the hearing for November, and a spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch said he would comply. ''James Murdoch is happy to appear in front of the committee again to answer any further questions members might have,'' she said.  The committee's decision seemed likely to bring further drama to an unfolding story that has reached deep into British society, raising questions about the behavior and power of the press and the once-intimate cross-ties between the media, the political elite and the police. John Whittingdale, chairman of the House of Commons select committee investigating the scandal, told Sky News that Mr. Murdoch, 38, would be recalled after the committee had heard testimony from Les Hinton, a former top executive at The News Corporation, and Mark Lewis, a lawyer representing individuals who were targets of the phone hacking. Mr. Hinton, who became the chairman of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal after the paper was acquired by the News Corporation, was the most senior Murdoch executive to quit as the hacking scandal unfolded this summer. Mr. Whittingdale said he expected James Murdoch to appear at the inquiry for a second hearing as part of the committee's efforts to tie up ''one or two loose ends'' left after earlier testimony. In testimony last week, former News Corporation executives disputed Mr. Murdoch's claims that he was unaware of widespread phone hacking at his papers. Another major figure in the investigation, Andy Coulson, a former editor of the Murdoch-owned tabloid The News of the World who later served as Prime Minister David Cameron's media director, told the committee through his lawyers last week that he would not accept an invitation to testify again because of concerns about the potential impact on a police investigation into the scandal and a separate judge-led inquiry appointed by the government. Mr. Coulson, who resigned from the prime minister's staff in January, is one of more than a dozen former editors, reporters, lawyers and executives from the Murdoch newspapers in Britain who have been arrested in recent months. All were released on bail after hours of intensive questioning, pending decisions by prosecutors on whether to bring charges. In another development, The Guardian newspaper reported that lawyers for the News Corporation's British newspaper group, News International, had told a court hearing on Tuesday that the company had discovered ''two very large new caches'' of documents and e-mails in its archive that could contain evidence of the scale of phone hacking by The News of the World. A judge preparing to hear civil cases arising from the phone hacking told a high court hearing that there was ''some important material'' in the new archive, whose discovery followed on a previous instance in which a huge tranche of e-mails potentially relevant to the investigations were found by the Murdoch papers after initially being reported lost. The scandal over unlawful intercepts of voice mail has been rumbling for several years, but it built to crisis pitch this summer with reports that The News of the World ordered the hacking of the phone of Milly Dowler, an abducted teenager who was found murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002. As the scandal exploded this summer, News International closed down the newspaper after 168 years of publication, causing dozens of reporters, editors and other staff members to lose their jobs. The Murdoch family was drawn personally into the inquiry in mid-July when the House of Commons committee on culture, media and sport questioned both Rupert and James Murdoch, with both men expressing regret over the phone hacking but denying any knowledge that it had been a widespread pattern before the rush of revelations this year.. The hearings resumed last week when two former senior employees of News International appeared before the committee to challenge James Murdoch's version of events. Their testimony centered on a 15-minute meeting in London in 2008 when, they said, James Murdoch, chief of the News Corporation's European and Asian operations, was told that the hacking of voice mail was more widespread than the company had acknowledged. It was on this basis, they said, that Mr. Murdoch approved an out-of-court settlement with Gordon Taylor, a leading soccer executive whose voice mail had been hacked, that eventually ran to $1.4 million, including legal costs. But that account has been disputed by Mr. Murdoch, who has denied that he was told at the 2008 meeting that there was a wider pattern of hacking involved. The News Corporation has maintained for years that the hacking was an isolated affair carried out by a ''rogue'' reporter, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire. Both men served jail terms in 2007 related to phone hacking. But some members of the parliamentary committee have focused on the payout to Mr. Taylor as evidence of an attempt to ''cover up'' the affair.  "
Millions May Go To Girl's Family In Hacking Case,"LONDON -- The family of Milly Dowler, the teenage murder victim whose voice mail messages were illegally intercepted by The News of the World, has been offered a multimillion-dollar settlement by the tabloid's parent company, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said Monday.  The person said the company, Rupert Murdoch's News International, had offered about $3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity. The News of the World is believed to have hacked into the voice mails of hundreds, possibly thousands, of people, including celebrities and politicians. Widespread public revulsion resulted from the revelation in July that its victims included the 13-year-old Milly Dowler, who disappeared in 2002 and whose messages were intercepted and erased to make room for new ones even as her family searched for her. That disclosure ultimately led the Murdochs to close The News of the World, the government to open several inquiries into the matter and the police to expand their criminal investigation into the paper's conduct. Mr. Murdoch, who seemed unperturbed by earlier accusations about his employees' phone hacking, was demonstrably shaken by the news about Milly Dowler. He met with the Dowler family to apologize, and later told a parliamentary committee that he had been humbled by the episode. News International would not disclose the amounts currently under discussion. If both parties agree to the proposal, the settlement will be by far the largest to date in the hacking case. In 2008, Gordon Taylor, a soccer executive, received about $1.4 million from News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation.  "
London Police Relent on Demand for Reporters' Sources in Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- The Metropolitan Police Service said on Wednesday that it had withdrawn its demand, at least for now, that the Guardian newspaper reveal the sources it used for articles about phone hacking.  In a statement, police officials said they had consulted the Crown Prosecution Service, which would be responsible for pursuing the case in the courts if it were to go ahead, and that the agency had asked for more information. As a result, police officials had decided to delay a decision on how to proceed. But this ''does not mean that the investigation has concluded,'' the statement said. ''We have agreed with the C.P.S. that we will work jointly with them in considering the next steps.'' The prospect of reporters being forced to reveal their sources has led to outrage across the British news media, even from some of the Guardian's bitterest rivals. ''We greatly welcome the Met's decision to withdraw this ill-judged order,'' the Guardian's editor, Alan Rusbridger, said. The apparent reversal is highly embarrassing for the police. Last week, they said they would seek a court order to force the Guardian to reveal, among other things, the sources for its articles about how The News of the World tabloid illegally intercepted the voice mail messages of a girl who was kidnapped and then murdered. The Guardian's initial article about the girl, Milly Dowler, generated widespread revulsion and started a chain of events leading to the closure of the newspaper, part of Rupert Murdoch's media empire. News International, Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper arm, reportedly has offered the Dowler family about $3.2 million, with an additional payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity, in compensation. Angry that the Guardian had obtained information about the Dowler case, the police decided to find out who had provided it. In August, a senior officer from Operation Weeting, the police phone-hacking investigation, was arrested on suspicion of disclosing unauthorized information in violation of Britain's Official Secrets Act. He has not yet been formally charged but has been suspended from his job. A Guardian reporter, Amelia Hill, was also questioned by the police in connection with the possible leak. In their statement explaining why they had apparently changed their mind about pursuing the Guardian, the police said that ''there was no intention to target journalists or disregard journalists' obligations to protect their sources.'' They were instead ''gathering any evidence'' about how the material had been obtained by the paper, they explained. ''It is not acceptable for police officers to leak information about any investigation, let alone one as sensitive and high profile as Operation Weeting,'' the police said.  "
British Lawyer Wants U.S. Hearing on Phone Hacking,"LONDON -- A lawyer representing some of Britain's phone hacking victims said on Friday that he was planning legal action in the United States against the News Corporation, the parent company of Rupert Murdoch's global media empire. In a series of interviews in London, the lawyer, Mark Lewis, said he had held discussions with American lawyers about the steps necessary to open proceedings against the News Corporation in New York, and that he expected the process to begin soon. He said he had hired Norman Siegel, a New York lawyer who has represented many of the families of those killed in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, to handle the case.  In an interview with Sky News, a British television network that is part of the Murdoch empire, Mr. Lewis said that the legal action in the United States would focus on the ''News Corporation's liability for actions by its foreign subsidiaries,'' including the tabloid The News of the World, which has been at the center of the phone hacking scandal and was closed in July. He said the lawsuits would focus on the revelations of widespread phone hacking in Britain and on accusations that the police were bribed to assist in the tabloid's pursuit of scoops. Mr. Lewis did not respond to voice mail messages requesting an interview on the issue. In another development, Andy Coulson, a former editor of The News of the World, has sued News International, the News Corporation's British subsidiary, because it stopped paying for his legal fees in the hacking case, the BBC reported. Mr. Coulson, who was arrested in July in connection with the investigations into phone hacking and payments to police officials under his editorship, resigned in January as the communications director for Prime Minister David Cameron. Mr. Lewis, based on his remarks in the interviews with Sky News, the BBC and the newspaper The Guardian, appeared to be relying, as a basis for the American legal action, on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 1977 statute that holds American companies and their executives liable for corrupt activities abroad, including bribery of foreign officials. In the Sky News interview, he said part of the reason for pursuing the News Corporation in American courts was the prospect of higher damage settlements than are customary in the British courts. The prospect of defending itself against civil suits in American courts would add a daunting new dimension to the challenges facing the News Corporation as a result of the phone hacking revelations in Britain. But some legal experts in Britain said that Mr. Lewis's announcement was a publicity stunt, and that the move could complicate legal proceedings in Britain. Mark Thomson, a British lawyer who also represents phone hacking victims, issued a brusque statement disassociating himself from Mr. Lewis's action. Mr. Thomson said the class-action lawsuit he has filed on behalf of his clients will go to trial in Britain in January, adding, ''My clients are not taking part in the reported action in New York.'' This week, News International offered a settlement of about $3.2 million, and a further payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity, to the family of Milly Dowler, a teenage murder victim whose voice mail messages were intercepted by The News of the World. The scandal has led to strong pressures on James Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch who leads the company's European and Asian operations. Both denied any prior knowledge of the practices at The News of the World.  "
Reporter Threatens to Name Names in Phone Hacking Scandal,"LONDON -- A reporter who is among the 16 people arrested and then freed on bail in the phone hacking case that has shaken Rupert Murdoch's media empire in Britain warned his former bosses on Friday that he planned to break his silence on the scandal in a civil court case. He said that he would reveal those who were responsible for the phone hacking.  The reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, 49, who was the chief reporter for the now-defunct tabloid The News of the World, gave the warning in a statement issued through his lawyers in connection with his wrongful-dismissal lawsuit against News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. Mr. Thurlbeck was one of the first people arrested by Scotland Yard in a renewed investigation of the phone hacking this year, but he has denied publicly having played any part in the illegal interception of cellphone voicemails. Mr. Thurlbeck remained on the News International payroll into September, when he was fired. He has accused the company of having unfairly dismissed him for being a whistleblower. In his statement on Friday, he suggested that both sides ''retain a dignified silence until we meet face to face in a public tribunal,'' a hearing on his suit. ''There is so much I could have said publicly to the detriment of News International but so far have chosen not to,'' he said. ''At the length, truth will out.'' News International declined to comment on Mr. Thurlbeck's statement. With his statement, Mr. Thurlbeck appeared to have joined other current or former News International employees who have shown a readiness to contradict one another in public about newsroom wrongdoing at The News of the World -- in particular, who authorized the phone hacking, who at the newspaper and at News International knew about it, and when. The discrepancies apparently in accounts given this summer by Murdoch executives to a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal will be explored further in additional hearings called by the committee this fall.  "
Britain: Former Murdoch Aide To Testify Before Parliament,"LONDON -- Rupert Murdoch's former chief lieutenant, Les Hinton, will appear before Parliament to answer further questions on the News of the Worldphone hacking scandal, lawmakers said Tuesday.  The parliamentary committee investigating the scandal said that Mr. Hinton will give evidence by video link from the United States on Oct. 24. Mr. Hinton was chairman of News International, the British newspaper unit of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation media empire, from 1995 to 2007; he then became publisher of The Wall Street Journal. He resigned from that post over the summer in the wake of revelations that journalists at the company's British tabloid weekly The News of the World had repeatedly broken into the private voicemail boxes of celebrities and people in the news, among other questionable practices. The scandal led the company to shut The News of the World, and threatened to shake News Corporation to its foundations. In dramatic hearings over the summer, Mr. Murdoch, his son James and other senior figures from The News of the World and News International were shown to be sharply at odds over the question of who knew that phone hacking was endemic at the newspaper, and when they knew it. The company had insisted until early this year that the practice was limited to one ''rogue reporter,'' Clive Goodman, who was jailed on hacking-related charges in 2007. Mr. Hinton ''was in charge during a lot of the critical period,'' said John Whittingdale, the committee chairman, in a telephone interview on Tuesday. Of particular interest, Mr. Whittingdale said, is a letter sent to Mr. Hinton and other senior figures at News International in early 2007 by Mr. Goodman, which alleged that phone hacking was undertaken by others and was ''widely discussed'' at the newspaper. Mr. Whittingdale said the panel, the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, would also be keen to explore allegations that Mr. Hinton had personally insisted on a large severance payout for Mr. Goodman when he was released from prison. A spokeswoman for News International declined to comment. Mr. Hinton, who had worked with Mr. Murdoch for more than 50 years, said in his resignation letter in July that he was ''ignorant of what apparently happened'' at the newspaper. It is likely that James Murdoch will also be recalled by the committee this year to give further testimony, a person with knowledge of the committee's deliberations said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"Britain: Company Knew of More Hacking, Lawyer Says","LONDON -- News International, Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper company, knew the practice of phone hacking was widespread at the News of the World newspaper as early as 2008, a lawyer who acted for the company told lawmakers here Wednesday.  Julian Pike, a partner at the law firm Farrer and Co., said he knew the company's claim that the practice was limited to one ''rogue reporter,'' was untrue but admitted that he ''had not done very much,'' with the information, as he was not obliged to reveal it. He insisted that he was ''not party to any cover-up.'' The company eventually admitted to wider wrongdoing early this year, and shuttered the newspaper this summer amid a cascade of revelations. But the company was told in 2008 that three other journalists at the tabloid had been involved, Mr. Pike told a committee of lawmakers gathering evidence on a scandal that continues to pervade a wide swath of British life. The committee will take evidence from Mr. Murdoch's former chief lieutenant, Les Hinton, next Monday, and has said it will likely call Mr. Murdoch's son James to give further evidence later this year. Both men face allegations, which they vehemently deny, that they were complicit in covering up phone hacking. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Irate News Corp. Shareholders to Take Murdoch to the Woodshed,"The annual News Corporation shareholders meeting has always been a raucous and unpredictable event. In a 12-minute exchange last year, one disapproving shareholder gave Rupert Murdoch, the company's chairman and chief executive, a copy of ''Man Bites Murdoch,'' an autobiographical book about an editor's clashes with the media giant, and asked if he would be attending the comedian Jon Stewart's ''Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear'' in Washington. Mr. Murdoch said he would be in Australia. But that incident might seem tame once this year's meeting ends Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. The gathering is expected to be the company's most contentious in years, with frustrated shareholders taking the microphone to demand accountability after a phone-hacking scandal in Britain that has embarrassed the company.  Investors will also have the chance to vote on the company's board members, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan. While the family's 40 percent stake virtually guarantees they will be re-elected, the chorus of discontent has put the company in an uncustomary defensive position. The most forceful, and potentially most ominous protest is likely to come from Tom Watson, the British Labour Party legislator who has led the investigation into phone-hacking at News Corporation's British newspaper unit. Mr. Watson, who acquired nonvoting proxy shareholder status to attend the meeting, said he planned to accuse the company of engaging in further criminal wrongdoing involving surveillance techniques that extend beyond the phone hacking. He did not discuss potential evidence. ''A lot of institutional investors do not know the scope nor the implications of what's happening in the U.K.,'' Mr. Watson said in a phone interview. ''You can delegate power but not responsibility, and Rupert Murdoch for whatever reason has failed to put in corporate governance arrangements that prohibit crimes from being committed.'' A News Corporation spokeswoman, Teri Everett, declined to comment. The company has done its part to carefully orchestrate the gathering. For the first time, News Corporation, citing security concerns, has made attendees register and R.S.V.P. before the event. Rather than holding the meeting at its usual venue, the Hudson Theater in New York, it will take place at the 476-seat Darryl F. Zanuck Theater on the gilded Art Deco-style Fox Studios lot near Beverly Hills, Calif. News Corporation said attendance would be similar to previous years and that it was not uncommon for companies to change locations for annual meetings. The Los Angeles venue was chosen because the company's entertainment division, which makes shows like ''Modern Family'' and movies like ''Avatar,'' is a major contributor to its financial growth, News Corporation said. Some shareholders will get up to 15 minutes to speak directly to Mr. Murdoch, according to people who have attended previous meetings. ''That can be a pretty long 15 minutes,'' said Digby Gilmour, head of telecommunications and media research at C.L.S.A. Australia. Stephen Mayne, a director at the Australian Shareholders' Association, and the person who presented Mr. Murdoch with the book last year, said he planned to travel from Sydney to attend. A former News Corporation employee and longtime shareholder, Mr. Mayne has attended 12 annual meetings. Mr. Murdoch has in recent years grown increasingly impatient with shareholder speeches, Mr. Mayne said. ''I got 40 minutes of back and forth in 1999,'' he said, adding: ''But he's gotten a lot tougher as he's gotten older.'' Mr. Mayne's advice for shareholders standing up to confront Mr. Murdoch? ''He'll shut you down. You've got to be quick and polite but firm at the same time.'' Any dissent will largely be symbolic. Mr. Murdoch owns nearly 40 percent of voting shares, and 7 percent belong to Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who has expressed his support for the board. As many as 30 percent of shareholders are expected to cast votes against Murdoch family members, several analysts estimated. Shareholder activists will dominate the meeting, since large institutional investors do not typically air grievances in such a public forum, analysts said. ''There will be a lot of noise, but at the end, not a lot of change,'' Mr. Gilmour said. The meetings typically begin with Mr. Murdoch opening the floor to questions, Mr. Mayne said. At the end of the exchanges, he gives a state-of-the-company address. That talk could become a more prominent part of the presentation as Mr. Murdoch lays out the shareholder-friendly actions News Corporation has recently taken, said a Deutsche Bank Securities analyst, Doug Mitchelson. One of them is a $5 billion stock buyback program currently under way, which has countered some investors' concerns about News Corporation's decision in July to withdraw its $12 billion bid for the British Sky Broadcasting Group. Chase Carey, chief operating officer, has said he would pursue additional stock buybacks on top of the $5 billion program. ''As much as we thought Sky was a good deal, buying back stock is a better deal,'' said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities. Company executives are sure to point out on Friday that even as most media companies struggle, News Corporation shares are up about 14 percent with a 52-week high of $18.35. The stock closed at $17.05 on Thursday. Last year, before the revelations of widespread phone-hacking, Mr. Mayne questioned Mr. Murdoch about allegations of hacking in 2006 involving two News of the World journalists, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson. ''There has been two parliamentary inquiries, which have found no further evidence or any other thing at all,'' Mr. Murdoch responded, according to a transcript. ''If anything was to come to light, we challenge people to give us evidence, and no one has been able to do so.'' In the end, the meeting will most likely give a platform to critics of the company's corporate governance and not be a referendum on its financial performance.  "
Murdoch Apologizes for Hacking Scandal After Investor Dissent,"Despite fiery attacks from shareholders, Rupert Murdoch and the rest of the News Corporation board were re-elected on Friday, after a turbulent summer during which a phone-hacking scandal in Britain prompted a rising level of discontent among investors. The results of the vote were expected, since the Murdoch family controls a large percentage of the voting shares. But stockholder dissent at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Friday led Mr. Murdoch to offer a lengthy apology to investors for the hacking scandal that embarrassed the company and led to calls for more responsible leadership from the board.  While defending the company's financial performance, Mr. Murdoch, 80, acknowledged its ethical lapses in the phone hacking by its British newspaper unit, News International. ''We cannot just be a profitable company. We must be a principled company,'' Mr. Murdoch told shareholders. ''We must admit to and confront our mistakes and establish rigorous and vigorous procedures to put things right.'' At the same time, Mr. Murdoch, who wore a black suit and blue tie and at times sparred with shareholders, urged investors to put the hacking imbroglio ''in context.'' Although the scandal had taken ''a significant amount of my time,'' he said, the vast majority of News Corporation employees have been ''building our business and increasing our profitability.'' In a statement on Friday evening, News Corporation affirmed that the board had been re-elected but did not provide a vote tally. Before the meeting, executives said they expected Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, to be re-elected with less than 90 percent of the vote, according to a person briefed on company discussions. Such a margin would signal significant disapproval of the company's governance, considering the family owns 40 percent of the shares. News Corporation said voting totals would be filed next week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The meeting was held at the company's Fox Studios lot in Los Angeles and ran 90 minutes. It gave the roughly 100 investors in attendance the chance to question Mr. Murdoch and vote on the leadership of a company with a market capitalization of $44 billion. Shareholders were eager to speak their minds. Julie Tanner, assistant director of socially responsible investing for Christian Brothers Investment Services, proposed that the company establish an independent chairman. ''This pervasive and value-destroying scandal requires stronger independent leadership on the board,'' she said. The proposal, which did not pass, set off a series of heated comments, the most contentious of which came from Tom Watson, the member of the British Parliament who has led the investigation into the phone hacking by News International. Mr. Watson asked Mr. Murdoch if he had heard about reports that journalists at the now shuttered tabloid News of the World had hacked computers as well as phones. Without presenting evidence, he said News International had hacked into the computer of a former army intelligence officer. ''You haven't told any of your investors what has to come,'' Mr. Watson said. Mr. Murdoch said he was not aware of the accusations. ''If you have further evidence, please let us know,'' he said. ''I promise you absolutely that we'll stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this and put it right.'' One board director, Viet D. Dinh, chairman of the board's corporate governance committee, was questioned about his independence. Mr. Dinh is a friend of the Murdoch family and godfather to Lachlan Murdoch's son. ''I came to this country as a refugee on a boat,'' Mr. Dinh said. ''I would sacrifice my integrity for no one.'' Hours before the meeting began, News Corporation announced it had reached a financial settlement with the family of Milly Dowler, the murdered British teenager whose phone was hacked by News of the World. The company said it would pay $3.2 million to the Dowlers and that Mr. Murdoch would personally donate $1.6 million to charities of the Dowler family's choosing. The decision to hold the meeting at Fox Studios, rather than in New York City, was an effort to draw shareholders' attention to the company's lucrative entertainment unit and emphasize profitability. Standing in front of a screen that displayed images of Fox movies and TV shows like ''American Idol,'' Mr. Murdoch told investors, ''The story of our company is the stuff of legend.'' He praised the success of movies like ''Avatar'' and the company's cable channels. At one point, he told investors that Mr. Watson, despite being a consistent critic of the company, had done an interview on Fox News. ''We're fair and balanced,'' Mr. Murdoch said, echoing the network's catchphrase and drawing laughs from the audience. In a 476-seat theater just past where Shirley Temple once rehearsed, Mr. Murdoch sat next to Chase Carey, the company's chief operating officer. Investors filed through metal detectors past stacks of The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, both owned by News Corporation. A scattering of protestors, including one wearing an oversize Rupert Murdoch mask, picketed outside the studio's Pico Boulevard gate. One sign carried the message, ''Lying is wrong.'' Mr. Murdoch appeared rested and ready to take on shareholder challenges. He grew impatient with speakers at times and asked them to limit their questions to one minute. When Edward Mason, a representative of England's Church Commissioners, stood up to criticize the company's corporate governance, Mr. Murdoch interrupted: ''Your investments haven't been all that great, but all right.'' Activists and longtime Murdoch critics, some with odd agendas, dominated the meeting since large institutional investors do not typically air their grievances in such a public forum. In addition to questions about hacking, executive compensation and the dual-class share structure that gives the Murdoch family a controlling vote, investors asked Mr. Murdoch about animal rights and digital tools for teachers. Mr. Murdoch did get some support. A Fox employee stood to praise the company and said he had ''never been asked to do something unethical, ever.'' The billionaire Haim Saban congratulated Mr. Murdoch on his business acumen and said, ''My money is on you.'' One division of News Corporation failed to pay dividends for investors, Mr. Murdoch said. He called the handling of MySpace, which the company bought in 2005 for $580 million, a ''huge mistake.'' ''We then proceeded to mismanage it in every possible way,'' he said. In June, it sold MySpace for $35 million.  "
"In Phone Hacking Inquiry, a Renewed Focus on Executives","LONDON -- The focus on Rupert Murdoch's senior executives in the wake of the News of the Worldphone hacking scandal intensified on Monday as his former right-hand man was questioned by lawmakers and his son James was summoned to give further testimony next month.  Les Hinton, who had worked with Mr. Murdoch for more than five decades, remained inscrutable on Monday in the face of often incredulous questioning from a parliamentary committee concerning his time as chairman of News International, the British newspaper unit of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation media empire, which Mr. Hinton ran from 1995 to 2007. Sixteen former employees of The News of the World, the News International-owned tabloid at the center of the scandal, have been arrested this year. The company shut down the newspaper this summer after a series of revelations that phone hacking -- breaking into the private voice mail accounts of people in the news -- was widespread while Mr. Hinton ran the company, possibly touching thousands of unwitting targets. Mr. Hinton, who appeared before the committee by way of a video link from the United States, told the lawmakers that he still felt that he was right to say, at a previous appearance in 2009, that phone hacking was restricted to a single ''rogue'' reporter, Clive Goodman, who was jailed for the practice in 2007. It has since emerged that Mr. Goodman sent Mr. Hinton a letter that year reporting a much wider problem. ''I don't think I'd regard Mr. Goodman's letter as evidence of anything,'' Mr. Hinton said Monday. ''They were accusations and allegations.'' Mr. Hinton said he had not been questioned by the British police or by anyone within News Corporation over his role in the matter, and he denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Hinton stepped down from his most recent post at News Corporation -- the publisher of The Wall Street Journal -- in July, as the scandal was making headlines, saying that although he was ''ignorant of what apparently happened,'' he felt that resigning was the right thing to do. Two members of the committee criticized him at the hearing on Monday for his repeated insistence that he did not recall important events, was not told of significant developments or was absent at crucial moments. Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of Parliament with a background in journalism, described Mr. Hinton as ''a mushroom'' because he seemed ''to have been kept in the dark by a lot of people.'' Mr. Hinton responded that the events he was being asked to recall were several years in the past. Shortly after the hearing, the committee announced that it would recall James Murdoch, who heads his father's European and Asian businesses, to give further testimony on Nov. 10. Former senior executives have said that James Murdoch was probably aware that phone hacking was widespread at the company before he authorized a large payment in 2008 to settle a lawsuit over the practice. He denies the accusation.  "
Cable TV and Movies Buoy News Corp. Profits,"News Corporation used its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday to highlight the success of its cable television and film units while trying to redirect investors' attention from a phone hacking scandal at the company's British newspaper unit. Buoyed by channels like Fox News and FX and the strong box-office performance of 20th Century Fox's ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' News Corporation reported operating income of $1.39 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, up 21 percent from the same period last year. Cable television provided 56 percent of the company's total operating income.  News Corporation reported a slight drop in net income to $738 million, or 28 cents a share, from $775 million, or 30 cents a share, last year. The decrease in an otherwise strong quarter was partly the result of fees related to an abandoned bid for the British broadcaster BSkyB. The company dropped that bid in July amid the outrage that followed the phone hacking revelations. Also contributing to the decrease was a $90 million tax benefit that lifted net income for the same quarter last year, said Reed Nolte, the company's senior vice president for investor relations. Chase Carey, News Corporation's president and chief operating officer, said he did not have anything new to add about the hacking scandal, though he said the company had a ''fully reserved'' fund to pay legal fees related to it. Instead he chose to emphasize the company's slate of diverse businesses. ''An earnings call is a good time to shift gears to talk about our operations,'' Mr. Carey said on a conference call with analysts and reporters. Rupert Murdoch, the company's chairman and chief executive, did not participate in the call. This summer, News Corporation carried out a $5 billion stock repurchase plan, which helped deflect investors' attention away from the company's embattled British newspaper operation. The company's earnings were reported after the markets closed on Wednesday, and in after-hours trading, News Corporation's stock rose 1.18 percent, to $17.10. ''The troubles raised by phone hacking have allowed shareholders to see some real positives,'' said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities. The company's push to get higher affiliate fees for cable networks paid off. Cable networks made $775 million in total operating income, an 18 percent increase from last year. Mr. Carey said shows like ''Sons of Anarchy'' helped ratings at FX climb 17 percent in the current season. He called Fox News a ''juggernaut'' and said the network's affiliate fees should continue to grow. News Corporation's film entertainment unit produced a 24 percent increase in operating income over last year, driven by $450 million in worldwide box office receipts for ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes.'' Higher retransmission fees and robust advertising spending on the Fox broadcast network helped offset expensive marketing campaigns to introduce fall shows. Operating income at the company's publishing unit fell 38 percent, to $110 million, partly from the closing of its News of the World tabloid, which was shut down after an investigation into phone hacking. The company reported a $91 million pretax charge related to its British newspaper unit. The Wall Street Journal had an increase in advertising and subscription revenue. Mr. Carey said the company was on track to meet its financial goals for its fiscal year, which ends in June. Despite its efforts to deflect attention from the scandal, the problems in Britain are sure to draw new scrutiny. On Tuesday, Parliament released documents in which an outside lawyer hired by the British newspaper unit warned in 2008 of a ''culture of illegal information access'' at the tabloid. The documents do not say whether the lawyer directly alerted James Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch's son and News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer. James Murdoch has said he did not know hacking extended beyond one rogue reporter. At a Parliamentary hearing in September, two former News Corporation executives contradicted earlier testimony from James. They said they had informed him that hacking at News of the World was more widespread. James will again testify before British lawmakers next week. Last month, 35 percent of votes cast by shareholders opposed the re-election of James Murdoch to the News Corporation board, raising questions about whether James would take over the company. His ascension once seemed inevitable. Similarly, 34 percent of shareholders opposed the re-election of Mr. Murdoch's older son, Lachlan, to the board. Mr. Carey said the company took shareholder votes ''seriously'' but that it was ''proud of the current board.'' He defended James's position in the company. ''We have great confidence in James. James has done a good job and we are not contemplating any changes,'' Mr. Carey said.  "
Journalist's Arrest Adds to Woes of Murdoch's British Empire,"LONDON -- A journalist at the tabloid The Sun was arrested Friday on suspicion of making illegal payments to police officers, a sign that a scandal has spread beyond The News of the World to other papers in Rupert Murdoch's British media empire. The suspect, a 48-year-old man, is the sixth person to be arrested in Scotland Yard's investigation into illegal payoffs by newspapers to police officers in the wake of the phone hacking scandal at The News of the World. He was arrested outside London ''in connection with allegations of corruption,'' the police said, and taken to a police station in southwest London for questioning.  The police would not identify the man, but News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch's media conglomerate, said in a statement that he was a News International employee, and people at the company have identified him as Jamie Pyatt, a senior journalist at The Sun, the Murdoch-owned tabloid that is the most popular daily newspaper in Britain. The arrest suggests that payoffs to the police may have extended beyond The News of the World, which was closed by Mr. Murdoch in July in an effort to contain the scandal, to other parts of the Murdoch newspaper stable. Mr. Pyatt is the first journalist not employed by The News of the World to be arrested in connection with the police corruption case; he has been at The Sun for more than 20 years and has never worked at The News of the World. In 2006, Mr. Pyatt, the newspaper's district editor, won the Scoop of the Year prize at the British Press Awards for his report on how Prince Harry, the younger son of Prince Charles, attended a costume party dressed as a Nazi. There is increasing evidence that The Sun might also have been involved in phone hacking, a technique used to illegally intercept voice mail messages. Documents in the case of Guy Pelly, who sued News International this year when it became clear that his phone might have been hacked, show that information illegally obtained by The News of the World was passed to The Sun ''from time to time.'' Scotland Yard opened the investigation into police payoffs by journalists, known as Operation Elveden, this summer after e-mails turned over to the police by News International showed that its journalists might have paid more than $200,000 to police officers in exchange for news tips, including information about the movements of members of the royal family. Those arrested in the Elveden case so far include Andy Coulson, former editor of The News of the World and the former chief spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron; and Rebekah Brooks, who also worked as the editor of The News of the World and is a former chief executive of News International. Operation Elveden is running alongside the phone hacking investigation, known as Operation Weeting, which has produced 16 arrests so far. No charges have yet been brought in either inquiry; typically, suspects are questioned, released and asked to present themselves to the police for possible criminal charges at a later date. Meanwhile, News International announced Friday that it had set up what it called a ''speedy, cost-effective alternative to litigation'' that would allow phone hacking victims to apply for swift out-of-court settlements through a company Web site. The purpose of the program, called the Voicemail Interception Compensation Scheme, is to ''process good claims quickly to an award of compensation, not to get bogged down in complex legal arguments and speculative requests for disclosure of documents,'' the company says on the site. People claiming to be victims and wanting compensation are asked to fill out and submit electronic forms detailing their claims. News International has already set aside more than $30 million to pay phone hacking victims; this move is intended to contain its legal costs as it deals with an increasing number of claims. Earlier this week, the police admitted that as many as 5,795 people might have been victims of The News of the World's phone hacking. This summer, they said the figure was 3,870.  "
A Murdoch Holds Fast In the Face Of a Storm,"LONDON -- Nothing rattled James Murdoch. Not being compared to the Mafia boss of a criminal enterprise run on fear and omerta. Not being accused of being willfully blind, shockingly incurious or curiously casual about his corporation's money. During two and a half hours of forensic, skeptical and even rude questioning from a parliamentary panel on Thursday, Mr. Murdoch, the 38-year-old deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, never wavered from his original account: that he had learned only recently that phone hacking had been widespread at the company's tabloid News of the World, now defunct. He said he had never misled the committee in earlier testimony in July. And he all but accused two former underlings, whose accounts directly contradicted his, of lying about it. Much was riding on how Mr. Murdoch handled the lawmakers' questioning, including his personal credibility and the health of the News Corporation media empire. The hacking scandal has tarnished the company, forced it to summarily shut down a newspaper, scuttled its $12 billion bid to acquire the satellite giant British Sky Broadcasting, destroyed its symbiotic relationship with Britain's political establishment, and added to the strains between Mr. Murdoch and his father, Rupert, the company's chairman.  At least 16 former employees have been arrested, including two former editors of The News of the World. (None has yet been charged.) A number of executives, including Les Hinton, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and chief executive of Dow Jones, have resigned. Throughout his appearance before the panel, the House of Commons' committee on culture, media and sport, a calm and confident Mr. Murdoch sought to portray hacking as a problem of the past and something that had forced the company to re-evaluate its practices. ''It is a matter of great regret that things went wrong,'' he said. Mr. Murdoch said he had first been made aware of an unresolved hacking problem in the spring of 2008, when he was briefly executive chairman of News International, News Corporation's British newspaper arm. That was when company executives asked for his approval to settle a case with Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who had accused The News of the World of hacking his phone. The executives had in their possession several pieces of internal evidence showing that Mr. Taylor was right, and that phone hacking at The News of the World was not limited to one reporter or one incident, as the company would later publicly and repeatedly assert. But Mr. Murdoch said that no one showed any evidence to him, even as he was urged to approve a large payment to Mr. Taylor. ''None of these things were made available to me or discussed with me,'' he said. ''I was given sufficient information to authorize an increase in the settlement offer. But I was given no more than that.'' His assertion directly contradicted the testimony of two former executives -- Colin Myler, then the editor of The News of the World, and Tom Crone, then News International's chief legal officer. The pair contacted the committee in July, after Mr. Murdoch's initial testimony, to say that he had not told the truth. They had indeed, they asserted, told him about an incendiary piece of evidence, the ''for Neville'' e-mail (a reference to Neville Thurlbeck, the chief reporter for The News of the World) that contained transcripts of hacked conversations and proved that hacking had gone beyond a single journalist. Mr. Murdoch said that although he was told the e-mail existed -- a shift from his previous testimony, when he claimed never to have heard of it -- no one had shown it to him or explained its significance. ''I believe their testimony was misleading, and I dispute it,'' he said of Mr. Myler's and Mr. Crone's statements. Later Thursday, Mr. Crone released a statement saying that Mr. Murdoch was being ''disingenuous'' at best. ''The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning e-mail and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,'' he said. In his testimony, Mr. Murdoch went out of his way to criticize Mr. Myler, who became editor of The News of the World after the original phone hacking case, in which the newspaper's royal reporter, Clive Goodman, was jailed in 2007. Mr. Myler should have told him what was going on and fixed it, he said. ''This was the job of the new editor who had come in, for lack of a better word, to clean this up -- to make me aware of these things,'' he said. He said that in a company of 50,000 employees around the world, ''We rely on executives at various levels of the business to behave in a certain way.'' Members of the committee, though, were openly incredulous at Mr. Murdoch's contention that when lawyers advised him to settle the Taylor case for hundreds of thousands of pounds, he had failed to ask basic questions about their reasoning. ''I find it incredible, absolutely incredible, that you didn't say, 'A quarter of a million? Let me look at that,' '' said Philip Davies, a Conservative Party member of the committee. ''I can't begin to believe that that is the action that any self-respecting chief operating officer would take, when so much of the company's money and reputation is at stake.'' In the end, News International paid Mr. Taylor $:450,000, about $725,000, in damages, plus legal fees exceeding $322,000. Paul Farrelly, another committee member, said that ''any 10-year-old'' would have asked how Mr. Goodman could have been the only journalist guilty of phone hacking when Mr. Goodman's job was to cover the royal family, and Mr. Taylor was clearly ''not a member of the royal family.'' ''Did you not say, 'He's not royal?' '' he asked. Mr. Murdoch replied, ''The details of the specific voice-mail interceptions -- those things were not at the top of my mind.'' Tom Watson, a Labour member of the committee and a persistent Murdoch critic, brought up recent revelations that The News of the World had hired private investigators as recently as a year ago to conduct secret surveillance on dozens of people, including lawyers representing phone hacking victims, and Mr. Watson himself. Mr. Murdoch said that he found the disclosures ''appalling'' and ''shocking,'' and that was sorry. Mr. Watson also asked whether Mr. Murdoch had heard of ''omerta,'' the Mafia code of silence. ''I'm not an aficionado of such things,'' Mr. Murdoch said. Mr. Watson then suggested that News International was run along those lines, and added, ''You must be the first Mafia boss in history who didn't know he was running a criminal enterprise.'' Exasperated but unperturbed, Mr. Murdoch said: ''Mr. Watson, please. I think that's inappropriate.'' Afterward, the panel's chairman, John Whittingdale, said that having taken all the oral testimony it needed, the committee would now begin preparing its report on the hacking scandal, particularly in light of the discrepancies between Mr. Murdoch's testimony and the statements of Mr. Myler and Mr. Crone. ''We're going to have to spend a long time deliberating before we reach judgments and conclusions,'' he told reporters. ''Of the two accounts we have heard, one of them is not true.''  "
Pattern of Illegality Is Cited at Paper,"LONDON --As a government-commissioned inquiry into Britain's journalistic practices opened on Monday, its chief lawyer delivered a series of bombshell revelations about what he called a ''thriving cottage industry'' of illegality at the defunct News of the World tabloid. In addition, said the chief lawyer, Robert Jay, police evidence showed that hacking was not limited to The News of the World, which was summarily closed by its owner, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, in July. Instead, he said, two other tabloids -- the Murdoch-owned Sun, and The Daily Mirror, owned by the Trinity Mirror Group -- had also illegally intercepted people's voice-mail messages, employing the same private investigator as The News of the World.  But those papers' potential malfeasance appears to have paled beside that of The News of the World, according to Mr. Jay, chief counsel to the investigation, the Leveson Inquiry, a far-reaching examination into the practices and regulation of the British news media. Mr. Jay said that 11,000 pages in notebooks belonging to the private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, reveal that he conducted 2,266 investigations on behalf of at least 28 different employees of News International, the British newspaper arm of News Corporation, over several years. Four of those employees -- listed in the notebooks under various code letters -- apparently commissioned 2,143 of those investigations. The most prolific of the four commissioned 1,453 alone. Until early this year, executives at News International repeatedly told the police, Parliament and other news media outlets that phone hacking was limited to a single ''rogue reporter'' at The News of the World. That was Clive Goodman, the paper's royal correspondent, who was jailed in 2007, along with Mr. Mulcaire, for intercepting voice-mail messages of members of the royal household. But the information from Mr. Mulcaire's notebooks, seized by the police in 2006, contradicts News International's claim, Mr. Jay said, suggesting instead a pattern of ''wide-ranging illegal acts within the organization.'' ''It is clear that Goodman was not a rogue reporter,'' he said. He added: ''Aside from the number of individuals potentially inculpated, we also have evidence of a significant quantity of illegal activity over a relatively lengthy time period. There are a number of ways in which this activity might collectively be characterized. I suggest that it would not be unfair to comment that it was, at the very least, a thriving cottage industry.'' Mr. Jay said that a total of 690 audio tapes were seized from Mr. Mulcaire's office, along with records of 586 recordings of voice-mail messages intended for 64 different people. The notebooks listed a total of 5,795 names of people who could be potential victims of phone hacking. He also said that the inquiry had seen documents suggesting that phones were being hacked as early as May 2001 -- at least a year earlier than previously disclosed -- and that the practice continued until 2009, two years after Mr. Goodman and Mr. Mulcaire were jailed. The inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, is one of three started since The Guardian newspaper disclosed in July that The News of the World had illegally hacked into the phone of a murdered teenager, Milly Dowler, in 2002, while she was missing but before her body had been found. The disclosure caused a wave of revulsion and led, ultimately, to the closing of The News of the World, the resignation of top officials at News International and the Metropolitan Police Service, the withdrawal of News Corporation's $12 billion bid to acquire the satellite company British Sky Broadcasting, and the dissolution of the close ties between News Corporation and the British political establishment. Other investigations are being conducted by the police and by a parliamentary panel, which last week interviewed James Murdoch, News Corporation's deputy chief operating officer and a son of Rupert Murdoch, for the second time since July. James Murdoch told the panel that no one had ever told him about the extent of the hacking at The News of the World -- not even in 2008, when he agreed to authorize a payment of more than $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought by a hacking victim, Gordon Taylor, against The News of the World. On Monday, Mr. Jay said that one of the questions at hand was how high up in News International ''the metaphorical buck stops.'' ''Is there a culture of denial -- or even worse, a cover-up -- at News International?'' he asked. The Leveson inquiry will examine the relationship between privacy and freedom of the press, the newspapers' code of conduct and whether Britain's self-regulating news media should have governmental oversight. In his opening remarks, Justice Leveson said that his team would monitor news coverage in the next months to ensure that no one speaking at the inquiry would be threatened by or punished in the news media. In the past, Britain's tabloids have made it standard practice to print damaging articles about their critics and those who refused to cooperate with them. Among the likely witnesses are 46 celebrities, politicians, sports stars and other public figures who have complained about media intrusion. They include J. K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books; the actors Hugh Grant and Sienna Miller; and a number of lawmakers, including Lord Prescott, former deputy leader of the Labour Party. One of the issues the judge will consider is the ties between politicians and the news media -- particularly the erstwhile coziness between lawmakers and News International. The inquiry is scheduled to fall into two parts, the first a general review of media culture and ethics. The second, into illegal activity, is meant to begin only when the police investigations and potential prosecutions are finished. So far, 16 people have been arrested in the phone hacking inquiry, including Andy Coulson, the former editor of The News of the World and the former chief spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron. Earlier this month, a journalist at The Sun was arrested on suspicion of making illegal payments to police officers, the first sign that the scandal had spread beyond The News of the World.  "
Testimony in British Hacking Inquiry Takes Debate Beyond Murdoch's Empire,"LONDON -- The actor Hugh Grant said Monday that British tabloid newspapers had broken into his home, accessed medical records and menaced his family as part of a ''cowardly, bullying and shocking'' press culture whose targets were not just celebrities, politicians and the police, but also people left vulnerable by misfortune. Through two hours of testimony before an official inquiry into press practices, Mr. Grant raised new accusations that broadened the debate to include all of the mass-circulation British tabloids, not just those owned by the News Corporation, Rupert Murdoch's media empire. Mr. Grant displayed a barely contained animosity toward press intrusion that contrasted starkly with the boyish congeniality of his film roles.  The inquiry was prompted by accusations that The News of the World, the weekly tabloid that the News Corporation shut down in July, had intercepted the voice mail messages of nearly 6,000 people, including Mr. Grant and some of his former girlfriends. But many of his accusations on Monday were aimed at The Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, two papers belonging to Associated Newspapers that are among the best selling in Britain; they had previously been untainted by the phone-hacking scandal. Mr. Grant said he could not ''for the life of me think of any conceivable source'' for an article in The Mail on Sunday in 2007 that claimed that his relationship with the socialite Jemima Khan was imperiled by late-night conversations with a ''plummy-voiced'' British-born film executive, ''other than the voice mails that were on my mobile telephone.'' He sued and won damages, he said, because the claim of any intimate relationship was false. In a statement issued shortly after his testimony on Monday, The Mail on Sunday strongly denied hacking his phone and said its information had come instead from a freelance journalist who spoke to a source close to Ms. Khan. ''Mr. Grant's allegations are mendacious smears driven by his hatred of the media,'' the paper said. At the inquiry, Mr. Grant, 51, insisted that he was not pursuing a vendetta against the press over coverage of a 1995 scandal, when the police in Los Angeles caught Mr. Grant in a car with a prostitute he picked up on Sunset Boulevard and he was fined $1,180. ''I totally expected there to be a press storm'' after that, he said, and he saw the matter as fair game. ''I'm the man who was arrested with a prostitute,'' he said later, noting wryly that his career survived the humiliation. But he saw no fairness in what happened next: Mr. Grant said that in the aftermath of the prostitution scandal, the door to his London apartment was taken off its hinges and his apartment broken into. Nothing was taken, he said, but details of his interior furnishings were published a few days later, an episode he said was the work of a cynically intrusive tabloid press ready to break the law in pursuit of scoops and profits, not of truth. He described a more recent episode in which the grandmother of his infant daughter was ''menaced'' by a paparazzi photographer who was staking out her home: when she snapped a picture of the photographer, Mr. Grant said, the photographer drove his car straight at her in the street outside her home. Mr. Grant said he suspected that his medical records had been illegally obtained for at least two articles in different newspapers, and that the police were tipping off journalists about calls from celebrities. ''A photographer or a journalist would show up on your doorstep before a policeman,'' he said. The judge heading the inquiry, Sir Brian Leveson, has said that one of his main tasks will be to consider whether there should be tighter regulation and stronger penalties for newspapers that use abusive techniques. Mr. Grant said he is a strong supporter of a freewheeling press as fundamental to democracy, but is opposed to the ''privacy-stealing industry'' that the tabloids had become. ''I'm the reverse of a muzzler,'' he said, ''but I personally feel that the license the British tabloid press has used to expropriate the right to privacy is a scandal that weak governments have allowed to continue for too long.'' Britain, he said, has a long national history of standing up to bullies, and the phone-hacking scandal had given the country the chance to rein in a bullying tabloid culture that he and fellow celebrities saw as the worst in the world. ''I just think a section of the press has been allowed to become toxic,'' he said. Referring to the journalists and private investigators implicated in the scandal at The News of the World, he said, ''It's highly unlikely they were practicing dark arts for only one title.'' The inquiry also heard from the parents of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old schoolgirl who was abducted and murdered in 2002. The News of the World has admitted hacking into her voice mail in the days before her body was discovered, and deleting messages when her in-box was full to make room for more. Her mother, Sally, told the inquiry on Monday that discovering the deletions had given her what proved to be painfully false hope that her daughter was still alive and checking her voice mail. She called on Mr. Murdoch to use the scandal ''as an opportunity to put things right in future, and have some decent standards, and uphold them.'' The inquiry has revealed startling statistics about the practice of voice mail interceptions, based on 11,000 pages of notes seized by the police from Glenn Mulcaire, an investigator employed by The News of the World. Mr. Mulcaire received 2,266 requests for interceptions from 28 journalists, his notes suggest. At least 16 former News of the World employees have been arrested in the matter so far. The Dowlers and Mr. Grant are among the movie stars, bereaved families, former intelligence officials and soccer players, among others, who are scheduled to testify in the coming days on the ''culture, practice and ethics of the press,'' the subject of the inquiry. The actors Steve Coogan and Sienna Miller, the author J. K. Rowling and the father of another missing child, Madeleine McCann, are among those expected to testify. At the outset of the hearing, the presiding judge denied a request from a lawyer for a British newspaper group to question the witnesses. He said he would afford the witnesses something they said the press had denied them: ''a right of reply.''  "
British Police Arrest Man In Scandal Over Hacking,"LONDON -- A 41-year-old man arrested Wednesday in connection with the phone hacking scandal that has rocked Rupert Murdoch's media empire was identified in British news reports as Glenn Mulcaire, the private detective at the scandal's center. The arrest, the 18th since a renewed police operation began in January, suggested that investigators may have reached a crucial phase in a case that has raised disturbing questions about Britain's freewheeling tabloid press and its relationships with the police, top politicians and even intelligence services.  In 2007, Mr. Mulcaire was jailed for hacking the phones of the British royal family at the behest of a reporter at Mr. Murdoch's News of the World tabloid. The company insisted that the illegal acts were the work of the investigator and just ''one rogue reporter.'' But in July, the scandal exploded after The Guardian disclosed that the tabloid had hacked into the phone of a murdered teenager in 2002, before her body was found. A wave of public outrage prompted three police investigations, a parliamentary panel and a public inquiry centering on accusations that the tabloid sought scoops by intercepting voice mails of newsworthy figures. How much top Murdoch executives knew, and when, remains a central question. Investigators who have examined the 11,000 pages of Mr. Mulcaire's meticulous notes on his work for the tabloid that were seized in 2006 say there is evidence that he had received 2,266 requests for interceptions from 28 journalists. The police have said that as many as 5,795 people may have been targeted between 2001 and 2009. A statement from Scotland Yard said the 41-year-old man, who remained unidentified by the police on Wednesday, was arrested in London at 7 a.m. ''on suspicion of conspiring to intercept voice mail messages'' and of perverting the course of justice. Mr. Mulcaire's lawyer, Sarah Webb, declined to comment when reached by telephone shortly after the reports identifying him as the suspect emerged. The police and government inquiries have uncovered not only widespread phone hacking, but also police bribery and political connections all the way to the prime minister's office. Two top police officers have been forced to resign. Mr. Murdoch and his son James closed the 168-year-old News of the World, were called before Parliament, and withdrew their $12 billion bid for a British satellite company under public pressure. Prime Minister David Cameron has been questioned over his hiring of a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his spokesman. Mr. Coulson is among those arrested. So far, suspects have been released on bail after being questioned, but some, including Mr. Coulson, will face further questioning and perhaps charges. The arrest came a week after a 31-year-old woman was detained in the same inquiry in the northeast of England. Scotland Yard declined to identify her, but the BBC and other British media identified her as Bethany Usher, a former News of the World reporter who is a lecturer in journalism at Teesside University. In a statement, she denied the hacking allegations. ''I worked for national newspapers between 2005 and 2008, spending two of those years at The News of the World, working largely on the road in the north of England,'' Ms. Usher said. ''At no time did I work in the Wapping office and I had little contact with other colleagues.'' The newspaper's head office was in Wapping. ''I have never been involved in the interception of telecommunications in any way and strictly adhered to the Press Complaints Commission code of practice,'' she added, referring to the regulations of British journalism. ''However, I became disillusioned through working with some who saw human suffering simply as fodder to fill pages. As such, I made the decision to find an alternative career.'' In late November, the police announced the arrest of a 52-year-old man, the first in a related investigation into computer hacking. He has not been identified by name, but was granted bail until December. According to Britain's Press Association news agency, Scotland Yard detectives are combing through 300 million e-mails from News International, a British media subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation global empire.

CNN Talk-Show Host Is Questioned in British Inquiry," LONDON -- The CNN talk-show host Piers Morgan declared on Tuesday that as the editor in chief of two British tabloids from 1994 to 2004, he knew no one who hacked phones or paid police officers for information. Sometimes annoyed, sometimes combative, often terse in testimony that he delivered by video link from Los Angeles, Mr. Morgan told a British investigation into news media practices that ''ethical considerations were interwoven into my work'' at both papers, The News of the World and The Daily Mirror.  The investigation, called the Leveson Inquiry, was set up in the wake of last summer's phone hacking scandal, which led to the closing of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid and to a raft of arrests. Witnesses have included public figures describing their misery at the hands of the tabloids and journalists describing the sometimes outrageous and illegal methods they used to get their stories. Other witnesses have testified that phone hacking was rife at The Mirror while Mr. Morgan was its editor, from 1995 to 2004; a lawyer for the inquiry said that the police had evidence that the practice went on. But Mr. Morgan repeatedly testified that it did not, and that he knew nothing about it. Nor did he admit that anything he did at The Mirror was ethically wrong. He stuck to these positions even when presented with statements apparently to the contrary that he himself had made in interviews and in his tell-all 2005 memoir, ''The Insider.'' For instance, Robert Jay, a lawyer for the inquiry, confronted Mr. Morgan with an interview he gave to The Press Gazette in 2007. In the interview, Mr. Morgan said that Clive Goodman, the News of the World royal reporter jailed for phone hacking, was ''a convenient fall guy'' for a practice ''that everyone knows was going on at almost every paper in Fleet Street for years.'' In another interview that year, Mr. Morgan was quoted as saying that ''it was pretty well known'' that reporters could hack phones by using standard access codes. Explaining these away, Mr. Morgan said that he was merely repeating widespread tales from the ''Fleet Street rumor mill'' that hacking ''went a lot further'' than Mr. Goodman's case. ''I wasn't aware it was widely prevalent in any specific form,'' he said. Mr. Morgan is not a universally popular figure among British journalists, some of whom resent his success in surmounting his tabloid roots to find media stardom in the United States. Here in Britain, he was known for being cheeky, outrageous, not always very serious, willing to try any stunt to get a story, sparring with celebrities, strong-arming politicians to give him better access -- all qualities he lays out in ''The Insider,'' whose subtitle is ''The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade.'' His testimony was important because so far, no documentary evidence has come into the public domain linking newspapers other than those owned by Rupert Murdoch with phone hacking. In a separate development, News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation, announced on Tuesday that it had settled seven more legal claims brought by people whose voice mail was illegally intercepted by The News of the World. These included James Hewitt, a former army officer who had an affair with Diana, Princess of Wales, and Paul Dadge, a man caught up in the 2005 terrorist bombings in London. But the main focus of the day was on Mr. Morgan. In other testimony, he said that printing articles based on material from garbage cans was no more unethical than the practice by nontabloid newspapers of ''taking the discarded remains'' from stories the tabloids paid for and using them ''without having to pay.'' Nor does he believe that relying on garbage-based documents for articles is necessarily so terrible, he said. ''If you throw rubbish into the street, I wonder how unethical it is if that appears in the newspaper,'' he said. ''I mean, it's rubbish, isn't it?'' Online Correction: December 20, 2011, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article contained an incorrect year for the terrorist bombings in London, which occurred in 2005, not 1995. It also incorrectly stated that Mr. Morgan testified by video from New York.  "
New Evidence Is Claimed in Lawsuit Against Cisco,"SAN FRANCISCO -- An advocacy group that accuses Cisco Systems of aiding the Chinese government in monitoring and apprehending members of the banned Falun Gong organization said Friday that it had new evidence to suggest that Cisco specifically tailored its technology for that purpose.  The Human Rights Law Foundation, based in Washington, sued Cisco, a California-based manufacturer of networking equipment, last May in the Federal District Court in San Jose, under a statute that allows American companies to be sued for violations of human rights abroad. The suit accused Cisco of having helped China build a firewall, known widely as the Golden Shield, to censor the Internet and keep tabs on dissidents. Cisco at the time said it had made nothing special for China. On Friday afternoon, the group amended its original complaint, saying it had evidence showing that Cisco customized its products specifically to help Beijing go after members of the religious group Falun Gong. A Cisco spokeswoman, Kristin Carvell, said company officials were reviewing the amended complaint and could offer no further comment. The group's evidence includes documents that the group says were part of Cisco's marketing pitch to Chinese organizations and government agencies, including a page from a PowerPoint presentation boasting that Cisco's technology can ''recognize over 90% of Falun Gong pictures'' in e-mail traffic. Another document, which the group says was used by Cisco's sales teams, described a broad public security database that would contain information on Chinese citizens, including ''key personnel of 'Falun Gong' evil cult organization.'' That database would in turn be connected to a system of firewalls and monitoring systems that could be used to filter content that the Chinese government considers to be sensitive. It is not clear if such a system was ever built, and it was not possible to verify the authenticity of the documents. According to one of the documents, the database would also contain data on Chinese citizens leaving the country, major criminal cases and motor vehicle information, and it would be connected to a video surveillance system. The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Cisco was supplying some equipment for a citywide video surveillance system in Chongqing, China. Cisco, for its part, said that it doesn't typically build databases, and that as a matter of policy it does not sell video surveillance cameras or equipment to China. Beyond the allegations made in this case lies a broader question about how technology tools can be used by repressive governments. Cisco's offerings, for instance, include tools that can track traffic going in and out of a personal computer. In principle, that equipment can be used to monitor criminals trying to steal proprietary information, or it can be used to track communications by dissidents in repressive countries. The question this lawsuit raises is whether Cisco tailored its standard suite of tools to meet specific Chinese demands. The suit contends that the authorities tracked Falun Gong members on the Internet using the Golden Shield and then apprehended them. Some were arrested and tortured, and one member was beaten to death, the lawsuit says. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Picking Locks and Hacking Servers at Defcon,"LAS VEGAS -- They sat at tables along the perimeter of a ballroom in the Rio Hotel. Lights were low. Laptops burned like campfires. Men and women hunched over the machines, their backs curved like question marks. Their fingers clicked away furiously. I had no idea what this was all about. I asked a gentleman who seemed to be among the oldest in the room. ""This is a spelling bee for hackers,"" Giovanni Vigna, 42, a professor of computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara, explained. ""It's a way to prove your hacking skills."" Each team, he said, was given the same type of virtual server, each with the same strengths and weaknesses. Each team was charged with defending its  server and attacking those of others. Each time a weak spot was attacked, a flag was awarded. The one with the most flags wins. Hence, the name of the contest: Capture the Flag. This is the final round. This year's game came with one nasty little surprise. It was conducted in what is considered the next language of the Internet, called IPv6. If you came prepared to compete in a spelling bee in English, suddenly the spelling bee was being conducted in Finnish. Contests are a big deal at Defcon, the somewhat circuslike hacker convention that takes place every year amid the circus of Las Vegas. There are workshops to hone computer security skills and panel discussions on topics that range from cerebral (""the art and science of security research"") to obtuse (""speaking with cryptographic oracles"").  It's not all computers. Defcon is about celebrating the art and science of tinkering. There was a ""lockpicking village"" where interested parties do exactly that: pick locks. ""Most of us see locks as puzzles,"" Babak Javadi, 26, one of the organizers, explained. ""A mechanical piece with lots of cool bits inside."" He has been taking apart locks since he was a kid, he said, and now runs a security business, specializing in high-security locks. There was a barber offering mohawks. There were vendors selling ""advanced gaming eyewear,"" which were basically glasses that sell for up to $189 a pair, designed to reduce the glare of a computer screen and ease eye fatigue.  There were vendors selling luggage tags that said ""Geek on Board"" and books with titles like ""Snip, Burn, Solder, Shred: Seriously Geeky Stuff to Make With your Kids."" Hackers, in other words, are old enough to make babies. At one stand in the vendors hall, I heard a man say, ""I'm considering buying one of these for my son."" I looked over his shoulder. He was pointing to a onesie with the slogan ""Born to Hack."" In another hall, a competition was under way to invent a beer-cooling contraption. In still another, teams were competing to see who could most deftly tamper with so-called tamper-resistant materials: strip tamper-resistant tape and put it back, remove tamper-resistant seals and put them back, manipulate tamper-resistant chains and restore them to their original state. ""You're doing something you're not meant to do: That's the essence of hacking,"" said Chris Kuivenhoven, 34, a security engineer from Atlanta. ""People can use it for good or bad.""   To win at Defcon is to earn the respect of the tribe. It's refreshing: conventional power and money take a back seat to skill and tenacity. It's also extremely intense. Capture the Flag began around midday on Friday and was scheduled to wrap 48 hours later. A team came from Japan, called Stutegoma2, after a tactic in the chesslike game called Shoge; they made it to the finals after six attempts and came prepared with a variety of Japanese savories and sweets, all spread out like flowers on their tables. A team made up of Belgians, French and Swiss was distinguished by the packs of cigarettes on their table and a sign that read ""No photos please"" (oh, that privacy bugaboo that Europeans have). Mr. Vigna said his team, like most of the others, would work through the night, up in their hotel room, once the ballroom shut for the night. Fifteen men in one room, I wondered aloud. Showers are mandatory, he said. He was sort of the team captain. The rest of his team were his graduate students. They had stocked up on bottled water, Diet Coke and pretzels. Red Bull was rejected. ""Red Bull crashes you, and this is a 2\xC2 day competition,"" he said. Defcon wouldn't be Defcon without a degree of public humiliation. As a first-time, un-tech-savvy journalist at the event, I was advised by organizers to not use the Internet at all. I turned off the data service on my putative smartphone and lapped up the thrill of being analog, with nothing but a notebook and a pen. An earlier version of this post referred to the University of California, Santa Barbara, as the University of Santa Barbara.   "
File Under: Huh? Norton Hires Actors to 'Stage' Facebook Status Updates,"Another advertiser is joining in a popular trend, producing and sponsoring live content that can be watched online. The advertiser is Norton, the provider of online security tools that is owned by Symantec, and its plan is to present 24 hours of original content on its Facebook page as part of what it calls Stuff Theater. The mini-marathon will be from Wednesday at 9 a.m. (Eastern time) to 9 a.m. Thursday. About 60 performers will participate, bringing to life posts, like status updates that appear on the walls of Facebook pages. In teaser video clips, produced to give an idea of what Stuff Theater will be like, a puppet shouts the name ""Haley""; an opera singer belts, ""I have a chicken pot pie craving""; and a woman dressed like a Shakespearean actor declaims a line about sweat in an, um, personal part of the anatomy. Stuff Theater, which will be performed from the Copernicus Theater in Chicago, is part of a campaign for Norton that carries the theme ""stuff,"" declaring that Norton protects the content online you consider important and valuable. Stuff Theater is being produced by two agencies that work on the Stuff campaign, Leo Burnett and Arc Worldwide in Chicago, both part of the Publicis Groupe. The budget is not being disclosed. The trend that Stuff Theater is part of is called branded entertainment, by which advertisers incorporate themselves into the plots of movies, TV shows and online videos. The goal is to avoid being zipped or zapped like conventional commercials. Offering live programming is a subset of the trend, as evidenced by a promotion in January sponsored by Hewlett-Packard called ""H.P. ePrint Live."" That promotion took place on YouTube, rather than Facebook. The goal of the Norton effort is to ""use a bit of humor and personal experience"" to ""get attention and be relevant,"" said Sally Jenkins, vice president of worldwide consumer marketing for the consumer business unit at Symantec in Mountain View, Calif. Ms. Jenkins estimates that during the 24 hours, the actors, singers, dancers, acrobats, puppets and others hired to take part in Stuff Theater will bring to life 1,000 Facebook posts. Those Facebook members who would like a post performed can click on ""Yes, I want my stuff performed on Stuff Theater"" on the Norton Facebook fan page. ""Internet security is a burdensome subject,"" said Dave Loew, executive vice president and executive creative director at Burnett. ""We're trying to find a way to say that protecting stuff is front and center, part of our digital life."" Jon Wyville, also an executive vice president and executive creative director at Burnett, called Stuff Theater an effort to ""put your social-media stuff on a pedestal and treat it with the importance it deserves, even if it's as mundane as a Facebook update.""

Web Hackings Rattle Media Companies,"It might just be the most worrisome letter to the editor any news organization can receive. PBS fought on Monday and Tuesday to restore the Web sites for two news programs on public television, ''Frontline'' and ''PBS NewsHour,'' which were crippled by hackers who said they were angered by coverage of WikiLeaks. The incidents were the latest examples of what security experts call ''reputational attacks'' on media companies that publish material that the hackers disagree with. Such companies are particularly vulnerable to such attacks because many of them depend on online advertising and subscription revenue from Web sites that can be upended by the clicks of a hacker's keyboard -- and because unlike other targets, like government entities and defense contractors, they are less likely to have state-of-the-art security to thwart attacks.  The PBS attack was said to be motivated by a ''Frontline'' film about WikiLeaks that was broadcast and published online on May 24. Some supporters of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, and Bradley Manning, a soldier who is suspected of having shared hundreds of thousands of government files with WikiLeaks, criticized the film and claimed that it portrayed the two men in a negative light. When the anonymous hackers posted a fake news article on a PBS blog and published passwords apparently obtained from PBS servers late Sunday night, they attached complaints about the film, which was titled ''WikiSecrets.'' Staff member at PBS said they were appalled by the hackings -- which were perceived to be attempts to chill independent journalism -- and, to a lesser extent, by the long delay in having the sites restored. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, David Fanning, the executive producer of ''Frontline,'' called the incidents a ''real intrusion into the press'' and said they should not be characterized as mere pranks. ''This is what repressive governments do,'' he said. ''This is what people who don't want information out in the world do -- they try to shut the presses.'' Mr. Fanning said ''Frontline'' included multiple points of view in ''WikiSecrets'' and provided forums for criticism of the film. Other staffers, speaking anonymously because they had not been authorized by PBS to speak on the record, did not point the finger for the hack directly at WikiLeaks, but some did suggest that it would be hypocritical for any supporters of such a group to try to tamp down on freedom of information. From time to time, other news organizations have wound up in the bull's-eye of hacker groups, sometimes after they have published unflattering information about those very groups. Last December, Web sites belonging to Gawker Media were forced to stop publishing when hackers gained access and stole the names and passwords of some users. Gawker had been critical of hacker groups like the one called Anonymous that had attacked security firms and Web sites of the Egyptian government. The group that claimed responsibility for the PBS attack this week, called Lulzsec, also hacked Fox.com, the Web site of the Fox broadcast network, earlier this spring and divulged personal information about some of the potential contestants on a reality show. ''We don't like you very much,'' the group wrote in a letter touting the successful break-in. Individual subjects of media coverage have also been known to retaliate using hacking tactics: in a well-publicized case that led to a conviction last year, a New Jersey man spread a computer virus that searched for mentions of his name in online articles and tried to shut down the hosts of those articles. The PBS attack appeared to start with Sunday's publication of a fake news article about the rapper Tupac Shakur being spotted alive in New Zealand. (He died in 1996.) Then, on Monday afternoon, the ''Frontline'' site was infiltrated, Mr. Fanning said. Comparing it to a rock being chucked through a storefront window, he said, ''I don't believe it will in any way hinder our continuing reporting on these sorts of subjects, but it is a cautionary note.'' Among the news sources affected was Tehran Bureau, a well-regarded source of news about Iran that is operated under the ''Frontline'' umbrella. The Web sites appeared to be back online on Tuesday afternoon. Robert Corn-Revere, a partner at the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine who specializes in First Amendment law, compared the hacking incident to the vandalism of a newspaper box or the theft of the papers from the box. ''Something like that is not a protected First Amendment act, even though you're expressing frustration with a newspaper,'' he said. When the Web site for ''PBS NewsHour'' was disrupted, staffers turned to sites like YouTube, where they posted Monday's newscast, and Tumblr, where they published transcripts and the news organization's features. PBS said that visitors to the sites did not have their personal information compromised, as has occurred in other hacking cases. ''As this breach shows, there's more than just personally identifiable information at risk,'' said Phil Blank, a security analyst with Javelin Strategy & Research. Many Web sites, he said, fail to take appropriate steps to combat ''Web site defacing'' and ''reputational risk.'' In the event of a hacker attack, news organizations, he said, ''lose both ways -- they lose from the 'Gee, don't they take care of their Web site?' perspective, and they lose from the 'How do I know the information they're putting out is accurate?' perspective.''

Pentagon Seeks a Few Good Social Networkers,"The Pentagon is developing plans to use social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter as both a resource and a weapon in future conflicts. Its research and development agency is offering $42 million in funding to anyone who can help. Social media will change the nature of warfare just as surely as the telegraph, the radio and the telephone did, and the Pentagon is fearful of being caught short. Some of its goals were laid out in a document being circulated among potential researchers and is to be presented at a briefing on Tuesday in Arlington, Va., at the offices of the military contractor System Planning Corporation. As social media play increasingly large roles in fomenting unrest in countries like Egypt and Iran, the military wants systems to be able to detect and track the spread of ideas both quickly and on a broad scale. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting innovative proposals to help build what would be, at its most basic level, an Internet meme tracker. It would be useful to know, for instance, whether signs of widespread rebellion were authentic or whether they were being created by a fringe group with little real support. Among the tools the successful seeker of government funding might choose to employ: linguistic cues, patterns of information flow, topic trend analysis, sentiment detection and opinion mining. Social networks can allow the military not only to follow but also to shape the action. In its 37-page solicitation, Darpa described how a would-be high-technology lynching was foiled: ""Rumors about the location of a certain individual began to spread in social media space and calls for storming the rumored location reached a fever pitch. By chance, responsible authorities were monitoring the social media,detected the crisis building, sent out effective messaging to dispel the rumors and averted a physical attack on the rumored location.""  (Is this a reference to Osama bin Laden or someone much more obscure? Were the ""responsible authorities"" trying to put off an attack because the individual was not at the location, or because he was? Darpa officials did not return e-mails requesting comment.)  The crisis was formed, observed, understood and diffused entirely within social media, the solicitation noted. But the success of the authorities was a fluke, the result of ""luck and unsophisticated manual methods.""  All the more urgent, then, is the need to analyze what is happening and to fight back by countermessaging. A successful program would influence attitudes through methods including automatically generating content, formerly known as spam, and ""inducing identities,"" which might be whipping up fake combatants.  All of this cyberwarfare will, of course, make it even less clear what is real and what is synthetic on the Internet, but that is not the military's problem and was possibly inevitable anyway. As Admiral Nimitz of the United States Navy wrote in 1948, ""Technology in warfare, as in all else, has simplified some details but greatly complicated the aggregate."" Interested participants will have to hurry. Preliminary proposals are due in the coming weeks. Darpa warned that projects that were merely evolutionary would be nonstarters.  "
A Homemade Drone Snoops on Wireless Networks,"It flies. It spies. It is the color of sunshine, and it has googly eyes. Meet WASP, the Wireless Aerial Surveillance Platform, one of the star attractions of this year's Black Hat conference for computer security professionals in Las Vegas. It's a remote-controlled plane with a computer in its belly that can fly up to 400 feet above the ground, snoop quietly on wireless networks below and attack one if it wants to. It can also pretend to be a GSM cellphone tower, eavesdropping on calls and text messages that pass through. The WASP was built by Richard Perkins and Mike Tassey using hobby materials, including Styrofoam plane body, plastic propeller and foam tires, along with circuit boards and wires. The materials are all off the shelf, costing $6,190 - a fraction of the cost of a spy plane, with cyber weapons included. Its creators eschew the term ""spy plane"" for their device. ""There's a negative connotation to a spy plane,"" Mr. Tassey said. ""This was done in an attempt to prove a concept."" What concept? ""That it can be done,"" he said. His sentiment perfectly embodied the ethos of Black Hat, a spirited gathering of technologists who sometimes make scary things to show that they can be made, and other times break things to show how badly they need to be fixed. At the same conference, for instance, a diabetic hacked into his electronic insulin pump and demonstrated how easily it could be shut down remotely, depriving a patient of insulin or worse, pumping in far more insulin than he needed. And a pair of security researchers demonstrated how easy it was to extract money from stolen credit cards, using the card-reading device distributed by Square.  The bird conjured by Mr. Perkins and  Mr. Tassey is barely four feet long and becomes an imperceptible, quietly humming little creature when it hovers overhead. Its vital assets are distance and anonymity. It would be easily deployed over, say, an office building to sniff out information going across its wireless network. Or if the office network is well secured, the plane could follow one of its employees on a trip to a neighborhood Starbucks to use the cafe's Wi-Fi network. The WASP could mimic the cafe's network, luring the unwitting employee and allowing access to a laptop or cellphone. As Mr. Tassey put it, ""In Starbucks, no one can hear your laptop scream."" Both  men have day jobs helping the federal government keep their information systems secure. They say they have no plans to make money on their device, nor to snoop on anyone, only to show how cheap and easy it can be to snoop and attack.   "
Fraud and Online Learning,"Online college courses have made higher education possible for untold numbers of working adults who cannot enroll in traditional classes and need flexibility to receive instruction at home. But online courses are also particularly vulnerable to student aid fraud, a growing problem that federal officials must move quickly to control.  A report from the Department of Education's Office of the Inspector General says that since 2005 it has opened 100 investigations and is evaluating 49 additional complaints, including one that could potentially involve as many as 10,000 participants. Distance-learning students rarely show up on any campus, so their identities can be easily falsified. Fraud rings target community colleges and other open-enrollment schools that offer low-priced, online programs. The fraud rings enroll ''straw'' students who provide their names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers to obtain federal financial aid. The ring leaders then take a share of the student loan money that schools disburse to students after tuition and other allowable costs are paid. In one case, a defendant at an online community college in Arizona incurred only $600 in tuition and fees for a summer course, but was awarded a total of $7,060 in federal aid, which is generally calculated based on income eligibility. This money is meant to cover living, transportation and other expenses that online students may not incur. Fraud rings have succeeded in enrolling prison inmates, even though they are not eligible for federal student aid, as well as ''students'' who were illiterate. The inspector general's office says participants in 42 different fraud rings have been convicted and more than $7.5 million in restitution and fines have been ordered in the past six years. This may be only a small portion of the problem. Some rings involve hundreds of participants, and it is unlikely that either the Office of the Inspector General or the Department of Justice has resources to track down and prosecute them all. To improve security, the government needs to put colleges on notice that they are responsible for disbursing aid to eligible students only. It should not allow payments for expenses a student does not actually have. Congress should change student aid to fix this problem.  "
"In Europe, Web Thefts Halt Carbon Trading","BRUSSELS -- The European Commission suspended trading in greenhouse gas emissions permits on Wednesday for at least a week after the theft of permits worth millions of euros via online attacks. The Emissions Trading System was a target of ''recurring security breaches'' over the last two months, the commission, the executive agency of the European Union, announced on its Web site Wednesday. The commission said it needed to shut the system down until at least Jan. 26 because ''incidents over the last weeks have underlined the urgent need'' for enhanced security measures.  The attacks raised new questions about the viability of Europe's main tool to combat a rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The stolen permits are part of Europe's effort to cap the amount of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, that companies may emit each year. Europe's system is the world's largest market for greenhouse gas emissions credits. Companies exceeding their emissions quotas buy certificates from companies that succeeded in shrinking their carbon footprint by, for example, adopting lower-emission technology or modifying production in other ways. Some of the thefts of credits early this week were from electronic registries in Austria, Greece, the Czech Republic, Poland and Estonia, said Maria Kokkonen, a spokeswoman for Connie Hedegaard, the Europe's commissioner for climate action. ''It could be a concerted action by fraudsters to get access and steal permits from legitimate accounts to sell on spot markets before the thefts were discovered,'' Ms. Kokkonen said. The permits stolen from the Czech registry were worth about 7 million euros ($9.3 million), she said. She was unable to comment on the value of the allowances stolen in other countries. Analysts said the thefts added up to a serious challenge to the system, which Europe wants other parts of the world -- the United States included -- to emulate. ''Although such incidents are negligible in terms of actual market impact, they will over time undermine the credibility of carbon trading as a policy measure to reduce emissions in Europe,'' said Kjersti Ulset, a manager at Point Carbon, a company that reports on emissions markets and provides consultancy services. Europe issued security guidelines after a similar attack in early 2010, but the latest case will almost certainly force the authorities to invest in new and more secure hardware. ''By investing tens of thousands of euros to upgrade their I.T. systems, member states could prevent losses on the scale of millions of euros,'' Ms. Kokkonen said, referring to information technology systems. Europe's system has had a rocky ride since trading began six years ago, including extreme volatility, tax fraud, recycling of used credits and suspicions of profiteering, in addition to online attacks. One year ago, swindlers used fake e-mail messages to obtain access codes for individual accounts on the national registries that make up Europe's system. Traders and companies who fell for that ploy were directed to a rogue Web site and invited to enter their security codes -- a practice known as phishing. The swindlers used the stolen codes to gain access to electronic certificates that represent quantities of greenhouse gases. They then sold the certificates through trading accounts registered in Denmark and Britain. That attack was estimated to have netted the swindlers as much as $4 million from Germany alone. Ms. Kokkonen said Wednesday that it was still unclear what methods were used to steal the permits in the latest attacks and that authorities still were looking into the matter.  "
Security Freezes: How They've Worked Out for You,"In this weekend's ""Your Money"" column, I write about security freezes, also known as credit freezes, in the wake of the big customer data breach at Sony. After such a breach, standard best practice now seems to be to offer affected customers credit monitoring or something similar. But no companies (or employers, who have experienced plenty of breaches, too) ever seem to offer security freezes, which allow the person who sets them up to keep anyone from accessing their credit reports. Without that access, companies generally won't set up a new account, which keeps the bad guys from opening new accounts in your name. Sony, too, isn't offering its customers free credit freezes, alas. I've had my files frozen for years, and thawing them to refinance a mortgage or get a new credit card rarely requires little more than 10 or 15 minutes of effort, plus a bit of money to pay the fees. Are your credit files frozen, and if so, how has it worked out for you? Anyone out there refused to freeze their files for whatever reason?   "
Major Record Labels Settle Suit With LimeWire,"Ending a five-year court battle over music piracy, the major record companies on Thursday settled a copyright infringement lawsuit with LimeWire, a popular file-sharing network, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations. Details of the settlement were not immediately available. In the suit, filed in 2006, the labels accused LimeWire of running a Web service ""devoted essentially"" to piracy, by allowing users to upload and download songs without permission. LimeWire began in 2000, and the labels contend that Mark Gorton, the site's creator and a defendant in the case, continued to operate it even after the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that a similar service, Grokster, could be held liable for infringement.  The labels identified more than 9,000 recordings made since 1972 that had been traded on LimeWire without permission, and sought damages of up to $150,000 for each song, or more than $1.4 billion in total.  Judge Kimba M. Wood of United States District Court in Manhattan ruled last year that LimeWire had violated copyright, and when the settlement was reached, the case was in trial to set damages. Mr. Gorton's lawyers had argued that illegal file-sharing was not solely responsible for the music industry's woes, pointing to CD counterfeiting, bankruptcies of major music retailers, and other problems. ""The record companies know and have known that their problems started well before LimeWire,"" Joseph Baio, LimeWire's lawyer, told the jury in his opening statement.   "
The Trouble With E-Mail,"Among Internet users with secrets, including bankers, lawyers, hackers and people who visit porn sites or confide in friends - so that would be all of us - there's a widespread apprehension that the Web is no longer a safe place to spill them. You can see that wariness in e-mail, which for years has been considered a spontaneous and freewheeling form, better known for gaffes and rants than anxiety and circumspection. As recently as 2008, Will Schwalbe and David Shipley described e-mailers as inveterate hotheads in their manual ""Send.""  ""On e-mail, people aren't quite themselves,"" they wrote. ""They are angrier, less sympathetic, less aware, more easily wounded, even more gossipy and duplicitous.""  Oh, how times have changed. The idea that e-mail is chiefly a conduit for anger and lies seems almost quaint. After too may careers ruined and personal lives upended by online indiscretions, it should now be crystal clear that there are some things one must never, ever commit to e-mail.  And that's why some bankers developed ""LDL."" ""LDL"" - which means ""let's discuss live"" - is an acronym that surfaced during the S.E.C.'s investigation of Goldman Sachs for its role in the nation's financial shame spiral. How do the pros use it? Goldman's Jonathan Egol is the first known master. When a trader named Fabrice Tourre described a mortgage investment in e-mail as ""a way to distribute junk that nobody was dumb enough to take first time around,"" Egol shot back: ""LDL."" See how that works? Wanna talk about junky mortgages? Let's get off the %#^ Internet.It works with other topics, too. Problems at home? LDL. State secrets about Egypt? LDL. How much you paid for your house? LDL.  ""LDL"" and its equivalents - tonal inversions of the carefree LOLs of e-mail past - are the most succinct ways Internet-users now express the desire to ditch the Web and seek analog pastures. And as much as the banker chat that was revealed in e-mail seems galling, it's the rare Web-user who'd willingly submit his own e-mail archive to prosecutorial scrutiny. LDL, for those who have the option, is an extremely good idea. Nearly everyone needs some form of communication that's not searchable, archivable, forwardable, discoverable and permanent. Of course, the longing for more in-person exchange is also part of the broader nostalgia a time before the Internet, when copyright and privacy seemed enforceable, and traditional business models obtained.  These grander sentiments were on theatrical display scale last week at eG8, the Internet-themed prelude to the G8 conference in France. Both conferences, like other jetset global conferences, are the very definition of LDL, existing solely to facilitate actual, physical elbow-rubbing among human beings like Jimmy Wales, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg.  At eG8, McKinsey submitted eye-popping research that showed that Internet-related consumption and expenditure in the G8 nations is now bigger than agriculture or energy. As if freshly aware of this economic monster, scores of high-profile global lawmakers, including Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, then spoke of the Internet as wilderness that they intended to colonize with official government overseers.  But it's not just French rhetoricians, using the language of the 19th century, to whom the Internet of today seems dangerously anarchic. Bloggers and others now chronicle their breaks from the Internet, periods of withdrawal from electronic communication. They also tighten privacy settings; they close Facebook pages. Their e-mails, texts and IMs become more pro forma and less expressive. It's been a year since the arrest of Bradley Manning, the army intelligence analyst who is believed to have yanked thousands of documents off the government's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet. Manning passed those documents on to WikiLeaks using Tor Hidden Services, a secure network that protects users from surveillance and traffic analysis. WikiLeaks started to publish them. And then Manning appears to have described his feat in an online chat with a hacker named Adrian Lamo, who turned him in.  To many observers, the lesson of WikiLeaks was not about Turkey or Saudi Arabia or national security. It's that no one's online communication - not the government's Secret Internet Protocol, not Bradley Manning's hacker chatroom - is secure. WikiLeaks has become a kind of Ruby Ridge for some Web users: an event that crystallized the perception that the Internet is embattled and that spies are everywhere.  Suddenly it seems, as they used to say in Tintin comics, these walls have ears. I see how this happened, but I can't help but remember the day I became 73773.143@compuserve.com It was 1993, and I'd clearly lucked into a good address - highly memorable with all those 7s and 3s. (That same year, President Clinton became 75300.3115@compuserve.com)  With e-mail, my inhibitions about traditional conversation fell away: there was no blushing or lisping or stuttering on e-mail. If traditionalists who disdained typing or excelled at office banter felt left out by electronic communication, millions of other personalities were brought to life by it. In the early 1990s there were some 15 million e-mail accounts worldwide. By the end of 1999 there were 569 million. Today there are more than 3 billion. E-mail, then, c'est nous. But we can't say no one warned us. We've all seen too many crises, personal and public, not to know that e-mail is not a place for secrets.  Note: The reference to Bradley Manning has been adjusted to indicate that he is only under suspicion of having disclosed diplomatic cables and intelligence reports.  "
Canadian Inquiry Finds Privacy Issues in Sale of Used Products at Staples,"OTTAWA -- An audit by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada found that used and refurbished products sold by Staples frequently came with an unwelcomed feature: other people's personal information. The office purchased 149 devices - including computers, memory cards and U.S.B. drives - at 17 Staples stores across Canada. Although the packaging on most of them claimed that the store had verified that the devices had been wiped clean, about one third of the auditor's purchases still held personal information. That included, among other things, passport number, social insurance numbers (which are similar to Social Security numbers in the United States), employment information and academic transcripts. The auditors also found previous owners' trip histories on two G.P.S. units. The office has a long history with Staples. In 2008, after an earlier audit, the retailer agreed to improve how it removed data from items destined for resale. But the most recent audit was opened after the privacy commissioner continued to receive complaints about Staples. ""It is disappointing that the issue that prompted our audit in the first place remained unresolved,"" Jennifer Stoddart, the privacy commissioner, said in a statement. ""If Staples is unable to remove all customer data from a particular manufacturer's device, it should not be reselling that device."" The privacy commissioner for the province of Alberta also recently found similar failings at Staples. In a statement, Staples' Canadian subsidiary said it ""cooperated fully with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and responded positively to all of the privacy commissioner's recommendations well before the release of this audit."" It added that many of the issues raised in the audit ""represent industry-wide challenges"" and called for industry standards on customer privacy. Staples has agreed to pay for a third audit, which will be conducted over the next year by an independent third party. If that audit shows continued problems, the privacy commissioner can begin an investigation and ultimately prosecute the company. Valerie Lawton, a spokeswoman for the privacy commissioner, said that was unlikely, however. ""We are confident that Staples will comply with our recommendations,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""Our collaboration with the company has been good to date and most of our recommendations are already being implemented.""  "
How to Know if You've Been Hacked,"News about hackers breaking into company databases and making off with sensitive customer information -- and crowing about it online -- just keeps coming. You may reasonably wonder if they got yours. A definitive answer is elusive, unfortunately. In many cases, like that of Epsilon or the recent hack at Sega, people who were affected will probably only find out if the companies come clean and send out a notification -- or they become identity-theft victims. But now there is an easy way to find out if you've been caught up in recent hacks by the likes of LulzSec and Anonymous, who claim to be in it for the ""lulz"" (fun) or are trying to make a political statement and have published their data hauls online for dramatic effect. An Australian technology professional and former security consultant, Daniel Grzelak, has built a Web site, ""Should I Change My Password?, where you can check whether your information is in 13 publicly available stashes containing more than 800,000 stolen records.  To see if your info is there, simply visit the site and type in your e-mail address -- he promises that he will not capture or store it. If it's found, you will be told how many times and get tips for creating strong passwords and using them safely. Mr. Grzelak said in an e-mail that he created the tool for family and friends who had heard about the ""LulzSec shenanigans"" and were concerned about what it meant for them. ""I wanted to give them A, an easy way to check if they were affected and B, some simple advice on what to do if they were."" LulzSec and others who have taken and exposed data may not use it maliciously themselves. But more criminally minded ""underground folks either already have the databases or quickly download them, while the average person just keeps going on about their business, oblivious to the carnage; unless of course their Facebook or Twitter accounts get violated,"" he said. Mr. Grzelak intends to update his site should more databases be published. He also said he was working on a one-click mechanism to check whether company e-mail accounts were affected, at the request of organizations he didn't name. And he's looking into how to create a safe and private way to alert victims.  "
Hackers Release More Data From Arizona Police,"Hackers on Wednesday publicly exposed for the second time information they claimed to have stolen from the computer systems and personnel of the Arizona state police, in a continuation of a nearly two-month hacking spree.   A hacker group known as Lulz Security last week leaked case files, phone numbers and addresses of officers from the department in what it said was a response to the state's tough laws aimed at illegal immigrants. The latest cache contained material from officers' personal e-mail accounts, including ""humiliating dirt,"" according to a statement posted on the Pirate Bay, a site for users of the file-sharing tool BitTorrent, which the hackers used to distribute the data. A spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety said it was looking into the hackers' claims and whether its systems had been breached.  The hackers no longer call themselves Lulz Security, or LulzSec for short, after disbanding last weekend and rejoining the larger hacker collective Anonymous. They are now working under a new banner they call ""AntiSec,"" protesting corruption and censorship.  One of the police department's spokesmen was singled out for attack in the latest data release for ""bragging"" about the department's security upgrades, promising the hackers would be caught and calling them ""a cyber terrorism group.""  ""The same fate will meet anyone else who tries to paint us as terrorists in an Orwellian attempt to pass more pro-censorship or racial-profiling police state laws,"" the group warned in its statement. It also said it had spared one former officer from having his personal information exposed because it learned that he was a Navajo and planned on suing the department for racial discrimination. The disclosure followed the release on Tuesday of a pile of stolen content tied to a variety of organizations, including the governments of Brazil, Australia, Anguilla and Zimbabwe; a right-wing Colombian police unit; and Universal Music and Viacom. In a statement, the group said the action was retaliation ""against corrupt Governments (in our world this is all Governments) and corrupt companies.""  "
Internet Providers to Help Thwart Online Piracy,"In a deal with the major entertainment media companies that has been years in the making, the leading Internet service providers have agreed to a uniform procedure for notifying customers about repeated instances of digital copyright infringement. The Internet providers, including AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast Verizon and Time Warner Cable, announced the deal on Thursday in Washington with the major trade associations for movies and music, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, as well as organizations representing independent filmmakers and record companies. The new procedure, which is expected to go into effect early next year, is known as a graduated response, and establishes a series of six warnings that an Internet service provider, or I.S.P., can send a customer whose account shows signs of infringing activity. These warnings escalate from simple e-mail notifications to a set of ""mitigation measures,"" like slowed connections or a block from Web surfing altogether. As the steps progress, a user must acknowledge to his I.S.P. that he understands the notice, and the user can also contest the complaint.""This is a sensible approach to the problem of online-content theft and, importantly, one that respects the privacy and rights of our subscribers,"" Randal S. Milch, executive vice president and general counsel of Verizon, said in a statement. ""We hope that effort - designed to notify and educate customers, not to penalize them - will set a reasonable standard for both copyright owners and I.S.P.'s to follow, while informing customers about copyright laws and encouraging them to get content from the many legal sources that exist."" The agreement also sets up a clearinghouse, the Center for Copyright Information, to monitor the alert system and deal with infringement issues. The center is expected to have a board made up of representatives of both the media companies and the I.S.P.'s. The deal is a victory of sorts for entertainment media companies, which have long complained that Internet providers were not doing enough to combat piracy. Yet while the system establishes guidelines for the I.S.P.'s in how they contact their customers, it does not replace the existing legal framework for online copyright infringement. That process, established by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, allows I.S.P.'s to shut down an infringing Web site if directed by a copyright holder. The music and film industries have had mixed success recently with their campaigns to step up enforcement and legislation for copyright infringement. Last year, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the United States Department of Homeland Security began seizing Web domains suspected of piracy and counterfeiting. The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, or Coica, a bill that would give the United States attorney general additional powers to pursue infringing Web sites, stalled in Congress last year, but a modified version of it, the Protect IP Act, has passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting a vote.

Videos of Kinect Hacks in Action,"Thousands of regular people are using Microsoft Kinect to create music instruments, artworks or other projects, as Peter Wayner writes in Thursday's newspaper. Below are a few videos showing the types of things that tinkerers are coming up with. Be Your Own Souvenir  -- This project captured 3-D images of people using the Kinect's camera, then used a 3-D printer to create action figure-sized statues that they could take home. Keyboard Anywhere -- This project created invisible piano keyboards, allowing people to play music by tapping on their desk, the wall or by stomping on the floor. Kinect Flock -- This interactive art piece displays a series of particles on a screen that respond to a person's movement. When the person is standing still, the particles group together to show the person's body; when she moves, they exhibit ""flocking and swarming behaviors."" The result, according to the creators, is a simulation that ""ebbs and flows between the recognizable and the abstract."" After-Mouse -- This application, for Windows 7, allows users to search a database of consumer products, control 3-D images of the products by moving their hands. It is intended to be used in retail stores. What are the best Kinect hacks you have seen? What would you like to see?  "
Security Experts Say Police Arrested Wrong Hacker,"Did they catch the wrong guy? The British police said Wednesday that they had arrested a 19-year-old hacker who goes by the online name Topiary, and is believed to be the spokesman for the hacker group Lulz Security. But on Thursday, the Web was abuzz with speculation about the events, with many asking if the police had been duped by hackers into arresting the wrong man. Hackers and security experts who have been tracking LulzSec for months say that the police had in fact arrested someone who uses the name Topiary online. But a trail of evidence in the form of Internet Relay Chats, or IRC, and online videos posted on YouTube, led many to think that the real Topiary was still on the run. A group calling themselves the Web Ninjas, who publish a blog called LulzSec Exposed, posted evidence that the real Topiary is most likely a 23-year-old man from Sweden. The Web Ninjas have said this in the past when they posted a series of documents exposing who they think is Topiary and other members of LulzSec. The Web Ninjas also cite evidence of a video interview with Topiary that was posted on YouTube when he belonged to the hacker group Anonymous.  As we have written in the past, hackers use the term dox, as in documented, when they expose a person's true identity online. Members of LulzSec were apparently doxed months ago, although most LulzSec members denied the accuracy of the documents. The British police did not respond to a request for comment about Wednesday's arrests. Another hacker who goes by the name The Jester online and has been actively tracking LulzSec and Anonymous members, posted a private chat log that took place between Topiary and another unknown hacker. In a portion of the chat, which can be seen below, Topiary admits that he has stolen his online alias from another person, whom he refers to as a ""troll"" and who lives in the north of England, the same area where police made an arrest on Wednesday. [removed]: ah, well, you should keep low manTopiary: I can't at this point, I need to just straight up deny it 100% and flaunt it everywhereTopiary: but I trust you, you know how it isTopiary: if I go hide then people will assume the dox are rightTopiary: so I'll just act like they failed hard[removed]: True that - so you need to make a big show of disproving themTopiary: yeah well, this is my plan:Topiary: (as you know I stole this nickname from a troll last December, didn't work out so well)Topiary: I'll just keep denying it until they try to go after the trollTopiary: then they'll think that's me and harass him[removed]: then he harasses back?Topiary: yeah but if I deny my real dox enough, people will go looking for other doxTopiary: then nobody will believe I'm me Topiary is believed to be the main spokesman for LulzSec, often communicating with the public via the LulzSecTwitter feed and Web site. He is known for his sly writing and sarcastic yet playful language. Although Topiary has announced several times in the past that he plans to retire from LulzSec and public hacking, he often re-enters the spotlight days later.   "
A Perp Walk on Twitter,"Lifting a page from the hacker's handbook, the Greater Manchester Police are naming and shaming rioters on their Twitter feed.  ""We promised we'd name all those convicted for their roles in the disorder -- here we go ..."" the police announced, as they began listing the names, dates of birth and partial addresses of individuals tried in connection with the disorder, which flared across Britain.  ""Eoin Flanagan (born 01/01/1983), of Carson Road, Burnage, jailed for eight months for stealing clothes,"" read one post.  ""Jason Ullett (born 15/10/72) of Woodward Court, Ancoats, sentenced to 10 weeks in prison for swearing at police officers,"" read another.   And another: ""Stefan Hoyle (born 27/01/1992) of St. Stephen Street, Salford, jailed for four months for theft after found with a stolen violin.""  Think of it as a new kind of perp walk, but very much in the tradition of hackers who are fond of outing their rivals online.  The police department's efforts received both praise and criticism, along with a few questions. The department explained that it released dates of birth so as to avoid confusion with individuals with the same name.  Both the Manchesterand Londonpolice have also posted photo streams on the photo-sharing site Flickr and asked the public to help identify riot suspects.  It is now commonplace for law enforcement authorities worldwide to use social media sites, like Facebook, in investigations. To publicize the identities of rioters is less common.  The Manchester police seem to be keenly aware that they are treading on new territory. ""Lot of debate about publishing details - courts very clear, justice should be done publicly,"" read one of its recent posts on Twitter.     "
Anonymous Protest Turns Tumultuous,"10:00 p.m. | Updated  Anonymous may be better at hacking than at organizing a protest. More than a dozen members of the hacker group Anonymous joined a small group of San Francisco residents Monday evening to protest the fatal shooting of a 45-year-old man by police officers last month. The protest, which began peacefully, became more chaotic when individuals tried to disrupt the transit system at a  Bay Area Rapid Transit station. Police officers in riot gear closed the station gates while protesters chanted at them.  Last week, during a similar protest, BART officials killed wireless and cellular activity at a number of BART stations with the hopes of quelling protesters. In response, Anonymous members hacked myBart.org, a Web site for BART riders, and leaked the names, phone numbers and passwords of many of the site's users. The Federal Communications Commission said Monday that it was investigating BART officials' decision to cut cellular service. Several Anonymous members wearing the group's well-known Guy Fawkes masks said they had organized the protest to ensure that BART officials did not cut cellular and wireless services again. Daniel Hartwig, deputy chief of police for the BART police department, said officials had not disrupted cellular activity in the train system, but officials had decided to close the train station until protesters dispersed. ""Protestors began disrupting trains and we did not feel there was safe passage for BART passengers,"" Deputy Chief Hartwig said. ""We do not oppose protesters exercising their First Amendment rights, but we do need to protect passengers.""   "
"Con Artists Claim Purchases Are Covered by eBay Motors, Crime Center Warns","Internet con artists are trying to sell vehicles they do not own, and to impart a look of legitimacy to their enterprise they are touting a fraudulent relationship with  the e-commerce site eBay Motors, according to a statement issued Monday by the Internet Crime Complaint Center. The center is a partnership of the National White Collar Crime Center, the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The vehicles are listed on Web sites other than eBay Motors, but the purchase pages claim that purchases would be covered by its Vehicle Purchase Protection program. The genuine eBay plan provides ""protection of up to $50,000 against certain losses associated with some types of fraud."" It does not, however, cover vehicles purchased on sites other than eBay. The complaint center says that the sellers claim to be in the military, and need to sell the vehicles in a hurry because of pending overseas deployments. They request that money be sent by Western Union or MoneyGram, and claim that the transactions are covered by the eBay plan. This tactic was also recently used by con artists operating a Web site that resembled Edmunds.com, the automotive news and analysis site. To gain a buyer's confidence, according to the complaint center's statement, the criminals use a live-chat feature in which they pose as sales assistants, assuring victims that the deals are legitimate and that ""safeguards are in place to reimburse the buyer for any loss.""

The Beatles Get Animated About Music Piracy,"The Beatles have thrown their support behind a grassroots campaign to fight music piracy, allowing their music to be used in a short animated video to help raise awareness of the value of original music, a publicist for campaign said. Made by the Music Matters campaign, the video does not directly address the issue of piracy. The main character talks about how the Beatles and their songs marked milestones in his life and brought people together around the world in a profound way. The animation is simple: stick figures, some with the Beatles' faces and playing guitars. The soundtrack includes tracks like ""Octopus's Garden,"" ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and ""Hey Jude."" It ends with the slogan ""That's why music matters."" ""It's a campaign to get people thinking about the ethical choices they face when consuming music,"" said Stuart Bell, a publicist for the Music Matters campaign. The campaign was begun in Britain in March 2010 and has attracted support from several well-known pop groups past and present, like the Jam, Sigur Ros and Elbow, as well as the major record labels, music publishers and retailers. The Beatles (represented by the surviving former members, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr,  and the estates of George Harrison and John Lennon) are far and away the most famous act to support the effort, which tries to encourage people not to download pirated versions of recordings. Music Matters puts a seal of approval on legitimate online sources of recordings that ensure royalties will be paid to the artists.   "
Voter Fraud: Does It Happen?,"Earlier today I dared the Internet to send me examples of voter fraud - particularly of a scale that would justify erecting barriers against whole groups of voters through photo ID requirements and other such pernicious nonsense. The Internet obliged, weakly. A few readers reminded me that the conservative columnist Ann Coulter was accused of voter fraud in 2009, for voting by absentee ballot in Connecticut in 2002 and 2004 despite the fact that she was living in New York. The Connecticut Election Commission investigated, but decided to take no further action since Ms. Coulter was a registered voter in the state and did not vote elsewhere. I never imagined defending Ms. Coulter, but this does not seem like a threat to our democratic way of life. Lots of people on Twitter directed me to posts on the right wing blog Red State, which put together a handy compilation of examples (apparently just for me). First among them was the case of the 2003 Democratic mayoral primary in East Chicago, Indiana, in which campaign workers for the incumbent paid voters to cast absentee ballots. Red State also mentions the investigation of a Troy, NY, city council race, a series of ballot ""manufacturing"" cases in Alabama, and an alleged plot by three poll workers to throw a 2005 state senate election in Tennessee to the Democratic candidate, Ophelia Ford. Suspend the elections! Demand genetic fingerprinting at the polls! If that's the worst that's out there, I'm sorry, but I'm still not afraid of voter fraud. Counting all the Alabama incidents separately  throwing in Ann Coulter, that brings us to a grand total of  cases. That is most certainly not a national crisis requiring action from the government. (It's an odd reversal, come to think of it: Liberals insisting the government butt out, conservatives demanding it butt in.) Besides, from what I can tell every one of the Red State incidents revolved around corrupt polls worker or local officials or some other functionary messing with absentee ballots. That's an age old problem but one that voter ID laws . I'm still not seeing evidence of large numbers of individuals impersonating someone else to cast a ballot or voting despite the fact that they don't meet eligibility requirements. Surely they must be out there, or the anti-voter-fraud lot would not be so up in arms. So, just for fun, let's consider an example that my Twitter followers did not cite. As the Times editorial board noted in October, Kansas' secretary of state, Kris Kobach, pushed for an ID law on the basis of a list of 221 reported instances of voter fraud in Kansas since 1997. But when The Wichita Eagle looked into the cases, it found that they were almost all honest mistakes: ""a parent trying to vote for a student away at college, or signatures on mail-in ballots that didn't precisely match those on file. In one case of supposed 'fraud,' a confused non-citizen was asked at the motor vehicles bureau whether she wanted to fill out a voter registration form, and did so not realizing she was ineligible to vote."" Maybe I'm still missing something really big (and no, not the 1960 elections or whatever LBJ may or may not have got up to in Texas more than 50 years ago). Or maybe voter ID laws, as the saying goes, are a solution in search of a problem.   "
"""Scene Near Me"" Hackers: From BigApps to TimesOpen","Avinash Dabir, Dan Blumberg and Luis Miranda are friends who live and work in New York City. Miranda works in financial services technology, while Dabir and Blumberg are media professionals. They signed up for their first hackathon, the two-dayBigApps 3.0 Hackathon put together by the New York City Economic Development Commission to ""create apps that use city data to make NYC better."" The three spent their mostly sleepless 36-hour code sprint making an app called ""Scene Near Me"". It mashes up movie locations from a city database with the Foursquare API for personal location information, so when a Foursquare user checks in, they learn if famous New York movie scenes occurred close by. Dabir narrated the experience for the demo, ""I check in from here, Pivotal Labs,"" (the site of the Big Apps hackathon). ""I get a text message alert, 'Scene Near Me: You're a stone's throw away from where scenes in Taxi Driver were filmed.'""  Those scenes were filmed in the East Village on 13th Street, between Second Avenue and Third Avenue. ""It depends on how far you can throw a stone,"" said Miranda, admitting that the app's proximity algorithms might not always be as close as a person might like. Others who tried the app and checked in from Pivotal Labs got information from Desperately Seeking Susan, or from Center Stage, a ""Fame""-like 2000 film about teen ballet dancers. ""Right now it's random, which movie comes up"" of the three possibilities, said Miranda.  The three men took second place in the hackathon's best hacks competition, as judged by a panel of esteemed city-based technologists. The group included Kellan Elliott-McCrea, CTO at Etsy, and Rachel Sterne, the chief digital officer of New York City. (The BigApps Hackathon best hack grand prize went to a street parking assistant app, ""Can I Park Here?,"" created by Eric Rataloff.) The group is continuing to work on the app, and plans to submit the hack to the larger New York City BigApps competition which will accept work until the deadline of January 25, 2012. Last week, after the BigApps Hackathon, they added links to movie reviews from The New York Times for the films whose famous scenes they tell people about (using the Times Movie Reviews API). Team Scene Near Me plans on participating in the TimesOpen: Hack Day on December 3. (Register here.) In fact, Dabir is ready to throw down, ""We're undefeated in hackdays and looking to go 2 for 2!""

"Expect Some Toning Down of Antipiracy Bills, Says Movie Industry Supporter","LOS ANGELES - Look for changes in the proposed antipiracy legislation that has giants in the entertainment and technology industries squared off against each other, but nothing extensive enough to please all of the legislation's opponents. That was the message from Michael O'Leary, the senior executive vice president for global policy and external affairs of the Motion Picture Association of America, during a telephone news briefing on Wednesday.  ""We will come forward with language that will address some of the legitimate concerns"" of technology companies that have opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House, and a similar Protect I.P. Act in the Senate, Mr. O'Leary said. He said those who were pushing the far-reaching antipiracy legislation have been huddling with Congressional staff members from both parties and both the House and Senate in the last few days, in an effort to answer some objections raised by Google, Yahoo and others who say the bills reach too far.  Mr. O'Leary appeared on the call with Kathy Garmezy, the associate executive director for government and international affairs of the Directors Guild of America, and Scott Harbinson, a government affairs officer with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The proposed bills are intended to combat foreign-based Web sites that traffic in stolen copyrighted content by forcing sites that connect to them through searches, payments or other means to sever those connections. Tech companies say that such steps would open the door to huge business and government intervention into the free flow of the Internet. Mr. O'Leary and his companions on the call declined to say specifically what changes in the bills they might support - and Mr. O'Leary strongly cautioned that he believed that some technology companies and public advocates were bound to remain unhappy with modified version of the bills. ""It's all rhetoric and there are no proposals,"" he said of the position staked out by the opponents to the bills. ""From where I sit, it's hard to see that as anything but a pretext for running out the clock and preserving the status quo."" Mr. O'Leary and his allies expressed confidence that the legislation would pass in some form. But they declined to say when or how it might move through some considerable opposition in Congress.  ""There are lots of hurdles to be overcome,"" said Mr. O'Leary, who acknowledged that the holidays and the coming turmoil of an election year would not make things any easier.  "
Opponent of Antipiracy Bill Backs Counterproposal,"LOS ANGELES - Senator Ron Wyden, who has said that he would filibuster the antipiracy Protect I.P. Act because it threatens a free Internet, now has a counterproposal on the table: let the International Trade Commission go after those who sell pirated copyrighted material on the Web from abroad. Mr. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, on Thursday joined a bipartisan group of 10 legislators from both houses in proposing what they called a ""draft framework for discussion"" of an alternative to the Protect I.P. Act in the Senate and the similar Stop Online Piracy Act in the House. Both bills would empower the federal authorities - when notified of online copyright infringement by sites based abroad - to force companies in the United States that provide services like payment collection or Web searches to sever any connection to those sites. Tech companies like Google, as well as advocates of an open Internet, have strongly criticized the legislation as a threat to free speech and free commerce. As recently as Wednesday, Michael O'Leary, a policy official with the Motion Picture Association of America, who supports the antipiracy legislation, complained in a telephone briefing that no one on the other side had come forward with an alternative plan to curb pirate sites that often operate abroad with impunity. In Thursday's statement, Senator Wyden, joined by Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, and others, proposed that the trade commission be given the power to use cease-and-desist orders against foreign Web sites that provide illegal digital imports or facilitate the import of counterfeit goods. According to those who support the proposal, such an order would prevent domestic ""transaction providers"" and Internet advertising services from providing services to the foreign site. But unlike the proposals now before Congress, they argue, this approach would not put magistrate judges across the country in the position of making determinations about infringement and trade policy. Sandra Aistars, executive director of the Copyright Alliance, an umbrella organization that supports the existing legislative proposals, was not impressed by the Wyden alternative, which she called ""impractical for individual artists and creators."" Individual creators and small businesses, Ms. Aistars said, would effectively be denied their day in court if they had to argue in Washington before the trade commission, in a process that might take 18 months, rather than pressing claims in home jurisdictions.

How a Music Site Disappeared for a Year,"11:42 a.m. | Updated A year ago, the federal authorities closed down five music sites as part of a Thanksgiving weekend sweep of dozens of sites, most suspected of selling counterfeit sports jerseys, DVDs and other goods. This week, one of those music sites, Dajaz1.com, was quietly returned to its owner, a Queens hip-hop fan who goes by the name Splash. In a statement, a spokesman for the federal agency involved, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, defended the seizure as legal but said that the government had decided not to pursue the case. ""In the case of this domain name - out of 350 seized - the government concluded that the appropriate and just result was to decline to pursue judicial forfeiture,"" said the spokesman, Ross Feinstein, referring to the total number of sites the agency has seized in the last 18 months. The news of the return of Dajaz1.com was first reported on Thursday by Techdirt, a technology news blog. To critics of the government's decision to close Web sites to address copyright infringement or piracy, the Dajaz1.com case serves as a warning on the dangers of overreach. The issue has become particularly charged now that Congress is considering legislation to give greater power to the government to crack down on Internet piracy and copyright infringement. Dajaz1 and the other music sites were suspected of infringing on copyrights by posting songs before they were officially released, and they were shut down without warning. In a detailed affidavit, a federal agent described finding dozens of ""unauthorized"" songs on the sites. But people in the music industry were quick to note that a great deal of the music on those blogs had actually been leaked by record companies to promote new releases. Civil liberties groups also objected to the seizures because of free speech and due process concerns. Splash's lawyer, Andrew P. Bridges of the firm Fenwick & West, said that the case against his client dragged on for months without explanation. The prosecutor assigned to the case, Mr. Bridges said, had obtained several extensions to a court deadline to apply for forfeiture of the property, but the orders were all sealed by the court. Finally, on Nov. 18, the lawyer said, the prosecutor told him the government was dropping the case, but offered no further information. ""I have never seen a piece of paper in this case, period,"" Mr. Bridges said. When asked whether Splash would pursue any legal action against the government for the seizure, he said, ""He is considering his options."" Two bills proposed in Congress - the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House, and the similar Protect I.P. Act in the Senate - would give law enforcement expanded powers to shut down sites suspected of copyright infringement, and would also compel Internet service providers to monitor their customers' activity and block suspicious sites. The bills are supported by copyright holders like the Hollywood studios and major record labels, who complain that the authorities are ill equipped to curb illegal sites. Technology companies, civil liberties groups and Web activists have objected to the bills as an ""Internet blacklist bill."" Dajaz1.com was reactivated this week, and it displays a video opposing the Stop Online Piracy Act, as well as a notice in a graffiti font saying, ""Dajaz1.com will be back shortly."" Mr. Feinstein, the ICE spokesman, did not respond to a question about the status of the other music sites' cases. But lawyers for two of the sites, the hip-hop blog OnSmash.com and torrent-finder.com, a search engine to find media files elsewhere on the Internet, said that they were in discussions with ICE to have their domains returned. Due to an editing error, and earlier version of this post failed to credit Techdirt with first reporting the news of the return of Dajaz1.com.  "
Daily Report: Congress Considers Bills to Prevent Piracy,"Two Congressional bills take aim at Internet sites that offer pirated copies of movies, television shows and music, reports Edward Wyatt in Thursday's New York Times. Most such sites operate overseas, but the legislation, with bipartisan support, is directed at companies in this country -- search engines like Google and Yahoo, payment sites like PayPal and ad servers -- that help the sites stay in business. The bills are highly controversial, with opposing sides lining up for battle. Silicon Valley companies, free-speech advocates and venture investors argue that the bills are too broad and endanger both Web sites and free speech. Google has hired at least 15 lobbying firms to fight the bills, while Mozilla has put a link to a petition opposing them on its Firefox browser home page. The Motion Picture Association of America and other business groups support them. A House committee is to take up one of the bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act, on Thursday. Here is the bill'stext. And for just a taste of the lively debate over the issue, here is a stream of commentary on Twitter.   "
Fresh Climategate Patter,"The blogosphere is abuzz with rumors that the British police investigation into the 2009 release of private e-mails between climate scientists has taken on new life. On Thursday, Tallbloke, an anonymous British blogger from the climate skeptics' camp, related that ""six detectives from the Metropolitan Police, the Norfolk Constabulary and the Computer Crime division"" had raided his house on Wednesday and taken two laptop computers. The police confirmed that a raid related to the e-mail inquiry had taken place in West Yorkshire and that computers had been seized.   For those of you who haven't been paying attention to the climate wars, e-mails originating on the computer servers of the University of East Anglia in England were disseminated online in November 2009. Skeptics on the science underlying climate change argued that the e-mails showed that climate scientists had manipulated data to prove their case. (The source of the leak or any computer hacking that precipitated the e-mails' release is remains unknown.)The e-mails seemed intended to undermine any progress in international negotiations on steps to arrest climate change that were held the following month in Copenhagen. But several inquiries cleared researchers of any scientific wrongdoing. Another batch of e-mails thought to date from the same time were distributed online  last month, just before another global climate conference organized by the United Nations opened in Durban, South Africa. The second trove elicited barely a shrug. Could the police be pursuing leads on several fronts, however? Tallbloke also posted a copy of a letter that he said was from the United States Department of Justice and was forwarded to him by Automattic, the parent company for WordPress.com. Automattic is a company that hosts WordPress.com Web sites, including Tallbloke's. A spokeswoman for Automattic confirmed on Thursday that it had received ""a preservation order"" from the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, the police in Norfolk, England, have been taking some ribbing online from folks who feel they have not done enough to catch the culprit or culprits who distributed the hijacked e-mails.

Revealing the Habits of Copyright Advocates,"As Congress moves forward on two bills aimed at curbing online piracy, a Web site has given opponents a way to attack those lobbying for the measures by exposing their illegal downloads. The site, youhavedownloaded.com, allows users to search through publicly available data that links roughly 50 million file-sharing users to specific content downloaded on torrent sites, which allow movies, television shows and other large files to be rapidly shared. Users of the site have said they found connections between purloined content and major Hollywood studios as well as to President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has supported similar legislation in his country.  The site works by collecting Internet Protocol addresses, which identify an individual computer at a given time, from torrent sites and connecting them to material downloaded to those same addresses, then displaying a list of content, which often contains copyrighted material.  Brian Krebs, a former Washington Post reporter who blogs about computer security, interviewed one of the founders of the site, Suren Ter-Saakov, a Russian living in Philadelphia: Ter-Saakov said he believes youhavedownloaded.com indexes about 20 percent of the file-sharing activity on the Internet. He maintains that the site was created merely as a proof-of-concept, and that it doesn't have any commercial application. But the site has shown it can be used for political purposes by those seeking to highlight contradictory behavior at major media companies now pushing hard in Congress for new antipiracy legislation.  TorrentFreak, a technology blog focused on file sharing, reported this week that it had taken a range of I.P. addresses associated with computers at three major Hollywood companies - Sony Pictures, NBC Universal and Fox Entertainment - and used the site to find that each could be connected to downloads of copyrighted material.  ""Yes, these are the same companies who want to disconnect people from the Internet after they've been caught sharing copyrighted material,"" the blog observed in a post under the name of its pseudonymous editor, Ernesto. The I.P. addresses said to be connected with the companies had downloaded numerous films, including some belonging to their competitors.  ""Of course our search wasn't limited only to these big Hollywood studios,"" TorrentFreak writes. ""We also checked the downloads at the BitTorrent Inc. headquarters in San Francisco. Interestingly there were no downloads recorded there. But there's plenty of piracy at other tech companies and other institutions."" According to the site, those included Google, which along with other tech giants has lobbied hard against the two bills now before Congress. The site is also being used in other countries by advocates of greater openness on the Internet. In France, the government passed an antipiracy law in 2009, a three-strikes measure that cuts off the Internet connection of any user caught downloading protected content three times. The law, known as Creation and Internet Law -- administered by an agency known by the French acronym Hadopi -- was strongly supported by Mr. Sarkozy.  That's what prompted Cyril Clavier, a Frenchman living in South Carolina, to target Mr. Sarkozy to see if he - or at least someone using computers at his official Paris residence - was among those downloading copyrighted material.  Mr. Clavier, a research intern at the computer science department of Charleston University, said in an e-mail that he discovered the range of I.P. addresses at Mr. Sarkozy's residence, Elysee Palace, and then ran each one through the youhavedownloaded.com site.  Mr. Clavier said that his findings proved that either ""someone using the Elysee's network downloaded something, which make them appear a little hypocrite,"" or ""someone spoofed their I.P. addresses"" to look like they belonged to the French president, ""which would demonstrate how weak is the identification by I.P."" The Elysee denied that any illegal downloads came from its computers, French radio reported.  In the Netherlands, the music royalty agency Buma/Serma, whose computers were said to be connected to illegally downloaded material, issued a press release claiming that their I.P. addresses had been spoofed, according to TorrentFreak. ""We aren't the only ones to come up with the idea of revealing the BitTorrent habits of copyright advocates,"" the blog said, adding that ""if it's so easy to spoof an I.P.-address, then accused file sharers can use this same defense against copyright holders."" Indeed, the spoofing of addresses is out of the range of the average Internet user, making it an unlikely source of misidentification in most cases. But there is another problem with trying to connect a unique I.P. address to single person in the real world: addresses that periodically change. (Google has argued that the widespread use by Internet companies of these so-called dynamic I.P. addresses means that I.P. addresses in general should not be considered personal information.) Youhavedownloaded.com does not take dynamic I.P.'s into consideration in its searches, meaning that several different people could have downloaded content in a single list provided by the service. ""Are you taking dynamic I.P.'s into account?"" one commenter on the site's main page asked. ""Because if you're not, this system is absolutely useless."" Mr. Ter-Saakov responded in a comment, saying he knew of this shortcoming but that the site is just meant to be a demonstration. The site announces itself as a way to ""scare your friends."" Many who commented are indeed scared, or even irate, and saw the site not as a tool for fighting new laws against piracy but as a way for media companies themselves to more easily look up individual users and go after them. One even suspected collusion between the site's creators and the recording and movie industries, which have aggressively pursued digital pirates: ""Your site does not explain it's purpose, are you working for the RIAA/MPAA?""  Meanwhile, in Congress, a House judiciary committee debate on the Stop Online Privacy Act was sidetracked on Thursday by a snarky post to Twitter.  On Friday, the committee adjourned for the holidays without voting on the measure, the Washington Post's technology blog reported. Debate will continue when Congress is back in session.   "
Daily Report: The Boycott Against SOPA Supporters,"The biggest news Friday is the battle in the tech world  between those who are proposing a boycott of everyone who supports the Stop Online Piracy Act and those who think that tactic is an affront to free speech. Congress would give companies some teeth to fight Web sites that publish pirated songs and movies. Opponents of the bill decry it ascensorship. Edward Wyatt wrote about the bill in The New York Times several days ago. The battle escalated when Paul Graham, an investor, said he advocated boycotting anyone who supported the bill, and by that he and like-minded people mean media companies, lawyers, entrepreneurs and investors. ReadWriteWeb noted that GoDaddy, the Web site registration service, is under threat of boycott for its support of the bill. Enter Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate brokerage firm, who warned that this was akin to a witch hunt. In a post on his company's blog, Mr. Kelman wrote: ""I just don't like bullies. Especially hypocritical bullies. If you actually believe in free speech, and not simply the free distribution of other people's intellectual property, you should let journalists, law firms and investors exercise their rights to it alongside your own. And yes, working on a bill in an open, democratic process is a valid expression of speech.""   "

Breach Tied To Nasdaq May Have Wider Effect,"As the company that runs the Nasdaq sought to reassure the public after revealing a computer breach to one of its systems, analysts said that the lingering effects may be to the company's other expanding business lines rather than to its trading. Nasdaq OMX, which runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, said over the weekend that the breach by hackers was not related to the system that handles trades. A spokesman, Frank DeMaria, said the exchange would conduct normal trading on Monday.  Federal officials also said there was no sign that the trading platform had been breached. Analysts said that the area that was affected by the intrusion was part of the company's push to offer a wider range of services to corporations and expand its revenue beyond trading fees. The computer servers that run those systems are not linked to Nasdaq's trading platforms, the company said. The company said the breach was confined to a separate Web-based application, on which corporations can store and share information. Nasdaq now handles about 19 percent of stock trading in the United States, compared with 27 percent by the larger New York Stock Exchange and its electronic trading arm. The breach ''will be a concern to listing companies and other firms doing business with Nasdaq,'' said Larry Tabb, the chief executive of the Tabb Group, a financial research business based in Westborough, Mass. Mr. Tabb said that while those products still represented a relatively small share of Nasdaq's revenue, it had expanded them over the last decade to help offset the competitive pressures that can limit trading fees. Nasdaq officials, he added, ''are going to have to put a full-court press on solving the problem as well as a P.R. press to show the listing firms that they can be confident their data was not compromised.'' The intrusion occurred late last year, but Nasdaq OMX said it had delayed notifying customers at the request of the Justice Department. Now, clients of the exchange will want to know more about how the company has enhanced its security as a result of the incident, said Patrick J. Healy, chief executive of the Issuer Advisory Group, a New York-based adviser to companies on listing their shares. Customers will also seek information about what the authorities learn about the motives for the attack, he said. Nasdaq OMX has said that it had found -- and removed -- suspicious files on its servers that could have affected an application called Directors Desk. It said the Web-based tool is intended to help corporate officers share internal governance data, and the company said there was no indication that the hackers had gained access to data belonging to the service's 5,000 customers. Other Nasdaq services help companies analyze data, communicate with investors and file financial reports. Law enforcement officials said the F.B.I.'s computer crimes branch was involved in the investigation. While the public may worry about potential damage that could be caused by attacks on banks or stock exchanges, computer security specialists said the trading systems at the exchanges have much more extensive protections against hackers, who could want to try to make money through executing rogue trades. But Gyan Chawdhary, a vice president for information security at the Markit Group, a financial services company, cautioned that an application like Directors Desk could hold inside information on earnings and other matters with potential to move markets. Mr. Chawdhary said foreign governments could mount such attacks to learn how American companies handled critical challenges. But he said hackers were more likely trying ''to gain company knowledge, which then can be used to make low risk, and high probability, investments.''  "
Trust,"The mantle of social relevance can be a heavy one, but ''Trust,'' a smooth drama about a girl's seduction and rape by a middle-aged Internet predator, is neither preachy nor hysterically overreaching.  Donning several pairs of kid gloves, the director, David Schwimmer, handles the screenplay by Andy Bellin and Robert Festinger with a restraint that can feel stifling but that mostly skirts salaciousness. Presenting 14-year-old Annie (Liana Liberato) at the center of a greeting-card family -- no problems here to make a girl especially vulnerable -- the film follows her escalating relationship with Charlie (Chris Henry Coffey), an online friend whom she believes to be close to her own age. Focusing more on the emotional aftershocks of the crime than its causes (why this popular, sporty girl would be so insecure is a mystery), ''Trust'' is commendably aware of a culture that routinely sexualizes girls. The work climate of Annie's father, Will (Clive Owen), an advertising executive, speaks volumes: the girls provocatively adorning his office walls -- and the fresh-faced waitress that his paunchy colleague creepily hits on at lunch -- are all daughters too. Like Michael Cuesta's ''L.I.E.'' ''Trust'' tries to highlight the psychological allure of the pedophile. ''I bet my dad would really like him,'' Annie tells her therapist (the reliable Viola Davis), even as Will's anguish is gradually elbowing everyone else's off the screen. The messy exchanges between Will and his wife (solidly played by Catherine Keener) are the film's best moments, ringing uncomfortably true in a world where electronic connection is often more valued -- and more difficult to police -- than any other kind. ''Trust'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Teenage breasts and old-fashioned profanity. TRUST Opens on Friday nationwide. Directed by David Schwimmer; written by Andy Bellin and Robert Festinger; director of photography, Andrzej Sekula; edited by Douglas Crise; production design by Michael Shaw; costumes by Ellen Lutter; produced by Mr. Schwimmer, Tom Hodges, Ed Cathell, Robert Greenhut, Heidi Jo Markel and Avi Lerner; released by Millennium Entertainment. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes.

Government Of Iran Detects Cyberattack,"TEHRAN -- Iran has discovered a new hostile computer virus designed to damage government systems, an Iranian official who heads a cyberdefense agency said in comments reported Monday.  In comments published by Iran's semiofficial Mehr News Agency, the official, Gholam-Reza Jalali, said the Stars virus had infiltrated government systems but was being decoded. ''Fortunately, our scientists have successfully identified the Stars virus, which has now been sent to laboratories,'' said Mr. Jalali, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander. He said no final conclusions had yet been reached about the virus's aim. In its initial state, it mimics a regular executable file. In recent days, Mr. Jalali admitted that the powerful Stuxnet virus discovered last year did indeed infect computer systems related to the country's nuclear program, but said that it was discovered before causing serious damage. Mr. Jalali said that the threat from Stuxnet had not yet been completely dispelled, and cautioned that further attacks were anticipated. ''The nation should ready itself for the next virus since it is possible that new viruses will be considerably more dangerous than the first,'' he said. Many computer security experts believe the Stuxnet virus was created by a government or governments trying to sabotage Iran's nuclear program, which Western countries believe is aimed at creating a nuclear weapon, but which Iran maintains is for peaceful purposes. After that virus was discovered last year, Iran reported delays in parts of its nuclear program.  "
Music Piracy Suit to Cost LimeWire $105 Million,"8:15 p.m. Updated Ending a five-year court battle over music piracy, the major record companies on Thursday settled a copyright infringement lawsuit with LimeWire, a popular file-sharing network, for $105 million, the Recording Industry Association of America announced.  In the suit, filed in 2006, the labels and the R.I.A.A., their trade group, accused LimeWire of running a Web service ''devoted essentially'' to piracy by allowing users to upload and download songs without permission. LimeWire began in 2000, and the labels contend that Mark Gorton, 44, the site's creator and a defendant in the case, continued to operate it even after the Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that a similar service, Grokster, could be held liable for infringement. Although the $105 million settlement is far from the $1.4 billion the labels had sought as a maximum penalty, the companies are hoping that the case will act as a deterrent to further piracy since Mr. Gorton, a former Wall Street trader with millions in personal assets, will also face liability. ''We are pleased to have reached a large monetary settlement following the court's finding that both LimeWire and its founder Mark Gorton personally liable for copyright infringement,'' Mitch Bainwol, the R.I.A.A.'s chairman, said in a statement. ''As the court heard during the last two weeks, LimeWire wreaked enormous damage on the music community, helping contribute to thousands of lost jobs and fewer opportunities for aspiring artists.'' Five years ago, Kazaa, another peer-to-peer file-sharing system, settled a suit with the major record companies for $115 million. In the suit, the labels identified more than 9,000 recordings made since 1972 that had been traded on LimeWire without permission and sought damages of up to $150,000 for each song. Judge Kimba M. Wood of United States District Court in Manhattan ruled a year ago that LimeWire had violated copyright, and when the settlement was reached, the case was in trial to set damages. In October, Judge Wood ordered that most of the service's functions be disabled, and the company said it was shutting down on Dec. 31. LimeWire had argued that illegal file-sharing was not solely responsible for the music industry's woes, pointing to CD counterfeiting, bankruptcies of music retailers and other problems. ''The record companies know and have known that their problems started well before LimeWire,'' Joseph Baio, LimeWire's lawyer, told the jury in his opening statement at the damages trial. On Wall Street, Mr. Gorton co-founded a hedge fund that in 2007 had a reported $117 million in assets. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
A Muse in the Machine: Click. Create.,"It seems almost unnecessary to introduce Cory Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker whose exhibition, ''Pro Tools,'' has opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In the ramp-up to the show Mr. Arcangel achieved something of a journalistic triple crown: profiles in New York magazine, The New Yorker and the Arts & Leisure section of The New York Times. These pieces detailed his early fascination with television and computers; his undergraduate years at Oberlin College, where he switched his focus from classical guitar to technology in music; his love of obsolete electronic equipment and programs; and the splash he made in the 2004 Whitney Biennial with ''Super Mario Clouds v2k3.'' Projected on four walls of a small gallery, this work consisted of a hacked program of the Super Mario Brothers video game, scrubbed clean of everything but its background: the puffy white clouds pulsing along on a pixelated blue sky. Its quietly animated fusion of Pop, Minimalism and giddy innocence was one of the exhibition's high points.  But Mr. Arcangel's Whitney solo turn does not quite live up to its advance attention. For one thing, it too seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts, or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides wryly with riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. The Arcangel show, organized by Christiane Paul, the museum's adjunct curator of new media arts, has the Whitney trending young, hip and fashion forward, if a bit skimpy. Mr. Arcangel, who just turned 33, is the youngest artist since Bruce Nauman in 1973 to be accorded an entire floor at the museum. Yet, like the Whitney's small lobby shows, this effort comes with only a brochure, not a thick catalog. No big case for greatness is posited; we're just being shown some fresh new art, barely six months of work. Signaling modesty and flexibility, the Whitney has momentarily shifted to alternative-space mode, which may be the perfect gesture for the week when it also broke ground for its new downtown home in the meatpacking district. As seen here Mr. Arcangel comes across as an artist who has parlayed his interest in electronic gadgetry and his infatuation with past avant-gardes into a low-affect art-about-art that too often flickers to fragile life only after you've ingested a dry, didactic wall label. The pieces on view are full of savvy echoes of early video art and structuralist film; kinetic, Conceptual and Pop art and their current derivatives; abstract painting; and, above all, appropriation art -- all of it often updated by his generation's democratic attitude toward information sharing. In that spirit three invisible works of art -- identified by labels only -- indicate that Mr. Arcangel has persuaded the Whitney to liberalize gallery conditions. The museum has suspended its prohibition of photography and let Mr. Arcangel boost cellphone reception and introduce Wi-Fi for computers, whose uses are normally verboten. This means that using such devices in the exhibition makes you part of a nominally participatory artwork. It also potentially underscores art as a momentary distraction, photo op or tweeting topic in a world of ever-shortening attention spans. The show's opening gallery is in many ways the best. The space is dominated by ''Various Self Playing Bowling Games (a k a Beat the Champ),'' a large-scale video work that asserts a virtual storm of light, noise and flashing images via six cheek-to-jowl projections of video bowling games, from the late 1970s to the 2000s, all altered so that the bowlers throw nothing but gutter balls. The label intones that the piece ''highlights the absurdities of simulating a physical experience in a virtual environment'' and that the parade of failure ''undermines both our expectations of technology and its promise of progress.'' But the work's most gripping aspect is its ever-sharper depiction of human emotion; the piece inadvertently mimes a kind of dawning of modern consciousness and existential despair by charting the evolution from the player as a pre-Pac-Man grunt, barely differentiated from the bowling ball itself, to a relatively realistic tantrum thrower, who collapses or pounds the floor after each failed bowl, like one of Mr. Nauman's furious frustrated clowns. The piece is also an anarchic reprise of the buttoned-down anthropological parsings of early-1980s Pictures art, especially Richard Prince's sequences of similarly posed models from ads for watches, jewelry or cigarettes. In an opposite corner ''Research in Motion (Kinetic Sculpture #6)'' rehearses the old saw about the similarity between modern abstract sculpture and commercial design with a series of ''dancing stands'' typically used in supermarket displays, but here conjuring, according to the label, the grids of Sol LeWitt. Whatever. The sight of them swiveling silently but weirdly in sync with the tumult of the bowling piece is among the show's nicer moments. Nearby a small monitor flashes and scrolls horizontal bands of intense color, from thick to thin to static, recalling Joan Jonas's early experiments with vertical roll and Paul Sharits's intensely chromatic flicker films. Punchy abstract color briefly holds sway in the second gallery, where 10 large, bright ''Photoshop Gradient Demonstrations'' evoke a kind of lurid cross between Color Field painting mistiness and Op Art harshness. As the title implies, these seven-foot-tall prints were made in Photoshop with a few clicks of the mouse, using pixel coordinates that are generously included in the individual titles; anyone can make them. As with the Mario cloud piece, these works bring forward and isolate background motifs, in this case ones frequently used in commercial art. Recalling photographs by Thomas Ruff and Mr. Prince, the ensemble makes a nice surround, but it is hard to imagine actually living with one of these hyper-slick pieces. Similarly it is difficult to imagine that the thousands of people who apparently downloaded Mr. Arcangel's code for hacking the clouds-only version of the Super Mario Brothers game will find much to like in this show. There's too much inside baseball. In one gallery a label informs us about the details of seven new pairs of Oakley M Frame sunglasses on a snazzy display stand: Mr. Arcangel has replaced the frames with painted bronze, seemingly parodying a certain art-world mania for hard-to-discern realistic casting. Nearby 10 boxes for Vizio 55-inch high-definition flat-screen TVs are double-stacked to form a long, low partition. This piece's title, ''Volume Management,'' refers to computer storage systems while also slyly suggesting a new label for Minimalism, with its emphasis on boxy voids of space. The label reveals that the screens are still in the boxes, conjuring Jeff Koons's early 1980s appropriation sculptures, which consisted of fresh-out-of-the-box vacuum cleaners presented in hermetically sealed, expertly lighted Plexiglas vitrines, like the expensive art objects that they soon became. Mr. Arcangel dispenses with the visual formalities, leaving everything to the imagination. The inadvertent humanism of the bowling piece occasionally reasserts itself, albeit in routine feats of bravura editing. ''There's Always One at Every Party'' is a compilation, or a ''supercut,'' of all the scenes from ''Seinfeld'' concerning Kramer's dream of doing a coffee-table book about coffee tables, pulling taut a thematic thread, ripe with Conceptualist self-reference and a kind of artistic delusion, that wandered through several episodes. ''Paganini Caprice No. 5'' reconstructs the well-known virtuoso work by Niccolo Paganini, the 19th-century violinist and composer, by grabbing individual notes from YouTube videos of amateur heavy-metal guitarists who frequently play the piece as a test of skill; it also creates a sweet, rapid-fire group portrait of music-driven souls whose dreams of stardom rarely materialize. But too often this show stalls in slight or incomprehensible works: 40 drawings, done with a relatively antique pen-plotter printer, that resemble angular Jackson Pollock scribbles; five innocuous wire sculptures made by computer-operated machines used in the manufacture of metal furniture and display racks; and a final wall painted in the custom-mixed color Jay-Z Blue, a reproduction of the color that, according to the wall label, was ''featured on a GMC Yukon Denali S.U.V. displayed at the North American International Auto Show in 2007.'' Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but sometimes he falls short, at which point it is perfectly O.K. to reach for your cellphone.

Congressman Says Hacker Sent Lewd Photo Using His Name,"Representative Anthony D. Weiner, one of the most prolific users of social media among politicians, said his Twitter account was hacked this weekend when someone sent out a lewd photograph under his name to a young woman in Seattle.  The episode unfolded Saturday night when it was reported on the Web site biggovernment.com, run by the conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart. It played out all day Sunday on the Internet, with Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represents part of Brooklyn and Queens, addressing the matter on his own Twitter and Facebook accounts, and with bloggers from the left and the right arguing about whether this might be the start of a scandal or an example of how easy it is for political rivals to harm each other's reputations using new technologies. Neither Mr. Weiner, an outspoken defender of liberal positions, nor Mr. Breitbart returned messages requesting comment on Sunday night. ''Anthony's accounts were obviously hacked,'' Dave Arnold, a spokesman for Mr. Weiner, told The Associated Press. ''He doesn't know the person named by the hacker, and we will be consulting on what steps to take next.'' Biggovernment reported that a sexually suggestive photograph of a man in underwear, shown only from the waist down, was sent to the woman in Seattle from Mr. Weiner's Twitter account. ''We've protected her name and her account, which was at one time verified to be active but has since been deleted after the photo in question was deleted,'' biggovernment wrote. ''Coincidentally, the rest of the photos in the congressman's alleged yfrog account were also deleted around 11 p.m. Eastern.'' Mr. Weiner made reference to the episode on Twitter. ''Touche Prof Moriarity. More Weiner Jokes for all my guests! #Hacked!'' He also wrote: ''Tivo shot. FB hacked. Is my blender gonna attack me next?'' He told the Web site Politico that his account had been hacked by someone who sent the photo under his Twitter and yfrog names to the woman in Seattle, one of his followers on Twitter. ''The weiner gags never get old, I guess, '' he said in an e-mail to Politico. A woman sent a statement to The Daily News that said she was the one who had received the photo and that she had never met Mr. Weiner, though she did follow him on Twitter. She also said that since the matter was made public, she has tried to delete her social media connections because she and her family have been hounded by media and bloggers wanting to know more about her. ''This is the reality of sharing information online in the 21st century,'' she said in the statement. ''Things that I never imagined people would care about are now being plastered all over blog sites, including pictures of me from when I was 17 and tweets that have been taken completely out of context. I tweeted once (it was reported that I said it twice) that 'I wonder what my boyfriend @RepWeiner is up to.' ''  "
Hackers Disrupt PBS Web Site and Post a Fake Report About a Rap Artist,"The PBS Web site briefly carried a fake article claiming that the famed rapper Tupac Shakur was alive and living in New Zealand after a group of hackers took over the organization's computer systems on Saturday night.  In addition to posting the fake news article, the group, which identified itself on Twitter as @LulzSec or The Lulz Boat, began posting passwords and e-mail addresses of people from a wide range of news organizations and other information belonging to PBS. As late as 2:30 a.m. on Monday, PBS had still not regained control of its Web site as the hackers continued to post defaced pages. Comments posted by LulzSec indicated that the group was unhappy with a Frontline program about WikiLeaks that was recently shown on PBS. The group began posting messages on Twitter about midnight on Sunday: ''What's wrong with @PBS, how come all of its servers are rooted? How come their database is seized? Why are passwords cracked?'' That message was followed by a succession of posts with links to lists of passwords and other data. Shortly afterward, it appeared that PBS was aware of the intrusion and the news organization posted statements acknowledging the hack, and pointing out that the article about Tupac Shakur was a fake. A NewsHour employee, Teresa Gorman, replied to questions on Sunday on the Twitter site, noting that the article about the rapper, who died in Las Vegas in 1996, was fake. The article was posted at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday on the PBS NewsHour news blog, ''The Rundown.'' The group posted a list of the material it had taken and a brief commentary: ''Anyway, say hello to the inside of the PBS servers, folks. They best watch where they're sailing next time.'' The group has attacked other media organizations in the last month, according to Secure Business Intelligence, including Fox News and the ''X-Factor'' television show.  "
Pentagon To Consider Cyberattacks Acts of War,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon, trying to create a formal strategy to deter cyberattacks on the United States, plans to issue a new strategy soon declaring that a computer attack from a foreign nation can be considered an act of war that may result in a military response. Several administration officials, in comments over the past two years, have suggested publicly that any American president could consider a variety of responses -- economic sanctions, retaliatory cyberattacks or a military strike -- if critical American computer systems were ever attacked.  The new military strategy, which emerged from several years of debate modeled on the 1950s effort in Washington to come up with a plan for deterring nuclear attacks, makes explicit that a cyberattack could be considered equivalent to a more traditional act of war. The Pentagon is declaring that any computer attack that threatens widespread civilian casualties -- for example, by cutting off power supplies or bringing down hospitals and emergency-responder networks -- could be treated as an act of aggression. In response to questions about the policy, first reported Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal, administration and military officials acknowledged that the new strategy was so deliberately ambiguous that it was not clear how much deterrent effect it might have. One administration official described it as ''an element of a strategy,'' and added, ''It will only work if we have many more credible elements.'' The policy also says nothing about how the United States might respond to a cyberattack from a terrorist group or other nonstate actor. Nor does it establish a threshold for what level of cyberattack merits a military response, according to a military official. In May 2009, four months after President Obama took office, the head of the United States Strategic Command, Gen. Kevin P. Chilton, told reporters that in the event of a cyberattack ''the law of armed conflict will apply,'' and warned that ''I don't think you take anything off the table'' in considering a response. ''Why would we constrain ourselves?'' he asked, according to an article about his comments that appeared in Stars and Stripes. During the cold war, deterrence worked because there was little doubt the Pentagon could quickly determine where an attack was coming from -- and could counterattack a specific missile site or city. In the case of a cyberattack, the origin of the attack is almost always unclear, as it was in 2010 when a sophisticated attack was made on Google and its computer servers. Eventually Google concluded that the attack came from China. But American officials never publicly identified the country where it originated, much less whether it was state sanctioned or the action of a group of hackers. ''One of the questions we have to ask is, How do we know we're at war?'' one former Pentagon official said. ''How do we know when it's a hacker and when it's the People's Liberation Army?'' A participant in the debate over the administration's broader cyberstrategy added, ''Almost everything we learned about deterrence during the nuclear standoffs with the Soviets in the '60s, '70s and '80s doesn't apply.'' White House officials, responding to the article that appeared in The Journal, argued that any consideration of using the military to respond to a cyberattack would constitute a ''last resort,'' after other efforts to deter an attack failed. They pointed to a new international cyberstrategy, released by the White House two weeks ago, that called for international cooperation on halting potential attacks, improving computer security and, if necessary, neutralizing cyberattacks in the making. General Chilton and the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. James E. Cartwright, have long urged that the United States think broadly about other forms of deterrence, including threatening a country's economic well-being, or its reputation. The Pentagon strategy is coming out at a moment when billions of dollars are up for grabs among federal agencies working on cyber-related issues, including the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Each has been told by the White House to come up with approaches that fit the international cyberstrategy that the White House published in May.  "
My Bad: A Political Medley,"Thomas Vinciguerra is the editor of the forthcoming ''Backward Ran Sentences: The Best of Wolcott Gibbs from The New Yorker.'' After a week of sometimes indignant public denials and insistence that he was the victim of an Internet hacker, a weeping and stammering ... [Representative Anthony D. Weiner] acknowledged at a news conference that he had sent the photo of himself in his underwear to ... a college student in Seattle. -- The Times, June 7  TODAY, I want to briefly address a private matter. (1) I'd like to take this time to clear up some of the questions that have been raised over the past 10 days or so, and take full responsibility for my actions. (2) There's no question at times of my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about this country, that I worked far too hard and things happened in my life that were not appropriate. (3) I was blind to how arrogant and self-centered I had become; I did not recognize that I thought mostly of myself. The worst part about this is I even tried not to become caught up in my own self-importance. Unfortunately, the urge to believe in it was stronger than the power to fight it. (4) I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression. (5) I made a serious mistake. (6) I haven't told the truth, and I've done things I deeply regret. (7) I've been unfaithful to my wife. (8) That was a mistake, and I deeply regret it. (9) This is no time for evasions, denials or alibis. I fully accept responsibility and I am truly sorry for my actions. (10) I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting my family. (11) To all those I have disappointed and hurt, these words will never be enough, but I am truly sorry. (12)I regret the harm that my actions have caused my family, my staff and my constituents. (13) As an elected official, I fully realize that my life is open for public criticism and scrutiny, and I take full responsibility for the mistake in judgment I made in attempting to handle this matter myself. (14) Over the course of my public life, I have insisted -- I believe correctly -- that people, regardless of their position or power, take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. (15) I've let down a lot of people. That's the bottom line. And I let them down and in every instance I would ask their forgiveness. Forgiveness is not an immediate process, it is in fact a process that takes time and I'll be in that process for quite some weeks and months and I suspect years ahead. (16) I do not believe that God tortures any person simply for its own sake. (17) I do believe in a forgiving God. And I think most people, deep down in their hearts hope there's a forgiving God. Somebody once said that when we're young, we seek justice, but as we get older, we seek mercy. There's something to that, I think. (18) As we go through the process of working through this there are going to be some hard decisions to be made, to be dealt with. (19) I owe a humble thank you to the many people who helped to get me here, and who helped me serve effectively. (20) I am very proud of the things we have accomplished during my administration. (21) But I guess where I'm trying to go with this is there are moral absolutes and that God's law indeed is there to protect you from yourself, and there are consequences if you breach that. This press conference is a consequence. (22) I ask that the media respect my wife and children through this extremely difficult time. While I deserve your attention and criticism, my family does not. (23) Thank you for watching. And good night. (24) (1) Eliot Spitzer, March 10, 2008. (2) Anthony D. Weiner, June 6, 2011. (3) Newt Gingrich, March 8, 2011. (4) John Ensign, May 2, 2011.

I.M.F. Reports Cyberattack Led to 'Very Major Breach',"WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund, still struggling to find a new leader after the arrest of its managing director last month in New York, was hit recently by what computer experts describe as a large and sophisticated cyberattack whose dimensions are still unknown. The fund, which manages financial crises around the world and is the repository of highly confidential information about the fiscal condition of many nations, told its staff and its board of directors about the attack on Wednesday. But it did not make a public announcement.  Several senior officials with knowledge of the attack said it was both sophisticated and serious. ''This was a very major breach,'' said one official, who said that it had occurred over the last several months, even before Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French politician who ran the fund, was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a chamber maid in a New York hotel. Asked about the reports of the computer attack late Friday, a spokesman for the fund, David Hawley, declined to provide details or talk about the scope or nature of the intrusion. ''We are investigating an incident, and the fund is fully functional,'' he said. Because the fund has been at the center of economic bailout programs for Portugal, Greece and Ireland -- and possesses sensitive data on other countries that may be on the brink of crisis -- its database contains potentially market-moving information. It also includes communications with national leaders as they negotiate, often behind the scenes, on the terms of international bailouts. Those agreements are, in the words of one fund official, ''political dynamite in many countries.'' It was unclear what information the attackers were able to access. The concern about the attack was so significant that the World Bank, an international agency focused on economic development, whose headquarters is across the street from the I.M.F. in downtown Washington, cut the computer link that allows the two institutions to share information. A World Bank spokesman said the step had been taken out of ''an abundance of caution'' until the severity and nature of the cyberattack on the I.M.F. is understood. That link enables the two institutions to share nonpublic data and conduct meetings, but users of the system say that it does not permit access to confidential financial data. Companies and public institutions are often hesitant to describe publicly the nature or success of attacks on their computer systems, partly for fear of providing information that would be useful to the individuals or countries mounting the efforts. Even so, Google has recently been aggressive in announcing attacks and, in one recent case, of declaring that its origin was China, an accusation the Chinese government quickly denied. But in the case of the I.M.F., officials declined to say where they believe the attack originated -- a delicate subject because most nations are members of the fund. The attacks were likely to have been made possible by a technique known as ''spear phishing,'' in which an individual is fooled into clicking on a malicious Web link or running a program that allows open access to the recipient's network. It is also possible that the attack was less specific, a case in which an intruder was testing the system merely to see what was available. The fund said that it did not believe that the intrusion into its systems was related to a sophisticated digital break-in at RSA Security that took place in March, which compromised some information that companies and governments use to control access to their most sensitive computer systems. RSA notified its clients of the loss of its data, and last month hackers attempted to use the information stolen from RSA to gain access to computers and networks at the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the nation's largest military contractor. After that attack, the World Bank briefly shut down external access to its most sensitive systems, for fear that the stolen information could make it a target. But it quickly resumed its normal operations and says it has seen no evidence of any attacks.  "

Anonymous Twitter Feeds Arise as Political Weapon,"gshih@baycitizen.org Early this month, State Senator Leland Yee, a leading candidate for San Francisco mayor, faced what his consultants called a cybersmear campaign. It involved anonymous Twitter feeds, including @Yee4Mayor, that dispatched negative tweets on matters like Mr. Yee's voting record and his 1992 arrest in Hawaii on suspicion of shoplifting a bottle of suntan lotion (the case was unresolved). Jim Stearns, Mr. Yee's strategist, asked Twitter to terminate the @Yee4Mayor account for violating the company's rule against impersonation. The company complied. But satirical accounts like @LelandYeeLoves and @NotLelandYee have continued to vex Mr. Stearns, who said he believed they were the handiwork of opposing campaigns.  ''Someone was clearly using this as a campaign tool,'' said Mr. Stearns, although he could not provide proof that Mr. Yee's opponents were behind the tweets. ''I don't care if it's a negative Twitter feed as long as I know where it's coming from.'' At a time when use of social media is quickly growing into a critical part of any candidate's playbook, campaigns across the country are discovering that the anonymous and instantaneous qualities of Twitter can also create headaches when candidates come under attack. In the San Francisco mayoral race, most of the mock feeds have at most several hundred followers and so far do not appear to be having much influence. But the growing prevalence of the anonymous accounts is raising questions about how to balance free speech and transparency in the fast-evolving world of online political communication. Federal campaign laws require disclosure of who paid for political mail and television spots. But it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to distinguish between organized political ''sock-puppeting'' -- the term for creating a false online identity -- and a private citizen's exercising free speech online. Mr. Stearns said that anonymous accounts muddied the democratic process and that campaigns should be required to disclose their Twitter activity. But others, like Eric Jaye, the former political adviser to Mayor Gavin Newsom who is now managing the mayoral campaign of Phil Ting, San Francisco's assessor-recorder, warned that overzealous regulation of Twitter would encroach upon First Amendment rights. ''The Internet has disempowered people like Jim Stearns and myself and empowered anybody with Internet access, a sense of humor and something to say,'' Mr. Jaye said. ''Get over it. That's the new reality.'' San Francisco has no regulations or disclosure rules for Twitter accounts, according to John St. Croix, executive director of the San Francisco Ethics Commission. But Mr. St. Croix said his agency would look into the matter if it appeared that the accounts were ''having an impact'' on the mayor's race. ''Fake'' Twitter accounts are not new or specific to San Francisco. The feed @MayorEmanuel gained national attention this year with parodies of Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago. Studies also suggested that a ''Twitter-bomb'' -- thousands of automated accounts firing off political attacks against Martha Coakley -- might have influenced the Senate race in Massachusetts last year after reaching nearly 60,000 people in two hours. Until recently, the tone on Twitter of San Francisco politics has been mostly playful. For years, at least two accounts claimed to represent Mr. Newsom's well-tended coiffure, @Gavshair and @newsomshair. (The latter had more than 1,000 followers.) Shortly after interim Mayor Edwin M. Lee took office in January, @edleesmustache, a Twitter account devoted to his facial hair, popped up. But in the mayor's race, the tone has shifted. City Attorney Dennis Herrera, who is a candidate, briefly came under fire from @HerreraLoves, which fired off two pithy tweets, including: ''Dennis Herrera Loves Lobbyists,'' followed by a link to a San Francisco Examiner article about a lobbyist who invited his contacts to a fund-raiser for the candidate. This year, ranked-choice voting, in which voters rank their preferences rather than choose a single candidate, encourages candidates to ''pretend to be nice to each other,'' said Bob Brigham, a social media consultant and former Newsom staff member. Negative third-party attacks in places like Twitter will likely ''fill the void,'' Mr. Brigham said.  "
Hackers Claim Another Target,"Lulz Security, a group of hackers who have claimed responsibility for a number of recent online data attacks, said Thursday that it had successfully breached the Arizona Department of Public Safety's internal servers, gaining access to hundreds of law enforcement documents, police profiles and e-mails.  The group posted a huge log of data it said it had obtained, releasing them on public file-sharing Web sites and a link via its Twitter account. Lulz Security said in a news release that it had chosen to attack Arizona law enforcement because it the group is opposed to the state's law against illegal immigration. A Department of Public Safety spokesman, Capt. Steve Harrison, said the biggest worry was the release of personal information about officers, which could endanger their safety. He said the documents appeared to be authentic but were sensitive, not confidential. The content of the documents obtained by Lulz Security include what appear to be the names, addresses and phone numbers of Arizona law enforcement officials. The data also covers hundreds of documents described as ''not for public distribution.'' Some of the documents offer instructions and manuals for interrogating individuals who have been arrested. The documents also include intelligence the department has collected about gangs in Arizona and Mexico.. Lulz Security also said it planned to release ''more classified documents and embarrassing personal details of military and law enforcement'' in the coming weeks. In the last several months Lulz Security has attacked a number of government and private Web sites, including Sony, the Senate's Web servers and the Central Intelligence Agency's Web site.  "
Hacked Memos Of State Police In Arizona Are Released,"PHOENIX -- A cache of internal documents released online on Thursday by hackers who gained access to the computer system of the Arizona Department of Public Safety revealed the array of potential outlaws on the state police's radar screen, from international terrorists to Mexican drug smugglers to motorcycle gang members. There was a memo telling officers not to send text messages while driving and a warning that criminals had found a way to break into the trunks of Crown Victoria police cruisers. A document on state budget cuts disclosed which roads the state police would stop patrolling this year because of reduced staffing.  In one of the leaked documents, the Border Patrol reported how four ''possible illegal aliens'' encountered by sheriff's deputies in southern Arizona on June 18 were found to be Qatari nationals in the country legally. Other memos warned officers of a FedEx truck that might be smuggling illegal immigrants and advised that two armed, off-duty Marines had been found patrolling the border. ''The documents are sensitive, but they don't appear to be classified,'' said Capt. Steve Harrison, a department spokesman. The Arizona police agency shut down its e-mail system on Thursday and Friday to allow computer forensics experts time to investigate the intrusion, which was orchestrated by Lulz Security, a group of hackers who have previously gained access to a number of government and private Web sites. Most alarming to the Arizona police was the release of personal data of some officers, including their home and cellphone numbers and addresses. The identities of some undercover officers were also disclosed. ''They put these officers' lives in jeopardy,'' Captain Harrison said of the hackers, who described their intrusion as a response to Arizona's immigration crackdown last year. Several officers whose names were in the documents told The Associated Press that their phones were ringing constantly on Thursday night with calls from people who had seen their numbers online. ''It's getting real annoying,'' Officer Daniel Scott said. Captain Harrison said the release of the documents was not likely to affect current criminal cases. But he said the information could alert potential suspects that the police were monitoring them, interfering with future prosecutions. The documents provided a behind-the-scenes look at the range of law enforcement priorities in Arizona. An intelligence bulletin by the F.B.I. and the United States attorney's office in Arizona mentioned five incidents over a four-week period in early 2008: A man who said he was Taiwanese was questioned after he took photographs of a federal courthouse; five Hispanic people were found in a vehicle with Mexican plates parked near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station; a man reportedly sent his brother, who was in the Taliban in Afghanistan, large amounts of money; a ''nervous'' man was reported trying to buy chemicals; and a Lebanese man in the country illegally was detained after he was found with envelopes stuffed with money placed throughout his vehicle. A counterterrorism alert, dated May 3, warned Arizona officers to be on guard for attacks after the killing of Osama bin Laden. Potential targets in the state, the memo said, could be shopping malls, sporting events like the Major League Baseball All-Star game in July and military installations. In a more local matter, an Officer Safety Bulletin warned about an Arizona man who apparently had battled cocaine addiction, threatened to kill an unidentified victim and claimed that ''he ate their pet cat.'' An internal memo urged officers to slow down while driving, reminding them that they saved relatively short amounts of time when they went above the limit of 100 miles per hour recommended in urgent situations. It is clear that computer security was a concern. A 2009 memo passed along from a law enforcement group in Maryland warned officers to be careful of e-mails purporting to be from the F.B.I. and containing a harmful attachment. Another memo warned officers to be careful of what they put on social networking sites, because the information could be used to damage their credibility in court.  "
"Citing Homeless Law, Hackers Turn Sights on Orlando","MIAMI -- The hacker group Anonymous has declared a cyberwar against the City of Orlando, disabling Web sites for the city's leading redevelopment organization, the local Fraternal Order of Police and the mayor's re-election campaign. Anonymous, a large yet loosely formed group of hackers that claimed responsibility for crashing the Web sites of MasterCard and the Church of Scientology, began attacking the Orlando-based Web sites earlier this week.  The group described its attacks as punishment for the city's recent practice of arresting members of Orlando Food Not Bombs, an antipoverty group that provides vegan and vegetarian meals twice a week to homeless people in one of the city's largest parks. ''Anonymous believes that people have the right to organize, that people have the right to give to the less fortunate and that people have the right to commit acts of kindness and compassion,'' the group's members said in a news release and video posted on YouTube on Thursday. ''However, it appears the police and your lawmakers of Orlando do not.'' A 2006 city ordinance requires organizations to obtain permits to feed groups of 25 people or more in downtown parks. The law was passed after numerous complaints by residents and businesses owners about the twice-weekly feedings in Lake Eola Park, city officials said. The law limits any group to no more than two permits per year per park. Since June 1, the city police have arrested 25 Orlando Food Not Bombs volunteers without permits as they provided meals to large groups of homeless people in the park. One of those arrested last week on trespassing charges was Keith McHenry, a co-founder of the first Food Not Bombs chapter in 1980 in Cambridge, Mass. He remained in the Orange County Jail on Thursday awaiting a bond hearing. This week Anonymous offered a ''cease-fire'' if no volunteers were arrested during Wednesday evening's feeding of the homeless. But the police arrested two volunteers, and on Thursday morning Anonymous disrupted the Web site Downtown Orlando, which promotes redevelopment there and is run by the city. An organization spokeswoman confirmed the attack but declined to comment, referring questions to the mayor's office. A spokeswoman for Mayor Buddy Dyer, whose re-election campaign site was disabled on Tuesday, called the attack on the Downtown Orlando site an ''inconvenience.'' She said the city would not change its policy of arresting volunteers who feed homeless people without a permit. ''We will continue to enforce the city ordinance,'' said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified out of a concern she would become a target of Anonymous. ''We must continue to focus on what our Orlando residents want and not the desires of others from outside the community.'' The attack on the Orlando Web sites was the second on a city or state government in two weeks. Last week, hackers gained access to the computer system of the Arizona Department of Public Safety and released law-enforcement records. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Orlando Police Department are investigating, officials said. Members of Orlando Food Not Bombs condemned the cyberattacks. ''We have absolutely nothing to do with Anonymous or any other group that is doing this kind of thing,'' said one member, Ben Markeson. ''And what Anonymous is doing is a distraction from the real issue at hand.'' Mr. Markeson said the Orlando mayor and City Council members had attempted to ''criminalize poverty'' by passing a series of ordinances intended to ''hide the homeless.'' ''Mayor Dyer wants to hide the poor and the hungry people living in our community,'' he said. The mayor's spokesman denied the allegation, saying: ''Nothing could be further from the truth. The city has a strong relationship with our region's homeless providers and will continue to dedicate resources and services that assist our homeless population.'' Anonymous has become known for prominent denial-of-service attacks on high-traffic Web sites. A denial-of-service attack takes place when an overwhelming crush of Web traffic is intentionally sent to a Web site until it is incapacitated and knocked off line. Anonymous members rallied a call-to-arms against the city as part of a campaign it dubbed Operation Orlando. Its members promised that future arrests of volunteers helping the homeless would be met with fresh attacks. ''For every arrested person,'' the group said on Twitter, ''Anonymous will deface or assault TEN websites in Orlando.''  "
Fox News Twitter Service Is Breached As Hackers Post a False Obama Story," A series of alarming Twitter posts about President Obama appeared on Fox News's Twitter account for political news early Monday morning, and the Web site for the cable television network said it was a victim of hacking. The Twitter account, @foxnewspolitics, one of many operated by Fox News, claimed that the president had been fatally shot while campaigning in Iowa, but gave no source for the news. On Monday morning, FoxNews.com first posted a brief statement saying that the reports were incorrect, and that it regretted ''any distress the false Tweets may have created.'' The six messages were removed around noon on Monday, about 10 hours after being posted, but not before attracting a flurry of attention. Because of the seriousness of the content, senior Secret Service officials held a conference call Monday morning to discuss the posts, said a law enforcement official who requested anonymity because of the investigation into the matter.  A spokesman for the Secret Service, George Ogilvie, said, ''We are investigating the matter and will be conducting appropriate follow-up.'' The White House declined to comment. In a statement Monday afternoon, Twitter indicated that its own servers had not been broken into; instead, the e-mail account associated with the specific Twitter feed had been compromised, and from there the hacker or hackers had been able to gain access. Twitter referred other questions about the incident to Fox News. Fox News did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Twitter's explanation. It simply reiterated an earlier statement from Jeff Misenti, vice president and general manager of Fox News Digital, saying, ''We will be requesting a detailed investigation from Twitter about how this occurred, and measures to prevent future unauthorized access into FoxNews.com accounts.'' The FoxNews.com Twitter account for political news, which has about 36,000 followers, had been dormant since Friday, but at about 2 a.m. Monday, a message was posted there that eerily presaged the posts that would follow about the president: ''just regained full access to our Twitter and email. Happy 4th.'' The next post said that the president ''has just passed. The President is dead. A sad 4th of July indeed.'' The next one said he had been ''shot twice in the lower pelvic area and in the neck; shooter unknown,'' and offered the disturbing detail that he ''bled out.'' The next post said that the president had been shot at Ross's restaurant in Iowa. The last message stated: ''We wish @joebiden the best of luck as our new President of the United States. In such a time of madness, there's light at the end of tunnel.'' Mr. Obama had been spending the weekend with his family at Camp David, and returned to the White House on Sunday, according to the official schedule. FoxNews.com posted a short statement early Monday explaining what had happened: ''Hackers sent out several malicious and false Tweets claiming that President Obama had been assassinated. Those reports are incorrect, of course, and the president is spending the July 4 holiday with his family. The hacking is being investigated, and FoxNews.com regrets any distress the false Tweets may have created.'' Twitter accounts are hacked from time to time, but Monday's incident attracted national attention because an assassination had been mentioned and a major news organization had been affected. Increasingly, news organizations like Fox News have embraced Twitter as a means of promotion and interaction with readers. The false Twitter posts about Mr. Obama seemed even more provocative because Fox News is widely perceived to be a voice of opposition to the Obama administration. On Monday, thousands of people on Twitter poked fun at the incident and at Fox News by pretending to guess Fox's Twitter passwords. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Carolyn Penner, would not address why the posts to the Fox News political account on Twitter stayed up so long, nor would she address reports about who was responsible. A group calling itself the Script Kiddies claimed responsibility for hacking the Fox News Twitter account, according to Adam Peck, the outgoing editor of Think, an online student magazine operated at Stony Brook University on Long Island, who said he had communicated via instant message early Monday with a member of the group. The Script Kiddies, Mr. Peck said, had posted to its own Twitter account that it hacked the political Twitter account of Fox News and wanted to speak to The Huffington Post, supplying an address at the instant-messaging service AIM. Mr. Peck, 23, said he figured he would try the address as well. The first conversation took place around 12:38 a.m., Mr. Peck said, before the inflammatory posts to Twitter appeared. ''We did ask them what their purpose was,'' Mr. Peck said. ''They said that they did align themselves with Anonymous and the antisec movement,'' he added, meaning ''antisecurity movement,'' or efforts intended to uncover information corporations or governments seek to hide. In the instant message, the person claiming to be a representative of the Script Kiddies said to Mr. Peck that there ''will always be a group of people that need to stand up for everyone else and attempt to keep the governments in balance with its people.'' The person claimed to be a former member of the better-known hacker group Anonymous. According to the instant-message record, which Mr. Peck provided to The New York Times, the person with whom he communicated at Script Kiddies said that Fox News ''was selected because we figured their security would be just as much of a joke as their reporting.'' Mr. Peck said he again contacted to the Script Kiddies when the first postings about the president were published, asking if the group had hacked the Twitter feed. Mr. Peck said he received a message in response: ''I cannot confirm that at this time. Stay tuned.'' Adding to the confusion, the Twitter account for the Script Kiddies at some point seemed to disappear, Mr. Peck said. He said he started ''frantically searching elsewhere to find corroboration of this story.'' But after 10 minutes of not finding it anywhere online, he said he figured it was the work of the Script Kiddies. Several news reports have referred to Think's interview, but for a time on Monday, the link to the interview was disabled. Mr. Peck, who will be graduating in December with a degree in journalism, said he suspected that the shutdown happened because of overuse. ''We're not used to having all that much traffic,'' he said. Online Correction: July 4, 2011, Monday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously defined the ''antisec movement'' as meaning ''anti-secrecy.'' In fact it means ''anti-security.''  "
Hackers Select A New Target: Other Hackers,"The hackers, calling themselves the A-Team, assembled a trove of private information and put it online for all to see: names, aliases, addresses, phone numbers, even details about family members and girlfriends. But their targets were not corporate executives, government officials or clueless bank customers. They were other hackers. And in trying to unmask the identities of the members of a group known as Lulz Security, the A-Team was aiming to take them down a peg -- and, indirectly, to help law enforcement officials lock them up. The core members of Lulz Security ''lack the skill to do anything more than go after the low-hanging fruit,'' the A-Team sneered in its posting last month.  In recent weeks, attacks on companies like Sony and government sites like senate.gov have raised concerns about increasingly organized and brazen hackers. On Monday, a Twitter account for Fox News was hijacked. But much of the hacking scene is a fractious free-for-all, with rival groups and lone wolves engaged in tit-for-tat attacks on each other, often on political or ideological grounds but sometimes for no better reason than to outwit -- or out-hack -- the other guy. The members of Lulz Security, or LulzSec, have been at the center of the sniping lately. The group won global attention through attacks on the C.I.A., Sony, the Arizona state police and other organizations, putting at risk the personal information of tens of thousands of people in the process. Even as they attacked, the LulzSec members craftily concealed their own identities, all the while articulating an ever-changing menu of grievances, from government corruption to consumer rights. LulzSec's provocative attacks and flamboyant style made it a tempting target. Other hackers, equally adept at maintaining their anonymity, have been seeking to penetrate the online aliases of the group's members. Late last month, LulzSec announced that it was disbanding, and that its members would continue their activities under other banners. But the F.B.I. and other agencies are continuing their pursuit, aided by information unearthed by other hackers. In fact, the Lulz Security members face the real possibility that if they are caught, it will be their fellow hackers who led the authorities to their doorsteps. ''This unfortunately represents one of few ways law enforcement gets good inroads into this community,'' said Bill Woodcock, research director at the Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit group in Berkeley, Calif., that tracks Internet traffic. In hacker parlance, to be unmasked is to be dox'd, as in documented. And by hacker logic, to be dox'd is to be put out of business. An online alias is an essential weapon: it conceals a person's name and whereabouts, while allowing the creation of an alternate identity. Indeed, the handbook for new recruits to Anonymous, the global hacker collective from which Lulz Security sprang earlier this year, contains tips on safeguarding one's identity -- from how to steer clear of Web sites that track online activity to masking one's Internet provider. One of the tools it suggests is Tor, a network of virtual tunnels originally developed by the United States Naval Research Laboratory to protect online government communications. ''In our world,'' the handbook concludes, ''a good defense is the best offense.'' Despite the detailed profiling by the A-Team and other hacker groups including Team Poison and Web Ninjas, no professed Lulz Security member has admitted to being dox'd, and some have merrily denied it. But the campaign seems to have had some effect. The A-Team's supposed outing of seven of Lulz Security's members coincided with the group's announcement that it was disbanding. And a spokesman for the group, using the alias Topiary, bid a public farewell in typically impish language: ''Sailing off -- watch your backs and follow the north wind, brazen sailors of the 'verse.'' The A-Team posting about LulzSec included mundane personal details. The sister of one purported LulzSec member, it said, was a bartender in a bowling alley in a small British town. Another member was described as ''very ugly.'' A third, the group railed, cannot hack at all: ''He doesn't actually do anything except give interviews.'' Part of the posting, complete with misspellings, went to the heart of the hackers' paradox: ''If your anonymous no one can find you. No one can hurt you, so your invincible,'' it said. ''The problem with this idealogy, is it's on the internet. The internet by definition is not anonymous. Computers have to have attribution. If you trace something back far enough you can find its origins.'' Lulz Security was not above outing one of its own. A member known as m--nerva leaked some of its chat room discussions to the media. In retaliation the group posted what it said was m--nerva's personal information, including an address in Hamilton, Ohio. Last week the F.B.I. raided a home in Hamilton but made no arrests, according to local media reports. An F.B.I. spokeswoman, Jenny Shearer, would not comment on what she said was a continuing investigation. In an interview with the BBC Web site, a spokesman for LulzSec who called himself Whirlpool said of the group's opponents: ''They keep trying to bring us down, we mock them, they get flustered and make snide comments, we laugh.'' Meanwhile the Web Ninjas, who publish a blog called LulzSec Exposed, declared their intentions this way: ''We have tried our best doxing LulzSec and keep doing it until we see them behind bars.'' Topiary's fellows do not seem to be in a mood to venture off into the north wind forever. Since announcing its dissolution, LulzSec has melted into a broader movement called AntiSec, which potentially has thousands of hackers on its side, including those associated with Anonymous. Hackers have continued to torment the Arizona police because of their role in a state crackdown on illegal immigrants, leaking officers' personal e-mail last week. Security companies and government agencies have a long history of relying on current or former hackers in the fight against computer crimes. One new wrinkle is the way that attacks on government targets have given rise to a small but loud faction of patriotic, presumably American hackers who are fighting back on their own, said Gabriella Coleman, an assistant professor at New York University who is researching a book on Anonymous. The fights have also become more public and spectacular, in part because of platforms like Twitter. ''Warring becomes an art form itself,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''There is that game quality to it. They're claiming they can't be found. It's a huge trophy if you can.''  "
"China's Biggest Search Engine, Known for Illegal Downloads, Makes Music Deal","BEIJING -- Baidu, the dominant Chinese Internet search engine, on Tuesday announced a major licensing deal with three of the world's largest music companies that would allow Chinese Web users to legally download and stream hundreds of thousands of songs free. The agreement between Baidu and One-Stop China, a joint venture between the Universal Music Group, the Warner Music Group and Sony BMG, will shut down access to a vast amount of pirated music and promises to broadly reshape the way China's 450 million Web users gain access to online music. The country has long been a haven for pirated content. Baidu has been one of the chief conduits to it, much to the consternation of record labels, publishers and artists both here and abroad.  Under the two-year deal between Baidu and One-Stop China, the three music labels will license over 500,000 songs, about 10 percent of them in Mandarin and Cantonese, which will be stored on Baidu's servers and available for free streaming and download on the site's ad-supported MP3 search page and social music platform, Ting. Baidu will pay a fee to the labels for each time a song is downloaded or played in a stream. It will also share revenue from online ads if that revenue exceeds a certain amount, as well as provide promotional support for the labels. The companies declined to disclose financial details of the agreement. With Baidu taking up the costs, this deal keeps music free -- but legal. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents global music companies, estimates that 99 percent of the music found online in China is illegal, much of it available through Baidu. Although China has more broadband connections than the United States and a rapidly growing middle class, the global recorded music industry's revenue in the country for 2009 was worth just $75 million, compared with $4.6 billion in the United States, according to the federation. So making money from music downloads and streaming in China will have an outsize impact for the labels, since digital sales accounted for 76 percent of the country's legitimate music revenue in 2010, compared with just 29 percent globally, where CD sales remain dominant. As part of the deal, on Monday the labels and Baidu agreed to a settlement endorsed by the Beijing Higher People's Court ending all outstanding litigation. For years, the American and Chinese music industries have singled out Baidu for criticism, saying the company has enabled users to steal vast quantities of copyrighted music, accusations that spurred a number of unsuccessful lawsuits. In February, the United States trade representative named Baidu as one of the world's 33 ''notorious markets'' for piracy and counterfeiting, centering on Baidu's practice of ''deep linking,'' or providing search results that direct users to unlicensed songs on other Web sites. Although American search engines have long been forced to abandon such practices, Chinese courts had ruled that deep linking was legal because the music was not stored on Baidu's servers. Despite those favorable court decisions, Baidu has now agreed to remove all deep links to music belonging to the three labels, though a small amount of other independently loaded music may remain available. ''We've never wanted to stand there and thumb our noses at the recording industry,'' said Kaiser Kuo, Baidu's director of international communications. ''This is a watershed moment. It's a great way for us to deliver the best possible user experience by providing free and high-quality music and brings obvious tangible benefits to all parties involved including the labels, artists and advertisers.'' Later this year, as part of the agreement, Baidu plans to introduce a premium fee-based service which will allow paying users to download music onto any computer, tablet or mobile device from a virtual storage locker. Mr. Kuo added that music search was profitable but had never been a source of major traffic. He said it accounted for a high of 30 percent in 2004 and was now less than 10 percent. The big label licensing agreement is the company's latest move toward a more legitimate business model since its rival Google began directing mainland Chinese Web users to its Hong Kong site in March 2010. In late March this year, Baidu announced it had deleted 2.8 million written works from its online library service, Wenku, in an effort to appease Chinese authors who demanded compensation, arguing that the company allowed pirated content on the site's servers for free download. The move came days after China's National Copyright Administration stated that it was investigating the company for copyright infringement of books. A few days later, Baidu said it would pay a fee to songwriters belonging to the Music Copyright Society of China, the country's official performing rights organization, each time one of their songs was downloaded or streamed through Baidu. Last year the organization won a rare lawsuit against Baidu over the company's providing unauthorized lyrics to 50 songs on its servers. Other Internet and media companies in China have signed contracts with music labels, with varying degrees of success. China Mobile made over $2 billion from its licensed ring tone service in 2009 alone, giving record companies a cut of the purchase price. Google in China offers more than a million songs for free through download and streaming and shares ad revenue. But at 84 percent, according to iResearch, an analytics firm based in Shanghai, Baidu's share of the Chinese Internet search market dwarfs that of Google and other rivals. Its agreement with Universal, Warner and Sony BMG, which account for most of the global music market, is expected to give the industry a brighter outlook in China after years of frustration. ''We're delighted with this because it means Baidu is genuinely partnering with us to move China's legitimate music market forward,'' said Max Hole, chief operating officer of Universal Music Group International, speaking on behalf of One-Stop China in a phone interview.  "
Open-Access Advocate Is Arrested for Huge Download,"A respected Harvard researcher who also is an Internet folk hero has been arrested in Boston on charges related to computer hacking, which are based on allegations that he downloaded articles that he was entitled to get free. A federal indictment unsealed in Boston on Tuesday morning on charges that the researcher, Aaron Swartz, broke into the computer networks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to gain access to JSTOR, a nonprofit online service for distributing scholarly articles online, and downloaded 4.8 million articles and other documents -- nearly the entire library. Mr. Swartz, 24, made his name as a member of the Internet elite as a teenager when he helped create RSS, a bit of computer code that allows people to receive automatic feeds of online notices and news. Since then, he has emerged as a civil liberties activist who crusades for open access to data.  In 2008, Mr. Swartz released a ''Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto,'' calling for activists to ''fight back'' against the sequestering of scholarly papers and information behind pay walls. ''It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture,'' he wrote. One goal: ''We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file-sharing networks.'' He also earned renown for downloading nearly 20 million pages of court documents for a project that put them free online. That brought Mr. Swartz under federal investigation. He was not indicted but later published the resulting F.B.I. file online. He faces up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines for charges related to wire fraud, computer fraud and unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer. He surrendered to the authorities on Tuesday morning, was arraigned in Federal District Court and pleaded not guilty to all counts. He was released on $100,000 unsecured bond. Institutions like colleges and libraries pay for access to JSTOR, which is then available free to their users. Supporters were quick to defend Mr. Swartz. David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, an activist group that Mr. Swartz founded, said in a statement that the arrest ''makes no sense,'' comparing the indictment to ''trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.'' An online petition gathered 15,000 signatures in just a few hours. In an interview, Mr. Segal said that his comments went to the principle, not to anything Mr. Swartz might have done in obtaining the documents. ''I know him as a person who cares deeply about matters of ethics and government,'' Mr. Segal said. ''I don't know about the matter of what has been alleged.'' Beginning in September of last year, according to the indictment, Mr. Swartz used several methods to grab articles, even breaking into a computer-wiring closet on the M.I.T. campus and setting up a laptop with a false identity on the school network for free JSTOR access under the name Gary Host -- or when shortened for the e-mail address, ''ghost.'' When retrieving the computer, he hid his face behind a bicycle helmet, peeking out through the ventilation holes. The flood of downloads was so great that it crashed some JSTOR servers, the indictment stated, and JSTOR blocked access to the network from M.I.T. and its users for several days. Ultimately Mr. Swartz returned the hard drives containing the articles to JSTOR and promised that the material would not be disseminated. ''We are not pursuing further action,'' the organization's general counsel, Nancy Kopans, said; the organization said in a statement that the criminal case ''has been directed by the United States Attorney's Office.'' As for the comments from Mr. Swartz's supporters that he had done nothing wrong, however, Ms. Kopans said, ''It's an unfortunate situation, but I think the facts speak for themselves.'' Mr. Swartz recently completed a 10-month fellowship at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard. ''Aaron has never done anything in this context for personal gain -- this isn't a hacking case, in the sense of someone trying to steal credit cards,'' said Lawrence Lessig, the center's director. ''That's something JSTOR saw, and the government obviously didn't.'' In a statement announcing the charges, a United States attorney, Carmen M. Ortiz, said: ''Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away.'' Carl Malamud, an online activist who worked with Mr. Swartz on the court-documents project, called Mr. Swartz ''one of the Internet's most talented programmers,'' but said that ''the JSTOR situation is very disturbing.'' In an e-mail exchange with a reporter, Mr. Malamud, who is engaged in a project intended to put all laws and government documents online, said: ''My style, when I see a gate barring entry and that gate is sanctioned by the law, is to go up to that gate and pound on it hard and force them to open up. Others sometimes look for a back door.'' He added, ''I'm not convinced that style is always effective, and it is certainly often dangerous.''  "
British Police Make Arrest In Net Attacks,"The British police announced the arrest on Wednesday of a 19-year-old man who they said was the spokesman of the online vigilante group Lulz Security, which has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on the Web sites of government agencies and private corporations.  In a statement, the police said the man used the online alias Topiary and had been picked up during a raid on a residence in the Shetland Islands, the rugged archipelago off the northeastern coast of Scotland. The police said they were also questioning a 17-year-old but had not arrested him. On Twitter, Topiary described himself as a ''simple prankster turned swank garden hedge.'' His missives were often facetious, suggesting the handiwork of someone who relished playful language. Lulz Security, the offshoot of a larger and more amorphous hacker group called Anonymous, has said it was responsible for attacks on the sites of PBS, the Senate, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and a company associated with the F.B.I. The most recent post on Topiary's Twitter feed is dated July 21, two days after law enforcement authorities announced the arrests of more than a dozen people in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands, who were accused of participating in online attacks at the instigation of Anonymous. ''You cannot arrest an idea,'' Topiary wrote. In the United States, 14 men and women, mostly in their 20s, were charged in connection with an online attack last December against PayPal, after the online payment company stopped taking donations for WikiLeaks. On Wednesday, in response to those arrests, Anonymous called on supporters to cancel their PayPal accounts. Shares in PayPal's parent company, eBay, dropped 3 percent, in line with declines in other tech stocks. A PayPal spokesman, Anuj Nayar, denied that any significant number of PayPal users had canceled their accounts in response to the call for a boycott. ''We haven't seen any changes to our normal operations, including account opening and closing,'' Mr. Nayar said. The attack on PayPal's site last December slowed down the company's system, but to such a small extent that it would have been imperceptible to customers, he said. At no point, Mr. Nayar said, was the Web site shut down.  "
Guardians Of Security Are Targets,"LAS VEGAS -- The Web site of ManTech International, a $2.6 billion computer security company that won a major F.B.I. contract, sells its services this way: ''Whether an intrusion is conducted by a skilled outsider with criminal intent, an adolescent hacker seeking a thrill or a disgruntled employee bent on revenge or espionage, the potential risks to the organization are enormous.'' Last Friday, ManTech was that organization.  A band of Internet vigilantes calling itself Anonymous said it had sneaked into ManTech's computers to demonstrate the company's insecurity. The group released what it said were internal company documents and, in language that suggested the handiwork of an adolescent hacker seeking a thrill, taunted the company online: ''It's really good to know that you guys are taking care of protecting the United States from so-called cyber threats.'' ManTech is in good company. In recent months, several security firms and consultants have been hit by the very intruders they are hired to keep at bay. Think of these companies as the new Pinkertons: Instead of taking on 19th-century outlaws in the Wild West, they are hired today to protect corporate and government data, including the most confidential intelligence information, across a vast virtual frontier. The string of embarrassing attacks on them demonstrates how vulnerable everyone is online, including those who are paid to be the protectors. Many technology professionals who have long warned about such security risks say so-called hacktivist groups like Anonymous, which publicize their attacks to make a point, are the least worrisome of the many potential intruders out there. ''With the rise of hacktivism, now the people who break into you tell you they break into you,'' said Jeff Moss, founder of the Black Hat conference, which drew nearly 6,500 technologists, largely security professionals, to Las Vegas this week. ''A little bit of public humiliation is going to go a long way in helping the security industry clean up.'' Other times, the attackers are mysterious and more worrying entities, as in the case of the still unknown organization that in March breached the systems of RSA, whose electronic security tokens are used across many industries. RSA's parent company, EMC, has said that replacing tokens and cleaning up the mess has cost it roughly $90 million so far this year. Hackers used information obtained in the RSA attack to break into Lockheed Martin, the largest military contractor in the country. On Wednesday the security company McAfee said it had uncovered a campaign of computer break-ins at 72 organizations and companies worldwide. McAfee called it the handiwork of a nation-state intent on acquiring, among other things, American military designs. Military contractors in the United States made up a disproportionately large share of the companies selected -- 12 in all. Anonymous, for its part, has made it plain that it goes after defense and intelligence contractors to expose their security vulnerabilities, not for financial or strategic gain. Booz Allen Hamilton, a $5.6 billion company based in McLean, Va., that does computer security work for the Defense Department, was hit by the group in early July; the hackers released the e-mail addresses of 90,000 military personnel. The most notorious breach of a security company came early this year after an executive at HBGary Federal, a relatively small consultant eyeing a government contract, boasted publicly of his ability to unmask the members of Anonymous. In response, hackers made off with a large trove of the company's e-mail messages and dumped them online, exposing details of its business transactions. Greg Hoglund, who is the chief executive of HBGary, the parent company that owns a minority stake in HBGary Federal, said that the breach was the result of ''a human mistake'' and that his firm, along with other security companies, had fortified their systems since then. ''It was a wake-up call for the entire security industry,'' Mr. Hoglund said. ''It probably needed to happen. I wish I didn't have to be the sacrificial lamb.'' As unlikely as it may seem, HBGary Federal still has a contract to help an unnamed federal agency sniff out spies inside its organization. And HBGary continues to sell its software, intended to ferret out the circumstances of a network intrusion. For its part, ManTech posted a vague statement on its site last Friday after the Anonymous attack, saying that it addresses threats to its information systems and pointing out the obvious: ''All organizations attract cyber threats in our highly networked world.'' An academic who studies computer security, who declined to be named because he consults for the government, described the Anonymous attacks on security companies in blunt terms: ''They're pulling their pants down publicly.'' The spate of attacks -- and the fear of more -- could actually end up buoying the fortunes of the global security industry. A nationwide survey of company technology managers, conducted by Forrester Research, found that computer security had increased as a share of the total information technology budget of companies, to 14 percent this year from 8.2 percent in 2007. Of those surveyed this year, 56 percent said it was a high priority to ''significantly upgrade.'' ''The landscape is more menacing now,'' said Eve Maler, principal analyst for security and risk at Forrester. ''Even the most experienced practitioners are in the process of upping their game.'' All of the major defense and intelligence contractors have expanded their digital security wings in recent years. They are simply following the money. The business of security for government agencies is growing by an enviable 9 percent a year, according to the research firm Input/Deltek. Federal government contracts alone amount to over $9 billion today and are projected to grow to $13.3 billion by 2015. ''Cybersecurity,'' Deltek concluded in a recent report, ''is somewhat immune to spending and budget cuts.'' For better or worse, said Jonathan L. Zittrain, a Harvard Law School professor, securing the Internet has been largely left to private players -- and even government information is increasingly guarded by private companies, whose actions can be difficult to monitor and hold accountable. ''In the absence of larger public order, we've seen do-it-yourself approaches: the technologically savvy can configure their own firewalls, and corporations can try to buy security,'' he said. ''But this can be as figuratively dicey as trying to get and maintain security contractors in Baghdad immediately following the fall of Saddam Hussein.''  "
Beatles Are in a Video About the Value of Music,"11:15 a.m. Updated The surviving members of the Beatles have thrown their support behind a grassroots campaign to fight against music piracy, allowing the enormously influential band's music to be used in a short animated video to help raise awareness of the value of original music, a publicist for campaign said.  Made by the Music Matters campaign, the video does not directly address the issue of piracy. The main character talks about how the Beatles and their songs marked miles-stones in his life and brought people together around the world in a profound way. The animation is simple: stick figures, some with the Beatles faces and playing guitars. The soundtrack includes tracks like ''Octopus's Garden,'' ''Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' and ''Hey Jude.'' It ends with the slogan: ''That's why music matters.'' ''It's a campaign to get people thinking about the ethical choices they face when consuming music,'' said Stuart Bell, a publicist for the Music Matters campaign. The video was sanctioned by Apple Corps, the company formed in the late 1960s to handle The Beatles' business affairs. Since the deaths of John Lennon and George Harrison, the company is controlled by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, a spokeswoman, Moira Bellas, said. The campaign was begun in Britain in March 2010 and has attracted support from several well-known pop groups like The Jam, Sigur Ros and Elbow, as well as the major record labels, music publishers and retailers. The Beatles is by far and away the most famous group to support the effort, which tries to encourage people not to download pirated versions of recordings. Music Matters puts a seal of approval on legitimate online sources of recordings that ensure royalties will be paid to the artists. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"After Cellphone Action, BART Faces Escalating Protests","zelinson@baycitizen.org  Early last month, a BART police officer shot and killed a knife-wielding homeless man at the San Francisco Civic Center station. The incident provoked a series of small protests that drew little attention until Aug. 11, when the transit agency took the unusual step of shutting down cellphone service for several hours as activists prepared for another rally. With that flip of a switch, BART has come under siege -- in cyberspace and underground. According to officials, BART's technology personnel have been working round the clock to fend off a disparate group of hackers who penetrated the agency's Web sites last week and released sensitive information, in retaliation for the shutdown of the cellphone and wireless services.  The Federal Communications Commission is investigating the decision to shut down the services, and the American Civil Liberties Union is considering a lawsuit against BART on the ground of First Amendment violations. The protests, while still small, appear to have grown in number and potency. Using the Twitter hashtag #MuBARTek, a wry reference to Hosni Mubarak's efforts to shut down communications before he was toppled as president of Egypt, activists organized a new round of protests that forced BART to shut down four stations during rush hour last Monday. Another rally is planned for this Monday. Protesters threatened that more would follow ''until BART decides to back away from their policy of cellphone censorship,'' according to one message from a person with the Twitter handle @OpBART. Some BART board members, like Lynette Sweet, have criticized the decision to shut down cellphone service. ''Rather than thwart protesters,'' Ms. Sweet said, ''we've invited in a whole new arena of people that we have to deal with now. It's like relighting a fire that was already out.'' The episode has been a sobering lesson in how even an agency that carries some 350,000 passengers over 104 miles of track every workday can be brought low by a seemingly ragtag group of activists who identify themselves by pseudonyms like Lamaline--5mg. According to David Wagner, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the hackers were relatively unsophisticated and most resembled ''bored rebellious teenagers.'' BART officials have labeled the protesters ''cyberterrorists'' and said the agency's actions were necessary to preserve safety in an environment of fast-moving trains and electrified rails. ''You have the ability to limit people's free speech when public safety is at risk,'' said the BART board president, Bob Franklin, who announced Thursday that the board would hold discussions this week on its policy for shutting off cellular communications. But Jean Hamilton, president of a union that represents 200 BART employees, said the agency's leadership had mishandled the crisis. ''We feel under fire, and we feel everything we've done to promote transit is in the toilet,'' Ms. Hamilton said. ''All people are talking about is freedom of speech and will the trains be stopped again tonight.'' The crisis began July 3 with a report to police dispatchers that a man in a tie-dyed T-shirt was walking the platform of the Civic Center station with an open bottle of alcohol. BART says the man, Charles Hill, approached officers with a four-inch-long knife and was preparing to throw it when an officer shot and killed him. The shooting is under investigation. The incident caught the attention of the group No Justice No BART, which formed in response to the 2009 shooting of an unarmed man, Oscar Grant III, on the platform of the Fruitvale station in Oakland. The group has about 500 fans on Facebook. Its leader, a research scientist who calls himself Krystof, has clashed repeatedly with the BART board. ''He's shown up at our meetings -- he's very cynical about BART,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''He wants to disband the BART police, and he's very media savvy.'' Krystof countered in an interview that ''BART has been really insular -- they're not used to outside scrutiny.'' As the group planned for a protest on Aug. 11, BART's spokesman, Linton Johnson, fearing that the rally would snarl the evening commute, proposed cutting off cellphone and wireless service, which the agency controls underground. The idea was endorsed by BART police and authorized by BART's interim general manager, Sherwood Wakeman, a lawyer. The protest never materialized, but the action provoked outrage. The next day, Mr. Johnson was dismissive of complaints. ''It is an amenity,'' he said. ''We survived for years without cellphone service,'' he continued, but now people are ''complaining that we turned it off for three hours?'' Mr. Johnson said BART approved the shutdown only after Mr. Wakeman determined that the action was legal under Brandenburg v. Ohio, a Supreme Court decision that lets the government punish speech that incites unlawful activity. Civil liberties advocates disagreed with that determination. Ms. Sweet, the board member, said the decision ''was something that they concocted pretty haphazardly.'' Last Sunday, hackers struck a BART marketing Web site, MyBART.org, making public more than 2,000 passenger e-mails and passwords. The hackers identified themselves as part of Anonymous, an amorphous cyberprotest movement. In July, the F.B.I. arrested 14 people, including two from the Bay Area, for an Anonymous attack on PayPal. Anonymous announced on a Web site where the information was posted that it had attacked BART ''to show that the people will not allow you to kill us and censor us.'' It posted the group's banner, a mask of Guy Fawkes, the Englishman who tried to blow up the House of Lords in 1605. On Wednesday, BART was hacked again. After penetrating the BART Police Officers Association Web site, hackers posted personal information for 102 officers, including home addresses. In a transcript of a private chat posted online, a person who identified herself with the alias Lamaline--5mg took credit for the attack, saying that she was annoyed ''about what bart did'' and that it was her first hacking. An online argument ensued about whether, in fact, she was part of Anonymous. ''Please refrain from dropping anybody's private information anywhere on anonymous's behalf,'' one poster wrote. Lamaline 5mg responded that the lax security that had allowed her to penetrate the Web site was ''not my fault.'' The F.B.I. is investigating both hackings. Mr. Wagner, the computer science professor, said BART could continue to face problems now that it appeared to have a bull's-eye on its back. BART's passengers also may continue suffering as the battle goes on. Brian Payton, of Oakland, has been delayed twice by protests on his way home from work in downtown San Francisco. Standing with a crowd waiting for the Montgomery Street BART station to open on Monday, Mr. Payton said it was wearing on him even though he sympathized with the protesters' cause. ''I do believe police brutality is wrong,'' he said, ''but there has to be another way to express themselves because all they're doing is hurting people who had nothing to do with it.'' Correction: August 28, 2011, Sunday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of a production error, the picture credit last Sunday with an article about growing protests against BART over the decision by officials of the transit system to temporarily shut down cellphone service earlier this month misidentified the provider of the photo.

Web Site Ranks Hacks and Bestows Bragging Rights,"So you think you can hack? Some 700 hackers looking to show off their talents have piled into an upstart Web site called RankMyHack.com in the last month. Emerging from the shadowy underground, they have submitted evidence of more than 1,200 Web site hacks, eager to have their feats measured against those of their peers. The site was created by a hacker nicknamed Solar to bring a little accountability to the online forums and chat rooms where hackers gather to learn tricks of the trade, buy and sell contraband and form alliances. There, eBay-style ratings systems meant to establish reputations are routinely abused, morality tends to be fluid and anonymous young people often talk big while carrying a small stick.  RankMyHack offers a way to separate the skilled from the so-called script kiddies by verifying hacks using codes that participants must plant somewhere on sites they have compromised. As in a video game, RankMyHack awards points, which are based on the popularity of the hacked site and the technical difficulty of the hack. Total scores determine hackers' ranks on the ''leader board of legends.'' Players can even challenge one another to duels. ''So have you got what it takes to be the best?'' Solar taunts on the site's home page, which has a distinctively retro design. Participants can also win ''bounties'' for hacking racist sites as well as university, military and government sites, an element intended ''to focus the abilities of talented hackers against political and government forces.'' In an e-mail interview, Solar, who declined to disclose his name or age, said he was a computer-science student in Britain and aspired to a career in computer security. He acknowledged hacking illegally ''in the past'' to develop his skills, but said he had never engaged in criminal acts like fraud. As of Sunday, the top break-in on the site was said to be a hack of The Huffington Post, worth nearly 1.7 million points and claimed by Mudkip, who is also the site's top-ranked hacker. The second-biggest hack, worth 1.5 million points, was said to be on Google, by Blackfan. The Huffington Post did not respond to requests for comment. Google said Blackfan had told it about a minor bug in the mobile version of Google.com as part of its program to reward security researchers for finding and disclosing vulnerabilities. The flaw poses no risk to users, Google said. Hackers like Mudkip and Blackfan can use a RankMyHack banner to display their stats on other Web sites, including hacker forums. But the banners can also help crime groups find talented and willing recruits, warned Rob Rachwald, director of security strategy at Imperva, a security company. ''If you like blood on your hands, this shows you're willing to do the dirty work.'' And RankMyHack could be useful to the authorities. ''The ability to verify that a person compromised a system is a law enforcement person's dream,'' said Holt Sorenson, a security specialist who helps run the Capture the Flag competition at the annual Def Con hacker conference in Las Vegas. RankMyHack seems to take a page from competitions like Capture the Flag that attract some of the world's most skilled hackers. In that game, competing teams defend their computers from attack while trying to steal a piece of data from or plant data on another team's computer. Organizers verify hacks and declare winners. At Def Con, no real damage is done and a strong performance can cement a reputation -- and attract job offers. But RankMyHack, which celebrates and some say incites illegal hacking, could hurt Solar's prospects for a career path that requires trust. Solar argued that the hacks would occur regardless, and that the site was positive because hackers did not need to do damage to prove they had infiltrated a site. He said security companies should be impressed that, ''secured to the teeth'' and attacked a hundred times a day, RankMyHack itself was still standing.  "
Japan: Cyberattack on Parliament,"TOKYO -- Computers in Japan's Parliament have been found to be infected with a virus, officials said on Tuesday, the latest in a series of mysterious cyberattacks that have raised concerns about the leakage of sensitive information.  Personal computers used by three members of the lower house, as well as possibly a computer server, were infected by the virus, the top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura, told reporters. He did not give details, but local media reports said the virus apparently had been used to hack into computers sometime in the past three months. The reports said log-in information and e-mails may have been stolen. Media reports said one of the three lawmakers opened an e-mail attachment that released the virus. The discovery comes a month after Japanese defense contractors revealed that they had also been targets of cyberattacks, which may have been aimed at classified military data. The contractors have said they did not know of any classified information being stolen. Still, the reports raised concern in Washington since the contractors, which included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, produce advanced American-designed weapons systems like the F-15 fighter jet. American security officials have already had doubts about Japan's ability to handle sensitive information since a Japanese Navy officer was arrested in 2007 for leaking classified data on the American Navy's advanced Aegis radar system. Japanese officials have apparently struggled to identify the source of the earlier attacks, which came from servers scattered across several nations, including China, Hong Kong and the United States. However, the assumption here seems to be that they originated in China, especially after media reports that investigators had found digital traces that one of the screens used to begin the attacks was written in the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China. China has strongly denied having a hand in the earlier attacks. On Tuesday, Mr. Fujimura and other Japanese officials gave no indication of who might have been behind the latest attacks, or what the hackers might have been after. He said that a full investigation of the latest breach is now under way. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
"After a Kidnapping, Hackers Take On a Ruthless Mexican Crime Syndicate","MEXICO CITY -- The hackers' message, delivered via YouTube by a man wearing a red tie and a Guy Fawkes mask, was as bold and risky as anything produced by the Zetas, Mexico's most ruthless crime syndicate. But this time, the Zetas were the target. They had kidnapped a geek with backup -- a respected member of the hackers collective known as Anonymous.  ''You have made a great mistake by taking one of us,'' said the video's masked figure. ''Release him.'' Or else, the message said, the names of government officials, taxi drivers and journalists who worked with the Zetas would be published online. The goal, they said, was the arrest of these suspected collaborators, but was there a possibility they might be killed by a rival cartel? Yes, said self-identified members of Anonymous, acknowledging the danger. Beyond that, might the hackers also be targeted? Were they afraid? ''Of course,'' said a blog post on Monday. Still, some hackers said, it was time for Netizens to fight back in a country where the news media have been cowed into submission, and where the justice system is often complicit in heinous crimes that regularly go unpunished. ''We believe it is high time to say enough to the terrible situation caused by the falsehood of the government and lack of scruples of people who do not care about the welfare of their fellow human beings,'' they posted. Anonymous appears to already have the information on collaborators. A person with knowledge of its operations, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said that online group conversations on Monday showed that the hackers have ''a list of 100 or so of the major contacts of the Zetas.'' It was not clear how they obtained the tally, or how accurate it was. And that appeared to be a major concern. A Facebook message on Sunday from one of the so-called hacktivists said there were indications that the Mexican government had tainted the Anonymous operation, known as OpCartel, ''putting in doubt the quality of the information.'' Whether Anonymous will publish what it has is unclear. The original YouTube message, uploaded on Oct. 6, said that Nov. 5 would be ''a day to remember,'' and the group has already provided a first strike. Last week, Anonymous defaced the Web site of a former Tabasco State prosecutor, Gustavo Rosario Torres, replacing his usual message with the image of jack-o'-lanterns and an announcement that Mr. Rosario ''es Zeta.'' But on Monday, in the wake of a security firm's report highlighting the potential loss of life from naming names, there were more mixed messages. A steady stream of posts on Twitter referring to OpCartel revealed an intense debate over the benefits and costs of moving forward. On Twitter and in private e-mails -- members of Mexico's underground online media said -- there appeared to be a widening gap between supporters and opponents of Anonymous's mission. This may have been by design. The blog post announcing that OpCartel would continue emphasized that ''anyone who is not properly protected should immediately and publicly disassociate themselves from this operation.'' Several Twitter accounts that had been active on the topic fell silent. Several other members of Mexico's online crime-reporting community said that OpCartel was causing internal strife, and that they had been asked by friends to stay away from anything having to do with the operation, even basic Twitter posts. Fred Burton, a vice president at Stratfor, which published the report warning against the Anonymous plan, said that fears of reprisals were well founded. ''Informants in that world are usually found dangling from a bridge or beheaded,'' Mr. Burton said. Those identified by Anonymous would be vulnerable to rival gangs, he said, while the hackers and their supporters might also be targets. And because Mexico's criminal groups have infiltrated Mexican law enforcement, which has access to sophisticated tracking software, anonymity online might not be enough protection. At least three people believed to have been online tipsters have been killed recently because of what their murderers described on public banners as snitching. Still, perhaps because of the danger -- or perhaps because of the desperate need of many Mexicans for a sense of control as crime spirals -- support for OpCartel continued to flow through the Web on Monday afternoon. Several Twitter users posted WikiLeaks cables with information about the Zetas. Others offered moral support. ''You will never falter you will not fail, bring down the corruption,'' wrote a user with the handle @fingers--digita. ''PLZ be careful comrades, EXTREMELY dangerous,'' wrote @AnonOWS, using the hash tag #justice for emphasis. Even those unsure about OpCartel said that it was significant as a citizen revolt. That was the core defense in the Anonymous blog post, which said a small task force was formed because ''the voice of the people have clamored for help.'' And according to some experts, regardless of whether OpCartel goes forward, the anger and outrage of Anonymous will be remembered, and channeled for another day. ''This is not about a desire for information,'' said Hector Amaya, a Mexican professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia. ''It's about the need for a remedy.''  "
Facts Blur as Hackers' Feud With a Mexican Drug Gang Ends in a Draw,"MEXICO CITY -- Some bloggers and Twitter users claiming to be part of the hacker movement Anonymous now say they have abandoned plans to expose collaborators working with the Zetas crime syndicate because the friend they say the gang kidnapped has been released. Other self-identified Anonymous hackers say they will eventually undermine the country's drug cartels by exposing corrupt officials, but that threats from the Zetas, along with the friend's release, have pushed them to declare that the current project -- OpCartel -- is dead.  Some outside critics, meanwhile, wonder if the whole story was a sham. Was anyone kidnapped, they ask. Where is the evidence? Did Anonymous really have the goods on corrupt officials that it claimed to have? ''We don't have enough facts to draw any conclusion at this point,'' said Fred Burton, an analyst for Stratfor, a private intelligence firm that was one of the first to scrutinize OpCartel. ''It's amazing to me, this whole set of circumstances.'' Amazing, confusing, disturbing -- there are many adjectives to describe the ostensible war between Anonymous and the Zetas. But surprising should not be one of them. Security experts and Anonymous veterans say the moment that members of an opaque, leaderless hacker movement decided to threaten a shadowy element of organized crime -- with a video featuring a man in a Guy Fawkes mask, no less -- certainty became as scarce as a Mexican murder conviction. With more media attention and time, it has essentially disappeared. Take the alleged kidnapping. The video from Anonymous posted Oct. 6 said that a friend was kidnapped a few weeks earlier in Veracruz, a coastal city. No name, age or identifying information was provided. When asked for verification earlier this week via e-mail and Twitter, Anonymous hackers initially ignored the requests, except for one person who said that other members had identified the victim as a young man who had taken part in a street protest called a ''paperstorm'' with the people who started OpCartel. They knew him in person, not just electronically, that person said, adding, ''That connection seems to be why they decided to do something.'' Others claiming a connection to Anonymous also said they saw online messages from Anonymous members saying a young man was taken. That was perhaps why skepticism flooded the Twitter stream late Thursday when @IberoAnon, a user who portrayed himself as an OpCartel leader, said the victim had been freed and ''we have established contact with her.'' @IberoAnon and others promised to provide proof. But it has yet to materialize. Another person known online as Itzela, described by others as a direct participant in OpCartel, said in an e-mail on Friday that the victim was a Mexican man, about 20 years old, who had been kidnapped about a month ago and was released Thursdayafternoon. Itzela said Anonymous had compiled the list of corrupt officials by hacking e-mail accounts. He said that after the victim was released, he joined the chat room and proved his identity there and in a later conversation on Skype. Could that online conversation be provided? How about a replay of the conversation on Skype? No answer. The current and future status of the group is just as hard to divine. A blog that appears to be linked to @IberoAnon now includes a post saying that OpCartel has been canceled partly because the Zetas threatened to kill 10 people for every collaborator the hackers identified. It is yet another claim impossible to verify. Anonymous members, or people who say they are, have given spurious information before. But could a death threat -- from a gang with a proven record of extreme violence -- have led @IberoAnon to change the gender of the released victim, or manufacture a timely release? Some hackers say yes. In Internet Relay Chat rooms frequented by Anonymous members on Thursday night, fear and the desire to find protection, mainly through software to mask one's identity, dominated the conversation. The discussion also included comments saying that no information would be given about the kidnapping because the Zetas had demanded silence. Still, there are those who insist that the hackers are not finished, even if OpCartel and Anonymous are labels increasingly likely to be avoided. There are conflicting accounts regarding what these hackers, who may or may not be the same hackers involved in the original video, plan to do. Itzela said discussions were under way about the release of information on the corrupt government officials: ''It's what we will do soon.'' Meanwhile a self-appointed Anonymous spokesman in Texas, Barrett Brown, has told reporters that the group may yet publish what he described as 25,000 Mexican government e-mails containing the names of Zetas members and their collaborators. Why, some might wonder, would Mr. Brown, presumably a real person using his a real name, go public with this information, given the risk? On Twitter, two reasons were offered: he has a book contract to write about Anonymous, and he does not live in Mexico. Unlike nearly everything else involving OpCartel, both claims appear to be verifiable facts.  "
Life Sentence for Possession of Child Pornography Spurs Debate Over Severity,"Does downloading child pornography from the Internet deserve the same criminal punishment as first-degree murder? A circuit court judge in Florida clearly thinks so: On Thursday, he sentenced Daniel Enrique Guevara Vilca, a 26-year-old stockroom worker whose home computer was found to contain hundreds of pornographic images of children, to life in prison without the possibility of parole. But the severity of the justice meted out to Mr. Vilca, who had no previous criminal record, has led some criminal justice experts to question whether increasingly harsh penalties delivered in cases involving the viewing of pornography really fit the crime. Had Mr. Vilca actually molested a child, they note, he might well have received a lighter sentence.  ''To me, a failure to distinguish between people who look at these dirty pictures and people who commit contact offenses lacks the nuance and proportionality I think our law demands,'' said Douglas Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, who highlighted Mr. Vilca's case on his blog, Sentencing and Law Policy. Sexual offenses involving children enrage most Americans, and lawmakers have not hesitated to impose lengthy prison terms for offenders. In Florida, possession of child pornography is a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. Mr. Vilca was charged with 454 counts of possession, each count representing one image found on the computer. Steve Maresca, the assistant state attorney in the case, said that in his view, Mr. Vilca ''received a sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines.'' ''Too many people just look at this as a victimless crime, and that's not true,'' he said. ''These children are victimized, and when the images are shown over and over again, they're victimized over and over again.'' But Lee Hollander, Mr. Vilca's lawyer, called the sentence ridiculous. ''Daniel had nothing to do with the original victimization of these people; there is no evidence that he's ever touched anybody improperly, adult or minor; and life in prison for looking at images, even child images, is beyond comprehension,'' he said. Mr. Hollander said Mr. Vilca had consistently said he did not know the images were on his computer. He refused a plea bargain of 20 years in prison, after which the state attorney increased the charges. The sentence will be appealed, Mr. Hollander said. Troy K. Stabenow, an assistant federal public defender in Missouri's Western District, noted that most people assume that someone who looks at child pornography is also a child molester or will become a child molester, a view often mirrored by judges. But a growing body of scientific research shows that this is not the case, he said. Many passive viewers of child pornography never molest children, and not all child molesters have a penchant for pornography. ''I'm not suggesting that someone who looks at child pornography should just walk,'' he said. ''But we ought to punish people for what they do, not for our fear.'' State and federal laws, which generally increase penalties based on the number of pornographic images, reflect the idea that acquiring child pornography requires extensive time and effort and thus is a measure of a defendant's involvement and interest. But with the rise of the Internet, it is possible to download hundreds of images in a matter of minutes, making the size of a stash a less than reliable indicator, Mr. Stabenow and other criminal justice experts said. It is now a rare case that does not involve the possession of hundreds, or even thousands, of images. As a result, many federal judges have issued sentences lower than those called for by federal guidelines, which add months for multiple images and other aggravating factors. And even when such sentencing enhancements are enforced, the sentences -- which can sometimes be 18 or 20 years -- are often well below what Mr. Vilca received. The federal guidelines, for example, recommend a minimum of 57 to 71 months in prison for possession of 600 or more images of very young children. Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who is now a law professor at the University of Utah, said there was no question that ''consumers of child pornography drive the market for the production of child pornography, and without people to consume this stuff there wouldn't be nearly as many children being sexually abused.'' Mr. Cassell is involved in efforts to get restitution for victims of child pornography, and has filed a petition in one case with the Supreme Court. But he said that while he was not familiar with Mr. Vilca's case and did not know what other facts might be involved, ''in the abstract, a life sentence for the crime of solely possessing child pornography would seem to be excessive.'' ''A life sentence is what we give first-degree murderers,'' he said, ''and possession of child pornography is not the equivalent of first-degree murder.''  "
New Trove of Stolen E-Mails From Climate Scientists,"The anonymous hacker who shook the world of climate science two years ago by posting a trove of stolen e-mails delivered a new batch on Tuesday, stirring up climate-change contrarians a little more than a week before global negotiations on greenhouse gases are to begin in Durban, South Africa. The new e-mails appeared remarkably similar to the ones released two years ago just ahead of a similar conference in Copenhagen. They involved the same scientists and many of the same issues, and some of them carried a similar tone: catty remarks by the scientists, often about papers written by others in the field.  Climate scientists said the release was likely intended to torpedo any potential progress in the Durban negotiations, though not much progress had been expected anyway given that countries have been reluctant to commit to binding emissions limits. The University of East Anglia, the British institution at the middle of the previous hacking episode, confirmed that at least some of the newly released e-mails were authentic. The cache released in 2009 appeared to have come from a file someone obtained by hacking into the university's computers, a crime for which no charges have been filed or suspects named. The new batch of more than 5,000 e-mails is evidently a fresh selection from the same set of records. A string of investigations following the 2009 release all came to the conclusion that scientists had not manipulated data to support their findings, though some of the reports did criticize them on minor points, such as failing to share their data or to respond properly to freedom of information requests. Myron Ebell, a climate-change skeptic who works for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank based in Washington, called the new e-mails ''strong evidence that a small group of scientists centered around East Anglia were engaged in a conspiracy to provide a scientifically misleading assessment of the case for catastrophic global warming.'' Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is the most prominent climate-change contrarian in Congress, cited the e-mails in a statement attacking the Obama administration's attempts to limit greenhouse gases. But Michael E. Mann, a Pennsylvania State University scientist who wrote or received some of the e-mails, said they showed the opposite of any conspiracy, demonstrating instead that climate science is a vigorous enterprise where scientists were free to argue over conclusions. ''Scientists rely on the ability to have frank, sometimes even contentious discussions with each other,'' Dr. Mann said in an interview Tuesday. ''Science requires that.'' In one of the e-mails, Raymond S. Bradley, director of the Climate System Research Center at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, criticized a paper that Dr. Mann wrote with the climate scientist Phil Jones, which used tree rings and similar markers to find that today's climatic warming had no precedent in recent natural history. Dr. Bradley, who has often collaborated with Dr. Mann, wrote that the 2003 paper ''was truly pathetic and should never have been published.'' Dr. Bradley confirmed in an interview that the e-mail was his, but said his comment had no bearing on whether global warming was really happening. ''I did not like that paper at all, and I stand by that, and I am sure that I told Mike that'' at the time, he said. But he added that a disagreement over a single paper had little to do with the overall validity of climate science. ''There is no doubt we have a big problem with human-induced warming,'' Dr. Bradley said. ''Mike's paper has no bearing on the fundamental physics of the problem that we are facing.'' Some of the other e-mails involved comments about problems with the computer programs used to forecast future climate, known as climate models. For instance, a cryptic e-mail apparently sent by Dr. Jones, a researcher at East Anglia, said, ''Basic problem is that all models are wrong -- not got enough middle and low level clouds.'' Gavin A. Schmidt, a climate modeler at NASA, said he found such exchanges unremarkable. He noted that difficulties in modeling were widely acknowledged and disclosed in the literature. Indeed, such problems are often discussed at scientific meetings in front of hundreds of people. Of the new release of e-mails, Dr. Schmidt said, ''It smacks of desperation.'' Dr. Mann said he hoped the fresh release, apparently first posted to a computer server in Russia, would provide new clues for the British police as they seek to catch the hacker or hackers. ''Who are the criminals?'' he asked. ''Who is funding this effort, not just to steal these materials but to promote them?''  "
Going After the Pirates,"Online piracy is the bane of the Internet. Still, bills proposed in the House and the Senate have overreached. The legislation needs to be tightened to protect intellectual property without hindering online speech and innovation.  Forty billion music files were shared illegally in 2008, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, amounting to 95 percent of all music downloads worldwide. Three-quarters of the video games released in late 2010 and early 2011 were shared illegally. Musicians, moviemakers, authors and software designers are not the only victims. Piracy's cost is measured in less innovation and less economic activity, as creators lose hope of making a living from their creations. Still, the definition of wrongdoing in the ''Stop Online Piracy Act'' introduced in the House is too broad. Under the bill, copyright owners could direct payment providers like Visa and advertising networks like Google's to cut off business to a Web site simply by filing notice that the site -- or ''a portion'' of it --''engages in, enables or facilitates'' intellectual property infringement or is being willfully blind to it. Accused Web sites would have only five days to assert their innocence. And the payment providers and ad networks could not be sued by sites that were wrongly cut off, so their easiest course of action might be to just comply with copyright owners' requests. If copyright owners could starve a Web site of money simply by telling a payment processor that the site was infringing on intellectual property, the bill could stymie legitimate speech. The purpose of the legislation is to stop business flowing to foreign rogue Web sites like the Pirate Bay in Sweden. But these provisions could affect domestic Web sites that are already covered by the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That act has safe harbors protecting sites, like YouTube, that may unknowingly host pirated content, as long as they take it down when notified. Another provision would allow the attorney general to sue foreign sites that ''facilitate'' piracy, and to demand that domestic search engines stop linking to them and that Internet service providers redirect traffic. Experts have said this measure could be easily overcome by users and warn that it could undermine an industrywide effort to reduce hacking. Legislators should also think hard about the message it would send to autocratic regimes like China's, which routinely block political Web sites. The House bill is right to focus on payment systems and ad networks to cut off the money to rogue Web sites. But like its Senate companion, the ''Protect IP'' bill, it has serious problems that must be fixed. The bill should be made to stipulate clearly that all of its provisions are aimed only at rogue Web sites overseas. Foreign sites must be granted the same safe harbor immunity -- and the bill must not open the door to punishments for domestic sites that abide by the 1998 digital copyright law. And rather than encouraging credit card companies and advertising networks to pre-emptively cut off business to Web sites accused of wrongdoing, a court order should be required before they take action.

Fighting Online Piracy,"To the Editor: You are right to recognize that online copyright theft has had a devastating impact on the creative industries (''Going After the Pirates,'' editorial, Nov. 27). But we don't agree that the proposed bills in Congress could ''stymie legitimate speech.'' To the contrary, the bills are specifically designed to focus on the worst of the worst sites whose model is predicated on theft.  Moreover, there is extensive due process afforded to accused sites under the bills. They require the attorney general to extensively document why a site meets the bills' tight standards -- pulled from existing law and Supreme Court cases -- and a federal judge must approve any order. Similarly, if companies serving pirate sites choose not to take action voluntarily, copyright owners must state their case and persuade a federal judge to issue a court order before payment processors or ad networks can be compelled to stop servicing the site. There may be different ways to craft a sensible bill, and we're all for finding the best way, but one thing is clear: the status quo isn't working. These illicit sites are among the culprits behind the music industry's more than 50 percent decline in revenues during the last decade, resulting in 15,000 layoffs and fewer resources to invest in new bands. It should be unacceptable to any of us involved in legitimate commerce online that a rogue Web site based outside the United States -- but hawking American products or copyrighted works -- can currently escape our laws.

Lines Drawn on Antipiracy Bills,"WASHINGTON -- Type ''download movies for free'' into Google, and up pops links to sites like the Pirate Bay, directing users to free copies of just about any entertainment -- the latest ''Twilight'' installment, this week's episode of ''Whitney,'' the complete recordings of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. For years, pirated movies, television shows and music have been on the Internet. And for just as long, Hollywood and the entertainment business have been trying and failing to stop it. But with more and faster broadband networks as well as powerful and speedy computers, the playing of illegally copied music and movies is booming as are sales of counterfeit goods from auto parts to pharmaceuticals.  Because most pirate sites are abroad, beyond the reach of United States law enforcement, companies have been left with a Whac-a-Mole approach to shutting them down. Now, however, two bills, broadly supported on both sides of the political aisle, aim to cut off the oxygen for foreign pirate sites by taking aim at American search engines like Google and Yahoo, payment processors like PayPal and ad servers that allow the pirates to function. Naturally the howls of protest have been loud and lavishly financed, not only from Silicon Valley companies but also from public-interest groups, free-speech advocates and even venture capital investors. They argue -- in TV and newspaper ads -- that the bills are so broad and heavy-handed that they threaten to close Web sites and broadband service providers and stifle free speech, while setting a bad example of American censorship. Google itself has hired at least 15 lobbying firms to fight the bills; Mozilla has included on its Firefox browser home page a link to a petition with the warning, ''Congress is trying to censor the Internet.'' A House committee plans to take up one of the bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act, on Thursday On the other side, some of the biggest business lobbies like the Motion Picture Association of America and the United States Chamber of Commerceare supporting the bills. Both sides, in fact, plan to spend millions of dollars for advertisements aimed at swaying consumer sentiment. Even newly proposed changes that the House panel will consider fail to address all the legislation's ills, opponents say. People involved in the drafting of the latest version, however, say the bill now specifically singles out only ''foreign rogue Web sites.'' ''Our mistake was allowing this romantic word -- piracy -- to take hold,'' Tom Rothman, the co-chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said in an interview last week in Washington. ''It's really robbery -- it's theft -- and that theft is being combined with consumer fraud,'' he said. ''Consumers are purchasing these goods, they're sending their credit card information to these anonymous offshore companies, and they're receiving defective goods.'' Those goods include not just movies shot surreptitiously in a theater with a jiggly hand-held video camera, the companies argue, but dangerously flawed pharmaceuticals, faulty brake pads and defective smoke alarms, to name a few categories of illegally copied goods. Each bill has attracted dozens of co-sponsors and broad support. The Senate bill, called the Protect IP Act, was overwhelmingly approved by the Judiciary Committee; a revised House bill, intended to address some initial criticisms, is scheduled to be marked up and voted on in committee before Congress adjourns for the holidays. Many in the Internet world, however, see ominous aspects even in the revision. ''There are some provisions that have improved,'' said Markham Erickson, executive director of NetCoalition, a group of technology companies that includes Facebook, LinkedIn and eBay. ''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Erickson said, ''the amendment also creates new problems in other places and fails to correct some of the original concerns we have raised since the start of the debate.'' Among them, he said, the amendment allows anyone to seek court action to restrain a Web site's activities, even those of sites based in the United States. Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is the primary sponsor of the bill and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is working on the legislation, said the immediate rejection of the amendment by technology companies showed that they were simply protecting their financial interests -- and sacrificing intellectual property rights in the process. ''That's because they've made large profits by promoting rogue sites to U.S. consumers,'' Mr. Smith said in a statement. Opponents say that many of the things that the legislation aims to prevent are already covered by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Under that law, Internet sites are required to take down links to specific pirated material when asked to do so by a copyright holder. ''We've done that more than five million times,'' Katherine Oyama, a Google policy counsel, told the House committee recently. Ms. Oyama added that Google also ejected companies from its advertising system when notified of illegal activities. Yet, as Mr. Smith and others have pointed out repeatedly, Google agreed in August to a $500 million settlement with federal and state agencies for failing to reject advertising business from pirates -- specifically, online Canadian pharmacies that used Google's AdWords program to place targeted ads promoting illegally imported prescription drugs to United States consumers. Google officials note that it acknowledged the conduct, accepted responsibility and paid a large fine -- but Google's Web site was not shut down. Opponents of the current bills argue that under the new proposals, Google could have been shut down. That sort of draconian measure is not where the bills are aimed, said Steve Tepp, chief intellectual property counsel for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''The targets are the rogue sites, the real bad actors,'' he said, which by selling counterfeit material endanger the jobs of ordinary workers at mainstream businesses. The jobs issue has been seized on by the bill's supporters and has created some strange alliances: supporting the bills are both the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Chamber of Commerce, which rarely take the same side on a business issue. On the other side, both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tea Party Patriots oppose the legislation. A third alternative emerged last week, as Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has been blocking the Senate bill from getting to the floor, introduced a new proposal that would make the United States International Trade Commission the arbiter for Internet disputes over copyrighted material. ''Butchering the Internet,'' Mr. Issa said, ''is not a way forward for America.''  "
Last Witness For Military Takes Stand In Leak Case,"FORT MEADE, Md. -- The government's arguments in the case against Pfc. Bradley Manning came to a dramatic conclusion Tuesday when the computer hacker who turned him in to the authorities took the stand to explain his role in the investigation, revealing at one point that he was simultaneously trading computer messages with Private Manning while sharing information from those chats with the authorities. The hacker, Adrian Lamo, said in a military courtroom here that he began exchanging instant messages and e-mails with Private Manning in early May last year, and decided to go to the authorities right away because the soldier made claims of ''acts so egregious it required that response.''  Private Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, stands accused in the most significant leak of government secrets since the Pentagon Papers. Since Friday, the military has been conducting a hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to court-martial him on charges of funneling tens of thousands of diplomatic cables and intelligence reports to WikiLeaks, which shared them with several news organizations, including The New York Times, and ignited international outrage. The hearing, which is expected to last through the end of the week, has given much of the world its first look at Private Manning, 24, who, even in his uniform and dark-rimmed glasses, barely looks old enough to drink. Mr. Lamo's appearance stirred some of the most emotional exchanges in these proceedings, with defense lawyers attacking him for betraying a troubled soldier who had gone to him for moral support. David Coombs, a defense lawyer, asked Mr. Lamo about chats in which he told Private Manning that the contents of their communication would remain private. Mr. Lamo told Private Manning that he should consider him as a ''minister or a journalist,'' adding that their chats would be treated as ''a confession or an interview, never to be published.'' Less than a month later, however, Mr. Lamo had shared the chats with both the authorities and the news media. Mr. Coombs attempted to press the matter for several minutes, with Mr. Lamo evading his questions. Finally, Mr. Coombs asked, ''Do you believe Mr. Manning was coming to you for moral support?'' Mr. Lamo was unapologetic, saying, ''I think he wanted to brag about what he had done.'' Throughout the hearing, Mr. Manning's lawyers have attempted to portray their client as a deeply troubled young man, struggling with gender identity issues during a time when the military was governed by the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy that prohibited gay men and lesbians from serving openly. The lawyers have argued that commanders were well aware of the soldier's turbulent emotional state when they cleared him to handle some of the military's most sensitive files, and that the military's controls over those files were lax, at best. ''The government has told you a lot about how things happened,'' an exasperated Mr. Coombs said during Tuesday's proceedings. ''We are trying to tell you why things happened. That's just as important.'' Testimony by one of Private Manning's former supervisors seemed to support the defense argument. Jihrleah Showman, who also worked as an intelligence analyst, said she had warned commanders on several occasions that Private Manning was in severe emotional distress and should not be allowed to handle classified material. Ms. Showman said she told commanders that she believed Private Manning suffered ''elevated levels of paranoia,'' and that he reported feeling as if he were constantly being watched. She said the soldier's outbursts were so ''uncontrolled'' that she believed he posed a threat to himself and to others. And she said she urged her commanders not to deploy him to Iraq. She described three occasions that she said exemplified Private Manning's erratic behavior, including one when he was ''screaming at the top of his lungs and waving his hands'' at an officer. In a second incident with a different officer, Ms. Showman said, Private Manning flipped over a table and lunged at him. And in the third incident, Ms. Showman said, Private Manning punched her in the face. She said the attack was ''unprovoked.''  "
Hackers Breach the Web Site of Stratfor Global Intelligence,"While the rest of the world engaged in merriment and good cheer, hackers used the holidays to attack a United States research group that puts out a daily newsletter on security issues. On Saturday, hackers who say they are members of the collective known as Anonymous claimed responsibility for crashing the Web site of the group, Stratfor Global Intelligence Service, and pilfering its client list, e-mails and credit card information in an operation they say is intended to steal $1 million for donations to charity. The hackers posted a list online that they say contains Stratfor's confidential client list as well as credit card details, passwords and home addresses for some 4,000 Stratfor clients. The hackers also said they had details for more than 90,000 credit card accounts. Among the organizations listed as Stratfor clients: Bank of America, the Defense Department, Doctors Without Borders, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United Nations. The group also posted five receipts online that it said were of donations made with pilfered credit card details. One receipt showed a $180 donation from a United States Homeland Security employee, Edmund H. Tupay, to the American Red Cross. Another showed a $200 donation to the Red Cross from Allen Barr, a recently retired employee from the Texas Department of Banking. Neither responded to requests for comment.  Mr. Barr told The Associated Press that on Friday he discovered that $700 had been transferred from his account to charities including the Red Cross, Save the Children and CARE, but that he had not been aware that the transfer was tied to a breach of Stratfor's site. Stratfor executives did not return calls for comment on Sunday. In an e-mail to subscribers Sunday morning, Stratfor's chief executive, George Friedman, confirmed that the company's site had been hacked and said his company was working with law enforcement to track down the parties responsible. ''We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other Web sites,'' Mr. Friedman wrote in the e-mail. ''We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained.'' The hackers took responsibility for the Stratfor attack on Twitter and said the attack would be the beginning of a weeklong holiday hacking spree. The breach was the latest in the online group's ongoing campaign of computer attacks which, to date, has been aimed at MasterCard, Visa and PayPal as well as groups as diverse as the Church of Scientology, the Motion Picture Association of America and the Zetas, a Mexican crime syndicate. The breach first surfaced on Saturday when hackers defaced Stratfor's Web site with their own message. ''Merry Lulzxmas!'' the group wrote in a reference to Lulz Security, a hacking group loosely affiliated with Anonymous. ''Are you ready for a week of mayhem?'' By Sunday afternoon, the message had been replaced with a banner message that said: ''Site is currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back soon.'' According to the hackers' online postings, the group voted on what charities to contribute to. Among their choices were cancer and AIDS research, the American Red Cross, WikiLeaks and the Tor Project, a software that enables online anonymity. Also according to their postings, the breach appears to have been conducted in retaliation for the arrest and imprisonment of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst on trial on charges of leaking classified intelligence information and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks last year. The attack was also likely intended to embarrass Stratfor, which specializes in intelligence and security. The hackers said they were able to obtain the credit card details because, they said, Stratfor had failed to encrypt them. ''The scary thing is that no matter what you do, every system has some level of vulnerability,'' says Jerry Irvine, a member of the National Cyber Security Task Force. ''The more you do from an advanced technical standpoint, the more common things go unnoticed. Getting into a system is really not that difficult.''  "
"As Patient Data Is Digitized, Risk of Breaches Is Rising","One afternoon last spring, Micky Tripathi received a panicked call from an employee. Someone had broken into his car and stolen his briefcase and company laptop along with it. So began a nightmare that cost Mr. Tripathi's small nonprofit health consultancy nearly $300,000 in legal, private investigation, credit monitoring and media consultancy fees. Not to mention 600 hours dealing with the fallout and the intangible cost of repairing the reputational damage that followed. Mr. Tripathi's nonprofit, the Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative in Waltham, Mass., works with doctors and hospitals to help digitize their patient records. His employee's stolen laptop contained unencrypted records for some 13,687 patients -- each record containing some combination of a patient's name, Social Security number, birth date, contact information and insurance information -- an identity theft gold mine.  His experience was hardly uncommon. As part of the 2009 stimulus bill, the federal government provides incentive payments to doctors and hospitals to adopt electronic health records. Some 57 percent of office-based physicians now use electronic health records, a 12 percent jump from last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. An unintended consequence is that as patient records have been digitized, health data breaches have surged. The number of reported breaches is up 32 percent this year from last year, according to the Ponemon Institute, a security research group. Those breaches cost the industry an estimated $6.5 billion last year. In almost half the cases, a lost or stolen phone or personal computer was responsible. Mr. Tripathi describes the days after the theft as a ''vortex.'' Fresh in his mind was a similar, albeit smaller, breach at Massachusetts General Hospital just months earlier in which a hospital employee left detailed clinical records for 192 patients on a subway. The breach had cost the hospital $1 million in settlement fees. ''We're a nonprofit with 35 people on staff,'' says Mr. Tripathi. ''A million-dollar fine would have decimated us.'' Mr. Tripathi says his nonprofit had just enacted a policy requiring that all patient files be encrypted, but had yet to decide on an encryption provider. All that stood between a determined computer thief and his patient data was a few passwords. Mr. Tripathi went to work assembling a crisis team of lawyers and customers and a chief security officer. They hired a private investigator to scour local pawnshops and Craigslist for the stolen laptop. The biggest headache, he says, was deciphering how much about the breach his nonprofit needed to disclose. Health organizations are required by federal law to report data breaches that affect more than 500 people to the Department of Health and Human Services. The department's Office of Civil Rights publishes the equivalent of a data breach ''Wall of Shame'' on its Web site -- which today includes 380 breaches affecting more than 18 million people. Mr. Tripathi said he quickly discovered just how many ways there were to count to 500. The law requires disclosure only in cases that ''pose a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individual affected.'' His team spent hours poring over a backup of the stolen laptop files. Of the nearly 14,000 patient records on the stolen laptop, most records did not warrant disclosure. In 2,777 cases, for instance, a record listed only a patient's name. Complicating matters were liability rules. In the eyes of the law, Mr. Tripathi's nonprofit is a contractor that acts on behalf of health providers. The legal burden of protecting patient data actually falls on his clients: the physicians and hospitals who entrusted his nonprofit with their files. ''The laws create a perverse outcome,'' he says. ''It was our fault, but from a federal perspective, it wasn't our breach.'' Mr. Tripathi narrowed down the group of patients whose data put them at serious risk for identity theft to 998 people across seven physician practices. Only one practice broke the 500-patient threshold requiring disclosure on the Department of Health and Human Services Web site. His office got to work notifying the affected patients of the data breach. They offered free credit monitoring -- though less than 10 percent took them up on the option -- spending a total of $6,000. In the aftermath, Mr. Tripathi says his company destroyed all patient data on mobile devices and temporarily prohibited employees from removing patient data from clients' offices. The company now mandates that all data be encrypted, and employees are required to tell health providers what data they will need to access and how they plan to use it. He never found the stolen laptop, and the incident, all told, cost his nonprofit $288,000. In many ways, Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative got off easy. In October, a desktop computer containing unencrypted records on more than four million patients was stolen from Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system based in Sacramento. A rock was thrown through a window to gain access to the computer. The theft is now the subject of two class-action suits, each of which seeks $1,000 for each patient record breached. ''Breaches are going to be one of the big challenges as more physicians and hospitals adopt electronic health records,'' Mr. Tripathi says. ''We're entering a brave new world.''  "
Q&A: Fighting a Clickjack Attack,"Q.I often see links posted on my friends' Facebook pages that I know are some sort of virus, even though it says my friend ""liked"" the page. Can I get infected myself if one of these links shows up on my Facebook News Feed or Wall? A.Many of those links promising a look at outrageous videos or photos are part of a ""clickjacking"" scam. In this situation, the user is typically tricked into clicking on a provocative link, but hidden code within the page posts a copy of the tainted link to the profiles of all the user's friends.  According to a post on a Facebook security page, if you or your friends have been clickjacked, you should be able to remove poison posts on your Facebook Wall and News Feed by moving the mouse cursor to the top-right corner of the unwanted item and clicking the X button to get the ""Remove and Unlike"" option. As a further precaution, check the Info page on your profile and remove any unwanted pages from your lists in the Activities and Interests area. As a general rule, do not click on strange links, even if it appears that close friends have shared them on your Facebook page; horrendous grammar or odd phrasing in the post should be an instant tip-off. Many clickjacking scams are designed just to herd users to sites that pay the perpetrator for page views, and are mostly harmless compared to other malicious activity. But depending on the spammer or scammer behind the code, malicious scripts can be used to deliver malware and junk mail, to phish for account information or to sign up unwitting users for unwanted services. To further protect yourself, make sure your computer is running an up-to-date security program. (Browser extensions like the NoScript add-on for Mozilla Firefox may help, but need to be configured carefully.) The Sophos security company has a more detailed look at how clickjacking works - and how to recover from it - here. Facebook's own Security area has tips on keeping safe from the latest threats at www.facebook.com/security.   "
Apple Operating System Affected by Malware,"For years Apple Mac users have boasted about the lack of viruses. In comparison, Microsoft Windows owners have regularly felt the brunt of viruses and malware that can easily debilitate an entire computer system in minutes. Now Apple is in that camp too after a barrage of viruses began infiltrating computers over the past few days. To fix the problem, Apple posted a list of instructions on its Web site Wednesday telling users how to remove the intrusive software from Macs. The company also said it planned to offer a software update that would completely eliminate the virus in the coming days. The virus infects Mac computers through Web sites that tell users to install antivirus software called Mac Defender. This software does the opposite of what it proposes and  infects computers with a virus.  Apple said the ultimate goal of the software was to gain access to credit card information ""which may be used for fraudulent purposes."" Alternative versions of the virus are called MacProtector and MacSecurity. The security company Intego posted an explanation of the malware on its blog and said the software was designed to look authentic and professional, using standard Apple iconography. Intego explained that once installed, Mac Defender would open  pornographic Web sites in the user's Web browser every few minutes. ""This is most likely to make users think that they are infected by a virus, and that paying for Mac Defender will relieve them of the problem,"" the company said.  "
"Syria Restores Access to Facebook and YouTube, Raising Fears of Monitoring Users"," The Syrian government began allowing its citizens Wednesday to openly use Facebook and YouTube, three years after blocking access to Facebook and other sites as part of a crackdown on political activism. Human rights advocates greeted the news guardedly, warning that the government might have lifted the ban to more closely monitor people and activity on social networking sites. The move comes just weeks after human rights activists in Egypt used Facebook and other social media tools to help mobilize tens of thousands of people for antigovernment protests. Activists in Tunisia used the Internet in December and January to help amass support for the protests and revolt that toppled the government of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.  After the mass demonstrations began in Egypt, opposition groups in Syria created a Facebook page called the Syrian Revolution and started a Twitter campaign calling on people to join ''day of rage'' rallies last week against President Bashar Assad. But the effort, which has generated more than 16,000 Facebook members, did not produce the street protesters that organizers had hoped for. Despite the ban, many Syrians had been able to use Facebook and other aspects of the Web restricted by the government through proxy servers that allowed people to circumvent the Syrian government's firewall, which also blocks Wikipedia, Amazon, Blogspot and Israeli newspapers, among other sites. Posts on the wall on Wednesday reflected a variety of opinions, including reminders for people to be careful about what they post to bold proclamations that the page would help spur change. ''We're going to launch a fearless attack,'' one user wrote on the Syrian Revolution Facebook page wall. ''Link to us on all pages so that all Syrians can see this. Think. Initiate. Decide, do and have faith in God.'' Syria's decision was welcomed by officials from the State Department with a note of caution, given the country's restrictions on the freedom of speech and freedom to assemble. ''We welcome any positive steps taken to create a more open Internet, but absent the freedoms of expression and association, citizens should understand the risks,'' said Alec J. Ross, senior adviser for innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who helped organize a delegation of business leaders from technology companies to meet with Mr. Assad in Syria last year. In those meetings, the business leaders said that opening the Web would be important to drive innovation. Susannah Vila, director of content and outreach for Movements.org, said she believed that the government in Syria, in releasing controls on the Internet, was trying to make it appear as if it were making democratic concessions after the tumult in Egypt and Tunisia. ''While access to social media sites presents an opportunity for Syrians to better mobilize one another, it also makes it easier for the government to identify activists and quash protests,'' said Ms. Vila, of the New York City-based organization that began in 2008 with the mission to help support advocates and activists using technology. Ms. Vila said there was growing concern that the government of Sudan was closely monitoring Facebook users there after lifting restrictions. Abdulsalam Haykal, a leading Syrian technology entrepreneur, praised the Syrian government's decision as a reflection of a commitment to build confidence with the country's young people. ''The power of social media is an important tool for increasing participation, especially by engaging young people,'' he said. Under Facebook's terms of service, users are required to use their real identities and not hide behind false or anonymous accounts, a violation that can lead to Facebook's closing an account. Debbie Frost, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said Wednesday that the company was not considering changing or re-examining its terms of service in those countries where some users were concerned about revealing their full identity for security reasons. ''Facebook has always been based on a real-name culture,'' she said. ''This leads to greater accountability and a safer and more trusted environment for our users. It's a violation of our policies to use a fake name or operate under a false identity.'' Ms. Frost said the company provided multiple options for users to communicate privately through groups and to read updates on a Facebook page without having to sign up for it. Ms. Frost said that the company had always seen some traffic for Syria, but not the number of Facebook users typical in a country, like Syria, with high Internet usage. She said the company did not see significant changes in traffic Wednesday. Syrian technology companies reported that it could take hours or days for people to get full access. A spokesperson for YouTube declined to comment on the lifting of the ban, but pointed to Google's Transparency report, which shows a jump in traffic to YouTube.com from Syria. According to DP-News.com, a pro-government Syrian Web site, there are about 200,000 Syrians currently using Facebook.  "
Companies Stay in the Loop by Using In-House Social Networks,"What would Facebook look like without photos of drunken nights out and tales of misbehaving cats? It might look a lot like the internal social network at the offices of Nikon Instruments. The tone is decidedly businesslike, as employees exchange messages about customer orders, new products and closing deals. And the general rule is that ''if you don't want your company president to see it, don't post it,'' said John G. Bivona, a customer relations manager at Nikon Instruments, which makes microscopes. As social networks increasingly dominate communications in private lives, businesses of all sizes -- from tiny start-ups to midsize companies like Nikon to behemoths like Dell -- are adopting them for the workplace. Although it is difficult to quantify how many companies use internal social networks, a number of corporate software companies have sensed the opportunity and offer various systems, some free to existing customers, others that charge a fee per user.  It's one more instance of how consumer technology trends, like the use of tablet computers, are crossing into office life. Because of Facebook, most people are already comfortable with the idea of ''following'' their colleagues. But in the business world, the connections are between colleagues, not personal friends or family, and the communications are meant to be about work matters -- like team projects, production flaws and other routine business issues. At Nikon, for example, which employs 500 people in offices throughout the United States, Canada and Brazil, a code of conduct for using the service leaves little room for the idle chit-chat that is pervasive on Facebook. Still, it can be tricky to transport the mores and practices of social networking into the office. For instance, some workers prefer to be ''lurkers'' who read posts rather than write them. Others are just not interested. At Symantec, the computer security company, a few employees initially disliked the idea of an internal social network, but nevertheless used it to air their complaints. Another issue is how to protect corporate secrets. The systems are generally set up so that companies can determine who sees particular files and who belongs to specific groups on the network. Yet problems still arise over where the data is ultimately stored. Some social network providers use their own servers. But that may conflict with the rules of some potential clients that prohibit storing company information outside their firewall, said Susan Landry, an analyst with Gartner. Companies that provide social networks respond to the concerns by emphasizing their rigorous security. Still, some offer networks that allow customers to keep their data on their own servers. And employees may post private information more widely than they should. ''It's sometimes a disaster,'' Ms. Landry said. ''It sometimes gets shut down by security or compliance.'' At the same time, even though companies make clear in etiquette guides how to use the networks, missteps occur. For example, at Symantec, a worker posted his cat's photo in his profile instead of his own. A well-meaning worker at Nikon alerted everyone to apple pie in the kitchen; never mind that colleagues in other offices were not interested. One of the biggest providers of corporate social networks is Salesforce.com, the online business software company based in San Francisco. It said 80,000 companies use its corporate social network, Chatter, up from around 10,000 when it was introduced a year ago. Yammer, a start-up and also based in San Francisco, said its service is used by more than 100,000 companies, up from around 80,000 a year ago. SAP, Cisco Systems, Socialtext, Jive Software and SuccessFactors are also pushing their products. Last month, VMware joined the list when it acquired Socialcast, one of the earlier networking services. Salesforce and Yammer both offer free versions of their social networks to companies. Salesforce charges $15 per user a month for its premium network -- existing software customers pay nothing extra, however -- while Yammer's costs $5 per user a month. At Symantec, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., more than a third of the 18,500 employees are able to use Chatter. More employees, and potentially some of the company's partners, will be added to the network later this summer. But not everyone who can use it does so. Chatter's analytic system, which can identify the most influential users, shows that only around 40 percent of the sales team is active on the service, said Tacy Parker, global sales force manager at Symantec. Still, Troy McKaskle, a chief technology officer at Symantec, is an evangelist for Chatter, which he says helps employees with everything from getting advice about how to configure their iPads to getting feedback on projects. Mr. McKaskle follows around a dozen groups on the service, and posts messages frequently. On a recent day, he wrote, ''Get ready for Odyssey!'' using a code name for a new technology that Symantec is developing. ''Dare I ask what Odyssey is?'' a colleague responded. Keeping posts relevant is important to the success of social networking within companies, managers of the networks agree. ''White noise'' will only annoy people and cause them to ignore the services. Employees can always stop following colleagues who post inane comments about their lunch, or they can quit groups in which they are no longer involved. On the other hand, employees in far-flung offices can use the network to be noticed in a way that would otherwise be impossible. A Symantec salesman in Dubai, for instance, has built a large following by creating a group that dispenses sales tips. Colleagues from around the world contribute advice too. Although generally serious in tone, some corporate social networks have a lighter touch that recalls some of Facebook's whimsy. A new feature on Yammer, for example, lets employees praise colleagues by giving them a gold star, among other accolades. Bosses can also take the pulse of the work force by posting a poll. Recently, Yammer introduced the ability to post videos. ''We've only built about 10 percent of what we want to build,'' said David O. Sacks, Yammer's chief executive, who unabashedly describes his service as ''very Facebook-like.'' One of the benefits of social networks for many employees is a decline in e-mail use. Instead of sending out mass mailings, workers post messages or collaborate on presentations within the service. Of course, social networks have not replaced many of the existing tools for collaborating, like Microsoft SharePoint. Nor have meetings become obsolete. Scott Lake, director of V.I.P. marketing at Caesars Entertainment, the casino colossus based in Las Vegas, said his team used Chatter to coordinate and promote events like Celine Dion concerts for the casino's best customers. Online groups set up for each event help ensure that everyone involved has the most up-to-date information. Questions and answers are visible to everyone in the group. Doing the same thing via e-mail would be cumbersome if not impossible. ''Before, we got on conference calls and hoped the information would be passed around,'' Mr. Lake said. ''Now, we have a lot fewer calls and meetings.''  "
Network That Preyed On Children Is Broken,"WASHINGTON -- Federal investigators announced on Wednesday that they had dismantled a sophisticated global network of pedophiles who traded pornographic videos and images of children as young as infants over the Internet, using encryption and proxy servers to evade detection.  About 600 people around the world were members of the online bulletin board ''Dreamboard'' before it shut down this spring amid the investigation, officials said. The Justice Department announced that 72 people had been charged so far, including more than 50 already arrested in the United States and abroad. The network specialized in graphic and often violent images of the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, including infants. It created an incentive among its members to create new files by kicking them out of the network if they did not upload material at least once every 50 days, and by granting them greater access to its archives if they created their own child pornography, said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer. ''Words cannot describe how horrific the enterprise's alleged crimes were,'' Mr. Breuer said. ''Dreamboard was extreme even among online child abuse forums. So-called 'super hard-core' images -- those depicting adults having violent sexual intercourse with 'very young kids' -- were highly valued.'' While the bulletin board used a server in Atlanta, most of its members were overseas, officials said. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said members had also been arrested in Canada, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hungary, Kenya, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Qatar, Serbia, Sweden and Switzerland. The investigation began in 2009, and officials said they were trying to identify the victims. John Morton, director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which participated in the inquiry, declined to say how investigators overcame the technological precautions used by some of the members. ''To those inclined to abuse small children, know this: there isn't a place on the Internet or the planet in which you are truly safe,'' he said. ''It may take us some time, it may take us some effort, but we will find you regardless of a screen name, a proxy server or an encryption effort, period.''  "
British Tabloid Accepts Blame In Cell Hacking,"LONDON -- Faced with a cascade of lawsuits and a widening police investigation into illegal hacking of phone messages by the News of the World tabloid, its parent company on Friday publicly admitted wrongdoing, apologized and offered to pay damages to some of the people who are alleged to be victims of the paper. The sudden admission was a dramatic about-face for the company, News International, which claimed for years that it had thoroughly examined the matter and was certain that the hacking had been limited to one ''rogue'' reporter and a private investigator. Neither of those claims was true, it turns out. ''Past behavior at the News of the World in relation to voice mail is a matter of genuine regret,'' News International, the British publishing division of Rupert Murdoch's media empire and the owner of the tabloid, said in a statement. ''It is now apparent that our previous inquiries failed to uncover important evidence and we acknowledge our actions then were not sufficiently robust.''  At least 24 celebrities, politicians and other public figures are currently suing News International, claiming that their cellphone voice-mail messages were illegally hacked into, or intercepted, by News of the World journalists hunting for stories. The company said that it was admitting wrongdoing in eight of those cases, those brought by, among others, the actress Sienna Miller; Tessa Jowell, a Labour Party politician; Andy Gray, a sports commentator and former athlete; and Nicola Phillips, a publicist who used to work for the celebrity publicist Max Clifford. ''News International has decided to approach some civil litigants with an unreserved apology and an admission of liability in cases meeting specific criteria,'' the company said in its statement. Much of the evidence in those and other cases was seized by the police in their initial investigation of hacking several years ago, and has come to light only recently in court documents. Unless many of the plaintiffs decide to settle, more damaging disclosures about News of the World's culpability could emerge as the current cases, and others that have not yet been filed, wend their way through the courts. News International proposed that cases other than the eight it hoped to settle might be overseen by an independent adjudicator. It said it planned to set up ''a compensation scheme with a view to dealing with justifiable claims fairly and efficiently,'' a plan that could cost it millions of pounds. But, it added, it would contest those cases that ''we believe are without merit or where we are not responsible.'' Two weeks ago, a High Court judge, Geoffrey Vos, ordered the ''rolling disclosure'' of tens of thousands of potentially damning News of the World e-mails to potential hacking victims. He has also ordered the police to release pertinent information to potential victims. It is unclear how many people were made targets by News of the World, but some estimates have put the figure in the thousands. Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament who has been a vocal critic of News International, said that the company had little choice but to try to settle. But the offer was ''hardly the end of it,'' he said. ''There are hundreds, if not thousands, of other victims involved,'' he said in an interview. ''And they've just got a lot of unanswered questions hanging in the air, and we are going to keep going until we get those questions answered.'' Mark Lewis, a lawyer for several of the people suing the company, said some plaintiffs were likely to accept ''reasonable'' offers from the company. ''The difficulty will be that without the full truth, it's difficult to assess the offer,'' he said in an interview. ''If you don't know how many times your phone was hacked, it's hard to know whether an offer is acceptable.'' Speaking of News of the World, Mr. Lewis said that some of the hacking cases that the paper was offering to settle were so blatant that ''the only people who didn't know were their readers.'' The case dates back to 2006, when two men -- the News of the World's royal reporter, Clive Goodman, and a private investigator working for the paper named Glenn Mulcaire -- were charged with illegally intercepting voice-mail messages from the cellphones of aides to members of the royal family. The two were jailed the following year, and that seemed to be that. But in 2009, The Guardian newspaper reported that several people, including the former chief executive of the Football Association, had been paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by News International to settle claims that their voice-mail messages, too, had been hacked. An article in The New York Times Magazine last summer quoted current and former employees of News of the World as saying that hacking had been endemic at the paper, describing a culture where reporters were encouraged to use any means possible to get stories. Since then, more and more possible victims have come forward, many after being alerted to possible hacking by their cellphone companies. In January, News of the World dismissed its assistant editor for news, Ian Edmondson, after court papers showed that the name ''Ian'' had been written in the phone-hacking notes of Mr. Mulcaire, the formerly jailed investigator. Soon after, Andy Coulson, who was editor of News of the World during the period that the hacking is said to have occurred, resigned from his new job, as Prime Minister David Cameron's chief spokesman, saying that the case was proving too much of a distraction. He has not been directly linked to any wrongdoing. Until recently, News of the World seemed reluctant to pursue the matter. But that has changed in the last few months. In March, for example, executives at the newspaper said they had suddenly unearthed millions of employee e-mails that they had claimed were somehow lost by their Internet provider en route to storage in India. They vowed to pass any relevant material to the police. Meanwhile, the police have been embarrassed by the case, facing accusations that they dragged their feet and failed to conduct a thorough investigation. They have since reopened the investigation, led by new officers who have promised to robustly identify any wrongdoers. At the same time, prosecutors are conducting an inquiry into what went wrong in the initial police operation. News International's statement today relates only to the civil litigation. Earlier this week, two News of the World journalists -- Mr. Edmondson, the former assistant editor, and Neville Thurlbeck, the paper's chief reporter -- were arrested on suspicion of phone hacking. They were questioned, released and ordered to present themselves to the police for further questioning in the fall.  "
CNN Host and Ex-Tabloid Editor Is Reluctantly Dragged Into Phone Scandal,"LONDON -- It was perhaps inevitable that the phone hacking accusations in Britain would cross the Atlantic and reach Piers Morgan, the flamboyant former Fleet Street editor who is now the host of ''Piers Morgan Tonight'' on CNN. James Hipwell, a former journalist at The Daily Mirror, a tabloid edited by Mr. Morgan until 2004, now says that phone hacking was ''endemic'' at the paper. ''Piers was extremely hands-on as an editor,'' Mr. Hipwell, 45, told the British newspaper The Independent in an interview published Saturday. ''I can't say 100 percent that he knew about it. But it was inconceivable he didn't.'' In an e-mail interview, Mr. Morgan struck back at that allegation and other suggestions by members of Parliament and a widely read political blog that his reporters had landed scoops at The Daily Mirror based on phone hacking. Members of Parliament have also said that Mr. Morgan should be questioned. ''I have never hacked a phone, told anyone to hack a phone, nor to my knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''I am not aware, and have never seen evidence to suggest otherwise, that any Mirror story published during my tenure was obtained from phone hacking.''  Mr. Morgan challenged Mr. Hipwell's credibility, pointing to the fact that he is a convicted felon who went to jail in 2006 for 59 days for buying stock in companies before touting them in a Daily Mirror column, then selling the shares when the prices rose. Mr. Morgan himself was accused of profiting from the sale of one company's stock based on the column, but said he ''was cleared by both internal inquiry and external legal investigation.'' Mr. Hipwell ''lied repeatedly during the various investigations into the scandal -- both about me and about other colleagues,'' Mr. Morgan said. ''He is not a credible witness.'' In an e-mail, Mr. Hipwell replied that his lawyers thought his case and Mr. Morgan's had been ''identical'' and that they were surprised that Mr. Morgan was cleared. ''No one has got to the bottom of why this happened,'' he wrote. A spokesman for Trinity Mirror, the publisher of The Daily Mirror, denied Mr. Hipwell's allegations about hacking. Asked if CNN had pressed him for assurances that he was not involved in phone hacking, Mr. Morgan replied, ''My unequivocal statements on this matter speak for themselves.'' A CNN spokeswoman said on Saturday that Mr. Morgan had been asked about the accusations and ''denied involvement in phone hacking both publicly and privately.'' In 2007, Mr. Morgan was quoted in GQ magazine as saying that the former News of the World reporter Clive Goodman, who went to jail for hacking phones of members of the royal household, had been made ''a scapegoat for a widespread practice.'' (The News of the World is the newspaper that has been at the heart of the hacking scandal.) Mr. Morgan said on Saturday that he had heard rumors about phone hacking in tabloid newsrooms for years, and ''it would now appear those rumors were correct.'' Mr. Hipwell's accusations are the latest in a series of charges against Mr. Morgan; the newspaper he edited, The Daily Mirror; and its sister tabloids The People and The Sunday Mirror. This month, Adrian Sanders, a member of Parliament, accused Mr. Morgan's old newspaper of obtaining a 2002 scoop -- that the former England soccer manager Sven-Goran Eriksson had had an affair with a television personality, Ulrika Jonsson -- by means of phone hacking. British lawmakers are protected from libel lawsuits while speaking in Parliament. Last Tuesday, during the questioning of James and Rupert Murdoch as part of the parliamentary committee, Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament, used the same protection to wonder aloud why lawmakers had not questioned Mr. Morgan. She then suggested -- incorrectly, as it turned out -- that Mr. Morgan had admitted in a book he wrote that phone hacking had produced big scoops for The Daily Mirror. She appeared to conflate a passage from his book with several posts by the widely read British political blogger Guido Fawkes. Later that day on CNN, an audibly angry Mr. Morgan confronted Ms. Mensch to deny the accusations. Ms. Mensch, he said, was ''a coward'' for refusing to repeat her claims outside of Parliament, where she would not be covered by the immunity protections. He challenged her to ''repeat what you said about it and then maybe go and buy a copy of my book.'' In the e-mail interview, Mr. Morgan said he intended to write a letter to John Whittingdale, the Conservative chairman of Parliament's culture, media and sport select committee, to demand a correction and apology from Ms. Mensch. ''Ms. Mensch accused me of personal criminal activity,'' Mr. Morgan said, ''and I never broke the law as an editor.'' Ms. Mensch did not respond to a message seeking comment. Mr. Morgan said he was gratified to see that Tom Watson, the Labour lawmaker who led the parliamentary questioning of the Murdochs on Tuesday, had said Saturday on Twitter: ''I've not seen any evidence linking @PiersMorgan to hacking. And I've seen a lot of documentation these last 2 years.'' Mr. Morgan was dismissed as editor of The Daily Mirror after it printed photographs, purporting to show British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners, that were revealed to be fake. He had also served as an editor at The News of the World in 1994 and 1995. ''I left the News of the World in 1995, at least five years before anyone has suggested phone hacking started at the newspaper,'' he said, ''and before cellphones were even in widespread use in the U.K.'' Mr. Morgan was asked about his longtime friendships with Rebekah Brooks, the former chief of The News of the World's parent company who was arrested a week ago, and Andy Coulson, the former News of the World editor who was also arrested in connection with phone hacking and the bribery of police officers. The Fleet Street adventures of Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson are featured in Mr. Morgan's book ''The Insider.'' ''I have offered them both my support as a friend,'' he said. Mr. Morgan was also a friend and colleague of Sean Hoare, the first former News of the World reporter to link Mr. Coulson to phone hacking. Mr. Hoare died at the age of 47 on Monday. The police have said Mr. Hoare's death was not suspicious. The outcome of toxicology reports are pending. ''I was shocked and saddened to hear of Sean Hoare's death,'' Mr. Morgan said.  "
Disregard That 'Past Due Invoice' From the College Board,"At a time when the College Board is already under scrutiny, like the SAT testing fraud investigation on Long Island, the organization that oversees the high-stakes college entrance exam has inadvertently raised students' anxiety on another front. This week, an untold number of counselors and students received an e-mail from the College Board soliciting their credit card information. The message, which carried a subject line of ""The College Board - Past Due Invoice,"" read: Our records indicate a past due balance on your account. This is often the result of a declined credit card payment or failure to submit the correct amount with your registration. It is important that you pay this outstanding balance quickly to avoid having your SAT scores placed on hold. While it wasn't spam, it did turn out to have been sent in error. The e-mail was followed, some 10 hours later, by an apology and retraction from the same College Board e-mail address. The note was headlined ""PLEASE DISREGARD EARLIER MESSAGE"" and read: We are writing to inform you that the e-mail message did in fact come from the College Board; however, it was sent to you in error. Please ignore and delete that e-mail. We assure you that your personal data was not compromised and no charges or transactions have been made in your name. Kathleen Steinberg, executive director of communications, wrote in an e-mail statement to The Choice regarding the situation: Earlier [Thursday], certain College Board account holders inadvertently received an e-mail from the College Board.  These recipients have been notified and asked to ignore and delete the original e-mail.  No personal data was compromised.  We are addressing the cause of the erroneous transmission, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience. Ms. Steinberg did not respond to questions about how many students and counselors received the e-mail, but a flurry of activity on Twitter and across the Web suggests the reach of the message to be broad. Peter Vogel, a physics teacher in Vancouver, British Columbia, found himself to be in good company after he crowd-sourced on Twitter: ""Anyone else receive the e-mail today from the College Board demanding payment for a non-existent SAT exam; followed by an apology?"" Meanwhile, the University of Pittsburgh was quick to advise its community of the illegitimacy of the solicitation, releasing a ""Phishing Alert"" warning recipients to delete the message without replying.

Israel Tests Called Crucial In Iran Nuclear Setback," The Dimona complex in the Negev desert is famous as the heavily guarded heart of Israel's never-acknowledged nuclear arms program, where neat rows of factories make atomic fuel for the arsenal. Over the past two years, according to intelligence and military experts familiar with its operations, Dimona has taken on a new, equally secret role -- as a critical testing ground in a joint American and Israeli effort to undermine Iran's efforts to make a bomb of its own. Behind Dimona's barbed wire, the experts say, Israel has spun nuclear centrifuges virtually identical to Iran's at Natanz, where Iranian scientists are struggling to enrich uranium. They say Dimona tested the effectiveness of the Stuxnet computer worm, a destructive program that appears to have wiped out roughly a fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges and helped delay, though not destroy, Tehran's ability to make its first nuclear arms. ''To check out the worm, you have to know the machines,'' said an American expert on nuclear intelligence. ''The reason the worm has been effective is that the Israelis tried it out.''  Though American and Israeli officials refuse to talk publicly about what goes on at Dimona, the operations there, as well as related efforts in the United States, are among the newest and strongest clues suggesting that the virus was designed as an American-Israeli project to sabotage the Iranian program. In recent days, the retiring chief of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, Meir Dagan, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton separately announced that they believed Iran's efforts had been set back by several years. Mrs. Clinton cited American-led sanctions, which have hurt Iran's ability to buy components and do business around the world. The gruff Mr. Dagan, whose organization has been accused by Iran of being behind the deaths of several Iranian scientists, told the Israeli Knesset in recent days that Iran had run into technological difficulties that could delay a bomb until 2015. That represented a sharp reversal from Israel's long-held argument that Iran was on the cusp of success. The biggest single factor in putting time on the nuclear clock appears to be Stuxnet, the most sophisticated cyberweapon ever deployed. In interviews over the past three months in the United States and Europe, experts who have picked apart the computer worm describe it as far more complex -- and ingenious -- than anything they had imagined when it began circulating around the world, unexplained, in mid-2009. Many mysteries remain, chief among them, exactly who constructed a computer worm that appears to have several authors on several continents. But the digital trail is littered with intriguing bits of evidence. In early 2008 the German company Siemens cooperated with one of the United States' premier national laboratories, in Idaho, to identify the vulnerabilities of computer controllers that the company sells to operate industrial machinery around the world -- and that American intelligence agencies have identified as key equipment in Iran's enrichment facilities. Siemens says that program was part of routine efforts to secure its products against cyberattacks. Nonetheless, it gave the Idaho National Laboratory -- which is part of the Energy Department, responsible for America's nuclear arms -- the chance to identify well-hidden holes in the Siemens systems that were exploited the next year by Stuxnet. The worm itself now appears to have included two major components. One was designed to send Iran's nuclear centrifuges spinning wildly out of control. Another seems right out of the movies: The computer program also secretly recorded what normal operations at the nuclear plant looked like, then played those readings back to plant operators, like a pre-recorded security tape in a bank heist, so that it would appear that everything was operating normally while the centrifuges were actually tearing themselves apart. The attacks were not fully successful: Some parts of Iran's operations ground to a halt, while others survived, according to the reports of international nuclear inspectors. Nor is it clear the attacks are over: Some experts who have examined the code believe it contains the seeds for yet more versions and assaults. ''It's like a playbook,'' said Ralph Langner, an independent computer security expert in Hamburg, Germany, who was among the first to decode Stuxnet. ''Anyone who looks at it carefully can build something like it.'' Mr. Langner is among the experts who expressed fear that the attack had legitimized a new form of industrial warfare, one to which the United States is also highly vulnerable. Officially, neither American nor Israeli officials will even utter the name of the malicious computer program, much less describe any role in designing it. But Israeli officials grin widely when asked about its effects. Mr. Obama's chief strategist for combating weapons of mass destruction, Gary Samore, sidestepped a Stuxnet question at a recent conference about Iran, but added with a smile: ''I'm glad to hear they are having troubles with their centrifuge machines, and the U.S. and its allies are doing everything we can to make it more complicated.'' In recent days, American officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity have said in interviews that they believe Iran's setbacks have been underreported. That may explain why Mrs. Clinton provided her public assessment while traveling in the Middle East last week. By the accounts of a number of computer scientists, nuclear enrichment experts and former officials, the covert race to create Stuxnet was a joint project between the Americans and the Israelis, with some help, knowing or unknowing, from the Germans and the British. The project's political origins can be found in the last months of the Bush administration. In January 2009, The New York Times reported that Mr. Bush authorized a covert program to undermine the electrical and computer systems around Natanz, Iran's major enrichment center. President Obama, first briefed on the program even before taking office, sped it up, according to officials familiar with the administration's Iran strategy. So did the Israelis, other officials said. Israel has long been seeking a way to cripple Iran's capability without triggering the opprobrium, or the war, that might follow an overt military strike of the kind they conducted against nuclear facilities in Iraq in 1981 and Syria in 2007. Two years ago, when Israel still thought its only solution was a military one and approached Mr. Bush for the bunker-busting bombs and other equipment it believed it would need for an air attack, its officials told the White House that such a strike would set back Iran's programs by roughly three years. Its request was turned down. Now, Mr. Dagan's statement suggests that Israel believes it has gained at least that much time, without mounting an attack. So does the Obama administration. For years, Washington's approach to Tehran's program has been one of attempting ''to put time on the clock,'' a senior administration official said, even while refusing to discuss Stuxnet. ''And now, we have a bit more.'' Finding Weaknesses Paranoia helped, as it turns out. Years before the worm hit Iran, Washington had become deeply worried about the vulnerability of the millions of computers that run everything in the United States from bank transactions to the power grid. Computers known as controllers run all kinds of industrial machinery. By early 2008, the Department of Homeland Security had teamed up with the Idaho National Laboratory to study a widely used Siemens controller known as P.C.S.-7, for Process Control System 7. Its complex software, called Step 7, can run whole symphonies of industrial instruments, sensors and machines. The vulnerability of the controller to cyberattack was an open secret. In July 2008, the Idaho lab and Siemens teamed up on a PowerPoint presentation on the controller's vulnerabilities that was made to a conference in Chicago at Navy Pier, a top tourist attraction. ''Goal is for attacker to gain control,'' the July paper said in describing the many kinds of maneuvers that could exploit system holes. The paper was 62 pages long, including pictures of the controllers as they were examined and tested in Idaho. In a statement on Friday, the Idaho National Laboratory confirmed that it formed a partnership with Siemens but said it was one of many with manufacturers to identify cybervulnerabilities. It argued that the report did not detail specific flaws that attackers could exploit. But it also said it could not comment on the laboratory's classified missions, leaving unanswered the question of whether it passed what it learned about the Siemens systems to other parts of the nation's intelligence apparatus. The presentation at the Chicago conference, which recently disappeared from a Siemens Web site, never discussed specific places where the machines were used. But Washington knew. The controllers were critical to operations at Natanz, a sprawling enrichment site in the desert. ''If you look for the weak links in the system,'' said one former American official, ''this one jumps out.'' Controllers, and the electrical regulators they run, became a focus of sanctions efforts. The trove of State Department cables made public by WikiLeaks describes urgent efforts in April 2009 to stop a shipment of Siemens controllers, contained in 111 boxes at the port of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. They were headed for Iran, one cable said, and were meant to control ''uranium enrichment cascades'' -- the term for groups of spinning centrifuges. Subsequent cables showed that the United Arab Emirates blocked the transfer of the Siemens computers across the Strait of Hormuz to Bandar Abbas, a major Iranian port. Only months later, in June, Stuxnet began to pop up around the globe. The Symantec Corporation, a maker of computer security software and services based in Silicon Valley, snared it in a global malware collection system. The worm hit primarily inside Iran, Symantec reported, but also in time appeared in India, Indonesia and other countries. But unlike most malware, it seemed to be doing little harm. It did not slow computer networks or wreak general havoc. That deepened the mystery. A 'Dual Warhead' No one was more intrigued than Mr. Langner, a former psychologist who runs a small computer security company in a suburb of Hamburg. Eager to design protective software for his clients, he had his five employees focus on picking apart the code and running it on the series of Siemens controllers neatly stacked in racks, their lights blinking. He quickly discovered that the worm only kicked into gear when it detected the presence of a specific configuration of controllers, running a set of processes that appear to exist only in a centrifuge plant. ''The attackers took great care to make sure that only their designated targets were hit,'' he said. ''It was a marksman's job.'' For example, one small section of the code appears designed to send commands to 984 machines linked together. Curiously, when international inspectors visited Natanz in late 2009, they found that the Iranians had taken out of service a total of exactly 984 machines that had been running the previous summer. But as Mr. Langner kept peeling back the layers, he found more -- what he calls the ''dual warhead.'' One part of the program is designed to lie dormant for long periods, then speed up the machines so that the spinning rotors in the centrifuges wobble and then destroy themselves. Another part, called a ''man in the middle'' in the computer world, sends out those false sensor signals to make the system believe everything is running smoothly. That prevents a safety system from kicking in, which would shut down the plant before it could self-destruct. ''Code analysis makes it clear that Stuxnet is not about sending a message or proving a concept,'' Mr. Langner later wrote. ''It is about destroying its targets with utmost determination in military style.'' This was not the work of hackers, he quickly concluded. It had to be the work of someone who knew his way around the specific quirks of the Siemens controllers and had an intimate understanding of exactly how the Iranians had designed their enrichment operations. In fact, the Americans and the Israelis had a pretty good idea. Testing the Worm Perhaps the most secretive part of the Stuxnet story centers on how the theory of cyberdestruction was tested on enrichment machines to make sure the malicious software did its intended job. The account starts in the Netherlands. In the 1970s, the Dutch designed a tall, thin machine for enriching uranium. As is well known, A. Q. Khan, a Pakistani metallurgist working for the Dutch, stole the design and in 1976 fled to Pakistan. The resulting machine, known as the P-1, for Pakistan's first-generation centrifuge, helped the country get the bomb. And when Dr. Khan later founded an atomic black market, he illegally sold P-1's to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. The P-1 is more than six feet tall. Inside, a rotor of aluminum spins uranium gas to blinding speeds, slowly concentrating the rare part of the uranium that can fuel reactors and bombs. How and when Israel obtained this kind of first-generation centrifuge remains unclear, whether from Europe, or the Khan network, or by other means. But nuclear experts agree that Dimona came to hold row upon row of spinning centrifuges. ''They've long been an important part of the complex,'' said Avner Cohen, author of ''The Worst-Kept Secret'' (2010), a book about the Israeli bomb program, and a senior fellow at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. He added that Israeli intelligence had asked retired senior Dimona personnel to help on the Iranian issue, and that some apparently came from the enrichment program. ''I have no specific knowledge,'' Dr. Cohen said of Israel and the Stuxnet worm. ''But I see a strong Israeli signature and think that the centrifuge knowledge was critical.'' Another clue involves the United States. It obtained a cache of P-1's after Libya gave up its nuclear program in late 2003, and the machines were sent to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, another arm of the Energy Department. By early 2004, a variety of federal and private nuclear experts assembled by the Central Intelligence Agency were calling for the United States to build a secret plant where scientists could set up the P-1's and study their vulnerabilities. ''The notion of a test bed was really pushed,'' a participant at the C.I.A. meeting recalled. The resulting plant, nuclear experts said last week, may also have played a role in Stuxnet testing. But the United States and its allies ran into the same problem the Iranians have grappled with: the P-1 is a balky, badly designed machine. When the Tennessee laboratory shipped some of its P-1's to England, in hopes of working with the British on a program of general P-1 testing, they stumbled, according to nuclear experts. ''They failed hopelessly,'' one recalled, saying that the machines proved too crude and temperamental to spin properly. Dr. Cohen said his sources told him that Israel succeeded -- with great difficulty -- in mastering the centrifuge technology. And the American expert in nuclear intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Israelis used machines of the P-1 style to test the effectiveness of Stuxnet. The expert added that Israel worked in collaboration with the United States in targeting Iran, but that Washington was eager for ''plausible deniability.'' In November, the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, broke the country's silence about the worm's impact on its enrichment program, saying a cyberattack had caused ''minor problems with some of our centrifuges.'' Fortunately, he added, ''our experts discovered it.'' The most detailed portrait of the damage comes from the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington. Last month, it issued a lengthy Stuxnet report that said Iran's P-1 machines at Natanz suffered a series of failures in mid- to late 2009 that culminated in technicians taking 984 machines out of action. The report called the failures ''a major problem'' and identified Stuxnet as the likely culprit. Stuxnet is not the only blow to Iran. Sanctions have hurt its effort to build more advanced (and less temperamental) centrifuges. And last January, and again in November, two scientists who were believed to be central to the nuclear program were killed in Tehran. The man widely believed to be responsible for much of Iran's program, Mohsen Fakrizadeh, a college professor, has been hidden away by the Iranians, who know he is high on the target list. Publicly, Israeli officials make no explicit ties between Stuxnet and Iran's problems. But in recent weeks, they have given revised and surprisingly upbeat assessments of Tehran's nuclear status. ''A number of technological challenges and difficulties'' have beset Iran's program, Moshe Yaalon, Israel's minister of strategic affairs, told Israeli public radio late last month. The troubles, he added, ''have postponed the timetable.'' Online Correction: January 17, 2011, Monday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled, at one point, the name of the German company whose computer controller systems were exploited by the Stuxnet computer worm.

U.S. Dismantles Large Network Of PCs Infected by Criminals,"The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Wednesday that they had dismantled a giant international network of computers infected by malicious software, one that was used in an eight-year financial crime spree. The agencies used both legal and technical methods, some of them unorthodox, in what they described as a groundbreaking effort to dismantle the so-called botnet, known as Coreflood. The botnet is estimated to have commandeered some 2.3 million Windows PCs in homes and businesses around the world, including 1.8 million in the United States. Coreflood helped gather usernames and passwords for the financial accounts of the owners of infected PCs that were then used to steal money from the accounts, making off with as much as $100 million, according to some estimates. Among the victims were a real estate company in Michigan whose bank account was drained of $115,771 and a Tennessee defense contractor that lost $241,866, according to the complaint.  The government's approach involved an effort to rescue the hijacked PCs and also take down the botnet's control system. It marks an advance in strategies to take down botnets, said Thorsten Holz, an assistant professor at Ruhr-University in Bochum, Germany, and a research analyst at the security company Lastline. He warned, however, that unless they are arrested, the botnet creators ''will likely continue to develop novel variants of malware and start a new generation of Coreflood in the future.'' As part of the government's legal strategy, the United States Attorney's office in Connecticut filed a civil complaint on Monday against 13 unnamed or ''John Doe'' defendants, alleging wire fraud, bank fraud and illegal interception of electronic communications. This approach allowed it to get court permission to act against the botnet. The F.B.I. then seized five server computers located in Arizona, Georgia, Texas, Ohio and California and 29 Web domains hosted in Connecticut that were used to control the PCs. The seizure disabled the botnet and is also likely to aid a continuing law enforcement investigation into the people responsible, who are believed to reside outside the United States, likely in Eastern Europe, where much online financial crime is centered. With the help of a court-ordered temporary restraining order, the F.B.I also replaced the botnet's so-called command-and-control servers with its own servers, which are being hosted by the Internet Systems Consortium, a nonprofit group. The swap was designed to head off an expected effort by the botnet owners to regain control by sending commands or new malicious software to the infected PCs, and to give Microsoft and antivirus software makers time to try to rid PCs of the Coreflood malware. The government said it was advised in the case by Microsoft, which has successfully taken down two large botnets used to send spam, known as Rustock and Waledac, using similar legal approaches. Microsoft said it candidly shared lessons learned during its earlier takedowns. A key lesson was that ''you want to hit them simultaneously and you want to hit them hard'' before they have a chance to move their operations, said T.J. Campana, senior program manager at Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit. ''We can really disrupt crime on the Internet through these types of tactics. We're all glowing here.'' Microsoft said Wednesday that, as part of its cooperation with the government, it had updated its free Malicious Software Removal Tool to detect and remove Coreflood and make eliminating it part of its monthly Windows updating process. The government's effort against Coreflood was different from Microsoft's takedowns in that the government obtained court permission to actually stop infected machines from phoning home to their criminal masters. It also commanded the PCs to stop collecting victims' personal data and effectively turn off the malware. This so-called kill command did not remove the malware from the PCs. The approach is a variation on a controversial tactic used by authorities in the Netherlands during their effort to take down the Bredolab botnet last year. The Dutch installed their own ''bot'' program on machines that had been infected by Bredolab, causing them to display a message notifying owners of the infection and explaining how to remove it. Officials in the United States avoided that legally troublesome approach, and instead gained permission from a court to send the kill command to infected computers within the country. It is working with Internet service providers to notify people whose PCs are infected and give them the ability to opt-out if, for some reason, they want to keep Coreflood running on their computers. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Study Sees Way to Win Spam Fight,"For years, a team of computer scientists at two University of California campuses has been looking deeply into the nature of spam, the billions of unwanted e-mail messages generated by networks of zombie computers controlled by the rogue programs called botnets. They even coined a term, ''spamalytics,'' to describe their work. Now they have concluded an experiment that is not for the faint of heart: for three months they set out to receive all the spam they could (no quarantines or filters need apply), then systematically made purchases from the Web sites advertised in the messages.  The hope, the scientists said, was to find a ''choke point'' that could greatly reduce the flow of spam. And in a paper to be presented on Tuesday at the annual IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in Oakland, Calif., they will report that they think they have found it. It turned out that 95 percent of the credit card transactions for the spam-advertised drugs and herbal remedies they bought were handled by just three financial companies -- one based in Azerbaijan, one in Denmark and one in Nevis, in the West Indies. The researchers looked at nearly a billion messages and spent several thousand dollars on about 120 purchases. No single purchase was more than $277. If a handful of companies like these refused to authorize online credit card payments to the merchants, ''you'd cut off the money that supports the entire spam enterprise,'' said one of the scientists, Stefan Savage of the University of California, San Diego, who worked with colleagues at San Diego and Berkeley and at the International Computer Science Institute. Visa, the largest credit card company, declined to comment. But Steve Kirsch, chief executive of Abaca Technology, an antispam company based in San Jose, Calif., said the findings held the potential for ''a very powerful deterrent'' to spammers. ''If the credit card companies wanted to shut down the spammers, we can easily aid them in rapidly and unambiguously identifying the merchant accounts used by spammers,'' he said. Spam has proved notoriously difficult to defeat over the years, despite sophisticated filtering technologies and legal investigations and convictions. Seven years after the famous prediction by Bill Gates, then chairman of Microsoft, that spam would be eradicated in just two years, about 90 percent of all e-mail is spam. An earlier study undertaken by the scientists showed that a single commercial spam e-mail campaign generated three messages for every person on the planet. That same study revealed that to sell $100 worth of Viagra, a spam provider needed to send 12.5 million messages. ''In the end, spam is an advertising business,'' Dr. Savage said in an interview. ''However, it only makes sense if you can find a way to take people's money. ''This means credit cards. Credit cards are the only payment platform that is ubiquitously available to Western consumers and can be used for Internet commerce.'' Merchants must work with a bank that is authorized to handle the transactions, he said, but most banks already refuse to work with shady sellers. If the financial companies like those found in the study would follow suit, then spammers would have to find new banks -- and the cost of switching would be high. Moreover, it is difficult to mask high-risk transactions, making it relatively easy to maintain blacklists. ''It is the banking component of the spam value chain that is both the least studied and, we believe, the most critical,'' the researchers write. The computer scientists say that because the spam system relies on just a few banks and an even smaller number of credit card processors, the business is highly vulnerable to disruption by regulators and law enforcement agencies. Moreover, legal pressure is increasing on other advertising channels used by online pharmacies. Last week Google reported in its quarterly financial statement that it had set aside $500 million to resolve a Justice Department criminal investigation into the company's practice of accepting advertising from online pharmacies. In their report, the University of California researchers looked at a campaign organized by a brand named Pharmacy Express, part of the Mailien marketing group, based in Russia. On Oct. 27, 2010, for instance, a network of zombie computers called the Grum botnet delivered an e-mail with ''Viagra Official Site'' in the subject line. Users who responded to the message were directed to a Web site that had been registered nine days earlier. The Internet system that supported the Web site was spread around the globe: the domain registrar was in Russia, the server computer was in China, and a proxy server computer was in Brazil. When a purchase was made from the Web site, the shopper was redirected from a computer in Turkey to the Azerigazbank Joint-Stock Investment Bank in Baku, Azerbaijan. The drugs themselves were sent directly from a manufacturer in India. The weak link in the system, the researchers noted, was that the Visa payment system handled the transaction between the customer's bank in the United States and the bank in Azerbaijan. Efforts to contact the Azerigazbank and the Mailien marketing group were unsuccessful. By blocking the transactions at the point at which the consumer uses a credit card, it is possible to shift the burden of cost to the spammer. ''The defenders can, in principle, identify which banks the scammers are using far faster than they can get new banks,'' Dr. Savage said, ''and for basically zero cost.''  "
"Men Robbed ATM Using Dunkin' Donuts Cards, Officials Say","Gift cards can be thoughtful. But some people still prefer cash. Two men have been indicted on charges of stealing more than $17,000 from a Chase bank branch in Hollis, Queens, by re-encoding Dunkin' Donuts gift cards with customers' stolen account information, the Queens County district attorney's office announced Monday. Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said the two men, visitors from Romania traveling in the United States on journalism visas, used the bank's ATMs ""as their personal slot machines"" - carrying out unauthorized transactions by encoding rechargeable Dunkin' Donuts cards with account information belonging to customers at various area banks.  The defendants, Daniel Gheorghe and Ionel Cristian Popa, both 33, were arraigned on Thursday in Queens County Supreme Court on a 70-count indictment. Sixty-six of the counts are for second-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument and carry a sentence of up to seven years in prison on each count. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges. According to the indictment, police first observed the defendants' unauthorized withdrawals in March. The cash machines apparently read the gift cards as bank-issued cards, and after each transaction, the men jammed cash, usually twenty-dollar bills, into their pockets, the police said. Police were summoned to the Chase branch at 205-19 Hillside Avenue by identity theft investigators from JPMorgan Chase, Mr. Brown said in a statement. At the time of the arrest, the authorities said, the men were found with $17,703 in stolen cash and 66 Dunkin' Donuts gift cards. Each Dunkin' Donuts gift card is issued with a 16-digit vendor account number. According to the criminal charges, investigators found that none of the codes displayed on the front of the seized cards matched the encoded information on the cards' magnetic strips. The numbers on the strip came from accounts registered to several local banks, including Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and HSBC, the authorities said. It was unclear how the defendants accessed customers' account information. There have been other cases in the region of ATM-related fraud in which Romanian nationals have been charged. In March 2010, two Romanians were charged with and later convicted of placing what are known as skimmer devices on machines in Woodside, Queens, in order to steal account numbers from customers at an HSBC bank. Months later, four Romanian citizens were charged with similar crimes at ATM machines in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  In 2009, after a rash of skimming incidents across Australia, investigators there referred to a Romanian ATM fraud network as a ""global phenomenon.""   "
Gundlach and TCW Square Off in Court,"LOS ANGELES -- Jeffrey Gundlach, one of America's best-known mutual fund managers, is facing allegations in a Los Angeles court this week that he and three colleagues stole confidential data and proprietary trading systems from their old employer in order to start a competing firm. In the civil case, which began two weeks ago, Mr. Gundlach and three other employees of his firm, DoubleLine Capital, are going up against their former employer, Trust Company of the West, a large mutual fund based in Los Angeles better known as the TCW Group. Mr. Gundlach and the other defendants were fired by TCW in December 2009. TCW, a unit of the French bank Societe Generale, has sued Mr. Gundlach and his DoubleLine employees for breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to steal trade secrets and breach of contract, alleging that they used stolen client data and proprietary trading platforms to get DoubleLine up and running. The firm is seeking more than $200 million in damages. Mr. Gundlach has countersued, alleging that TCW fired him in order to keep for itself hundreds of millions of dollars in fees he was owed. He is seeking up to $1.25 billion in damages. The trial team for Mr. Gundlach, seated on the left side of the room furthest from the jury, is led by Brad D. Brian, a partner in the Los Angeles office of Munger, Tolles & Olson. Mr. Brian is a Harvard-educated trial lawyer who specializes in complex civil cases, and his work has a bit of a literary streak. In 2009, he defended Rhonda Byrne, author of the self-help best seller ""The Secret,"" in a copyright dispute, and he also settled a royalty dispute pitting the heirs of J.R.R. Tolkien and HarperCollins against New Line Cinema, a settlement that allowed ""The Hobbit"" to begin filming. The trial team for TCW is led by John B. Quinn, a partner in the Los Angeles law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Mr. Quinn graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976, one year before Mr. Brian, and his firm, which is litigation-only, is known in Los Angeles for its relaxed office culture. (One partner is reportedly fond of wearing Hawaiian shirts.) In 2008, Mr. Quinn represented Mattel in a trade secret theft case against MGA Entertainment, the company that sells the Bratz line of dolls.  The Gundlach trial is being held on the 17th floor of a Los Angeles County Superior Court building. Judge Carl J. West, an experienced civil judge with a white handlebar mustache, is presiding. The news media flocked to the first day of the trial to hear opening statements, and a small scrum of reporters has been stationed on wooden benches in the back of the room in the days since.  So far, TCW has called three of the four defendants to testify. Cris Santa Ana, Jeffrey Mayberry and Barbara VanEvery, all current DoubleLine employees, have testified that they downloaded confidential TCW information to external storage devices before leaving the firm in 2009. A TCW employee, Dolores Talamantes, testified that she smuggled a drive belonging to Mr. Santa Ana out of the firm in her bra on the same day he was fired. Mr. Gundlach is expected to take the stand on Wednesday. His lawyers are expected make the case that although the information from TCW was downloaded, it was never used in DoubleLine's formation. Furthermore, the DoubleLine defense team is expected to argue that Mr. Gundlach was only concerned about downloading information because he knew he was about to be fired. In his opening statement, Mr. Brian referred to ""a secret plan to get rid of Mr. Gundlach"" hatched by TCW executives that was referred to inside the firm as ""Project G."" For a stuffy white-collar civil case, the trial has some racy details. The jury has been shown romantic e-mails between Mr. Gundlach and Ms. VanEvery, as well as flirtatious messages between Mr. Mayberry and a co-worker, Rachel Cody, in which they discussed rumors of the impending departure of Mr. Gundlach's team. In those exchanges, Ms. Cody's nickname was ""Beluga,"" and Mr. Mayberry's nickname was ""Autobot,"" a reference to the protagonists from the Transformers franchise. Lawyers for TCW have also told the jury about an all-expenses-paid private jet trip Mr. Gundlach arranged for members of his fixed-income team in 2009 to Marfa, Tex., where they smoked cigars, drank expensive wine and visited two fine art museums. Mr. Gundlach is a noted art collector, and the name of his new firm, DoubleLine, is said to be an homage to the linear art of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. One disagreement so far has been over the nature of Mr. Gundlach's trading infrastructure, which includes software used to evaluate mortgage-backed securities, that TCW alleges was stolen for use at DoubleLine. TCW has likened the platform to ""the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken,"" implying that it was a trade secret whose similarity to the system used at DoubleLine represents a clear case of theft. Mr. Gundlach has previously claimed that the system he created at TCW is actually more akin to Ernest Hemingway's process of writing his novel ""The Sun Also Rises."" Once the trading system was finished, Mr. Gundlach stated, replicating it would simply mean remembering what he had created before and retracing the steps.   "
"In Court, Gundlach Chief Denies Using Trade Secrets","LOS ANGELES - In a courtroom here, Jeffrey E. Gundlach, one of the most prominent bond managers in the country, on Thursday defended himself against claims that he had planned to sabotage his former employer, Trust Company of the West, by using stolen data and client information to start a competing firm. ""I took my responsibility at TCW very seriously, "" he testified. ""I loved TCW."" The trial involving Mr. Gundlach and TCW, as Trust Company of the West is better known, resembled a breakup tale as Mr. Gundlach detailed his falling out with TCW, which fired him in December 2009. Soon afterward, TCW sued Mr. Gundlach, accusing him of breaching his fiduciary duty and stealing trade secrets to start his new firm, DoubleLine Capital. TCW is seeking more than $375 million in damages. On the witness stand, Mr. Gundlach, dressed in a gray pinstripe suit and a blue tie, told the jury of seven men and five women that although he and his colleagues had once made preparations to leave TCW, including looking at office space and registering a Delaware corporation, he had ""mothballed"" those plans by the time he was fired in December 2009. When a TCW lawyer asked him about a DoubleLine logo he helped design as early as July 2008, he played it down as a ""doodle."" ""I'm very interested in the artwork of Piet Mondrian,"" Mr. Gundlach said. ""I was wondering if I could make a convincing Mondrian."" So far, TCW's case against Mr. Gundlach has hinged on testimony that he and his lieutenants took confidential and proprietary data for use at the new firm. Also named as co-defendants in TCW's lawsuit are former employees Cris Santa Ana, Barbara VanEvery and Jeffrey Mayberry, all of whom currently work at DoubleLine. All three have all testified that they downloaded TCW information to external hard drives, but have said that none of the data was used at DoubleLine. Mr. Santa Ana has testified that Mr. Gundlach told him to download information, a claim Mr. Gundlach disputed on Thursday. After Mr. Gundlach was fired in December 2009, more than 40 of his TCW team members followed him to DoubleLine. ""Anything that was downloaded, we never used at DoubleLine,"" Mr. Gundlach said in a taped deposition that was played for the jury. The trial is notable for occurring at all. Most financial employment disputes are settled quietly, but Mr. Gundlach said in an interview this week that the settlement offers he received from TCW were ""worse than losing in court."" In a countersuit, Mr. Gundlach is seeking more than $500 million, claiming that he was a victim of a conspiracy to oust him from the firm. For a case involving the sleepy mutual fund world, the testimony has at times been shockingly personal. So far, witnesses called by TCW have testified that Mr. Gundlach was ""a cultural cancer"" who referred to himself as ""the Pope"" and ""the Godfather."" In an interview this week, Mr. Gundlach said he did not expect his aggressive personality to be a factor in the trial. ""The fact that they don't like me doesn't mean I've breached my fiduciary duty,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Richard Villa, TCW's chief financial officer, told the jury that Mr. Gundlach had been paid more than $40 million in 2009, the year he was fired, and that he had had earned compensation totaling about $240 million for the years from 1991 to 2009. A rare moment of levity occurred during the court session when, in his taped deposition, Mr. Gundlach was asked by John B. Quinn, a lawyer for TCW, if he knew of any data at TCW, other than a portable alpha trading system, considered proprietary. After a long pause, Mr. Gundlach responded, ""A recipe in the dining room?"" Mr. Gundlach will continue his testimony on Monday.   "
"Gundlach Found Liable in Trade Secret Case, but He Wins Back Pay","A bitter trial that rattled the normally quiet world of mutual funds came to an unusual end on Friday, as a jury awarded Jeffrey E. Gundlach, a star bond fund manager, millions of dollars in unpaid compensation even though it found him liable for breaching his fiduciary duty and stealing trade secrets at his former firm, Trust Company of the West. Jurors took two days to find Mr. Gundlach and three co-defendants liable for taking trade secrets from Trust Company of the West, known as TCW, after he was fired in December 2009. It also found all four liable for breaching their fiduciary duty to TCW and Mr. Gundlach liable for interfering with investor contracts. But, in a twist, the jury awarded no damages to TCW for the breach and contract claims. Instead, the jury awarded Mr. Gundlach and his co-defendants $66.7 million in damages related to a countersuit he filed against TCW, in which he contended that he was owed millions of dollars in fees for the funds he ran.  Although they held Mr. Gundlach liable for theft of trade secrets, the jurors found that the documents and electronic files he and his co-defendants took out of TCW were not stolen maliciously. Judge Carl J. West, who presided over the case in Los Angeles County Superior Court, will determine damages for the trade secrets issue at a later date. TCW said on Friday that it was seeking $89 million in that claim. Lawyers for both sides rushed to claim victory after the verdict was read. Susan Estrich, a lawyer for TCW, said the jury had effectively validated the firm's claims. ""We came in here focused on basic principles and wrongful conduct,"" Ms. Estrich said. ""We brought three claims, and the jury found liability on all three claims."" But Mr. Gundlach's camp, $66.7 million richer, was celebrating, too. ""We are pleased that the jury agreed with us that neither Jeffrey Gundlach nor any of our clients did anything that resulted in monetary harm to TCW,"" said Brad Brian, a lawyer for Mr. Gundlach. ""We're equally pleased that the jury awarded Mr. Gundlach and our other clients the wages that were owed to them."" TCW has not said whether it plans to appeal the verdict on Mr. Gundlach's back pay. The mixed verdict capped a trial that lasted nearly two months and seemed, at times, more like an argument between jilted lovers than a white-collar employment dispute. Lawyers for TCW accused Mr. Gundlach of conspiring to sabotage his firm, comparing him to Gordon Gekko, the fictional buyout villain played by Michael Douglas in the movie ""Wall Street."" Mr. Gundlach's lawyers, in return, asserted that TCW had plotted to fire him for months and wanted to save money on the lucrative fees it owed him. Over the course of six weeks of testimony, witnesses in the trial described Mr. Gundlach, who was named fixed-income manager of the year by Morningstar in 2006, as a ""cultural cancer"" who berated colleagues in the open and displayed unchecked arrogance. In closing arguments, lawyers for TCW presented a slideshow of some of Mr. Gundlach's greatest hits, including e-mails in which he referred to himself as the pope and to Philip A. Barach, his co-manager, as ""the B team."" TCW contended that Mr. Gundlach and his associates stole client information and proprietary trading systems in order to set up a competing firm, DoubleLine Capital. More than 40 employees from TCW followed Mr. Gundlach to DoubleLine, which was running less than a month after Mr. Gundlach was fired from TCW. Among those employees were Cris Santa Ana, Barbara VanEvery and Jeffrey Mayberry, all of whom were Mr. Gundlach's co-defendants. On Friday, Mr. Gundlach, dressed in a pinstripe suit and a bright orange tie, looked straight ahead as the jury's verdict was read, according to a live feed of the trial provided by CourtroomView. For industry watchers and nervous investors, the jury's decision came as something of a relief. ""This divorce has been messy, and it's a good thing that the investment teams can now go back to managing portfolios without this distraction hanging over them,"" said Miriam Sjoblom, a bond fund analyst with Morningstar. ""To the extent DoubleLine shareholders were worried about damages from this suit impacting the resources of the firm, this verdict should assuage those fears."" Mr. Gundlach, an avid art collector and unabashed bon vivant, has done well since leaving TCW. His DoubleLine total return bond fund is among the top performers in its class, and the firm announced on Friday that its overall assets under management had passed $16 billion, a stunningly quick gain for a firm less than two years old. TCW, a unit of the French bank Societe Generale, struggled in the immediate wake of Mr. Gundlach's departure. The firm lost billions in assets after he left, even though it acquired a competitor, Metropolitan West, to replace his team. Today, TCW is on the mend. It has about 600 employees, and the firm's assets under management have grown to $120 billion. In a fact sheet distributed to reporters during the trial, the firm said it had developed ""a more collegial, collaborative workplace culture"" since 2009. But that newfound collegiality has not extended to Mr. Gundlach, as evidenced by the angry and often brutal case the firm made against its former star. Experts say that although the trial could have been a landmark employment case about the merits and dangers of competing against a former employer, it turned out to be nearly all sound and fury. ""This is a split-the-baby decision,"" said Jill E. Fisch, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ""It didn't resolve any questions about how much you can compete, and it seems like it was a long expensive battle that could have been avoided."" An article on Saturday about the verdict in a legal dispute between Jeffrey E. Gundlach, a bond fund manager, and his former employer, Trust Company of the West, misstated one of the jury's findings. The jury found Mr. Gundlach and three co-defendants liable for breaching their fiduciary duty to Trust Company, known as TCW, not their fiduciary duty to investors.   "
Ex-Programmer Is Sentenced to 8 Years for Stealing Code From Goldman,"A former Goldman Sachs computer programmer convicted of stealing source code from the firm was sentenced on Friday to more than eight years in prison, capping a case that had shone a rare spotlight on the world of lightning-fast computer-driven trading. A federal jury in Manhattan in December found the programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, guilty of stealing proprietary code that places trades using computer algorithms that spot tiny discrepancies in stock prices. Such trading earned Goldman about $300 million in 2009.  Before leaving Goldman for a new job at a start-up, Teza Technologies, federal prosecutors had claimed, Mr. Aleynikov secreted the code onto a server in Germany to get around the investment bank's security systems. The prison term, while at the low end of federal sentencing guidelines, was four times what probation officials had recommended. Prosecutors had asked for as much as 10 years. The recent case in Manhattan of Samarth Agrawal, a trader at Societe Generale, who was convicted of stealing proprietary code from its high-frequency trading business was cited throughout the hearing. Mr. Agrawal was sentenced in February to three years in prison, less than the government's request. ''It is unprecedented for the government to seek a sentence five times as high as probation recommends and for the court to impose a sentence four times as high,'' said a defense lawyer, Kevin H. Marino. Standing before the judge in a navy-blue jail uniform on Friday, Mr. Aleynikov, 41, maintained that what he did was a foolish breach of confidentiality, not a theft meant to benefit his new employer. ''I never meant to cause Goldman any harm,'' the Russian-born Mr. Aleynikov said in a heavy accent. ''I am sorry for the burden and emotional impact this trial has caused on my family, and my mother and children.'' But Judge Denise L. Cote of the Federal District Court in Manhattan likened his crime to ''economic espionage.'' Mr. Aleynikov's conduct, she said, ''deserves a significant sentence because the scope of his theft was audacious -- motivated solely by greed, and it was characterized by supreme disloyalty to his employer.'' ''He knew what he was doing would harm Goldman Sachs,'' the judge said. Mr. Aleynikov came to the United States from Russia in 1990, just before the fall of the Soviet Union. He spoke little English and, according to his lawyer, had just $300 in his pocket and an expertise in computer programming. Goldman paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers. In 2009, he was recruited by Teza Technologies, which offered to triple his salary. During his last three days before departing Goldman in early June of that year, he secreted large pieces of the code onto a server in Germany, and then deleted some of the evidence to hide what he had done, prosecutors had said. On July 2, 2009, Mr. Aleynikov visited the offices of Teza, bringing with him a computer and storage device that contained some of the Goldman code. The following evening, six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Aleynikov after he landed at Newark International Airport. Mr. Aleynikov has been in jail since March 2, when the judge revoked his bail. The decision to incarcerate Mr. Aleynikov before his sentencing was prompted by a letter from federal prosecutors, who warned that Mr. Aleynikov had dual citizenship and posed a flight risk. After the sentencing, his lawyer, Mr. Marino, asked the judge if his client could be placed on bail and be allowed to surrender himself when it came time to report to prison. When the prosecution protested, Mr. Marino called their objections ''mean-spirited.'' ''O.K., I don't think it's mean-spirited,'' said Judge Cote, who denied the motion but agreed to reconsider at a later date. The judge recommended to the Federal Bureau of Prisons that Mr. Aleynikov be assigned to a federal prison in New Jersey. Before he was taken from the courtroom, Mr. Aleynikov blew kisses to his family in attendance.  "
Presidential Historian and Colleague Arrested in Theft of Documents in Maryland,"WASHINGTON -- A presidential historian and author, Barry H. Landau, was arrested with a colleague on Saturday in Baltimore on charges of stealing historical documents from the Maryland Historical Society, including ones signed by Abraham Lincoln.  Mr. Landau, a collector of presidential memorabilia based in New York City who cultivated actors and former statesmen, was taken into custody after spending several hours reviewing documents at the historical society with a colleague, Jason Savedoff, the Baltimore Police Department said. An employee called the police to report having seen Mr. Savedoff put a document inside a laptop case and leave the building. The employee followed Mr. Savedoff to a nearby men's bathroom and identified him when the police arrived. When confronted by the police, Mr. Savedoff complained of stomach pains, but officers eventually found keys in his pocket, which led to a locker in a nearby building that contained 60 documents worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to an account by the police, who cited an inventory by society employees. The police said they arrested Mr. Landau because he had signed the documents out for a viewing in the building. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also involved in the case, and a bureau spokesman in Baltimore, Richard Wolf, said Mr. Landau had been charged but not arraigned. The authorities were still determining whether the alleged crime would fall under state or federal jurisdiction, Mr. Wolf said. In addition to the papers signed by Lincoln, numerous inaugural ball invitations and programs worth about $500,000 and signed commemorations of the Statue of Liberty and Washington Monument were found by the employees, the police said. Mr. Landau's expertise as a presidential historian was praised by Henry A. Kissinger and the late Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. on the jacket of Mr. Landau's 2007 book, ''The President's Table: Two Hundred Years of Dining and Diplomacy,'' a history of presidential dining. His Web site, www.barryhlandau.com, states that his collection includes a million items, ''including 26,000 presidential menus and invitations and the original key to the White House,'' and shows photographs of him with Alec Baldwin, Morgan Freeman and Martha Stewart, each holding a copy of his book. He told The Washington Post in an interview in 2005 that Laura Bush had consulted with him during the Republican National Convention in New York about ''possible themes'' for George W. Bush's inauguration. His Web site says he has worked with nine presidents ''planning historic events.''  "
A Fund Accuses Its Former Star of Data Theft,"LOS ANGELES - Jeffrey Gundlach, as the manager of highly successful fixed-income funds, first at Trust Company of the West and more recently at his own business, has been called ''the king of bonds.'' Now his former employer is trying to disrupt his reign. In a rare instance of a prominent employee dispute going to trial, Trust Company of the West, better known as TCW, is trying to prove in court here that Mr. Gundlach and three other former employees stole client data and proprietary trading platforms to start Mr. Gundlach's business, DoubleLine Capital, after he was fired in December 2009. TCW, a unit of Societe Generale, the French bank, is seeking more than $375 million in compensatory and punitive damages in the civil trial, which began in Los Angeles County Superior Court two weeks ago.  In a countersuit, Mr. Gundlach contends that TCW fired him to keep for itself hundreds of millions of dollars in management and performance fees. He is seeking more than $500 million in compensatory damages. His fortunes may turn on how convincing he is to the jury of seven men and five women when he takes the stand, possibly on Thursday. The trial has captivated the mutual fund world and is being watched closely by pension funds and other large institutional investors. The reputations of TCW and Mr. Gundlach are at stake, and even a small award to either side would be seen as a huge symbolic victory. Mr. Gundlach, 51, has made a fortune investing in mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-income products, and has gained a reputation as a hard-driving trader whose arrogance is eclipsed only by his market savvy. In an interview on Tuesday, he attributed TCW's case against him to ''business interference,'' and said the company was simply seeking to discredit him. ''They're jealous of the talent,'' he said, referring to himself. In making their case, lawyers for TCW have sought to sketch a picture of Mr. Gundlach as a brash renegade who was secretly plotting to leave the company and use proprietary information to form a competitor. Cris Santa Ana, Jeffrey Mayberry and Barbara VanEvery, Mr. Gundlach's co-defendants, have testified that they downloaded TCW data to external hard drives before being fired. Eric Arentsen, a TCW managing director, testified on Tuesday and Wednesday that Mr. Gundlach had referred to Marc I. Stern and Robert A. Day, TCW's chief executive and founder, respectively, as ''dumb and dumber'' while employed there, and that he had heard Mr. Gundlach and Mr. Santa Ana talk of taking TCW systems to a new company. ''We have established clearly that the defendants were intentionally downloading information that they knew belonged to TCW, that they did it under the direction of Jeffrey Gundlach, and that this process began as early as early 2009,'' said Susan Estrich, a lawyer for TCW. Lawyers for Mr. Gundlach and his co-defendants have said that TCW data was not used at DoubleLine, and that he began preparing to leave only after it became clear he would be fired. In his opening statement, Brad Brian, a lawyer for Mr. Gundlach, referred to ''Project G,'' what he described as a scheme by TCW executives to get rid of Mr. Gundlach well before December 2009. The trial has proved unusually exciting for a white-collar civil case, with some testimony resembling that of a bitter divorce proceeding. TCW lawyers have told the jury about a private jet trip Mr. Gundlach arranged for members of his team in 2009 to Marfa, Tex., where they smoked cigars, drank costly wine, viewed art collections and, the lawyers contend, plotted to leave TCW. TCW tried to introduce even more lurid evidence about items that were found in Mr. Gundlach's office after he was fired, including pornographic films and marijuana. But Judge Carl J. West did not allow that information to be used in court, saying it was irrelevant. Mr. Gundlach has called the belongings remnants of ''a closed chapter in my life.'' Mr. Gundlach has long been a figure of controversy in the fund industry. A former Yale Ph.D. candidate in mathematics who has claimed to be able to do The New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle in 20 minutes, he decided to become a financier after watching ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,'' the television show with Robin Leach. He joined TCW in 1985 as an entry-level analyst and eventually made a name for himself by specializing in mortgage-backed securities. In 2006, Morningstar named him fixed-income manager of the year, and he is often mentioned in the same breath as notable bond investors like Bill Gross of Pimco. By the time he left TCW in 2009, he oversaw $70 billion in assets, roughly 65 percent of the company's total assets, and was responsible for roughly half of its revenue. About 40 TCW employees followed him to DoubleLine. Today TCW has 550 employees. Howard Marks, chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, said via e-mail that ''to the extent TCW's goal has been to impede DoubleLine's success, it's obvious that has failed.'' Mr. Marks, who left TCW in a bitter split in 1995, helped Mr. Gundlach start DoubleLine, and owns a 22 percent stake in it. DoubleLine has become a prominent company with about $14 billion in assets under management. Its flagship Total Return Bond fund grew more than 13 percent in the last 12 months, according to data from Bloomberg. TCW is still dealing with the effects of Mr. Gundlach's departure. In 2010, it announced that it had acquired Metropolitan West Asset Management to replace the team that left with Mr. Gundlach, but investors withdrew some $25 billion from TCW. Its assets under management have grown since Mr. Gundlach was fired, and totaled about $120 billion in June, but its flagship bond fund has trailed DoubleLine's. In a statement, Mr. Stern, TCW's chief executive, said, ''The integration and performance of the MetWest team has exceeded every one of my expectations, and has helped put TCW on a path of steady growth, with a new cohesive culture of cooperation and teamwork.'' In making their case, lawyers for TCW have sought to show that the trading platform Mr. Gundlach's team developed at the company, which includes software that quickly analyzes the individual mortgages within a mortgage-backed security, could not have been quickly replicated at DoubleLine without copying. A TCW lawyer compared the value of the trading system to ''the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken.'' Mr. Gundlach has previously said that the system he used at TCW was easily duplicable, comparing it to ''The Sun Also Rises.'' Once Hemingway had written the book, Mr. Gundlach said, replacing it would simply be a matter of remembering what he had done and typing it out again. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.  "
Golden Cyberfetters,"Over the past few months a number of people have asked what I think of Bitcoin, an attempt to create a sort of private cybercurrency. Now Alexander Kowalski at Bloomberg News directs me to this Jim Surowiecki article on Bitcoin, which is very interesting. My first reaction to Bitcoin was to say, what's new? We have lots of ways of making payments electronically; in fact, a lot of the conventional monetary system is already virtual, relying on digital accounting rather than green pieces of paper. But it turns out that there is a difference: Bitcoin, rather than fixing the value of the virtual currency in terms of those green pieces of paper, fixes the total quantity of cybercurrency instead, and lets its dollar value float. In effect, Bitcoin has created its own private gold standard world, in which the money supply is fixed rather than subject to increase via the printing press. So how's it going? The dollar value of that cybercurrency has fluctuated sharply, but overall it has soared. So buying into Bitcoin has, at least so far, been a good investment. But does that make the experiment a success? Um, no. What we want from a monetary system isn't to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich. And that's not at all what is happening in Bitcoin. Bear in mind that dollar prices have been relatively stable over the past few years - yes, some deflation in 2008-2009, then some inflation as commodity prices rebounded, but overall consumer prices are only slightly higher than they were three years ago. What that means is that if you measure prices in Bitcoins, they have plunged; the Bitcoin economy has in effect experienced massive deflation. And because of that, there has been an incentive to hoard the virtual currency rather than spending it. The actual value of transactions in Bitcoins has fallen rather than rising. In effect, real gross Bitcoin product has fallen sharply. So to the extent that the experiment tells us anything about monetary regimes, it reinforces the case against anything like a new gold standard - because it shows just how vulnerable such a standard would be to money-hoarding, deflation, and depression.

Warner Tests Renting Film On Facebook For Web Cash,"Warner Brothers became the first major media company to offer a movie for rent on Facebook, a move that could position the social network to become a force in the digital distribution of movies, rivaling services like Netflix and iTunes. Warner said on Tuesday that it would allow Facebook users in the United States to rent the film ''The Dark Knight'' directly on the social networking site, and pay for it using Credits, Facebook's virtual currency. If other studios make similar moves, Facebook could tap a significant revenue stream, bolstering its Credits currency as it seeks to create a rival to PayPal and other payment systems.  Warner said it might make other movies available on Facebook over time. ''This is definitely a test,'' said Thomas Gewecke, president of Warner Brothers Digital Distribution, in a telephone interview. While some analysts saw the move as a danger to Netflix -- a threat investors seemed to take seriously as shares of Netflix dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday -- others said that for Facebook, which is already one of the most popular places to watch videos online, the payoff from Warner's move might be more in the expansion of its online currency. ''I think this is much more about payments than about movies,'' said Alex Rampell, the chief executive of TrialPay, an advertising company that offers free Facebook Credits to people who buy certain products. Mr. Rampell said that millions of Facebook users were using Credits to pay for virtual goods inside games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars. ''It seems like a logical step to use the currency to pay for movies,'' he said. Facebook began testing Credits in virtual games nearly two years ago. But the company, which keeps 30 percent of all transactions conducted through Credits, has made it clear that it wants to turn its virtual currency into a payment mechanism for all sorts of digital goods. To expand the use of the currency, Facebook last year began selling Credits through prepaid gift cards at Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy. Earlier this year, it opened up Credits to all application developers on Facebook. Warner appears to be the first major media company to take advantage of the service to charge for content. Facebook said that more than 400 developers were already using Credits. ''We're looking forward to seeing the new and interesting ways that developers and partners use Credits to offer virtual and digital goods in the future,'' Jonathan Thaw, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. Like other Hollywood studios, Warner is racing to figure out how to deal with two significant problems: piracy and plummeting DVD sales, both of which are growing worse as broadband access spreads across the globe. The industry's best hope for a solution is to make more content available for digital purchase on more platforms. But Hollywood is also fretting that certain delivery systems -- particularly Netflix, with its rapidly growing streaming service -- are becoming too powerful. If Warner's go-straight-to-the-fans Facebook experiment is successful, it could be a way of skirting those middleman distributors. It chose the ''The Dark Knight'' in part because a related Facebook page run by the studio has a robust four million fans. The rental costs $3, or 30 Facebook Credits. For now, Facebook is hardly a rival to online movie rental services, and it is not clear if the company plans to become one. It did not specifically help Warner and has not signed a licensing or distribution deal with the studio. And even if other studios follow Warner's lead, Facebook lacks a feature for users to find movies. But some analysts said that Facebook could eventually inch its way more aggressively into the movie rental business. ''On a longer-term basis, we think that Facebook could become a credible threat'' to Netflix, Ingrid Chung, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to investors. Ms. Chung noted that for now, however, Facebook ''lacks content, does not have wide distribution across devices that connect to the living room TV, has few people on the payments platform.'' Warner's Mr. Gewecke is bullish on another experiment, this one involving the sale of movies through a newly introduced iPad app. Warner now offers ''App Editions'' for two films, ''The Dark Knight'' and ''Inception.'' Rather than gaining access to the films through iTunes, consumers instead download a free app, which lets them buy the movies for unlimited streaming. The app route is significant because it allows Warner to sell ''Inception'' and ''The Dark Knight'' in 23 countries where iTunes does not currently operate a video store -- including fast-growing and highly pirated markets like China and Russia. ''This platform allows us to experiment with an early version of what you might call a 'connected movie' -- the ability for us to offer new extras over time as updates,'' Mr. Gewecke said. ''We think that is a great way to add more value to the digital ownership experience,'' he added.  "
Cashing In Coins and Skipping the Surcharge,"AT Coinstar, which operates about 19,000 coin-counting machines in supermarkets and other spots, marketers analyze consumer data closely -- but sometimes they just like to watch. ''We have videos of folks pouring coins into the machine and they're watching the ticker go up and up and they can't believe it, because they usually have about 50 percent more than they thought they had,'' said Engle Saez, vice president for consumer experience at Coinstar. ''They're elated.'' What may come as less welcome news, however, is the Coinstar service fee, which is 9.8 percent in the United States.  Now Coinstar -- with operations throughout the United States, Canada and Britain -- increasingly is teaming up with retailers, who essentially pay that service fee on behalf of consumers, who in turn agree to spend their bounty with them. After tallying, instead of receiving a levied cash voucher, users choose a gift certificate for the full value of the coins from retailers including Starbucks, Gap, iTunes and Amazon.com. For Coinstar, which receives fees for transactions regardless, the growth potential for such partnerships is considerable, because the companies promote Coinstar to their own customers on their Web sites, through promotional e-mails, and in print and online advertisements. While Coinstar, which converts $3 billion in coins annually, has offered the fee-free option from some retailers for as long as five years, the company had until recently never advertised the option. While Mr. Saez declined to say how many customers opted for no-fee gift certificates, he said that ''the ratio is inordinately high'' for cash vouchers. ''We haven't told anyone about it,'' Mr. Saez said. ''For all intents and purposes it's been the best kept secret out there.'' But now Coinstar is trying to change that. Late last year, in publications including People and The New York Times, Coinstar advertised a program where several retail outlets, including iTunes, Borders and Regal Cinemas, went beyond shouldering the fee to offer gift cards that exceeded the value of a $40 minimum coin exchange by $10, meaning that $40 in coins could be redeemed for a $50 gift certificate. After that promotion ended on Jan. 1, iTunes made the same bonus offer for the 30 days that ended March 6, while another company, Rixty, is offering a $30 gift certificate in return for cashing in $25 in coins from March 25 through April 17. Rixty enables consumers who lack credit cards to make cash-based purchases online, primarily for virtual goods in games like Farmville and on social networks like Facebook. When the company first started selling credits to consumers in 2009, it began by offering fee-free credit exclusively to Coinstar users. ''When we launched they were our first partner, and the great thing was on Day 1 we were live on 10,000 kiosks across the country,'' said Ted C. Sorom, chief executive of Rixty. (Today there are about 17,000 Coinstar machines in the United States.) While most Rixty consumers are adults, many are adolescents who earn cash baby-sitting and mowing lawns, but lack credit cards. ''When they go to their parents and say, 'Can I borrow a credit card to buy a pair of virtual pants in a virtual world that you've never really heard of?' the results are not positive,'' Mr. Sorom said. While his company today has numerous ways to use cash for online purchases, including Rixty gift cards available at retailers like Kmart and J. C. Penney, Mr. Sorom is partial to the freewheeling nature of Coinstar consumers. ''It is found money,'' he said of their transactions. ''It doesn't come from a wallet or bank account, and people are much more willing to spend it on something on the edge of their budget, something they couldn't justify spending money on before.'' Coinstar, which says it has kiosks within five miles of 95 percent of the United States population, says it has an average coin transaction of $38 and about 76 million transactions annually. The largest coin exchange on record for the company involved Edmond Knowles of Flomaton, Ala., who in 2005 cashed in $13,084.59 -- all in pennies. Coinstar sent an armored truck to Mr. Knowles's home to retrieve the pennies. Amazon, which has offered fee-free gift certificates through Coinstar since 2005, says spending among Coinstar users increases every year, though the online retailer declined to give specifics. ''We know there's a segment out there that doesn't have access to credit cards, and we also see a lot of college students who don't have credit cards,'' said Marcell King, senior manager at ACI Gift Cards, the issuer of Amazon gift cards. More than eight million consumers stopped using credit cards in the last year, a nearly 11 percent increase in the number of consumers who forgo them, according to a recent report from TransUnion, a credit rating agency. The latest effort by Coinstar, in pilot programs under way at both the Albertsons and Stop & Shop supermarket chains, entails a first for the company: offering no-fee gift cards at the very store where shoppers are exchanging coins. Stop & Shop is running its pilot program for a six-month period through May at 50 stores, most of them in Massachusetts, and promoting it through newspaper circular advertisements and billboards -- by Eleven Inc. in San Francisco -- and in-store radio announcements. ''What we're hearing from our customers is that they like it and they're happy with it,'' said Mark McGowan, president of the Northeast division of Stop & Shop, who declined to provide preliminary data from the pilot program. Mr. Saez, of Coinstar, said such in-store programs had enormous potential -- and should have been initiated long ago. ''We're trying to appeal to those consumers who are fee-averse by putting a product in front of them that we know is highly, highly relevant to them,'' he said. ''To convert coins into a grocery store gift card -- that one was a no-brainer that skipped over a lot of brains here for many years.''  "
Some Faint Praise for Mr. Ballmer,"Microsoft has missed too many opportunities under Steve Ballmer's stewardship. It's a fair criticism reignited last week by the hedge fund boss, David Einhorn, who called for the software giant's chief executive to step down. But that doesn't necessarily mean Mr. Ballmer will go. Based on total return to shareholders, other long-time company bosses, including Jeff Immelt at General Electric, have fared worse. Mr. Ballmer started as chief executive in January 2000. Over the last decade, Microsoft's shares have tumbled 30 percent, and they're up only a hair from their low in 2006. The potted narrative is that Mr. Ballmer has shepherded the ''old'' operating system and productivity software powerhouse reasonably well but misjudged new developments, wasting billions of dollars chasing Silicon Valley innovators like Apple and Google.  It would be a lot to expect a single company to dominate more than one truly world-changing technology. But with that caveat, the critique of Mr. Ballmer is on target even if he's far from the only chief executive who has struggled to make the most of a franchise. And he at least saw the need to pay dividends a few years earlier than, say, John Chambers at Cisco Systems. On a total return basis including those payouts, Microsoft shareholders are down just over 10 percent over 10 years, and better off by some 14 percent over five, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That's far from gratifying, but easily beats Cisco. Looking further across corporate America, Mr. Ballmer stomps Mr. Immelt's decade-long reign at G.E. and outdoes Rupert Murdoch's latest five-year stretch at the News Corporation. Richard Fairbank at Capital One Financial and Steven Burd at the grocery chain Safeway, two other corner-office fixtures, also have fallen short of Mr. Ballmer's performance. This report card, of course, damns Mr. Ballmer with faint praise. His problem isn't so much shrinking profits as a loss of investor faith in Microsoft, whose price-to-earnings ratio is one of the lowest among big companies in the United States. But Mr. Einhorn probably won't quickly get his wish for a replacement. Mr. Ballmer and Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, go way back and together own more than 10 percent of the company. That means the current chief executive probably will get more time to try to reinvent Microsoft. Virtual Inflation In the currency wars, the nerds are winning. The value of a Bitcoin, a digital currency trading over peer-to-peer networks, has rocketed more than ninefold in two months to more than $8.60 as of Friday afternoon. The preordained supply and decentralization of Bitcoins have intrigued geeks and paranoid inflationistas alike. But this abstract gold may not survive what looks like a bubble. Bitcoins are actually strings of unique digits, tracked and traded via an online network. People earn new coins by solving network security problems. These coins can then be traded for real currencies on exchanges, or for goods from certain businesses that accept them. The Bitcoins in a user's virtual wallet are tracked by the secure system and can be transferred only by that user. Moreover -- and here's the hook for the inflation worriers -- the currency can't be printed willy-nilly. The supply of Bitcoins is on a predefined path and will be capped at 21 million. And because there's no central point in the system, there's no equivalent of the Federal Reserve to rewrite that policy. The concept of the Bitcoin is no less real than regular paper money or coins. All such currencies have only the value their users accept. Bitcoins do, though, have a couple of disadvantages: they don't generate income, and since they exist in the digital cloud they'd be less use than paper money in any scenario involving power cuts or lost connectivity. Still, it's easy, quick and essentially free to transfer Bitcoins. Moreover, transactions are anonymous and the system knows no national borders. That's helpful for some legitimate users, but also makes the currency a potential worry for law enforcers. The finite supply means the value of Bitcoins should rise as demand increases. But the latest run-up looks decidedly frothy. A flush user can buy Web design help or alpaca socks. But there aren't many businesses that accept Bitcoins. So it seems likely that enthusiasts and speculators are hoarding them without regard to the value they really represent. A bubble that bursts when the abstract intellectual appeal fades would probably doom the otherwise creative idea.

Speed Bumps on the Road to Virtual Cash,"MONEY is accumulated, traded and transferred online every day, but can there be a form of currency that exists only online and yet has real-world value? That is the premise of Bitcoin, an open-source virtual currency system that since 2009 has grown to a market worth more than $100 million. But the past few weeks have shown that a virtual currency can be just as vulnerable as the paper kind. Bitcoin accounts have been subject to hacking and theft; the currency itself experienced a bubble and a crash. And at least one group that was collecting donations in Bitcoins has decided against using them because of possible legal entanglements. Gavin Andresen, who is the lead developer of the open-source software that operates the currency, said in an interview from his home in Amherst, Mass.: ''I expected it to have lots of speed bumps along the way -- but I didn't expect there to be so many speed bumps in a row.''  There are several appeals to the idea of an online currency. The standard way to ensure the validity of online transactions, according to Jerry Brito, a technology expert at George Mason University, is ''to have an intermediary to keep the ledger,'' that is, a service like PayPal or a credit card company that takes a percentage of the transaction. A virtual currency would not need an intermediary. It would also make it harder for authorities to track transactions (particularly appealing for gambling sites or other quasi-legal activities). Bitcoin began as a kind of thought experiment. In 2009, an anonymous programmer published a paper proposing a virtual currency that would elegantly solve many of the problems surrounding currency that exists only on the Internet, including the main one, that the money would simply be copied like, say, music files, and plummet in value. Another part of the challenge was to create a currency without having to resort to a central bank to issue the currency and track the transactions. In other words, the transactions would be genuinely ''peer-to-peer'' rather than pass though a virtual bank. The solution of the Bitcoin programmer, who wrote under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, was to ensure that each ''coin'' was its own certificate of authenticity -- that the coin, in essence, would be nothing more than that certificate. In the Bitcoin system, a new coin is produced whenever a computer can calculate an answer to a difficult problem, and then attaches that answer to a digital record of every transaction of every Bitcoin ever traded -- a breathtakingly large amount of information to carry around in order to buy a pack of gum, but in a time when information can zip around the Internet, not too much to ask. Anyone would be free to create a new coin, within proscribed supply limits, by having a computer do the work needed to prove that it was in fact a valid Bitcoin. ''The incentives are right, they are a check that everyone is following the rules,'' said Mr. Andresen. ''Early adopters want it to succeed, because they already own the currency. And if you generate Bitcoins no one thinks is valid, you have wasted a lot of computer time.'' In fact, Bitcoin is a rarity for a currency in that it is neither a so-called fiat currency -- one like dollars, which are valuable because the government says they are -- nor is it a specie currency, one that gets its value because it can be converted into a precious metal like silver or gold. But why would a Bitcoin have value if it is only a stream of numbers, unsupported by government fiat or by some underlying asset? ''Why does any tool have value?'' Mr. Andresen asked. ''It is valuable because it is useful.'' Starting almost as soon as the coins were introduced, they have been traded for dollars at online exchanges, serving as a crude measure of the currency's popularity and health (and also giving a market where owners can trade in Bitcoins for real dollars). After two years, there are seven million of these ''coins'' in circulation and the rate of increase -- currently 50 coins are added every 10 minutes -- will slow each year until the number tops out at 21 million coins around 2025. The coins, which trade for about $17 each at online exchanges, have a cumulative value of about $100 million. ''I do think of it as the market cap of Bitcoin,'' said Mr. Andresen. Today, a list of businesses that accept Bitcoin currency is a motley collection of companies on the fringe of the computer world, groups that conduct gambling or the like, and, notably, the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks, which accepts contributions in Bitcoins. You certainly can't stock the pantry or furnish your home with Bitcoins. When reached by phone, a bookstore owner on the list, Sonny Saul, from Woodstock, Vt., said that he had had the account for only a week and a half and that he had ''no practical experience with it yet, other than your phone call.'' Mr. Saul said his son was a fan of Bitcoins and had set up an account for him; he said he was intrigued. ''I might be able to bypass Visa and Mastercard -- they take 2 to 3 percent on every transaction,'' he said, adding that if it ''eliminates the need for a central bank -- I am interested philosophically how it would affect society.'' A Hungarian woman, Judit Whelan, 33, who designs pet accessories and was persuaded to accept the coins by her husband, a computer programmer, said that she had more success. ''I've sold 24 collars, 13 leashes and 1 pair of 'Disco Knickers' with Bitcoin over the last few months,'' she wrote in an e-mail. ''The first order I had was for 42 BTC, which was worth about $40 at the time, but now those coins would be worth around $680! Originally I had a fixed Bitcoin price, but now I do a conversion based on the exchange rate.'' But the currency proved to be so unstable, Mr. Andresen said, that it became hard to use as a ''unit of account.'' When they began, they were worth fractions of a penny. They rose to more than $30, a market cap of more than $210 million, and now trade roughly in the middle. And the system has had to weather other challenges. In June alone, there have been thefts of virtual wallets that have been left unprotected on Bitcoin owners' hard drives; the biggest case was said to involve coins with a trading value of $500,000. Similarly, security firms say they have detected ''bots'' that hijack unsuspecting computers to do the calculating necessary to create new coins on other peoples' dime. Even more spectacularly, the largest trader of Bitcoins, the Mt.Gox exchange, said it was hacked on June 19, with certain accounts being emptied and others being used to trade imaginary Bitcoins and, in the process, drop the value of Bitcoins to pennies. In a coincidence of timing, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet rights advocacy group in San Francisco, announced that it would not be accepting the Bitcoins that had been donated via an account in its name, in order to avoid any legal entanglements with the service. The group would be returning coins that at one time were worth $100,000 to the Bitcoin community because of the uncertain legal picture, its legal director, Cindy Cohn said. ''We didn't want to be a participant in this,'' she said. Mr. Andresen he said he imagined that after the bubbles, the currency would find enthusiasts, beyond the traders: ''Anything that is purely in the electronic world,'' he said. ''Digital downloads, Web hosting, programming services -- especially if it is international -- those would be the early niches.'' Mr. Brito was optimistic about Bitcoins finding consistent users. But as with many online innovations, the early adopters tend to occupy a different, if marginal, niche. ''This is a censorship-proof currency that allows transactions to happen,'' he said. ''Right now what are those sort of transactions? Gambling, buying drugs -- that is what is going to jumpstart it.''  "
Codebook Shows an Encryption Form Dates Back to Telegraphs,"If not for a computer scientist's hobby of collecting old telegraph codebooks, a crucial chapter in modern cryptography might have been lost to history. The collector is Steven M. Bellovin, a professor of computer science at the Columbia University School of Engineering and a former computer security researcher at AT&T Bell Laboratories. On a recent trip to Washington he found himself with a free afternoon and decided to spend it at the Library of Congress, looking for codebooks that weren't in his collection. In the 19th century codebooks were used not so much for secrecy as for compression, to bring down the prohibitive cost of telegraph communication. (The first trans-Atlantic cables cost $5 a word.) Designers devised lists of words to replace phrases and even sentences.  But when Dr. Bellovin hunted though the card catalog, his interest was piqued by an 1882 codebook whose title included the word ''secrecy.'' ''I thought, 'O.K., let me go see how they did it,' '' he recalled. ''When I read the two-page preface, my jaw dropped.'' He could plainly see that the document described a technique called the one-time pad fully 35 years before its supposed invention during World War I by Gilbert Vernam, an AT&T engineer, and Joseph Mauborgne, later chief of the Army Signal Corps. Although not widely used today because it is relatively difficult to work with, the one-time pad is still viewed as one of strongest ways to encrypt a communication. The technique is distinguished by the use of a random key, shared by both parties, to encode the message and decode it; the key must be used only once and then securely disposed of. It was the Soviet Union's misuse of the technique -- code clerks were occasionally reusing the one-time pads instead of discarding them -- that led to the Venona project, the collaboration between the United States and British intelligence services that yielded code-cracking coups during World War II and the cold war. The 1882 monograph that Dr. Bellovin stumbled across in the Library of Congress was ''Telegraphic Code to Insure Privacy and Secrecy in the Transmission of Telegrams,'' by Frank Miller, a successful banker in Sacramento who later became a trustee of Stanford University. In Miller's preface, the key points jumped off the page: ''A banker in the West should prepare a list of irregular numbers to be called 'shift numbers,' '' he wrote. ''The difference between such numbers must not be regular. When a shift-number has been applied, or used, it must be erased from the list and not be used again.'' That sent the astonished Dr. Bellovin to the Internet to try to find out whether Mr. Miller's innovation was known to the later inventors. The results of his largely online detective work can be found in the July issue of the journal Cryptologia. Born in Milwaukee in 1842, Mr. Miller attended Yale and then joined the Union Army, where he fought at Antietam and was wounded at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was transferred to the Army inspector general's office, where he became a member of a squad of detectives investigating Lincoln's assassination -- perhaps his first contact with cryptanalysis, Dr. Bellovin speculates. He seems to have kept a diary that still belongs to his descendants, but Dr. Bellovin was unable to obtain it. According to several independent specialists in cryptography, Mr. Miller was undoubtedly the first to propose the concept of the one-time pad. ''Miller probably invented the one-time pad, but without knowing why it was perfectly secure or even that it was,'' said David Kahn, the author of the definitive 1967 book ''The Codebreakers.'' ''Moreover, unlike Mauborgne's conscious invention, or the Germans' conscious adoption of the one-time pad to superencipher their Foreign Office codes, it had no echo, no use in cryptology. It sank without a trace -- until Steve found it by accident.'' Dr. Bellovin found no evidence that either Mr. Vernam or Mr. Mauborgne ever met Mr. Miller, but he did uncover one more tantalizing clue -- in the society pages of The San Francisco Chronicle, of all places. At a military ball at the Presidio in 1907, Mr. Miller met Parker Hitt, a cryptographer who was a student and colleague of Mr. Mauborgne's. ''It is quite certain that if Hitt knew of Miller's system,'' Dr. Bellovin writes, ''he would have shared that knowledge with Mauborgne when they were together at the Army Signal School in Fort Leavenworth.'' But as he acknowledges, that is still a big ''if.''  "
How Revolutionary Tools Cracked a 1700s Code,"It has been more than six decades since Warren Weaver, a pioneer in automated language translation, suggested applying code-breaking techniques to the challenge of interpreting a foreign language. In an oft-cited letter in 1947 to the mathematician Norbert Wiener, he wrote: ''One naturally wonders if the problem of translation could conceivably be treated as a problem in cryptography. When I look at an article in Russian, I say: 'This is really written in English, but it has been coded in some strange symbols. I will now proceed to decode.' '' That insight led to a generation of statistics-based language programs like Google Translate -- and, not so incidentally, to new tools for breaking codes that go back to the Middle Ages.  Now a team of Swedish and American linguists has applied statistics-based translation techniques to crack one of the most stubborn of codes: the Copiale Cipher, a hand-lettered 105-page manuscript that appears to date from the late 18th century. They described their work at a meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Portland, Ore. Discovered in an academic archive in the former East Germany, the elaborately bound volume of gold and green brocade paper holds 75,000 characters, a perplexing mix of mysterious symbols and Roman letters. The name comes from one of only two non-coded inscriptions in the document. Kevin Knight, a computer scientist at the Information Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California, collaborated with Beata Megyesi and Christiane Schaefer of Uppsala University in Sweden to decipher the first 16 pages. They turn out to be a detailed description of a ritual from a secret society that apparently had a fascination with eye surgery and ophthalmology. It began as a weekend project this year, Dr. Knight said in an interview, adding: ''I don't have much experience in cryptography. My background is primarily in computational linguistics and machine translation.'' Uncertain of the original language, the researchers went down several blind alleys before following their hunches. First, they assumed the Roman characters and not the abstract symbols contained all of the information. But when that approach failed, they figured that the code was what cryptographers call a homophonic cipher -- a substitution code that does not have a straightforward correspondence between the original and encoded information. And they decided the original language was probably German. Eventually they concluded that the Roman letters were so-called nulls, meant to mislead the code breaker, and that the letters represented spaces between words made up of elaborate symbols. Another crucial discovery was that a colon indicated the doubling of the previous consonant. The researchers used language-translation techniques like expected word frequency to guess what a symbol might equal in German. ''It turned out that we can apply a lot those techniques to code breaking,'' Dr. Knight said. The work is being praised by other experts. ''Cracking the Copiale Cipher was a neat bit of work by Kevin Knight and his collaborators,'' said Nick Pelling, a British software designer and a security specialist who maintains Cipher Mysteries, a cryptography news blog. But while the cipher was a notable success, Dr. Knight and his colleagues have been frustrated by other, more impenetrable ciphers. ''There are these books and ancient languages of real historical value that contain historical information that we just can't get out yet, and that's of interest to a lot of people,'' he said in a filmed interview describing the Copiale project. The work has value to historians who are trying to understand the spread of political ideas. Secret societies were all the rage in the 18th century, Dr. Knight said, and they had an influence on both the American and French Revolutions. He recently shared the decoded Copiale text with Andreas Onnerfors, a historian at Lund University in Sweden and an expert on secret societies. ''When he saw the book and the decoded version, he was very excited about it,'' Dr. Knight said. ''He found a political commentary at the end that talked about the natural rights of man. That was pretty interesting and early.'' Modern examples of challenging ciphers include the communications the Zodiac killer sent to the police in California in the 1960s and '70s, and the ''Kryptos'' sculpture, commissioned for the C.I.A. headquarters, which has been only partly decoded. But the white whale of the code-breaking world is the Voynich manuscript. Comprising 240 lavishly illustrated vellum pages, it has defied the world's best code breakers. Though cryptographers have long wondered if it is a hoax, it was recently dated to the early 1400s. With a University of Chicago computer scientist, Dr. Knight this year published a detailed analysis of the manuscript that falls short of answering the hoax question, but does find some evidence that it contains patterns that match the structure of natural language. ''It's been called the most mysterious manuscript in the world,'' he said. ''It's super full of patterns, and so for somebody to have created something like that would have been a lot of work. So I feel that it's probably a code.''  "
Locking Up A USB Drive,"Q. I like to transfer files between machines with a portable USB drive. Is there a way to protect this drive with a password in case I ever lose it?  A. If you want to add a password to your USB drive to keep your traveling files secure, you can lock the drive's contents with encryption software. These programs, some of which are free, can be found around the Web, but make sure to get one that is compatible with your computer's operating system. Some of these drive-encryption programs include TrueCrypt (it works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux systems) and FreeOTFE for Windows (short for ''on the fly encryption). Commercial programs include USB Secure ($30 for the full Windows version). Your computer's operating system may have some useful tools for putting a lock on external drives, like the Bitlocker to Go feature of Windows 7 or the Mac OS X Disk Utility program. The next time you buy a USB drive, consider one that has its own encryption software built in. Some portable drives, aimed at professionals and those who may be toting around corporate secrets, offer military-grade encryption. IronKey makes several types of security-minded USB drives, as does Verbatim.

Wine Country Internet Provider Takes On Justice Department,"The Obama administration has found an unlikely adversary in wine country.  Taking advantage of a 25-year-old law that governs digital privacy, the Justice Department asked a small Northern California-based Internet service provider to cough up information about one of its customers, a self-described supporter of WikiLeaks.  Santa Rosa-based Sonic.net fought back. Dane Jasper, its co-founder, said in an interview Monday that the company went to court to challenge the order, which, like similar information requests, was sealed by a federal judge and not available to the public. It won a court order to share the request for information with its client, Jacob Appelbaum. The case was first reported in The Wall Street Journal.  Mr. Jasper said the court order remained sealed and that he could not reveal any details of the information it requests.  The Justice Department has filed similar requests for information on WikiLeaks supporters. They have been sealed by the courts and not available to the public under a provision of the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Internet companies and civil liberties groups have lobbied to update and amend the law.Last year, the government sought information about Mr. Appelbaum and other WikiLeaks supporters from Twitter, the microblogging site on which they had accounts. Twitter similarly turned to a federal court and won permission to share the information order with their clients. The government in that case wanted Twitter to reveal its users' Internet Protocol addresses, which would have showed their physical locations, as well as to whom they sent direct messages on Twitter.   Sonic, founded in 1995, describes itself on its Web site as one of the first companies to bring high-speed Internet to California's wine country. Mr. Jasper recently asked its customers to lobby Congress against a proposed measure that would require Internet service providers to retain records of their customers' online activities for a year. Sonic says it deletes customer logs after two weeks. ""Storing logs longer presents an attractive nuisance, and would potentially make our customers the target of invasions of privacy,"" Mr. Jasper said in an August blog post.   "
Apple Seeking Product Security Manager,"Don't be fooled by how easy this job might sound: Apple hopes to hire a new ""product security manager,"" or in layman terms, someone who can stop new iPhones from going missing in bars. The new position was posted on Apple's job board after the loss of yet another iPhone prototype, which went missing in San Francisco last month. Last year,  an Apple engineer lost a prototype iPhone 4 in a bar that ended up featured on Gizmodo, the technology blog. Although Apple might be the brunt of jokes about the repeat iPhone loss, the new job listing is definitely not fun and games. Among the number of high-level security requirements, the new candidate must have at least five years experience in the security field, an advanced degree in risk management and a strong understanding of international security standards. Unlike Apple's usually cryptic job postings, this one is blatantly clear: The candidate will be responsible for overseeing the protection of, and managing risks to, Apple's unreleased products and related intellectual property. Position will reside in Cupertino, California.   "
U.S. Uses Cyberspace To Rebut Messages Posted by Extremists,"MacDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. -- The morning sun had barely cast its fresh light over Tampa Bay when Ardashir Safavi -- born in Iran, a refugee to Turkey, educated in the mid-Atlantic states -- was up and patrolling two dozen Persian-language Web sites, hunting militant adversaries in cyberspace. His mission was to scan news reports, blogs, social media and online essays to identify those he viewed as ''containing lies, misinformation or just misperceptions'' about American military operations and Pentagon policy across the Middle East. In recent months, Mr. Safavi and his teammates spotted posts that included doctored photographs of Osama bin Laden purporting to prove that Al Qaeda's leader had not died in an American commando raid. They turned up blogs stating that the Pentagon was accelerating war plans for invading many Muslim nations, and others amplifying Taliban accusations that American troops rape with impunity across Afghanistan.  Mr. Safavi works as part of the Digital Engagement Team, established in 2008 by the military's Central Command to ''counter extremist ideology, promote cultural awareness and explain U.S. interests,'' said Maj. David E. Nevers, the team's chief officer, who must approve all responses before they are posted on foreign-language Web sites. The team includes 20 native speakers of Arabic, Dari, Persian, Pashto, Urdu and Russian, the latter a shared language across the Muslim countries of the former Soviet states of Central Asia. Given that Central Command is responsible for military actions in an arc of instability stretching from the Indian Ocean across the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea, people here call their headquarters ''Tampa-stan.'' The government's expanding efforts in computer-network warfare, offense and defense are among the most secret enterprises carried out by the military and intelligence community. To counter the adversary's use of the Internet, American cyberwarriors have hacked into extremist chat rooms to sow confusion, or to inject poisonous code to take down militant Web sites. Sometimes, they choose not to act, but silently track the online movements of jihadists to learn their plans. In contrast, the Digital Engagement Team operates in total sunshine: all of the online postings carry an official stamp acknowledging sponsorship by Central Command. The team's operators ''respectfully deflect baseless and often irrational insults, confront adversaries with factual evidence and expose extremist propaganda that might otherwise go unrefuted,'' Major Nevers said. ''All engagements are transparent and attributable.'' The only obfuscation is the use of online pseudonyms to protect the civilian contract employees from potential retaliation. Mr. Safavi's Internet pen name is drawn from a grand Persian dynasty. On a recent morning, he spotted a provocative Persian posting that inspired an energetic thread of responses criticizing the Pentagon's relationship with a complicated ally, Pakistan, mostly posing theories of Great Game conspiracies pitting spy vs. spy, insurgency vs. military, Washington vs. Islamabad. The discussion was relevant beyond Mr. Safavi's native Iran, since there are large Persian-speaking populations in Afghanistan and in its northern neighbor Tajikistan. ''You've heard of the Iron Curtain, of course,'' Mr. Safavi said. ''We're here to pierce the Electronic Curtain because the military has decided that it cannot cede this information space to violent extremists.'' Mr. Safavi typed up a translated summary of the Internet exchange, which in a matter of minutes had grown to 29 entries read by thousands more. He proposed a response drawn from Pentagon and State Department policy statements: it described shared American and Pakistani security interests, citing as evidence the large number of Pakistanis in security forces who were killed in battles with insurgents within that country's borders. Then he sent a message up his chain of command to Major Nevers on a form labeled ''Permission to Engage.'' The Digital Engagement Team works in cyberspace but not at network speeds because translation and approval take hours. Yet it has tried to make a virtue of the demands of oversight. If an offending Web posting is spotted in the early morning, the response is online by early afternoon, landing just as computer users across the Middle East resume their Web surfing in the hours between dinner and sleep. Parallel to these military efforts, the State Department created a strategic counterterrorism communications center whose online analysts and bloggers try to understand what inspires their target audience -- men 18 to 30 years old, mostly in the Middle East -- to violent extremism, and to find ways to steer them away from that. ''We really want to have an intimate understanding of where they're coming from, what they're saying, how they're saying it, and what drives them,'' said Richard LeBaron, a former American ambassador to Kuwait who is the center's coordinator. For the State Department's Digital Outreach Team, Arabic- and Urdu-speaking analysts engage extremists in online conversations, identifying themselves as representing the United States government. ''The fact they engage with us indicates we've hit a nerve,'' Mr. LeBaron said. ''They often use horribly abusive language, so our folks have to have thick skins.'' Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism analyst at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, said that despite their limitations, these online outreach campaigns were efficient and inexpensive tools in the government's increasingly holistic approach to combating terrorists, especially as the United States draws down its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In many respects, Mr. Fishman said, juxtaposing factual images -- videotapes of the hateful preachings of the Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri against the triumphant protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo this year -- can be more powerful, and more effective, than any message the government can transmit. ''Just demonstrate the facts and let reality speak for itself,'' Mr. Fishman said. Popular Arabic-language Web sites acknowledge the impact of the Digital Engagement Team. A blogger at www.islamtoday.net wrote late last year that the effort ''represents a shift in the style of engagement normally used by Americans with the populations of the region, which usually addresses the elites and the governments in English.'' The blogger acknowledged that the military's online initiative ''is to open a dialogue with readers and Web sites that represent a segment with different interests and opinions,'' and that the Central Command postings in ''smooth Arabic'' were ''often very sophisticated.'' Military officers admit that beyond anecdotal feedback, it is hard to measure the program's impact. Software can tabulate the number of people reading the postings across the foreign-language Web sites where the team engages. But it is impossible to measure whether opinions are changing -- and, if so, whether the team is a significant influence, or simply trying to empty the ocean of militancy one thimble at a time. ''What's most important is that we are engaging in intelligent, honest and forthright discussions,'' said Maj. T. G. Taylor, Central Command's chief of media. ''The fact that more and more forums allow us to participate with their audiences is perhaps a more important measure of our communication efforts.'' One recent effort by the Central Command involved answering a chat room query on what had been accomplished by America's decade-long involvement in Afghanistan. ''Afghans today enjoy more political, economic and social rights than at any time in the history of the country,'' the Digital Engagement Team wrote back. It added, ''The days of public stoning and the beating of women in the streets are over.''  "
