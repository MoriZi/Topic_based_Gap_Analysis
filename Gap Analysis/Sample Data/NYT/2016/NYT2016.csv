Russia Prepares to Block LinkedIn,"LinkedIn, the social networking site for professionals that will soon be bought by Microsoft, is to be blocked in Russia after a local court ruled on Thursday that it had breached the country's data protection rules, a sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating in the country. The case in the Moscow city courts arose at a time of debate in Washington over how the United States might retaliate for what American security officials said was the Russian government's hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and other digital interference in the presidential election.     Russia has a history of increasing regulatory pressure on businesses in political disputes. The case began in August, before Donald J. Trump's victory in Tuesday's presidential election, and there is currently no connection between the LinkedIn case and the hacking scandal.   The country's push to gain greater control over its internet users is one of a number of attempts by governments worldwide to dictate how people use digital services.   From China's blocking of whole swaths of the internet to Europe's efforts to regulate what can and cannot be viewed online, different regions and countries are in a battle with companies and other governments to decide how the internet will expand.   Russia imposed its ban -- a rare occasion of LinkedIn being blocked in a country -- after lawmakers passed new rules last year that required any personal digital data on Russian citizens collected by companies to be stored within the country.   Officials said the rules were aimed at protecting people's online privacy from hackers, but critics have claimed the legislation could allow Russian authorities to force companies -- both local and international -- to hand over sensitive information about their users.   Many of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, like Facebook and Twitter, also do not store data locally within Russia, but Roskomnadzor, the country's telecommunications watchdog, targeted LinkedIn for its failure to comply with the new data rules.   It was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted in particular, rather than any other major social networking site. Analysts have suggested that the Russian authorities focused on the company, an also-ran in the country's social networking market, as a warning to larger tech companies.   The Moscow court decision, upholding a previous ruling against LinkedIn, means the company will now be blocked from operating across the country.   The ban could take effect as early as Monday, with internet service providers in Russia blocking access to LinkedIn's web address. The company, which has fewer than five million Russian users among its 467 million global users, could still appeal the court's decision.   ''The Russian court's decision has the potential to deny access to LinkedIn for the millions of members we have in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,'' Anoek Eckhardt, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''We remain interested in a meeting with Roskomnadzor to discuss their data localization request.''   LinkedIn is being bought by Microsoft -- a Silicon Valley tech giant with deep links in Russia -- for $26.2 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.   A number of other American tech companies like Facebook and Twitter have made efforts to expand their footprints within the country, though they have had to balance people's use of these social networks with the government's often heavy-handed efforts to gain control of digital information.   Facebook, for instance, rejected all five requests from the Russian government last year for access to specific data on people's online accounts, according to the company's latest transparency report. Twitter also rejected four requests from local officials for individuals' account information over the same period, according to its own report.   Despite LinkedIn's current problems in Russia, the company has often been willing to bend to local pressures, particularly in China, where it has agreed to abide by the country's strict censorship rules to build a significant presence there. Other American tech companies like Google and Facebook remain blocked in China.   The current standoff over data in Russia started in 2012, when local campaigners in Moscow used social networks to organize widespread protests against the re-election of the country's current president, Vladimir V. Putin. The same year, Russian hackers breached LinkedIn and stole more than six million of its customers' passwords.   Despite criticism of Russia's data protection rules, other countries, including Germany, have passed similar legislation that forces tech companies to store people's digital information on local servers.   A number of American tech companies are investing billions of dollars combined to build data centers across Europe to comply with such rules.   In Brazil, a judge also blocked WhatsApp, the internet messaging service, after the company, which is owned by Facebook, refused to hand over data to help in a criminal investigation.   The efforts have been aimed at safeguarding individuals' personal data, though companies have been quick to voice their skepticism over such practices.   In Russia, companies like Google have also faced other challenges from local incumbents like Yandex, the country's largest search engine, which have often outmuscled international rivals in their home market.   This year, Yandex won a legal challenge against Google over antitrust claims that the American search giant has unfairly favored some of its own mobile services over those of rivals. Eventually, the Silicon Valley company was fined $6.8 million in the case.     "
Taking OS X Security Seriously,"Q. The thought of ransomware aimed at the Mac makes me nervous. What other Mac threats are out there and who makes OS X antivirus software? A. While generally much less of a target than the Windows operating system, Apple's OS X system for the Mac has experienced a few dedicated attacks from malicious software over the past several years, including Flashback and Xcodeghost. Keeping your Mac updated with the latest security patches from Apple and using strong passwords (that are frequently changed) can help protect your system.     In addition to offering its own suggestions for safer computing to Mac users, Apple promotes the security features it builds into OS X, including malware detection and the ability to encrypt data with the FileVault tool. To avoid malware, the company also advises users to install software from the Mac App Store or other trusted sources only.   For another layer of protection, adding a security suite or antivirus program could help detect threats that may emerge against the Mac. Depending on what you want and how much you want to pay, you can find free basic virus scanner programs as well as comprehensive security suites.   Independent software evaluation sites like AV-Test and AV Comparatives do annual reviews of most major security programs for the Mac, and are a good place to start reading about what products are available. Avria, Avast Software, BitDefender (which also has a free Virus Scanner app), Intego and Malwarebytes are among the increasing number of companies now making Mac security software.   However, keep in mind that many security problems for OS X and Windows start with phishing and other forms of social engineering attacks. Through fraudulent email messages, tainted web links or rogue file attachments, criminals try to fool the user by deceptively wheedling out passwords, credit card numbers and other personal information.   The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team has an extensive online guide to protecting oneself, as does the consumer-oriented OnGuardOnline.gov site from the Federal Trade Commission.

"South Korea, Saying North Hacked Phones, Warns of a Looming Cyberattack","SEOUL, South Korea --  Nearly a year and a half after North Korea was accused of mounting a sophisticated cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, South Korea's intelligence agency accused the country of hacking into the smartphones of dozens of senior government officials, and suggested that the North could be preparing a major cyberattack. The early descriptions provided by the agency, the National Intelligence Service, indicated that the cyberattacks directed at South Korean officials were not as sophisticated, or destructive, as the attack on Sony in late 2014. That assault left 70 percent of Sony's computers inoperable. The South Korean attack -- or at least the first stage of it -- involved stealing text messages, contact information and voice conversations, seemingly more focused on espionage than on destruction.      Yet the agency said that South Korea faced a growing threat of major online attacks from the North, possibly in retaliation for the latest international sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear arms and missile programs. Seoul imposed new sanctions of its own against North Korea on Tuesday, including a ban on ships that have stopped in North Korea within the past six months.   Perhaps the most notable part of the announcement by the agency was the disclosure that North Korean hackers had successfully gained access to the network of a company that provides security software for an online banking system used by more than 20 million South Koreans. That is often the prelude to larger attacks, and the North is believed to have been behind several attacks on banks, government websites and media companies in the South since 2008.    In this case, the agency said that the attack on the security firm took place in February, and was detected early. It said there was no major disruption to banking services. But that assumes the North would conduct its attack right away, rather than waiting to mount a larger operation -- which is what it did in the Sony case, which took months to engineer.   North Korea has increasingly turned to cyberweapons as a way of exacting a price on its adversaries without provoking a major counterattack. It is under particular pressure now after its fourth nuclear test, which it claimed involved a hydrogen bomb. American officials have said there was no evidence a hydrogen weapon was involved.   But the Pentagon has also warned that the impoverished North might see hacking attacks as ''a cost-effective way to develop asymmetric, deniable military options.''   While that nuclear test provoked United Nations sanctions, passed last week, countries have been uncertain how to respond to cyberattacks. Whatever price the North paid for the Sony assault appeared to be fairly modest. Nonetheless, its cyberwarfare units appeared to stand down for much of 2015.   But between late February and early March of this year, the agency said, North Korea tried to infiltrate the smartphones of senior South Korean officials by sending them text messages designed to activate a virus. About 20 percent of those phones were infected with the virus, according to the agency, which did not identify the officials.   The intelligence service did not explain how it had concluded that North Korea was responsible.   South Korea has been a leading advocate for the tougher penalties on the North, to cut the funding that enables it to keep its weapons program alive. Many of the new United Nations sanctions single out luxury goods, which analysts believe are used to ensure the loyalty of the North's ruling elite.   Yet for the past several years, South Korea rarely imposed unilateral sanctions. The ban it announced on Tuesday would prohibit all ships visiting North Korea from making port calls in the South for six months. Japan announced a similar measure last month.   Last year, 66 ships from other countries made a total of 104 port calls in South Korea after visiting the North, carrying steel and other goods, the government said. South Korea also said that 40 individuals and 30 entities, most of them North Korean, would be prohibited from financial transactions with the South because of ties to Pyongyang's weapons programs. It also urged its people not to eat at any of the 130 restaurants abroad that North Korea runs to earn foreign currency.   Seoul had already banned most direct trade with North Korea after the sinking of a navy ship in 2010, which it attributed to  a North Korean torpedo attack. On Wednesday, Pyongyang's state-run news agency quoted North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, as boasting that the country possessed standardized small nuclear warheads for ballistic missiles.   The North said last year that it had already begun building small nuclear weapons. Such claims carried in the nation's propaganda-filled media are impossible to confirm independently.

Apple Sees Its Privacy Stance as Crucial to Its Global Brand,"SAN FRANCISCO --  It took six years for Apple to persuade China's largest wireless carrier, China Mobile, to sell the iPhone. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, made repeated trips to China to meet with top government officials and executives to woo them personally. The persistence paid off. In 2013, China Mobile relented, a moment Mr. Cook later described as ''a watershed day'' for Apple.    Today, China is Apple's second-largest market after the United States -- Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products in the last fiscal year -- and the iPhone, the company's top seller, has become both a status symbol and a form of personal security, given how difficult the device is to break into in a country where people increasingly worry about hacking and cybercrime.   Apple's success in China helps explain why it is now in a standoff with the United States government over whether to help officials gain access to the encrypted iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting last December.    The company is playing the long game with its business. Privacy and security have become part of its brand, especially internationally, where it reaps almost two-thirds of its almost $234 billion a year in sales. And if it cooperates with one government, the thinking goes, it will have to cooperate with all of them.   ''Tim Cook is leveraging his personal brand and Apple's to stand on the side of consumer privacy in this environment,'' said Mark Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo who studies encryption and cyberlaw. ''He is taking the long view.''   Mr. Cook, who has called privacy a civic duty, said as much in a letter to Apple customers on Tuesday. He described how the United States government was asking for a special tool to break into the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone and said, ''The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.''   An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks in Mr. Cook's letter.   The business advantage Apple may get from privacy has given critics an opening to attack the company. In a court filing on Friday, the Justice Department said Apple's opposition to helping law enforcement appeared ''to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.''   Apple senior executives responded that their defiance was not a business choice. They said there had not been any business fallout and that Mr. Cook had received supportive emails from customers across the country.   In fact, Apple has not made a point of advertising data security and privacy. The company has quietly built privacy features into its mobile operating system, known as iOS, over time. By late 2013, when Apple released its iOS 7 system, the company was encrypting by default all third-party data stored on customers' phones. And iOS8, which became available in 2014, made it basically impossible for the company's engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.   Mr. Cook has also been vocal about how Apple is pro-privacy, a message that he discussed more widely after revelations from the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about government surveillance. Mr. Cook argued that the company sold hardware -- phones, tablets and laptops -- and did not depend on the mass collection of consumer data as some Silicon Valley behemoths, such as Google and Facebook, do for their advertising-oriented businesses.   At a conference in October, Mr. Cook called privacy a ''key value'' at Apple and said, ''We think that it will become increasingly important to more and more people over time as they realize that intimate parts of their lives are sort of in the open and being used for all sorts of things.''   For Apple, cooperating with the United States government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally.   In China, for example, Apple -- like any other foreign company selling smartphones -- hands over devices for import checks by Chinese regulators. Apple also maintains server computers in China, but Apple has previously said that Beijing cannot view the data and that the keys to the servers are not stored in China. In practice and according to Chinese law, Beijing typically has access to any data stored in China.   If Apple accedes to American law enforcement demands for opening the iPhone in the San Bernardino case and Beijing asks for a similar tool, it is unlikely Apple would be able to control China's use of it. Yet if Apple were to refuse Beijing, it would potentially face a battery of penalties.   Analysts said Chinese officials were pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of computers and phones sold in the country, though Beijing last year backed off on some proposals that would have required foreign companies to provide encryption keys for devices sold in the country after facing pressure from foreign trade groups.   ''People tend to forget the global impact of this,'' said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now, a nonprofit that works for Internet freedoms. ''The reality is the damage done when a democratic government does something like this is massive. It's even more negative in places where there are fewer freedoms.''   Governments in Russia, Britain and Israel also have robust surveillance operations. Some governments have tried to use technology to gather intelligence on citizens at home and abroad.   Apple's resistance to the United States government's demand has been polarizing. Apple supporters have held protests in cities like San Francisco in recent days to show their support of the company and have used hashtags on social media like #freeapple and #beatthecase.   ''We're fighting to maintain even the assumption that companies should protect us,'' said Evan Greer, the campaign director at Fight for the Future, a civil liberties group that is organizing protests nationwide on Tuesday to support Apple. ''Apple is doing what every company should be doing.''   Others, including the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, have criticized Apple, and Mr. Trump has suggested boycotting its products.   Around the world, people are aware of the impasse but many say it does not affect their decision to buy iPhones and the company's other products. In Rome on Friday, Simone Farelli, a 34-year-old history teacher who was browsing for a new iPhone at an Apple Store, said she ''didn't see why'' the company's standoff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ''would change my mind about buying a new phone.''   In China, the iPhone continues to hold a special place as a symbol of middle-class status.   Wen Shuyue, a 35-year-old consultant, who on Friday was waiting outside the Apple Store in Beijing's upscale Sanlitun district, is one of Apple's millions of Chinese users. He said he liked the iPhone because it was simply better than models made by Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei.   ''I've never used Xiaomi or Huawei, because I think their designs are rough and not all that personal,'' he said.   Apple's shareholders have so far been quiet. In the past, investors who complained that some of Apple's socially driven initiatives were superfluous to the company's core business were quickly subdued. At a 2014 shareholders' meeting, Mr. Cook told investors that if they wanted him to make decisions based only on the bottom line, ''then you should get out of the stock.''   But data privacy may eventually motivate investors -- and ultimately more customers -- to vote with their wallets because ''it's an issue that speaks directly to the business,'' said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. ''Right now people buy phones regardless of encryption issues, but we have to wait and see how bloody this fight gets.''     "
Social Security Requires Cellphone to Use Online Services,"People seeking to manage their federal Social Security benefits online can no longer do so unless they provide a cellphone number so they can receive an access code by text each time they log on. The change, which took effect July 30, is part of an effort to improve online security, according to the Social Security Administration. Users with online ''mySocialSecurity'' accounts already could choose to use texted codes as an extra layer of security, in addition to their user name and password. But now, the extra step is mandatory. Many businesses, including banks, offer such codes, but their use is typically optional.    The agency said the move was a response to an executive order issued in October 2014 that requires federal agencies to provide ''more secure authentication'' for online services. Adding a texted code to the user name and password is a type of multifactor authentication intended to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to confidential information, the agency said.    The Social Security Administration's news media office said agency officials were not available for interviews, but it provided information by email and sent links to statements on the agency's website.   The agency said that it realized the new security layer might be an inconvenience for some people. But, it added, ''Our research shows that an overwhelming majority of American adults have cellphones and use them for texting.''   The shift may create hurdles, however, especially for older Americans, who are less likely to use mobile phones. About 78 percent of people 65 and older own a cellphone, compared with 98 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center.   Comments about the change on the Social Security Administration's Facebook page were largely negative. ''Please rethink this security change,'' a woman posted, in one of the more polite responses. ''So many of us can't afford a cellphone. Texting with old joints is a joke. Please find another way for all of us to use the great service at mySocialSecurity account online.''   Other comments suggested that older Americans who do have cellphones avoid using the text function because they do not want to pay for receipt of spam messages.   Some privacy advocates question whether texted codes are the best way to safeguard a user's information.   ''It's better than nothing,'' said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, which focuses on protecting personal information and preventing identity theft.   But he said basic text messaging technology can be vulnerable to hacking. He said other options, like authentication apps that create one-time codes, might offer superior protection. But, he said, such apps generally would require use of a smartphone, rather than a basic cellphone. Smartphones are less popular among older people; only about 30 percent of people over 65 use them, according to the Pew Research Center data.   Mr. Stephens also faulted the Social Security Administration for giving users scant notice of the new requirement. Some people with online accounts received notification by email over the weekend, as the new rules were taking effect. While the change is well intended, ''I just think it was very poorly executed,'' he said.   Technical glitches stymied some users who tried to use their accounts soon after the new text requirement took effect on Saturday. Verizon Wireless customers, for instance, could not use the system until Monday afternoon. Verizon's systems apparently were screening the text messages as spam, said Kevin King, a company spokesman, but that problem has been fixed.   The website, however, noted on Wednesday that heavy traffic might cause problems with the receipt or entry of text codes and advised users, ''Please check back in a few days.''   The mySocialSecurity website, introduced in 2012, allows people who receive Social Security benefits to obtain verification letters, order replacement Social Security or Medicare cards and set up or change direct deposit of payments. Those who do not yet receive benefits can obtain estimates of future payments and check their annual earnings statement to make sure that their benefit payments are calculated using the correct information.   The online service has become more important in recent years as the Social Security Administration, like other government agencies, has sought to reduce the amount of paperwork it generates. The agency once sent earnings statements annually to workers 25 and older, but several years ago it reduced mailings and began encouraging Americans to check online. (The agency now mails statements to workers every five years, starting at age 25).   Here are some questions and answers about the new Social Security log on system:   How does the new logon system work?   Users enter their user name and password as usual, but they are also asked to enter an eight-digit code texted to their cellphone each time they log on to the website. A texted code is now also required for people who are establishing accounts for the first time. The codes are valid for 10 minutes and can be used just once.   What if I don't use a cellphone or don't want to provide my number?   For now, users can email,  call or write to the Social Security Administration, or visit a local office, to request information about their benefits or earnings statements. The administration said it eventually expected to offer alternatives, but texts were the only option now because of ''technical and resource constraints.''   What if I lose my cellphone or get a new one?   If you get a new phone but keep the same phone number, you do not have to do anything, according to the administration's website. If you lose your cellphone, you can request a cellphone reset code online, and the agency will mail you a letter with a reset code in five to 10 business days.   Where can I get more information about the new requirements?   The administration has a list of frequently asked questions on its website.     "
Ashley Madison Owner Reaches $1.6 Million Settlement,"The owner of the website Ashley Madison, which marketed itself to would-be adulterers and was breached by hackers last year, will pay a sharply discounted $1.66 million penalty after an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and several states into lax data security and deceptive practices, the company and the authorities said on Wednesday.  The remainder of a $17.5 million settlement was suspended based on the inability of Ruby Corporation, the website's privately held owner, to pay. ""I recognize that it was a far lower number, frankly, than I would have liked,"" Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the trade commission, said in a call with reporters. ""We want them to feel the pain. We don't want them to profit from unlawful conduct. At the same time, we are not going to seek to put a company out of business."" The size of the payment means that Ashley Madison's customers will not receive any financial redress for the breach, which exposed the personal details of more than 36 million people who signed up for a site with the slogan ""Life is short. Have an affair."" Class-action lawsuits against the company are pending. The joint investigation, which also included the authorities in Australia and Canada, found that lax security practices at the Toronto-based company allowed intruders access to its computer networks several times between November 2014 and June 2015 without being discovered.Related Articles   "
Downside of Bitcoin: A Ledger That Can't Be Corrected,"There has been much discussion about the potential of blockchain, the technology underlying virtual currencies like Bitcoin, to change the world. We have heard waves of inspired commentary on how the technology, with its ability to share information and record transactions, will be as revolutionary as the internet itself. At Accenture, we agree about these huge possibilities, but there is an elephant in the room that will need to be confronted. One of the accepted virtues of blockchain is that it creates a permanent, immutable ledger of transactions. For example, each of the roughly 160 million Bitcoin transactions that have occurred since the cryptocurrency began in 2009 will stay on that ledger as long as Bitcoin exists.     That permanence has been vital in building trust in the decentralized currencies, which are used by millions of people. But it could severely limit blockchain's usefulness in other areas of financial services relied on by billions of people. By clashing with new privacy laws like the ''right to be forgotten'' and by making it nearly impossible to resolve human error and mischief efficiently, the blockchain's immutability could end up being its own worst enemy.   The financial services industry needs to face the question of how to balance the appeal of pristine accounting with the demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records.   This challenge is coming to light with new data privacy rules like the European Union's general data protection regulation, which will add new consumer data privacy and ownership rights over the next two years. These rules will not just affect Europe; they will have a far-reaching impact on global companies, and not least on the back offices of major financial institutions.   Entities anywhere in the world that handle personal data belonging to Europeans will be affected by such laws, and infractions could lead to fines of 4 percent of revenue. Little wonder that Accenture clients are asking how they will defend the ''right to be forgotten'' rules using blockchain technology that always remembers.   Blockchain's immutability could eventually run at odds with existing regulations, too. For example, the United States Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-P all require personal financial data to be easily redacted.   For blockchain purists, simply questioning the immutable nature of the technology is a heresy to be resisted. Like the early internet pioneers who saw e-commerce as a crass concept that would spell the end of the web as a place for ''cooperation and helpfulness,'' many of today's strongest blockchain advocates, though often highly inventive and visionary, tend to be more idealistic than pragmatic about blockchain's evolution. (It's worth noting that the internet, arguably the world's primary social fabric, now also supports commerce between two billion people every day.)   For example, a hacker exploited a programming error this spring in a self-executing blockchain ''smart contract,'' stealing more than $60 million of ''ether'' (another digital currency) from a start-up fund called the  Decentralized Autonomous Organization.   When lawyers argued that the hacker was entitled to the assets under the erroneous code, a surprising number of blockchain purists agreed. Even after the project's leaders succeeded in winning a consensus of participants to bifurcate the code at a point before the transaction occurred, a large number of participants continue to use the version of the chain where the theft occurred.   One thing is clear: If the financial services industry is to embrace a new technology, it cannot be one in which mischief and mistakes are immutable and fraudsters can defend their actions on spurious ideological grounds. Even the smartest contracts can be susceptible to human error, and even the cleverest I.T. architectures will be hit by events that need to be undone.   We need the means to solve this challenge, while maintaining blockchain's vast strengths. At Accenture, we're working with leading academics on a prototype that would enable blockchains to be amended or redacted where necessary -- under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators.   The venture capital community has invested more than $1.4 billion in blockchain applications over the last three years, according to the World Economic Forum. This year alone, banks and technology companies are expected to spend more than $1 billion out of their own pockets to develop the technology.   But if blockchain is to move beyond cryptocurrency and lab experiments to real and profitable deployments, we need to challenge conventional orthodoxy and rethink the role of absolute immutability. Perhaps we will then soon be able to read more about blockchain's achievements rather than its potential.   Richard Lumb is Accenture's group chief executive for financial services.     "
F.B.I. Examining if Hackers Gained Access to Clinton Aides' Emails,"WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I. investigation into the suspected state-sponsored Russian theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee's computer networks has expanded to determine if aides and organizations considered close to Hillary Clinton were also attacked, according to federal officials involved in the investigation. But so far, a sampling of senior Clinton aides at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia found none who said they had been notified by the F.B.I. or private investigators that their private emails had been compromised. At this point, law enforcement officials say, there is evidence only of attempts to gain access to those associates through ''spear-phishing'' attacks, often crude efforts to get someone to click on an email that releases malware into the computer.     The committee has said that Russia hacked into its computers and has been supported in its assertion by several private cybersecurity firms, including Crowdstrike, the company that investigated the committee's breach.   Two years ago, several Clinton aides who had worked at the State Department were notified that their accounts there had been broken into by one of the same Russian intelligence agencies, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., suspected of getting into the committee's system. That hacking, which went largely undetected while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state in President Obama's first term, gave the Russian intelligence services what one diplomat termed a road map of Mrs. Clinton's associates and frequent email partners.   Mrs. Clinton's private server while she was secretary of state, in Chappaqua, N.Y., would have been another obvious target. But last month the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said there was no ''direct evidence'' that Russia or any other power had ''successfully hacked'' into Mrs. Clinton's server. Still, he said, there was evidence that intruders had tried, and when Mr. Comey said any successful intruders were probably far too skilled to leave evidence of their intrusion behind, law enforcement officials said, he had the Russians in mind.   For years American intelligence agencies and the F.B.I. have tracked the operations here of two of the most sophisticated state-run hacking groups in the world, the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence agency, and the F.S.B., the state security service and successor, twice removed, of the K.G.B. of the Soviet era.   The activities of the two groups in the United States and around the world have been tracked for so many decades that their successes and misadventures are the subject of movies and lore in both the United States and Russia. But since they turned to hacking techniques and sometimes cyberweaponry, the Obama administration has rarely protested in public about the group's boldest information-warfare attacks, in part to avoid retaliation.   The administration decided not to publicly identify the Russians as the power behind State Department, White House and Joint Chiefs of Staff intrusions. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, told Congress that the United States would not name or shame any country engaged in ordinary espionage -- of the kind the United States also does -- but should focus instead on setting norms against the theft of intellectual property and destructive attacks. For that reason, Mr. Obama has focused on agreements with China to protect corporate secrets.   Now some administration officials think they may have misunderstood Russia's intentions. After the public release of the emails and documents that brought down the chairwoman of the Democratic Party, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the threat by WikiLeaks to release more documents from this and other hacks, administration officials say they are in a strange new world in which Russia may be using the products of espionage to influence an American election.   Some outsiders agree. ''There is nothing new in one nation's intelligence services using stealthy techniques to influence an election in another,'' Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote on the Lawfare blog on Monday. He noted that the United States had engaged in covert actions to influence elections in Indonesia, Italy, Chile and Poland during the Cold War.   But he added that ''doing so by hacking into a political party's computers and releasing their emails does seem somewhat new.'' It could foretell an era of data manipulation, in which outsiders could tinker with votes, or voter data, or ''lose'' electronic ballots.   Federal officials say their investigation has been underway since the spring, when the committee notified the F.B.I. of the intrusion. The committee's suspicions were triggered by what appeared to be a relatively clumsy attack by the G.R.U. In the course of investigating that attack, the F.B.I. discovered an earlier, more sophisticated attack on the committee by the F.S.B., which is often in competition with the G.R.U.   But investigators say the committee was reluctant to cooperate deeply in the federal investigation, relying instead -- as many companies do -- on private investigators that they hired. The committee brought in Crowdstrike, which reported publicly in June that it had evidence that the hack began last summer.   Julian Assange, who founded WikiLeaks, argued to Richard Engel of NBC in an interview broadcast Monday that ''there is no proof of that whatsoever'' that Russia was behind the original hacking. ''We have not disclosed our source, and of course, this is a diversion that's being pushed by the Hillary Clinton campaign.''   Mr. Assange also said another round of emails to be released would provide ''enough evidence'' to indict her, but her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said, ''He says a lot of things, so I'm not, I'm not going to pay attention to that.''   Many cybersecurity firms that have examined the evidence released by Crowdstrike say Russia appears to be the source. Thomas Rid, a cyberexpert and author of ''Rise of the Machines,'' noted in an article published on Vice's website that the intruders made several mistakes: ''One leaked document included hyperlink error messages in Cyrillic,'' because the documents had been edited with Russian language settings, and other ''metadata'' was consistent with ''identical fingerprints'' found in attacks on the German Parliament. The Germans named one of Russia's intelligence agencies as the attacker in that case.     "
Surveillance in the Post-Obama Era,"During his 2008 campaign, President Obama vowed to assert greater oversight of the massive surveillance apparatus built in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, arguing that the United States needed to strike a better balance between privacy and security and that all intelligence programs should be lawful. ""I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to track and take out the terrorists without undermining our Constitution and our freedom,"" Mr. Obama said in 2007.  Once in office, however, the Obama White House failed to meaningfully scale back surveillance practices established by Mr. Obama's predecessor, including the unlawful bulk collection of Americans' domestic phone call records. It was only after a National Security Agency whistle-blower, Edward Snowden, exposed how much data American intelligence agencies were collecting and hoarding that the administration began to disclose the capabilities, legal underpinnings and safeguards of government surveillance programs. The Snowden revelations prompted important reforms. Still, the debate over the proper balance between privacy and security remains far from settled. Disappointingly, the two candidates vying to replace Mr. Obama have failed to outline clear and comprehensive visions for one of the most consequential sets of choices the next president will face. One big issue is what to do when a key provision of the law that gives the N.S.A. the authority to collect the electronic communications of foreigners - which inevitably sucks in their correspondence with Americans - expires at the end of 2017. Before reauthorizing that part of the law, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the next president and Congress should craft a more narrow authority that ensures that the data of Americans cannot be searched without a warrant. How best to respond to encryption technology, which is evolving rapidly, will be another major challenge. Earlier this year, the White House supported the Justice Department's heavy-handed order to compel Apple to disable a security feature that would have allowed the government access to a locked iPhone that belonged to a mass shooter. That request, withdrawn before the legal fight was settled, would have forced the company to develop a capability that it argued would have undermined the privacy of its customers. The next president should refrain from forcing technology companies to build encryption systems that can be breached, which would make everyone's private information more vulnerable to hackers. The next president should be more forthcoming in disclosing the legal rationale and effectiveness of the government's surveillance programs. ""Just trust us,"" its default response to reasonable requests for more information, simply isn't enough. The latest instance involved reports earlier this week that Yahoo was compelled last year to screen all messages for a specific type of correspondence the government was interested in spotting, as part of surveillance of a state-sponsored terrorist organization. Left unsaid was whether it worked and whether other email providers have been issued similar secret orders. The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has not substantively addressed any of these issues. But he has proposed draconian, unconstitutional measures to keep the nation safe, including carrying out surveillance of mosques and creating a database of Muslims. This is offensive and outrageous. ""We're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,"" he said last November. Hillary Clinton has been more measured in discussing surveillance and encryption. Her campaign has suggested creating a national commission to explore legal and practical questions surrounding encryption. Mrs. Clinton has also said she would like to foster a more constructive relationship with Silicon Valley leaders, who have often been reluctant to collaborate with intelligence agencies. But she has been troublingly vague on specifics. The next president needs to take the initiative early on to outline a responsible philosophy and approach toward surveillance and privacy issues. Even if that happens, Congress still needs to be more assertive than in the past in setting clear parameters to ensure that intelligence gathering programs are legally sound and effective. It would be a shame if it took a new whistle-blower to force what should be a continuing, vigorous debate.  This is part of a series about issues that deserve more attention in the presidential campaign.

Donald Trump's Hotel Chain to Pay Penalty Over Data Breaches,"Donald J. Trump's hotel chain agreed to pay a $50,000 penalty and revamp its data security policies after a couple of breaches exposed 70,000 credit card numbers and other personal information of its customers.  Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, who announced the settlement on Friday, said in a news release that banks tracing fraudulent card use last year determined that the cards had last been legally used at Trump hotels, indicating the security breach had happened there. Further investigation found malware at several Trump hotels and that an attacker in 2014 had gained unauthorized access to steal sensitive information.    The high-end hotel chain, which includes the Trump Soho and Trump International in New York and properties in Chicago, Las Vegas and Waikiki, Hawaii, knew about the initial infiltration as early as June 2015, but did not warn customers for nearly four months, which the attorney general's office said violated state laws requiring expedient notification.   Mr. Schneiderman said that delays in implementing security measures may have contributed to additional exposure of personal data in November 2015, a breach that was discovered in March.   The conclusion of the data case comes as cyberthreats have taken an outsize role in Mr. Trump's presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton. A series of hackings, including emails of Democratic National Committee officials, has spilled over to the campaign trail, with Mr. Trump at one point calling on Russia to find Mrs. Clinton's missing emails.   The settlement resolves one of the pending confrontations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat and a supporter of Mrs. Clinton's. Mr. Schneiderman sued Mr. Trump in 2013, claiming that his for-profit educational programs at Trump University defrauded students, and he recently said his office was looking into Mr. Trump's foundation.   In addition to the fine, the hotel chain agreed to install a number of procedures to safeguard customers, including employee training, risk assessments and regular testing of systems.   ''Unfortunately, cybercriminals seeking consumer data have recently infiltrated the systems of many organizations including almost every major hotel company,'' Jennifer Rodstrom, a spokeswoman for Trump Hotels, said in a statement. ''Safeguarding our customers' data is a top priority for the company, and we will continue taking actions to do so.''

Ex-Bangladesh Bank Chief Blames Global Transfer System for Theft,"DHAKA, Bangladesh -- The former governor of Bangladesh's central bank, from which $81 million was stolen in February, says that flaws in the global money transfer system -- and not any misstep by him -- are to blame for the brazen heist. In an interview this week at his home in a well-to-do neighborhood in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, Atiur Rahman, who resigned from his post after the theft, said that the loss had been a ''systemic failure'' and that ''Bangladesh should not be blamed for something going wrong in the chain.''    In particular, he blamed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Bangladesh's central bank had placed the money.   ''If you want to take $500 out of your account in the U.S., you'll be asked several questions,'' Mr. Rahman said. ''But here, millions are going, and you're not asking any questions.'' The New York Fed, he added, ''should have immediately called someone in Bangladesh -- the governor or someone.''    Mr. Rahman also said that he tapped an online security firm a year ago to help the bank bulk up its defenses but that it had been hired only after the theft because of bureaucratic delays.   Mr. Rahman's comments go to the heart of fears in the international banking community. The theft exposed weaknesses in the way the world's banks, companies and other financial institutions transfer money around the globe. Swift -- the system they use to move that money and through which the money was transferred out of the New York Fed -- has since said it has seen other such attempts to steal money from the global banking system.   In the case of Bangladesh Bank, the thieves used stolen credentials to try to transfer nearly $1 billion of the central bank's money at the New York Fed to accounts around the world. About $81 million was ultimately transferred to casinos in the Philippines, where much of it disappeared.   A spokeswoman for the New York Fed declined to comment on Mr. Rahman's remarks but said that the theft had not been the result of a breach of its computer systems.   Some experts have said the theft was the result of weaknesses in Bangladesh Bank itself. Local news reports have said the bank used $10 routers and no firewalls. But Mr. Rahman disputed the notion that the bank's digital security was lax.   ''I made cybersecurity the top of the agenda,'' he said, adding, ''I smelt a year back that this could be a problem. It was my bad luck that this happened now.''   He said that the bank had tapped Mandiant, a security firm owned by FireEye Inc. of the United States, as an adviser before the theft, but that bureaucratic tangles in Bangladesh had kept Mandiant from fully joining until after the incident. Dan Wire, a spokesman for FireEye, declined to comment.   Swift executives have also been frustrated that some of its users have been slow to disclose a breach in their systems and -- in one case -- failed to inform the consortium of an attack at all. Swift representatives have suggested to federal officials in the United States that banks that cannot maintain a basic level of digital security may have to be removed from the network, a decision that could economically marginalize certain parts of the world.   A spokeswoman for Swift -- which stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication -- declined to comment on Mr. Rahman's remarks but said: ''Security weaknesses at individual customer firms have an impact on others in the wider financial system, which means that the industry as a whole has to respond by renewing and enhancing its security.''   Mr. Rahman said that an investigation was continuing and that there might have been negligence at Bangladesh Bank. But he said he was not responsible for any wrongdoing. ''As a governor, I'm not supposed to look at each and every small thing,'' he said.   ''Maybe someone's password was compromised,'' he added. ''It was a departmental failure and not the fault of the governor. It was a high dosage attack, like a 15 on the Richter scale attack. Other parties could have helped or warned Bangladesh. You cannot imagine my shock.''   On speculation that someone within the bank had actively helped the thieves, he said, ''if there's a criminal, catch him, but without blaming anyone without reason.''   Mr. Rahman resigned after the theft for the greater good of the bank, he said. But he defended his conduct after the theft. The former governor has been criticized in Bangladesh for not reporting the theft to the country's government for a month.   ''I wanted to save the financial system and the image of the country,'' he said.   ''It could be a mistake, but it was not a crime,'' he said, adding, ''People should not expect that I'll be technically so smart that I would know from the start what happened.''   To steal the money, the thieves sent transfer orders to the New York Fed using the Bangladesh Bank's credentials. The heist was well timed -- it took place during Thursday night in Bangladesh, on the eve of the country's weekend. When workers there discovered the transfers on Saturday, they tried to reach the New York Fed, which was closed for its weekend.   Mr. Rahman contends that the New York Fed did not do enough to verify that the orders were real. ''There was a terrible lack of efficiency from the Fed,'' he said. ''We were sending mails, faxes, but there was no one to pick that up. We need a hotline.''   In May, representatives of the Fed, of Bangladesh Bank and of Swift met in Basel, Switzerland, to discuss protecting the global financial system from these types of attacks.   Mr. Rahman also laid some of the blame on the Philippines, where the theft has exposed what critics say are holes in efforts to counter money laundering. ''If the Fed really wants to help, it only needs to make one small phone call to the Philippines central bank governor and order it to return the money,'' he said. ''It's the credibility of the system that's at stake.''   In March, the agency that tackles money laundering in the Philippines filed criminal charges against two businessmen, accusing them of breaking the country's money-laundering laws by receiving some of the money from the heist.   A spokeswoman for the governor of the Filipino central bank, Amando Tetangco Jr., wrote in an email, ''Charges have been filed against those who have been identified as being involved in the Bangladesh heist. We await the decision of the courts.''     "
"Switching Focus, Intel Sells Majority Stake in Cybersecurity Unit to TPG","SAN FRANCISCO -- McAfee, once one of the household names in computer security software, is poised to become an independent business once more. Intel, which bought McAfee for $7.7 billion six years ago, said on Wednesday that it had sold a majority stake in its cybersecurity business to the investment firm TPG, in a transaction valuing the security provider at approximately $4.2 billion, including debt.    The move will bring McAfee independence at a time when cybersecurity businesses have grown more prominent amid seemingly omnipresent hacking threats. And its sale illustrates how much both the technology industry and Intel have changed since Intel purchased the company in 2010.    Then, much of computer security was centered on protecting personal computers hard wired to corporate and personal networks. The explosion of smartphones, tablets and laptops, all wirelessly connected to cloud computing systems, has changed the industry. PC sales have shrunk for five years, too, changing Intel's business plans.   In a world where many programs share information, it is harder at times to say where some software resides, or with what it is interacting. Individual virus scans like the kind that McAfee traditionally sold might be useful, but they are not always sufficient. Nor are firewalls, which may protect some of a corporation but cannot create an adequate defense.   Following industry trends, Intel Security last year announced plans to refocus on cloud network security as well as ways to identify and analyze potential threats through sophisticated software, which the business said would let it respond to problems sooner and faster. It also expanded its focus to protection for mobile devices, as well as PCs.   Intel, reeling from the PC collapse, has struggled to build up a business in chips for cloud-type data centers. This has made McAfee, along with other software assets that Intel acquired under its previous leadership, less attractive to current management.   Sales from the security business rose 11 percent during the first half of this year from the same time last year, to $1.1 billion.   Under the terms of the deal, McAfee will borrow money to pay an approximately $2 billion dividend to Intel, which will retain a 49 percent stake in the business. TPG will pay $1.1 billion in cash for a 51 percent stake.   The business, currently called Intel Security, will again adopt the McAfee name when the deal closes, which is expected in the second quarter of 2017.   TPG as a company has long expressed interest in cybersecurity applications, having already invested in two start-ups through its growth equity arm.   Ten months ago, however, its flagship private equity division approached Intel about potentially spinning out the cybersecurity business.   ''We have long identified the cybersecurity sector, which has experienced strong growth due to the increasing volume and severity of cyberattacks, as one of the most important areas in technology,'' Bryan Taylor, the TPG partner who led the investment, said in a statement.   ''Given McAfee's leading global market position, loyal customer base, and trusted technology, we see a compelling opportunity to invest in a highly-strategic platform that is growing consistently and addressing significant and evolving market demand,'' he continued.   For Intel, selling a majority stake in McAfee would free the Silicon Valley giant to spend more time on core areas while still retaining a foothold in the cybersecurity world.   ''Security remains important in everything we do at Intel and going forward we will continue to integrate industry-leading security and privacy capabilities in our products from the cloud to billions of smart, connected computing devices,'' Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief executive, said in a statement.     "
Europe Tried to Rein In Google. It Backfired.,"Google is a top target for European regulators and privacy watchdogs, who openly fear and distrust its dominance. The American tech giant's search engine alone gobbles up roughly 90 percent of the European market. But a landmark court ruling intended to rein in Google has instead put it at the forefront of Europe's enforcement of Internet privacy. That has upended conventional wisdom about the company and raised questions about the role of commercial interests in protecting people's privacy, often with little or no transparency.    In the almost two years since Europeans gained the ''right to be forgotten'' on the Internet, Google has passed judgment in over 418,000 cases -- roughly 572 a day -- from people wanting links of certain search results to be removed, according to the company's records. It has approved fewer than half of those requests, all behind closed doors.   Google's total number of privacy-related judgments is double those of most of Europe's biggest individual national authorities over the same period, even though these public agencies address a wider range of data protection complaints.    Despite a history of animosity toward the company, national regulators have handed over the review powers to Google with few complaints, saying they are merely following Europe's complex data protection rules. Other search companies, including Microsoft, have been given the same authority, though their number of judgments pales by comparison.   Some consumer groups and privacy experts are not satisfied with that arrangement. They have sounded alarm bells over a for-profit company -- one that relies on tapping into people's digital lives to make billions of dollars and that is the subject of multiple privacy and antitrust investigations -- playing such a central role in protecting individuals' data, and doing so in such a secretive manner.   Google has not responded to requests, including an open letter last year from primarily European and American academics, to explain how its review process works. And since 2014, when ''right to be forgotten'' was enshrined, the company has declined to give any journalists access to its team of fewer than 50 employees -- mostly lawyers and paralegals based at its Dublin offices -- who review the demands. Google also did not respond to questions for this article about the decision process.   ''It's a half-baked solution,'' said Luciano Floridi, a University of Oxford professor who previously sat on an advisory council to help Google handle its role as a de facto privacy regulator. ''If Europe really wanted to regain control over personal data, giving Google this type of power is an odd outcome.''   Less than 1 percent of Google's decisions are appealed to Europe's privacy authorities, according to the regulators' statistics, and those authorities said they generally ruled in the company's favor.   But several individuals who sent requests to Google told The New York Times that the lack of detail over how these decisions were made left them frustrated and, in some cases, angry that a company adjudicated on such delicate matters. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to publicize their own privacy cases.   ''If governments were handling 'right to be forgotten,' they would have to publish data,'' said Martin Husovec, a professor at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society in the Netherlands, and a signatory of the open letter to Google. ''But with Google, we can't see what's happening behind the company's closed doors.''   After Europe's highest court ruled in May 2014 that people with connections to the Continent could ask search engines like Google and Microsoft's Bing to remove links about themselves from online search results, the companies were handed the power to decide which of these requests were legitimate. Citing European privacy rules, the European Court of Justice mandated that search engines, and not a public body, should be the first port of call for the decisions. Europe's top court did not require that companies make their decision-making process open to public scrutiny.   People's privacy requests must relate to online information, like personal circumstances or a past criminal conviction, that is no longer relevant or not in the public interest, definitions that privacy lawyers say are inherently fuzzy.   Thus far, that has mostly involved people demanding mundane information like phone numbers or addresses be removed from links to online directories (the largest collective group of sites affected). Individuals have also requested that links to references about themselves on social media, including Facebook, be taken down.   In some cases, however, newspaper articles, including one in The Times covering somewhat questionable business practices, have been removed from European search results. Elsewhere, a Romanian website that publishes court proceedings has been hit with complaints.   People requesting the removal of links must submit an online form, attaching an official ID.   Though Google would not comment publicly about the review process, two company executives gave some detail on how decisions were made. They spoke to The Times on the condition they not be named.   Typically, requests are sent to Google's legal team. Straightforward rulings, like those that involve a public figure who cannot legally apply for links to be removed, are handled by junior staff members. Tougher decisions are referred to senior lawyers who must weigh an individual's privacy against the public's right to information, the company officials said.   When Google's team accepts a request, it informs an individual that the privacy demand has been successful, while also notifying the website that links to certain European search results have been removed. The website cannot appeal the decision. If Google refuses the request, the company must tell an individual that the decision can be appealed, but does not specifically explain why the submission failed.   Some European officials remain wary of handing Google the power to make privacy decisions, though they declined to comment publicly on the court-mandated privacy process. But regulators acknowledge that the company's system -- which has so far dealt with removal requests for 1.4 million links -- has proved surprisingly straightforward. Some officials also remain satisfied that Google makes these initial privacy rulings despite a lack of openness over how decisions are made.   ''When it comes to appeals, we agree with Google most of the time,'' said Mathias Moulin, a deputy director at the Commission National de l'Informatique et des Libertés, the French privacy authority.   This muted official response -- from both European regulators and politicians -- is partly because agencies lack the financial, technical and human resources to handle the substantial influx of ''right to be forgotten'' requests, according to regulatory officials and legal experts.   Still, for privacy campaigners and some regulators, Google's regulatory track record remains outweighed by Europe's effectively handing the policing of one of its fundamental rights to a for-profit company.   ''Is Google the right entity to have such power over these decisions?'' said Johannes Caspar, supervisor at the Hamburg data protection authority, the primary regulator in Germany that oversees American tech companies such as Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and Facebook. ''We have to live by European law, and that says Google must decide.''     "
Obama Stresses Data in Terrorism Fight,"BERLIN -- The trans-Atlantic debate over digital privacy rights versus the surveillance needs of intelligence agencies was put under a spotlight on Monday, as President Obama called for continued access by law enforcement officials to thwart terrorism, while some European privacy advocates urged greater restraint. ''I want to say this to young people who value their privacy and spend a lot of time on their phones: The threat of terrorism is real,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking at a trade show in Hanover, Germany.     ''I've worked to reform our surveillance programs to ensure that they're consistent with the rule of law and upholding our values, like privacy -- and, by the way, we include the privacy of people outside of the United States,'' he added.   Mr. Obama's message comes at a sensitive time, as cities like Brussels and Paris are still recovering from recent terrorist attacks. But his words are unlikely to slow down European efforts to expand people's control over their digital lives.   Europe is at the heart of a global debate over the way companies like Google and Facebook, as well as national intelligence agencies, handle people's digital data. Some regulators in the 28-member bloc have called on companies and governments, particularly that of the United States, to comply with the region's tough privacy regulations.   ''Those who want to play in our backyard must play by our rules,'' Viviane Reding, a member of the European Parliament from Luxembourg and a former top European Union official, said on Monday at a privacy conference in Berlin. ''Protection of our personal data shouldn't have a national barrier.''   Ms. Reding is an author of a European Union privacy law that will go into force in 2018. It will be able to impose fines of up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue for the most serious breaches of European data protection rules. Those penalties would apply to any company -- even if it has no physical presence in Europe -- that has customers within the European Union.   At issue are communications via cellphones, as well as data generated in social media, online searches and e-commerce purchases.   The protections pursued in the European Union include the so-called right to be forgotten, detailed by the bloc's highest court, which requires search giants like Google to remove links to online information in some cases.   And Europe's national privacy regulators have vowed to take a tough line against a new pact between the United States and the European Union that is intended to ensure the relatively unimpeded flow of personal data across the Atlantic. The national regulators are wary of the ability of American law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor data to fight crime or terrorism.   But American agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, argue that they actively monitor companies' access to individuals' digital data. They say that American privacy safeguards -- including the United States Constitution -- often provide better protection than the rules in other jurisdictions, including those in Europe.   ''We care about Europeans' privacy,'' Mr. Obama said in Hanover, ''not just Americans' privacy.''   Many European officials acknowledge that the region's privacy laws share many similarities with those in the United States. But they also highlight important differences, including the lack of overarching federal privacy legislation. The differences, they say, must be bridged if Europe and the United States are to effectively supervise the way companies like Facebook and Google gain access to data worldwide.   ''The digital world is globalized,'' Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Union's data protection supervisor, said at the Berlin conference on Monday. ''So data protection should also be globalized.''     "
Bank Cybersecurity Demands United Effort,"Dominic Elliott and Sarah Hurst are columnists at Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com. Banks that have been pooling resources on blockchain technology should apply their camaraderie in a different field: computer security. The hacking of an unnamed commercial lender, revealed by the financial messaging system Swift on Thursday, came after an $81 million digital heist from Bangladesh's central bank in February. An industry utility -- or at least better-coordinated defenses -- is needed.     Increased regulatory requirements and low interest rates, both legacies of the financial crisis of the last decade, have made it hard for banks to make an economic return. The distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin may help cut industry costs. That's why more than 40 banks have joined the blockchain development group R3.   Cybersecurity should be next on the list. It's likely to be banks' biggest cost in terms of financial crime prevention this year and next, according to LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Weak digital defenses might prompt a credit rating downgrade, says Standard & Poor's.   Lenders may feel worried about sharing confidential data with rivals. But the aviation industry, long teetering on the edge of profitability, improved efficiency by sharing accident information via black box technology. And greater teamwork would help keep tabs on would-be criminals. Companies' own employees represent a huge threat: the business investigations company Kroll said in its latest annual global fraud report that insiders were 81 percent of the wrongdoers. A shared database of suspects might be a safeguard.   Regulators and governments could play a bigger role, too. The European Central Bank's plan for a database of serious incidents, as reported by the Financial Times on Thursday, appears to be no more than a first step. The United States Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center has had limited success: only 5 percent of the digital threats that American Express finds are the subject of warnings from other institutions, the company's chief executive, Kenneth Chenault, said last year.   But lenders right now seem to be doing too little. Europe's private sector-led Cyber Defense Alliance consists of just four banks. Financial institutions have demonstrated an unusual level of esprit de corps when it comes to new technology. Given that digital security could hit their finances more painfully, cooperation makes even more sense.     "
Digital Security Experts Find Unlikely Allies in Ex-Officials,"SAN FRANCISCO -- To Amit Yoran, a digital security veteran, the fight between Apple and the F.B.I. over access to an iPhone can be viewed in black-and-white terms: What law enforcement authorities want is ''so misguided, they simply boggle the mind.'' Speaking to an audience of computer security professionals at the RSA Conference, Mr. Yoran, who heads the RSA Security division of the data-storage provider EMC, explained his exasperation with officials who he says want to weaken the data protection in computer products despite the growing threat of hackers and other attacks.     ''Such a policy would harm U.S. economic interests on an already suspicious world stage, as well as unconscionably undermine those trying to defend our digital environments in every industry,'' said Mr. Yoran, who was the cybersecurity czar at the Department of Homeland Security for a little more than a year, ending in 2004.   Mr. Yoran's strong take on Apple's confrontation with the F.B.I. might be expected of someone in the tight-knit security world. Indeed, it was a typical refrain of conference attendees who see the dispute as an extension of the decades-long struggle between the tech industry and government over encryption.   But what surprised many of the about 40,000 people attending the RSA Conference, the world's largest gathering of security experts, this week was the nuanced, industry-friendly tone of former government officials who spoke at the event.   Michael Chertoff, the former director of Homeland Security under George W. Bush and an author of the Patriot Act, said it would be a mistake to sacrifice tough security to ''give authorities admittedly important access to certain types of phones or data.''   And strong security will become even more important in the coming years as Internet-connected technology spreads from smartphones and computers to home heating systems, streetlights, the electrical grid and much more, said Mr. Chertoff, who is now executive chairman of a risk-management and consulting organization.   ''Attacks on control systems can have loss of life, and encryption is going to be a key element in a strategy to secure all of this going forward,'' he told an audience.   The F.B.I. wants Apple's help bypassing the password mechanism of an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple is resisting a court order requiring its assistance, and a crowd of tech companies have filed court briefs in support of Apple's stance.   To many in tech, the iPhone fight is a reminder of the 1990s, when the government unsuccessfully argued for a so-called back door to encryption called the Clipper chip. The encryption debate was reignited by the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic that was revealed in documents leaked in 2013 by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.   Mr. Snowden's revelations added urgency to the adoption of tougher security and encryption at Silicon Valley's technology companies, including Apple, which added an encryption system in 2014 that made it impossible for the company to extract data off a customer's phone without the owner's password, even when compelled to by court order.   Security experts now worry that if Apple is required to create software to bypass its password system, it will be a precursor to many more government requests. They also worry that once Apple writes that code, it will show the world's spies, terrorists and hackers how to bypass its password security.   ''Numerous governments are going to come a-calling for their bite of the apple,'' said Nuala O'Connor, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a tech policy group. ''Once it's created, you can't unwrite that code.''   The tech industry has other unlikely allies in this debate.   J. Michael McConnell, a director of the National Security Agency in the 1990s, was once an advocate of the Clipper chip. But he said at the RSA Conference that he changed his mind after joining the private sector and Booz Allen Hamilton, a military consultancy, where he said he had yet to examine any computer of consequence that had not been hacked by Chinese spies.   ''When you understand that level of extraction of intellectual property,'' Mr. McConnell said, ''it's logical that ubiquitous encryption is something the nation needs to have.''   There is, of course, a business rationale for these concerns. The United States hardly has a monopoly on encryption technology. Consumers can pick from around 800 encryption tools from 55 countries. Some in the security business worry they will lose badly to competitors in other countries if it becomes clear the United States government has a way around their systems.   ''The moral, economic, strategic and technical leadership of the United States is at stake here,'' Dan Kaminsky, a well-respected security researcher, wrote in Wired in a piece timed with the conference. ''Whoever masters making a secure, digital world not just possible, but practical, will own the next Silicon Valley.''   Others at the conference, including James A. Lewis, a leading digital strategist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research group in Washington, said the iPhone debate was the start of a much larger discussion about the use of end-to-end encryption. That is, technology that protects data behind cyphers at every point.   He said this technology would make it difficult for corporations to see what employees were doing and for financial regulators to see what Wall Street was doing. It would, he added, put a veil over nearly everything.   Mr. Lewis argued for a system not unlike Google's, which has deployed encryption but, unlike Apple's encryption scheme, has yet to make it unrecoverable to authorities.   ''End-to-end encryption does not make you safer, it creates legal problems,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''That's what we're really fighting about.''   But most at the conference disagreed with that premise.   ''We're not going to stop this technology,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''It's already available in parts of the world.''     "
Stepping Up Security for an Internet-of-Things World,"The vision of the so-called internet of things -- giving all sorts of physical things a digital makeover -- has been years ahead of reality. But that gap is closing fast. Today, the range of things being computerized and connected to networks is stunning, from watches, appliances and clothing to cars, jet engines and factory equipment. Even roadways and farm fields are being upgraded with digital sensors. In the last two years, the number of internet-of-things devices in the world has surged nearly 70 percent to 6.4 billion, according to Gartner, a research firm. By 2020, the firm forecasts, the internet-of-things population will reach 20.8 billion.    The optimistic outlook is that the internet of things will be an enabling technology that will help make the people and physical systems of the world -- health care, food production, transportation, energy consumption -- smarter and more efficient.   The pessimistic outlook? Hackers will have something else to hack. And consumers accustomed to adding security tools to their computers and phones should expect to adopt similar precautions with internet-connected home appliances.    ''If we want to put networked technologies into more and more things, we also have to find a way to make them safer,'' said Michael Walker, a program manager and computer security expert at the Pentagon's advanced research arm. ''It's a challenge for civilization.''   To help address that challenge, Mr. Walker and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, created a contest with millions of dollars in prize money, called the Cyber Grand Challenge. To win, contestants would have to create automated digital defense systems that could identify and fix software vulnerabilities on their own -- essentially smart software robots as sentinels for digital security.   A reminder of the need for stepped-up security came a few weeks after the Darpa-sponsored competition, which was held in August. Researchers for Level 3 Communications, a telecommunications company, said they had detected several strains of malware that launched attacks on websites from compromised internet-of-things devices.   The Level 3 researchers, working with Flashpoint, an internet risk-management firm, found that as many as one million devices, mainly security cameras and video recorders, had been harnessed for so-called botnet attacks. They called it ''a drastic shift'' toward using internet-of-things devices as hosts for attacks instead of traditional hosts, such as hijacked data center computers and computer routers in homes.   And last week, researchers at Akamai Technologies, a web content delivery company, reported another security breach. They detected hackers commandeering as many as two million devices, including Wi-Fi hot spots and satellite antennas, to test whether stolen user names and passwords could be deployed to gain access to websites.   The Cyber Grand Challenge was announced in 2013, and qualifying rounds began in 2014. At the outset, more than 100 teams were in the contest. Through a series of elimination rounds, the competitors were winnowed to seven teams that participated in the finals in August in Las Vegas. The three winning teams collected a total of $3.75 million in prize money.   With the computer security contest, Darpa took a page from a playbook that worked in the past. The agency staged a similar contest that served to jump-start the development of self-driving cars in 2005. It took the winning team's autonomous vehicle nearly seven hours to complete the 132-mile course, a dawdling pace of less than 20 miles per hour.   Still, the 2005 contest proved that autonomous vehicles were possible, brushing aside longstanding doubts and spurring investment and research that led to the commercialization of self-driving car technology.   ''We're at that same moment with autonomous cyberdefense,'' Mr. Walker said.   The contest, according the leaders of the three winning teams, was a technical milestone, but it also shed light on how machine automation and human expertise might be most efficiently combined in computer security.   In the security industry, the scientists say, there is a lot of talk of ''self-healing systems.'' But the current state of automation, they add, typically applies to one element of security, such as finding software vulnerabilities, monitoring networks or deploying software patches. And automated malware detection, for instance, is often based on large databases of known varieties of malicious code.   For the Darpa test, the attack code was new, created for the event. In the capture-the-flag style contest, the teams played both offense and defense. For the humans, it was hands-off during the competition. The software was on its own to find and exploit flaws in opponents' software, scan networks for incoming assaults and write code to tighten its defenses.   The winners succeeded in integrating different software techniques, in ways not done before, into automated ''cybersecurity systems.'' The contest was conducted in a walled-off computing environment rather than the open internet.   The scientists agree that further development work needs to be done for the technology to be used broadly on commercial networks and the open internet.   ''But this was a demonstration that automated cyberdefense is mature enough, and it's coming,'' said David Melski, captain of the second-place team whose members came from the University of Virginia and a spinoff start-up from Cornell University, GrammaTech, where Mr. Melski heads research.   The first-place team, which won $2 million, was a group from ForAllSecure, a spinoff from Carnegie Mellon University. Hours after the Darpa contest, its cyberreasoning software, called Mayhem, went up against the best human teams at Defcon, an annual hacking competition.   In that three-day contest, Mayhem held its own for two days and proved itself to be extremely strong on defense. But by the third day, the human experts had come up with more innovative exploits than Mayhem, said David Brumley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon and chief executive of ForAllSecure.   Still, the automated system displayed its power, especially in keeping up with the scale of security challenges in the internet-of-things era. ''The number of things automated systems can look at is so vast that it changes the game,'' Mr. Brumley said.   Yan Shoshitaishvili, a Ph.D. candidate who led the third-place team, a group from the University of California, Santa Barbara, is focusing his research on designing ''centaur'' systems that effectively combine machine firepower with human expertise.   Humans are still better than computers at understanding context -- and security is so often defined by context. For example, you do want to broadcast your GPS location data to friends in a social app like Glympse; you do not want a program sending out location data if you're in a battlefield tank.   ''In the real world,'' Mr. Shoshitaishvili said, ''humans can assist these automated systems. That's the path ahead.''     "
Picking a Windows 10 Security Package,"Q. I'm just starting to use a Windows computer again after many years on a Mac. I want to protect myself but the number of options is overwhelming, including antivirus, anti-spyware, anti-spam, anti-malware, personal firewalls, anti-phishing, anti-Trojan and so on. Do I need all this and should I be paying for all this protection or will some of the free programs suffice?  A. All-in-one security suites (which typically sell for $30 and more) promise all-around protection and have their advantages. Depending on how you use the Internet, though, these packages may be overkill. The money you pay in software fees and annual subscriptions does buy relative simplicity once you install the program and let it guard your system on multiple fronts from viruses, spyware, Trojan horse programs (and other malware), remote attacks, dangerous spam and other threats.    However, Windows 10 and other programs you may already be using include many of these security tools -- and they are free. Windows Defender, the built-in malicious software scanner that has replaced Microsoft Security Essentials, can detect most basic threats, even though the program did not score particularly high in recent tests (conducted by the independent AV-Test site) that pitted Windows Defender against third-party programs.   Still, Windows Defender is free, comes with Windows 10 (as does Windows Firewall) and is fairly simple to use. When combined with free programs like Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (which detects Trojan horse programs, spyware and more) and Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit (which shields many popular browsers from web-based attacks), the built-in Windows security programs may be enough. Many mail programs include a junk filter to help trap spam, and services like Microsoft's Outlook.com and Google's Gmail automatically screen for spam and phishing schemes.   Casual surfing to popular sites and established e-commerce outlets should bring you in less contact with malicious software, and surfing while logged into a standard user account (and not the administrator account) is generally much safer. However, if anyone who uses the computer tends to wander deeper into the wilds of the web to file-sharing sites and other invasive malware targets, you may want to shore up your PC's defenses with security software that scores higher in protection and performance tests than Windows Defender. In addition to AV-Test, sites like PCMag.com and TopTenReviews.com also critique and compare multiple programs.

Why Apple Should Unlock an iPhone,"William J. Bratton is the New York City police commissioner and John J. Miller is the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence. THE government and Apple have chosen interesting ground on which to contest the limits of government access to data on mobile devices. The case involves an F.B.I. request for Apple's assistance in opening a phone once carried by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife was responsible for the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 22 wounded. On one level, this should be comfortable space for the government. First, the phone is owned by the County of San Bernardino, which issued it to Mr. Farook, an employee of its health department. The county, as Apple's customer, has no problem having its phone opened. Second, Mr. Farook and his wife were killed in a gun battle with the police early last December. Under the law, dead people have no privacy rights.     But Apple is making a stand because the government wants it to create something against its will: code that would disable a feature that erases all content after 10 failed password attempts. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, has said that if this happens, the floodgates will open to similar law enforcement requests, putting customers' data at risk. And not just in the United States: Apple supporters have raised concerns that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are likely to follow suit.   Mr. Cook's position is hyperbolic, in our view. But beyond the legal case, there is an ethics issue unfolding here.   Until 17 months ago, Apple held the key that could override protections and open phones. Apple used this ''master key'' to comply with court orders in drug, kidnapping, murder and terrorism cases. There was no documented instance of this code getting out to hackers or to the government. So what was the problem Apple was trying to fix when it abruptly announced, in September 2014, that with its new iOS 8, ''Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants''?   Some believe that allegations by Edward J. Snowden of mass surveillance of phone and Internet communications by the National Security Agency stoked fears among Apple's customers that the government was spying on them. Perhaps an iPhone that even Apple couldn't unlock might allay such fears, while also helping sales by offering more privacy and security.   But Mr. Snowden claimed that the N.S.A. was capturing some Americans' Internet traffic from overseas, not that the agency was hacking into smartphones. Moreover, Apple's position on privacy seems at odds with its own strategy of encouraging customers to pay to store personal data on iCloud, which is also vulnerable to hackers.   Apple partisans also argue that the company is trying to protect privacy in places like China, where governments could demand access to phones belonging to dissidents. But Apple could refuse those requests, or have China make them through the State Department, a means of insulating itself from unreasonable demands. That is often how the United States asks for assistance from overseas corporations in investigations.   Apple and privacy advocates have framed this debate as the government wanting to ''create a back door'' into people's devices. But the Constitution protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. And for more than 200 years, the standard has been for law enforcement to obtain a warrant signed by a judge, based on probable cause.   What the government is actually requesting here is that Apple restore a key that was available until late 2014. Complying with constitutionally legal court orders is not ''creating a back door''; in a democracy, that is a front door.   Mr. Cook says Apple's ultimate goal is to provide customers ''safety'' from ''attack.'' But Mr. Cook does not seem to be talking about the kind of attack that took 14 lives in San Bernardino. Presumably, he means attacks from hackers or what he may view as government intrusion -- even when that intrusion is legal.   The phone in the San Bernardino case stopped uploading data to the cloud about six weeks before the killings. That suggests there may be information inside the device that was deliberately concealed. That could include the identities of terrorists who influenced or directed the attack; such information, if pursued, could prevent future plots. Or the iPhone might contain nothing of value. It is Apple's position that we should never know.   The ramifications of this fight extend beyond San Bernardino. Brittany Mills was a 29-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered in Baton Rouge, La. Apple says it can't comply with a search warrant and open her iPhone even though the police believe the identity of the killer is contained in her device.   Ms. Mills was an Apple customer. So were some of the people who died with iPhones in their pockets in the San Bernardino and Paris attacks. How is not solving a murder, or not finding the message that might stop the next terrorist attack, protecting anyone?   Google, which owns the Android system, now indicates that it will follow Apple's lead. For those companies, and others like them, there is a sound argument in not wanting, even indirectly, to become an arm of the government. But when you are the two companies whose operating systems handle more than 90 percent of mobile communications worldwide, you should be accountable for more than just sales.

A Web Crime on the Rise: Hackers Lock Out Users and Demand a Ransom,"It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood thriller, but the all-too-real scenario played out this month at a large Los Angeles hospital: Hackers seized control of critical computer systems and the hospital paid a $17,000 ransom to release them. So-called ransomware attacks have increased significantly in the past year, security experts say, and the hospital, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, is not the first to fall victim.     The Titus Regional Medical Center, a small hospital in Mount Pleasant, Tex., experienced a similar attack last month, which knocked its core electronic medical record system offline. It, too, paid the ransom, according to Shannon Norfleet, a hospital spokeswoman.   Those in the security industry say such attacks are becoming more prevalent, but are rarely made public.   ''We get over 100 calls and emails a month from different organizations that have had some form of ransomware impact their environment,'' said Charles Carmakal, who oversees breach investigations for clients of Mandiant, a consulting unit of the security firm FireEye. ''Nobody talks to the media about it.''   In a statement released Wednesday, Allen Stefanek, the president of Hollywood Presbyterian, described the two-week battle that his hospital fought to regain control of its data after a malware attack was detected on Feb. 5.   The attack did not disrupt medical care or compromise the personal information of employees or patients, he said. Instead, it blocked hospital employees from using email and other forms of electronic communication by using encryption to lock them out of the system.   Mr. Stefanek said hospital administrators were told that if they wanted to gain access to their network again, they would have to pay the attackers, who would then give them the decryption key. Mr. Stefanek said that the hospital had contacted the authorities when the malware attack was first detected.   ''The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,'' Mr. Stefanek said. ''In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.''   Heath care providers are required to tell patients of any breaches that compromise their personal information or health data, but a typical ransomware attack would not fall into that category. The attackers do not need to gain access to the underlying data in order to encrypt it and prevent others from viewing it.   Once compromised, an organization has little choice but to pay up or say farewell to its data, according to Levi Gundert, who oversees information security strategy for Recorded Future, a threat analysis firm.   ''There's really no workarounds for it,'' he said. ''It's very frustrating for both law enforcement and the victims themselves.''   Hollywood Presbyterian's attackers demanded their payment in the   form of 40 Bitcoins, a difficult-to-trace currency that has become the currency of choice for online criminals.   Ransomware attacks are on the rise, industry researchers say, because they work. A research team at Dell gathered data from one ransom-payment server and found that it collected $1.1 million in a six-month period. McAfee Labs, Intel's security research unit, detected 638,000 new ransomware variants in 2014. Last year, that number shot up to nearly 3.8 million.   Many ransomware attacks are random, and comparatively low-tech and blunt. Victims are most often infected by clicking a malicious link in an email or by malware delivered through a web browser, frequently hidden in advertisements. The average payment demanded is just $300, according to the security firm Symantec, a sum that is within reach for the individuals and small businesses that most often fall prey to these schemes.   But Mr. Carmakal said he was seeing a growing number of attackers targeting businesses and other organizations with deeper pockets. In those attacks, the hackers may go to greater lengths to remove data -- not just lock access to it -- and threaten to release it publicly if they are not paid.   ''Automated malware doesn't know if an organization has $100,000 or not. A human knows,'' he said. ''We've seen an uptick in those kinds of attacks over the past year. We've seen attackers ask for $10,000 to seven-figure values to delete the data'' in their possession.   As ransomware attacks grow more frequent, they are increasingly hitting organizations that deal in public safety and other critical functions. Over the past year, the attacks have affected police departments and school districts across the country.   Health care organizations seem to be particularly vulnerable to hacking attacks because they have been slower to embrace sophisticated backup systems and other security measures than other industries, like financial services, said Katherine Keefe, the head of breach response services at Beazley, an insurance company.   Her team investigated 1,200 breaches last year, about half of them at health care providers. The rate of ransomware attacks has noticeably increased in the last six to eight months, she said.   ''The criminals see that there's money to be made, and I think they believe they can hold organizations over a barrel,'' Ms. Keefe said.   The cost of an attack goes far beyond the usually modest sum demanded for ransom. It took Hollywood Presbyterian 10 days to restore its systems, Mr. Stefanek said.   Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Los Angeles, said the agency had begun an inquiry into the attack, but she provided no further details.     "
"Mark Zuckerberg Covers His Laptop Camera. You Should Consider It, Too.","Mark Zuckerberg is one of the most powerful men in the world because billions of people give Facebook, which he founded, free access to their personal data. In return, users receive carefully curated snapshots of his life: baby photos, mundane office tours and the occasional 5K. On Tuesday, observers were reminded that Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, is not just a normal guy who enjoys running and quiet dinners with friends. In a photo posted to his Facebook account, he celebrated the growing user base of Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. An eagle-eyed Twitter user named Chris Olson noticed that in the image's background, his laptop camera and microphone jack appeared to be covered with tape.     Other publications, including Gizmodo, used the tweet to raise the question: Was this paranoia, or just good practice?   3 things about this photo of Zuck:Camera covered with tapeMic jack covered with tapeEmail client is Thunderbird pic.twitter.com/vdQlF7RjQt -- Chris Olson (@topherolson) June 21, 2016   The taped-over camera and microphone jack are usually a signal that someone is concerned, perhaps only vaguely, about hackers' gaining access to his or her devices by using remote-access trojans -- a process called ''ratting.'' (Remote access is not limited to ratters: According to a cache of National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, at least two government-designed programs were devised to take over computer cameras and microphones.)   Security experts supported the taping, for a few good reasons:    The first is that Mr. Zuckerberg is a high-value target.   ''I think Zuckerberg is sensible to take these precautions,'' Graham Cluley, an online security expert and consultant, wrote in an email Wednesday. ''As well as intelligence agencies and conventional online criminals who might be interested in targeting his billions, there are no doubt plenty of mischievous hackers who would find it amusing to spy upon such a high-profile figure.''    The second is that covering photo, video and audio portals has long been a basic and cheap security safeguard.   ''Covering the camera is a very common security measure,'' Lysa Myers, a security researcher at the data security firm ESET, said in an email. ''If you were to walk around a security conference, you would have an easier time counting devices that don't have something over the camera.''    Third, Mr. Zuckerberg is not immune to security breaches.   A recent  hacking of his Twitter and LinkedIn accounts shows that he most likely committed two basic privacy faux pas: He may have used the same password across several websites and did not use two-factor authentication.   Judging from his photo, however, it appears that Mr. Zuckerberg was taking simple precautions to protect himself from anyone who may try to gain remote access. The practice is fairly technologically simple: Hackers trick people into clicking on links or unfamiliar websites containing malware that allows them access to the devices.   Mr. Zuckerberg is not the only high-profile case: James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., also puts tape over his computer's webcam, for surprisingly simple reasons, according to NPR:   ''I saw something in the news, so I copied it,'' Mr. Comey said. ''I put a piece of tape -- I have obviously a laptop, personal laptop -- I put a piece of tape over the camera. Because I saw somebody smarter than I am had a piece of tape over their camera.''   People who are not billionaires or high-ranking government officials are not without risk, said Stephen Cobb, a senior security researcher at ESET.   ''For people who are not C.E.O.s, the threat is people scanning the internet for accessible webcams for a range of motives, from voyeurism to extortion,'' Mr. Cobb wrote in an email.   Experts don't have a good estimate for how often such attacks occur, but according to a 2015 report released by the nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance, the practice is a growing problem for consumers, especially young women. The report also said that trojans account for some 70 percent of all malware.   ''They've been one of the most popular types of malware on every operating system, for quite a long time,'' Ms. Myers, of ESET, said. ''The best ways to protect against them are to update all your software on your machine regularly, and use reputable security software, including anti-malware and a firewall.''     "
Into the Breach,"It was the kind of phone call no chief executive wants to make -- or receive -- in the middle of a multibillion-dollar deal. On Tuesday, Lowell McAdam, the head of Verizon Communications, was on the road. Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, was at work in Silicon Valley. Executives at both companies were moving forward on Verizon's $4.8 billion acquisition of Yahoo's core business.    But Ms. Mayer had some unexpected bad news. She caught up with Mr. McAdam and Marni Walden, a rising star at Verizon who is expected to oversee the Yahoo business after the deal is complete, by phone, according to people briefed on the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Yahoo recently discovered that at least 500 million of its user accounts had been breached by hackers two years ago, well before the two companies began talks. Yahoo and law enforcement officials were scrambling to unwind the intrusion.    After calling Mr. McAdam and Ms. Walden, Ms. Mayer phoned Tim Armstrong, who leads the AOL business at Verizon and will be overseeing the integration with Yahoo, according to the people briefed on the conversation. Again, the news was not good.   The calls set off a flurry of questions at Verizon -- How could this possibly have happened? Who was behind it? Why is it only becoming known now? Could this jeopardize the deal? -- but also the sounding of an alarm and the deployment of a triage team to assist Yahoo.   The telecom giant directed its online security experts, including Chandra McMahon, Verizon's chief information security officer, to do their own investigation of the hack. And they enlisted the help of Verizon's security division, part of its enterprise solutions business, which helps companies defend against and manage hacks.   Now, just a few days after Verizon learned of the breach, it is contending with the ramifications of what is believed to be the largest hack of a single company. Even as Verizon tries to assess the damage at Yahoo and prevent further security intrusions, the scope of the hack and the potential fallout -- including the possibility of a costly class-action lawsuit -- are inevitably prompting renewed scrutiny of a deal that was intended to transform the telecom behemoth into a digital media powerhouse.   For now, Verizon has given no indication of whether the breach will affect its plans to acquire Yahoo. On Friday, the company declined to provide a comment beyond a statement it issued on Thursday, in which it said it would evaluate the situation ''as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities.''   Yahoo declined to provide further comment on Friday.   The effort is complicated because the sales proceedings between Verizon and Yahoo are at an early stage. Though teams from the two companies were already working together on integration plans, Verizon does not yet own Yahoo. As a result, Verizon does not have direct access to the Silicon Valley company's servers to conduct its own investigation.   In late July, after the Verizon deal was announced, Yahoo became aware of a claim that about 280 million of its user credentials had been hacked, according to a person briefed on the specifics, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Yahoo started an investigation but could not substantiate the claim, this person said. It was not clear on Friday whether Yahoo had made Verizon aware that it was looking into this claim in July.   During the course of that investigation, Yahoo learned of the more severe breach, which it has said it believes was state-sponsored. Yahoo has not yet said exactly when it realized how large the intrusion was, leaving open the question of whether Ms. Mayer and her team waited to notify Verizon of the hack. Yahoo is now working with outside security consultants and said its investigation was continuing.   Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School, said Verizon had two main options if it decided to use the hack as leverage in setting the terms of the deal.   ''They could say, 'This thing is huge. We want to walk away from the transaction,''' he said. Were Verizon to try to claim that the breach was so severe it was grounds to terminate the deal, it would have to prove that the hack amounted to a material adverse effect on the value of Yahoo.   Such claims can be difficult to prove in court. According to Mr. Quinn's reading of the merger document for the deal, Verizon would most likely have to prove that certain high-level Yahoo employees were aware of the severity of the hack before the deal was agreed upon, and intentionally withheld that information.   In the merger agreement, Yahoo states that ''there have not been any incidents of, or third-party claims alleging'' security breaches or thefts of user data that might result in a major change to the value of the company.   More likely, Mr. Quinn said, Verizon could pressure Yahoo to renegotiate the terms of the deal.   ''They go to court, or threaten to go to court, and renegotiate the price,'' he said. ''That can be a very winning strategy.''   Like any big company contemplating an acquisition, Verizon performed due diligence on Yahoo before it agreed to the deal. It was not immediately clear, however, how seriously it took security issues during that process.   But Verizon would have known that Yahoo has a history of breaches. In 2012, Yahoo said that more than 450,000 user accounts had been hacked.   Such issues are increasingly pertinent to mergers and acquisitions. In a 2014 report, lawyers from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer wrote that corporate buyers were still not taking security due diligence seriously enough.   ''With this concerted action and a series of high-profile strikes on businesses including eBay, Target and Yahoo, the risks of cyberattack are evident,'' they wrote.   ''Yet as the global economy recovers and deal activity rises,'' the report continues, ''increasing awareness of cyber-risk has not resulted in meaningful changes'' to the mergers and acquisition process.   Verizon is purchasing Yahoo in the hope that the internet portal will make it a major player in the digital media business, positioning the company to compete with Google and Facebook for ad dollars. The biggest wireless carrier in the United States, with roots going back to the first telephone call in history, Verizon is facing declining revenue and is looking to Silicon Valley for growth.   Those motivations are unlikely to have changed in the course of two months. But it remains unclear whether this new information has made Yahoo a less desirable acquisition target.   Some of Verizon's executives have indicated they may be up to the challenge of a big hack. In a recent talk at Penn State University, Ms. McMahon, the telecom company's chief information security officer, suggested that she relished the cat-and-mouse game between hackers and companies.   ''I love security,''  she said. ''I love the offense and the defense of it. The bad guys are innovating just as much as the good guys in terms of their defense. Our job as defenders is to see all that.''     "
Cryptography Pioneers Win Turing Award,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In 1970, a Stanford artificial intelligence researcher named John McCarthy returned from a conference in Bordeaux, France, where he had presented a paper on the possibility of a ''Home Information Terminal.'' He predicted the terminal would be connected via the telephone network to a shared computer, which in turn would store files that would contain all books, magazines, newspapers, catalogs, airline schedules, public information and personal files.    Whitfield Diffie, then a young programmer at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, read Mr. McCarthy's paper and began to think about the question of what would take the place of an individual signature in a paperless world. Mr. Diffie would spend the next several years pursuing that challenge and in 1976, with Martin E. Hellman, an electrical engineer at Stanford, invented ''public-key cryptography,'' a technique that would two decades later make possible the commercial World Wide Web.    On Tuesday, the Association for Computing Machinery announced that the two men have won this year's Turing Award. The award is frequently described as the Nobel Prize for the computing world and since 2014, it has included a $1 million cash award, after Google quadrupled its size.   This year, it was announced during the RSA Conference, a security technology symposium held here this week.   Named for Alan Turing, the British mathematician and computer scientist, the award is particularly noteworthy because it comes at a time that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is locked in a bitter feud with Apple over the agency's inability to unlock the cryptographic system that protects digital information stored in the company's iPhones.   While private information can be protected with a so-called ''symmetric'' key, or a single digital code, that is used to mathematically scramble the data, the problem becomes much more difficult when two parties who have not met physically wish to have a secret interaction.   The privacy protection technology that is now used extensively to protect modern electronic communications is based on Mr. Diffie's and Mr. Hellman's original research that led to the creation of ''public-key cryptography'' technology.   Public-key cryptography is a method for scrambling data in which each party has a pair of keys, one which can be publicly shared and the other which is known only to the intended recipient of a message. It is possible for anyone to encrypt a message using the individual's public key. However, the message can only be unscrambled with the aid of the private key held securely by the recipient of the message.   In the United States and elsewhere, cryptography was once a highly classified military and intelligence agency technology. But in the 1970s academic researchers began delving into the field, which led to clashes with law enforcement and spy agencies.   In 2013, documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor, revealed widespread government surveillance of Internet traffic, leading companies like Apple and Google to modify the security in their products and to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I.   Mr. Diffie and Mr. Hellman have long been political activists. Mr. Hellman has focused on the threat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity, and he said in an interview he would use his share of the prize money to pursue work related to the nuclear threat. He said he also planned to write a new book with his wife on peace and sustainability.   Mr. Diffie, who has spent his career working on computer security at telecommunications firms and at the Silicon Valley pioneer Sun Microsystems, has been an outspoken advocate for the protection of personal privacy in the digital age.   He said in an interview that he plans to do more to document the history of the field he helped to create. ''This will free me to spend more of my time on cryptographic history, which is urgent because the people are quickly dying off,'' Mr. Diffie said.     "
"If Mark Zuckerberg Can Be a Hacking Victim, So Can You","There are several lessons to be learned from a data breach in which hackers gained access to Mark Zuckerberg's social media accounts, but chief among them is probably this: Quit using the same password for multiple websites. It may be annoying and time-consuming, but following this simple rule can help you avoid the public pwning, or account takeover, that befell Mr. Zuckerberg, the billionaire owner of Facebook and Instagram.     A collective that calls itself OurMine boasted that it had broken into a handful of his social media accounts, including LinkedIn, Twitter and Pinterest. Screengrabs posted by Engadget showed the hackers notifying Mr. Zuckerberg of the breach using his own Twitter account. Bold move.   ''We are just testing your security,'' the tweet read.   In a statement released on Monday, LinkedIn said that it had found and removed a fake profile that had been created of Mr. Zuckerberg.   ''We were alerted of this takeover attempt and have taken action to remove the false profile on LinkedIn,'' the statement read.   The company declined to address whether the hack was the result of a larger data breach in 2012 that compromised over 100 million accounts. LinkedIn has taken steps to invalidate passwords from older accounts, but the breach against Mr. Zuckerberg shows that some accounts, especially those that are old or dormant, remain at risk.   In a statement emailed by a spokesman on Monday, Facebook said that Mr. Zuckerberg's Facebook and Instagram accounts had not been breached.   ''No Facebook systems or accounts were accessed. The affected accounts have been re-secured using best practices,'' the statement read.   (Facebook's security systems are now designed to thwart suspicious logins, but Mr. Zuckerberg's account has not always been immune to breaches: In 2013, a blogger hacked the executive's page to exploit what he said was a security flaw on the social network.)   OK. Now I'm paying attention. Is my account safe?   You should check to see if your email account has been compromised. The website Have I Been Pwned? provides a useful service: Plug in your email address, and the website will reveal if your data has been leaked or manipulated by hackers.   All right, I checked. Now what?   If your account has been compromised, change your password. And we'll say it again: Using the same password for multiple accounts is a cardinal sin in the security world, so make sure you mix it up, even with accounts you rarely use.   Graham Cluley, an online security expert and consultant, said that using the same passwords was a likely reason for the Zuckerberg hack. (According to the website The Hacker News, OurMine tweeted that Mr. Zuckerberg's password was ''dadada,'' and was used across multiple accounts. OurMine's Twitter account has since been suspended.)   ''It shows it can happen to anyone -- even geeks,'' Mr. Cluley said. ''The problem is that even if you have adopted sensible password practices now, your past mistakes may come back to haunt you.''   Is there anything else I can do?   Mr. Cluley suggested obtaining a password manager, like LastPass, to keep track of your login information. He also said that wherever possible, you should enroll in two-step verification, which sends an authorization code to the user's phone before the account can be opened. Most social platforms vulnerable to hacking, including LinkedIn, Twitter and Gmail offer it.   Troy Hunt, an online security expert and the creator of Have I Been Pwned?, reiterated that a password manager was the most reliable way to stay safe.   ''Without this, we risk exposing sensitive data in a way that it can put other accounts at risk, particularly via a data breach of one site, which is becoming an alarmingly common occurrence,'' he said.   In a statement to its users on Monday, LinkedIn echoed the suggested tactics: ''All members should take care to manage and change passwords across other sites, avoid reuse, leverage advanced security features, and update often.''     "
A 10-Digit Key Code to Your Private Life: Your Cellphone Number,"The next time someone asks you for your cellphone number, you may want to think twice about giving it. The cellphone number is more than just a bunch of digits. It is increasingly used as a link to private information maintained by all sorts of companies, including money lenders and social networks. It can be used to monitor and predict what you buy, look for online or even watch on television. It has become ""kind of a key into the room of your life and information about you,"" said Edward M. Stroz, a former high-tech crime agent for the F.B.I. who is co-president of Stroz Friedberg, a private investigator. Yet the cellphone number is not a legally regulated piece of information like a Social Security number, which companies are required to keep private. And we are told to hide and protect our Social Security numbers while most of us don't hesitate when asked to write a cellphone number on a form or share it with someone we barely know.  That is a growing issue for young people, since two sets of digits may well be with them for life: their Social Security number and their cellphone number. Nearly half of all American households have given up their landlines and have only wireless phone service - a figure that has risen more than 10 percentage points in just three years. Among people ages 25 to 29, the share of homes that have only wireless phone service stands at 73 percent, according to government statistics. Taylor Gallanter, a 23-year-old hair stylist in San Francisco, has had her cellphone number since she was 15. She has never had a landline and doubts she ever will. She knows how valuable her cellphone number is. She does not provide it on online forms unless it is required. Using her email address as contact information, she said, seems less invasive and risky. ""With just your cellphone number and name, I know they can get all sorts of information about you,"" Ms. Gallanter said. In fact, investigators find that a cellphone number is often even more useful than a Social Security number because it is tied to so many databases and is connected to a device you almost always have with you, said Austin Berglas, a former F.B.I. agent who is senior managing director of K2 Intelligence, a private investigator. ""The point is the cellphone number can be a gateway to all sorts of other information,"" said Robert Schoshinski, the assistant director for privacy and identity protection at the Federal Trade Commission. ""People should think about it."" The use of the cellphone number in new, unanticipated ways has echoes in the history of the Social Security number, which was created in 1936. Its original purpose was to enable the nation's nascent social insurance system to maintain accurate records of workers covered under the program. It was never meant as a general-purpose identification number. Gradually, the simplicity of using a unique number to identify people encouraged the widespread use by other government agencies and corporations. That took off starting in the 1960s, when mainframe computers made it possible to create huge digital files on citizens and customers. The spread of the Social Security number as a quick and easy identifier, found in all kinds of corporate and government databases, has smoothed the way for commerce. But there have been unintended consequences. ""That Social Security numbers are so broadly used and often so poorly protected is a major cause of the current epidemic of identity theft,"" said Alessandro Acquisti, a computer scientist and privacy expert at Carnegie Mellon University. The total losses in the United States from stolen identities used in crimes like credit card and loan fraud were $15 billion last year, Javelin, a research and consulting firm, estimated. And 11 percent of American adults say they lost money last year in a telephone swindle, according to a Harris Poll survey sponsored by Truecaller, a Swedish maker of a cellphone app with features like caller ID and spam blocking. But if a cellphone number and the intimate computer behind it open a door to new risks, technology, as is so often the case, can also be employed to combat those risks. Take fraud prevention. When shoppers use Affirm, a start-up that offers an alternative to credit cards for online purchases, the company's software mines many data sources and approves or rejects a loan within a minute or so. To perform that feat of technical wizardry, Affirm asks borrowers for a few pieces of personal information, including their names and dates of birth. But the strongest identifier and conduit to useful information is the cellphone number, which acts like ""the digital equivalent of the Social Security number,"" said Max Levchin, chief executive of Affirm. When a customer of Affirm wants to get an installment loan to buy, say, an $850 mattress or a $3,000 mountain bike, the company sends the person a temporary personal identification number in a text message. The same form of authentication is widely used by banks, payment systems like PayPal and other companies before certain transactions are approved. The temporary ID numbers typically remain valid for only 30 seconds to 180 seconds, increasing the odds that the person trying to borrow or buy is indeed the same person who owns the phone with that number. It's not foolproof, but if a cellphone is lost or stolen, it is typically locked. It can be hacked into, but that takes a separate set of skills. By contrast, a stolen Social Security number is a permanent pathway to identity theft. ""What you can do with the cellphone number and mobile technology represents a pretty substantial advantage in the ongoing war against fraud and identity theft,"" said Rajeev Date, a venture investor and former banker, who was previously deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But a cellphone-only life presents problems for many independent professionals and workers at start-ups and small businesses, who make business calls on their personal cellphones. So Ms. Gallanter, a partner in a mobile barbershop in a van, became one of the five million people who have installed the new app Sideline this year to add a second number to their cellphones. The service is free for individuals and $10 a month a number for groups of workers in a business, who get extra features like a company directory and voice mail transcription. One of Sideline's ad mottos is: ""Keep your personal number private. Add a second number to your smartphone."" ""This gives you a second mobile identity, which more and more people need today,"" said Greg Woock, chief executive of Pinger, a start-up in San Jose, Calif., that created the Sideline software and service.

Student Question | What Is Your Reaction to Apple's Decision to Fight a Court Order to Unlock the iPhone Used by San Bernardino Gunman Syed Rizwan Farook?,"Last week, a judge in California ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the assault in San Bernardino that killed 14 people in December. The following day, Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, responded with a letter to Apple customers, warning of the ""chilling"" breach of privacy posed by the government's demands.  These events captured the attention of many, including members of our new Student Council members Rhea and Duncan, who ask, Does Syed Rizwan Farook have less of a right to privacy because of his crimes, and does Apple have the right to deny the F.B.I. and the U.S. government of the information needed to crack the encryption?  In ""In the Government vs. Apple, Who Wears the Black Hat?"" Robert Levine writes:  The dispute between the Justice Department and Apple over access to the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the gunmen in the San Bernardino massacre, comes down to this question: Shouldn't the government have more legal and moral authority to weigh complicated issues of privacy and national security than a company that makes phones? It should. After all, nobody ever elected Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, to public office. The legal case seems clear enough: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a warrant, Mr. Farook is dead, and his iPhone, which he used for work, is the property of San Bernardino County, which consented to having it searched. The data on the phone could yield valuable intelligence, making its content a legitimate matter of national security. Apple had obeyed a demand to provide the government with the information in Mr. Farook's iCloud account. But then it was asked to undermine the phone's security system so the F.B.I. could try as many passcodes as possible to open the phone without erasing the stored data. Apple refused. On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion saying that Apple's objections had little to do with security but appeared ""to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy."" The government, not Apple, should guarantee our privacy rights. But this dispute has arisen precisely because the government hasn't done so. Instead, it squandered much of its legal and moral authority when the National Security Agency engaged in widespread surveillance of American citizens for so long. Some N.S.A. abuses targeted Silicon Valley directly. ...In Apple's public response, the company said it was fighting the F.B.I.'s demands not because it objected to the government unlocking Mr. Farook's phone but because the government could then ask Apple to undermine the security of other iPhones and because such software could potentially help criminals and repressive governments hack iPhones. By analogy, the company doesn't have a key to the phone so the government is asking it to make the lock weaker. Apple is being asked to undermine not only the security of its products but also potentially its corporate reputation and even its business. The company is especially concerned that a victory for the government would set an informal precedent for other countries to demand that Apple unlock encrypted data. It's hard to have any sympathy for Mr. Farook, but the line between terrorism and criticism of the government can be far fuzzier in other countries, like China, where Apple sold tens of millions of iPhones in the last quarter of 2015. Apple's phones are also sold in Pakistan, where homosexual acts can send people to prison, and in Saudi Arabia, where adultery is punishable by lashing or stoning and apostasy punishable by death. The United States government may have a reasonable case when it comes to Mr. Farook, but a victory here would open a Pandora's box that can't be closed in the United States or anywhere in the world. Cracking the phone open also may not help as much as we think: Would-be terrorists can use encrypted communication services that operate in other jurisdictions. In ""Why Apple Is Right to Challenge an Order to Help the F.B.I.,"" the Editorial Board of The New York Times writes: Law enforcement agencies have a legitimate need for evidence, which is all the more pressing in terrorism cases. But the Constitution and the nation's laws limit how investigators and prosecutors can collect evidence. In a 1977 case involving the New York Telephone Company, the Supreme Court said the government could not compel a third party that is not involved in a crime to assist law enforcement if doing so would place ""unreasonable burdens"" on it. Judge Pym's order requiring Apple to create software to subvert the security features of an iPhone places just such a burden on the company. Apple has already given the F.B.I. data from the phone that was backed up and stored on its iCloud service; the last backup was made about a month before the attacks. But the company's chief executive, Timothy Cook, has said that requiring it to create software to bypass a feature that causes the phone to erase its data if 10 incorrect passwords are entered would set a dangerous precedent and could undermine the security of its devices. The Department of Justice has argued that the software would be used on that phone only and notes that Apple has previously helped law enforcement unlock phones. The company changed how it encrypts phones after the surveillance revelations by Edward Snowden. But writing new code would have an effect beyond unlocking one phone. If Apple is required to help the F.B.I. in this case, courts could require it to use this software in future investigations or order it to create new software to fit new needs. It is also theoretically possible that hackers could steal the software from the company's servers.  Students: Read both op-ed pieces, then tell us ... - What is your opinion about the situation? Do you think Apple should be willing to let the F.B.I. unlock the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook? - Do you think that doing so would jeopardize the security of other iPhone users? Why or why not?  - What do you think about the Justice Department's countering the Apple's decision based on ""its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy""? - Have your opinions about Apple, prviacy and national security changed since this news story began to develop last week? If so, how? Students 13 and older are invited to comment below.

"Former Officer Is Jailed Months Without Charges, Over Encrypted Drives","A former police sergeant has been held without charges in a federal detention cell in Philadelphia, part of an effort by the authorities to pressure him to decrypt two computer hard drives believed to contain child pornography. The case reveals yet another battle line for law enforcement and digital privacy advocates over encryption, this time on an Apple computer, not an iPhone.    The sergeant, Francis Rawls, was ordered by a federal court last August to hand over the two hard drives, which were seized from his home because they were suspected to contain the illegal pornography.    Mr. Rawls was shown to a private room at the district attorney's office to comply with the order. Once there, according to a court document, he spent most of the time staring at the computer and then said he could not remember the passwords to turn off FileVault, a feature of Macs that encrypts hard drives when a user logs out. He was taken into custody, and this week he started his eighth month in a federal detention center, all without ever being charged with a crime.   Mr. Rawls's case is the latest in a growing number of legal battles over digital privacy in the United States. The challenges are playing out in courts across the country, propelling a national debate over when the government can compel individuals or companies to disclose codes or passwords giving access to private data.   ''Not only is he presently being held without charges, but he has never in his life been charged with a crime,'' Keith M. Donoghue, his federal public defender, wrote in a motion last week seeking his client's release.   In two high-profile cases recently, the Justice Department tried to force Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a gunman who was behind the massacre in San Bernardino, Calif., and an iPhone used by a Brooklyn drug dealer. The department later backed off after it accessed data on the phones without the company's help.   Mark Rumold, a senior lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that focuses on defending civil liberties in digital issues, said the increased focus on privacy rights was spurred in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden's revelations about government surveillance, which led to the pursuit of more advanced encryption technologies to counter that surveillance.   ''It is a combination of a growing awareness and increased use of technologies that are privacy protected,'' Mr. Rumold said. ''I do not think it is a stretch to say these types of issues are affecting people all over the country in everyday life.''   Encryption goes further than a simple login password, by scrambling data in a way that requires a password key to descramble it. It is used most commonly to protect consumers from online fraud or to keep bank accounts secure.   Law enforcement agencies have typically made encryption an issue in high-profile cases involving terrorism or child pornography. In March, President Obama said the United States had already accepted that law enforcement can ''rifle through your underwear'' in the search for suspected predators, so there was no reason to treat a person's digital information differently.   If the government has no way into a smartphone, he added, ''then everyone is walking around with a Swiss bank account in your pocket.''   Many of the cases involving court-ordered access to personal devices include arguments centering on an individual's right under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, and about whether they can be compelled to reveal passwords or decrypt those devices.   In the Philadelphia case, for example, the officer was told to type in the passwords in a private room in the district attorney's office, rather than to simply tell the password, which could be construed as testifying against himself.   Suspects may be on shakier constitutional grounds when it comes to biometric data like fingerprints.   In another recent case, the authorities in California obtained a search warrant in February compelling the girlfriend of a suspected member of an Armenian gang to press her finger against an iPhone that had been seized from a Glendale home. The phone was protected by Apple's fingerprint identification system, and prosecutors wanted access to the phone data, according to a Los Angeles Times report.   In some cases, courts have said that ordering suspects to decrypt their own devices for investigators violated their rights, such as in the 2013 case of a Massachusetts forgery suspect. But when the case later made its way to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, that decision was reversed.   In his motion to a federal court of appeals last week, Mr. Donoghue, the Philadelphia public defender, said his client, whom he referred to as John Doe, had come under scrutiny during a Delaware County investigation into a public network called Freenet, where users communicate and share files in a secure environment.   The two hard drives and other devices, including an Apple Mac Pro computer, were seized from Mr. Rawls's home on March 30, 2015. After he did not decrypt the hard drives, he was ordered in September to be ''incarcerated indefinitely'' until he complied with the order, not to ''punish him,'' but to ''coerce future compliance,'' prosecution documents said.   He was taken into custody by United States marshals. The Philadelphia Police Department said in October that Mr. Rawls, who had been on the force for 17 years, would be suspended and then dismissed for ''conduct unbecoming'' an officer.   Last week, Mr. Donoghue said in his motion to the court that the detention was causing ''irreparable injury'' to a man who had not been charged with any crime and who was exercising his right not to provide evidence that might be used against him.   ''We are hopeful the appeal will result in our client's prompt release from the custody that was ordered after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination,'' Mr. Donoghue said in an emailed reply to questions.   Parts of the court documents that would explain the reasons for Mr. Rawls's detention and the court order are still under seal. Government prosecutors have until May 16 to reply.     "
Unusual Pairing Makes Public Bet vs. Pacemakers,"The cybersecurity firm behind a short-seller's campaign against St. Jude Medical, a major manufacturer of pacemakers, has a curious operating history. The firm, MedSec, says it has been around 18 months. But it was incorporated in the United States in Delaware just last month. Justine Bone, its chief executive, came on board two months ago.    And MedSec's headquarters shares the same address as a virtual office in Miami that provides space to a number of companies.   The start-up is at the center of an unusual story line that brings together a Wall Street short-seller and the mysterious world of computer hacking.    Three weeks ago, Carson Block, an investor known for betting against, or shorting, companies' stocks, announced that he and MedSec had uncovered ''troubling cybersecurity flaws'' in St. Jude's pacemakers. Those flaws, he claimed, made them vulnerable to hackers and posed a potential health hazard. The situations put forward by Mr. Block were more akin to an international spy thriller than his usual forensic examination of a company's accounting.   Mr. Block went public about three months after he received a call from Robert Bryan, a former hedge fund manager who helped raise money for MedSec, asking him to breakfast. Mr. Bryan proposed that MedSec and Mr. Block's Muddy Waters hedge fund join forces to expose a potential security vulnerability that Mr. Bryan said MedSec had discovered in St. Jude's pacemakers.   The firms agreed to share in the windfall of any decline in St. Jude's stock.   ''I have a very jaundiced view of how companies treat cybersecurity,'' Mr. Block said in an interview on Thursday. ''This is why this issue spoke to me so much.''   Short-sellers stake bets against stocks and profit when the share price falls. They often find themselves taking the heat for protesting loudly about the company they have waged a financial bet against. St. Jude has itself accused Muddy Waters, which manages about $100 million, of publishing a misleading report for its own financial gain. The company's share price fell about 5 percent on Aug. 25 after Muddy Waters released MedSec's research.   Muddy Waters' partnership with MedSec is unorthodox. The cybersecurity firm counts Mr. Bryan, a former Goldman Sachs analyst, as one of its directors. Mr. Block and Mr. Bryan first met when Mr. Bryan was running a now-defunct hedge fund in New York called Metaval Capital.   MedSec has portrayed itself as a company that researches vulnerabilities in medical devices as a public service and considers itself among a group of hackers that engage in bounty hunting for bugs in networks and software programs. But unlike many of these hackers, who typically confront the company with their findings and seek compensation, MedSec chose not to go to the company.   Ms. Bone, MedSec's chief, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Aug. 25, that MedSec did not go to St. Jude with its findings because they were ''worried that they would sweep this under the rug.''   MedSec says that St. Jude's pacemakers and defibrillators have security flaws including a lack of encryption and an opening that allows unauthorized devices to intercept communication between the implanted device and its home monitor.   But St. Jude has said the findings are in error. On Wednesday, the company filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Minnesota accusing MedSec and Mr. Block of making false statements and conspiring to manipulate its shares.   In the lawsuit, St. Jude noted that a group of researchers at the University of Michigan had reproduced MedSec's experiment and ''came to strikingly different conclusions'' and said the problems uncovered were overblown.   St. Jude, like many medical device manufacturers, has had a history of problems with some of its products -- some with deadly results. In 2012, the company had to make changes to some of its heart defibrillators because of problems with wires that protruded from their casings that had led to a number of deaths.   The recent questions about the security of St. Jude's pacemakers comes as the company is being acquired by Abbott Laboratories in a stock and cash deal valued at $25 billion. Abbott has said it plans to continue pursuing the deal, which was announced on April 28, shortly before Mr. Block met with Mr. Bryan to discuss teaming up.   Mr. Block, in an interview, said the timing of the meeting was a coincidence and that MedSec had broadly looked at whether other pacemaker manufacturers were vulnerable to similar attacks and found problems only at St. Jude.   ''I don't think you can conclude that they came together to short St. Jude,'' Mr. Block said of MedSec.   In an emailed response, Mr. Bryan described himself as a minority investor in MedSec and said the company ''raised seed capital far before contacting Carson.'' He added that ''it's implausible that we'd develop an entire study a year ago on the hope a short-seller would take the case and not speak to any of them.''   He said the company was incorporated in St. Kitts and Nevis, a Caribbean nation, last year and incorporated in Delaware so it could ''receive compensation'' from Mr. Block's fund. Mr. Bryan said the firm has a long-term ''sublease and physical office space'' and ''recently we signed up a few clients including a hospital in Texas.'' He declined to disclose any names.   A number of hedge funds, which had placed bets on the likelihood of the Abbott deal closing, lost money when shares of St. Jude fell last month, erasing more than $1 billion in market value. Some of them, as well as other investors in St. Judge, have discussed filing a lawsuit against Muddy Waters and MedSec, and brought in lawyers at a prominent Wall Street law firm as counsel, according to people briefed on the discussions.   MedSec's board and staff is an unusual mix, including a former congressman, university professors and people from the world of hacking. Mr. Block has arranged for his public relations firm to handle media for MedSec.   A doctor who is on the company's board and issued a letter vouching for the firm's results also has an equity stake in MedSec.   The firm sought to add some gravitas to its ranks with the hiring of Ms. Bone, who previously held top network security jobs at Bloomberg and Dow Jones. A former ballet dancer in New Zealand, Ms. Bone also is the former chief executive of Immunity, a company that specializes in cybersecurity threat assessment, and she has been a featured speaker a major hacker community conferences.   Immunity emerged last year in a document dump by WikiLeaks of emails with companies that had business discussions with Hacking Team, an Italian company that has come under scrutiny for selling digital spy tools to governments with records of human rights abuses.   MedSec and Muddy Waters have given varying accounts of the urgency of their discovery. In her television interview, Ms. Bone said the company saw ''no evidence of an immediate threat.''   In their report, however, MedSec and Muddy Waters quote Hemal Nayak, a cardio-electrophysiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine, who recommended that his patients unplug their St. Jude devices and said he would not implant any new pacemakers until the security problems were addressed.   Dr. Nayak, who could not be reached for comment, also serves as a medical adviser and board member at MedSec and has an equity stake in the firm. He has acknowledged not being an ''expert in cybersecurity'' but said he ''witnessed, firsthand, the experiments MedSec has conducted.'' Mr. Nayak was given an equity interest in firm ''prior to MedSec reaching its conclusions,'' according to a footnote in the research report.   A spokeswoman for the University of Chicago Medicine said: ''The work Dr. Nayak conducted with MedSec/Muddy Waters was done on his own time and not in his capacity as a faculty member or physician at the University of Chicago Medical Center.''   The same day that Mr. Block and MedSec went public with their findings, they sent a copy of the research to the federal Food and Drug Administration.   Angela Stark, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said in an emailed statement the agency ''is aware of the allegations and concerns raised in MedSec's public report'' and is investigating them.   She added that the agency said patients with St. Jude pacemakers should continue to use them.     "
Europe's Privacy Watchdogs Dissatisfied With U.S. Data-Transfer Deal,"Only two months after the European Union's top policy makers agreed to a hard-won data-sharing pact with United States officials, the bloc's national privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the deal did not go far enough to safeguard the personal information of Internet users in Europe. The agreement, the so-called E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which would allow companies to continue sending personal data back and forth across the Atlantic, is still widely expected to be ratified by early summer. But by sounding the alarm over the current deal, national privacy watchdogs from France, Germany and other European Union member states have served notice that American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon could face protracted country-by-country legal battles.     The regulators say they worry that companies could misuse data, including information from search engine queries and social media posts. They also say they fear that American law enforcement and intelligence agencies might gain access to European citizens' personal information without sufficient safeguards in place.   ''From the outside, it must look like Europe can't speak with one voice on privacy,'' said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels. ''This is becoming kind of a circus.''   The stance taken by the regulators -- which have the power to investigate and, in some cases, to fine companies that have broken privacy rules in the region -- represents a major setback for European and United States negotiators who had spent years hammering out the deal.   And the protest from the regulators signals that they could open cases and levy fines on companies that rely on moving data such as employees' financial information or social media posts across the Atlantic.   As part of their announcement on Wednesday, European national privacy regulators said the data-transfer agreement was an improvement on previous rules. But they added that they remained concerned over American intelligence agencies' seemingly indiscriminate access to citizens' personal data when it is transferred to the United States.   That access, according to the privacy watchdogs, is not subject to protections that match those currently offered in Europe. The regulators also said that new legal mechanisms to allow Europeans to monitor how their data is used in the United States needed to be strengthened.   ''We believe there's still work to do,'' Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France's data protection chief, who also heads a Pan-European privacy regulator, said on Wednesday. ''We need to ensure that protections of the Privacy Shield are indeed essentially equivalent to what is available in Europe.''   Ms. Falque-Pierrotin called on the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that negotiated the data-transfer pact, to make further changes to the deal to meet the regulators' concerns.   Those included fears that the indiscriminate bulk collection of Europeans' data by United States and European intelligence agencies failed to comply with the region's data protection rules. The privacy agencies also said the independence of a United States ombudsman reviewing European data protection complaints had to be strengthened.   Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Wednesday that she would try to incorporate the regulators' views into the final Privacy Shield pact, though she did not say which of the proposals would be included.   But Ms. Jourova also emphasized that attention should now turn to getting European countries' approval for the data-transfer agreement by next month.   ''I count on data protection authorities to help ensure that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield works well in practice,'' she said.   European privacy campaigners, including Max Schrems, an Austrian law student whose case against Facebook led the region's highest court to invalidate the previous trans-Atlantic data-sharing agreement, the so-called Safe Harbor pact, have called for greater restrictions on how companies and United States agencies gain access to users' digital information.   Some are also preparing legal challenges to the Privacy Shield deal, saying that it failed to uphold Europe's tough privacy rules, which are viewed as being on a par with other fundamental rights, like freedom of expression.   American officials contend that new oversight mechanisms -- including an ombudsman in the State Department to handle European data queries -- sufficiently protect privacy. They also say that American safeguards over how national intelligence agencies gain access to personal data go beyond what is available in many countries in the European Union.   ''The U.S. has a different structure than Europe, but both systems offer robust privacy protection,'' Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary who led the American team in negotiating to revamp the data-transfer agreement, said in a recent interview.   Despite Europe's national regulators raising concerns over Privacy Shield, legal experts and policy makers still expect the agreement to be approved by European countries by early summer.   That is because the European Commission has the sole power to agree to the new rules, and because some countries, particularly the likes of Britain and Ireland, where many American technology companies have headquarters, have given their support to the trans-Atlantic deal.   It remains unclear how the European Commission will alter Privacy Shield to answer national regulators' concerns, though it is unlikely that European officials will reopen negotiations with their American counterparts.   But Europe's privacy regulators -- which will soon gain the right to fine companies up to 4 percent of their global revenue if they are found to have broken local data protection laws -- may still not be satisfied with any changes to the data-transfer agreement, increasing uncertainty over how some of the world's largest companies will handle digital information.   ''No national regulator wants to put companies in a legal limbo,'' said Alexander Whalen, a senior policy manager at Digital Europe, an industry body whose members include Google and Microsoft. ''We're now in a waiting game.''     "
"Hack of Quest Diagnostics App Exposes Data of 34,000 Patients","A medical laboratory company based in New Jersey said Monday that it was investigating a recent hack that exposed the personal health information of about 34,000 people.  An ""unauthorized third party"" gained access to names, dates of birth, lab results and, in some cases, telephone numbers on Nov. 26 through a mobile health app that gives patients access to lab results and other information, according to the company, Quest Diagnostics, which is based in Madison, N.J. The stolen data did not include Social Security or credit card numbers or any other insurance or financial information. All the people affected have been notified, the company said. It also said there was no indication that any of the information had been misused. The company did not say whether the hack affected individuals in any particular region of the country. The company has locations throughout the United States. Quest said it had taken immediate steps to address the vulnerability in its app, which is called MyQuest by Care360, and had reported the intrusion to law enforcement. The company said that an investigation was continuing and that it was working with a cybersecurity business to prevent similar hacks. Quest did not immediately respond to a phone message and email requesting further comment.  "
Apple Battle Bares Fissure in U.S. Policy,"WASHINGTON --  The intensifying legal battle over encryption between Apple and the Justice Department has all but obscured another more subtle division, the one inside the Obama administration itself. Driven by competing and sometimes clashing interests about privacy, national security and the economy, some of the president's most senior aides are staking out a variety of positions on the issue.    The White House denies there is disagreement over the effort to force Apple to break into the phone used by one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings, but the differences on how to deal with the broader questions raised by encryption have become increasingly apparent.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants the ability to break into smartphones and computers for investigations. The Pentagon and intelligence officials worry that the same techniques could be used by foreign powers or hackers to drain data from phones used by the United States government, and that countries like China will demand the same access provided to American law enforcement officials.    The conflicting positions were on display last week. On Tuesday, James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., testified in Congress about the need for some kind of government action -- he avoided the word ''legislation'' because the White House has specifically said it is not seeking that now -- that would guarantee access to law enforcement, no matter how encryption technology evolves.   Less than a day later, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, talking to technologists at an annual computer security conference in San Francisco, struck a very different tone. ''Data security, including encryption, is absolutely essential'' to the Pentagon, he said. ''None of our stuff works unless it's connected.'' He also warned against a legislative solution.   A law ''written in an atmosphere of anger or grief,'' he said, is ''not likely to be the right answer.'' Later he drove home the point, saying ''it would be better to work this out rather than have a law written.'' And throughout his talk, Mr. Carter made it clear that he is more interested in securing data than prying into it.   Administration officials insist the comments do not reflect serious internal disagreements about policy. They say, for example, that the Justice Department and F.B.I. also support strong encryption -- with limits -- while the heads of the intelligence agencies, responsible for securing government communications, understand the stresses on those investigating serious crimes.   In a statement, the White House said on Friday that ''our policy on encryption is clear.'' But the policy it described delineated the differing positions rather than resolving them.   ''The United States government firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption, which is a key tool to secure commerce and trade, safeguard private information, promote free expression and association,'' it said. ''At the same time, encryption poses a grave challenge for our national security and law enforcement professionals.''   But officials from the National Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon describe meetings in the White House Situation Room that go over the same territory, and in the end cannot find a middle ground.   The arguments were touched off two and a half years ago, with the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor, that the agency had gone to some lengths to undercut encryption.   There was evidence -- none confirmed, or discussed by the Obama administration -- that the N.S.A. had gained access to the unencrypted communications of servers around the world owned by Google and others to tap into foreign communications. There were suggestions that it had also tampered with the products of a foreign manufacturer of SIM cards, which go into every mobile telephone, to make it easier to intercept calls and emails.   The issues were taken up by a presidential commission that included legal scholars and intelligence experts, like Michael J. Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A., and Richard A. Clarke, a former senior national security official in the Clinton and Bush administrations who now works in cybersecurity. Their conclusion was unambiguous in opposing the building of so-called back doors for encrypted devices.   The commission told President Obama that the United States government should ''not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken or make vulnerable generally available commercial software,'' and it urged more companies to adapt such systems.   Last month, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, commander of the United States Cyber Command -- the Pentagon's digital arm, which both protects the Defense Department's networks and conducts offensive action -- as well as director of the N.S.A., echoed that view in remarks to the Atlantic Council.   The view of Admiral Rogers, many experts say, may be affected by the fact that his agency has the best code-cracking capabilities in the world, and he does not need to make public what systems he is already inside. Because he cracks the codes of foreign adversaries (and more than a few allies), he does not need a warrant, as Mr. Comey does. And his agency's less publicized job is securing the government's most vital secrets.   With more and more government communications relying on mobile devices, including a so-called hardened version of the iPhone and the iPad, the N.S.A. is also not interested in advertising to the world ways in which those devices can be defeated.   So far Mr. Obama has fully backed legal efforts by the F.B.I. to force Apple to help authorities unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino terrorist, who was killed in the attack. But he has rarely spoken about the broader questions, and when asked recently, a senior administration official said the White House still does not favor legislation to solve the issue.   The encryption issue seems particularly acute at the State Department and the Commerce Department, both of which have their own sets of concerns.   One of Hillary Clinton's favorite pilot programs as secretary of state, accelerated during the 2011 Arab Spring crisis, was to equip dissidents and activists around the world with the ''Internet in a suitcase,'' devices to help communicate and evade censorship.   But the system relies on encrypted conversations, to keep them away from Chinese state security or Egypt's brutal internal police. Any effort to force Apple to break that encryption, several American officials said -- insisting on anonymity because the administration is still debating these issues -- would be replicated from Beijing to Cairo.   Commerce Department officials have made the point that if Congress ultimately mandates that all encrypted products must be accessible to investigators, it will be a boon to foreign producers of encryption hardware and software. And there are a lot of them.   Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expert, published a study recently that said there were ''at least 865 hardware or software products incorporating encryption from 55 different countries.'' After the United States, Germany tops the list with 112. Most products, Mr. Schneier said recently, ''are as good as what you would find in the United States.''   But so far users are not flocking to them in mass numbers for a simple reason: For novices, they can be hard to use.   Apple's design is of particular concern to the F.B.I. because the encryption is automatic; users do not have to do a thing to make it work. As a recent Harvard study about the problem of ''going dark'' -- when law enforcement can no longer get access to evidence because of technological advances -- pointed out, the more times users have to manipulate the programs, the greater the opportunity for error.   Which is exactly what the F.B.I. is hoping for.     "
Cyberattacks Disrupt Saudi Aviation Agency,"Follow Sewell Chan on Twitter @sewellchan. Saudi Arabia's aviation agency was attacked last month by an aggressive computer virus intended to disrupt high-profile government targets, officials and experts said on Thursday. The attack, which experts say emanated from outside the country, used a version of Shamoon, malware used to target the Saudi energy sector four years ago. Similar kinds of data-clearing software were used in 2014 against the Las Vegas Sands and  Sony.    The Saudi government confirmed the latest breaches on Thursday, after several cybersecurity firms noted them. Bloomberg News reported that thousands of computers were damaged at the headquarters of the General Authority of Civil Aviation starting in mid-November, ''erasing critical data and bringing operations there to a halt for several days,'' although operations at Saudi airports did not appear to be affected.    The state-run Saudi Press Agency, citing a government statement, reported on Thursday that the national cybersecurity department had detected what officials called a systemic attack on crucial government agencies, including in the transportation sector. The attacks were aimed at halting operations, stealing data and planting viruses, the news agency reported.   Saudi Press reported that officials had alerted the government to the attacks last month and had sent vulnerable agencies tips on defending their computers -- suggesting that officials had failed to heed the messages.   The statement acknowledged that the attacks were staged from outside Saudi Arabia, but it did not specify the targets nor say when the breaches began.   If Saudi officials were fazed, they did not show it on Thursday.   ''What attack?'' Mohsen al-Shahrani, a communications officer for the general security department at the Interior Ministry, said when asked about the assault. ''I have not heard anything about this.''   Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, reported that state-sponsored hackers were believed to be responsible for the breaches and suggested that they might have emanated from Iran.   Iran and Saudi Arabia have been in a tit-for-tat cyberwar for more than four years. In April 2012, Iranian engineers working at the Kharg oil terminal, a speck in the Persian Gulf from which a large portion of Iran's oil is exported, noticed that their computers had stopped working. The same happened at the Oil Ministry's headquarters in Tehran, the capital, according to local news accounts.   A computer virus known as a wiper had been interfering with the ministry's internal network, removing files from hard drives and taking over computers. Insiders suspected Saudi hackers of carrying out the attacks, though there was no evidence.   Four months later, Saudi Aramco, the largest company in the Saudi Arabia, was hit by a virus that erased data on three-quarters of the company's computers, replacing everything with an image of a burning American flag. American intelligence officials said the real perpetrator was Iran, although they offered no evidence.   Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of the security firm CrowdStrike, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that the malware was a variant of Shamoon, which was used in the Aramco attack.   Mr. Alperovitch said the motives for the most recent attacks were not clear. He noted, however, that Iran had targeted Saudi Arabia with cyberattacks before, that the two countries have been locked in a sectarian competition for regional dominance for years, and that they are backing opposing sides of the wars in Syria and Yemen.   Iranian intelligence agents used Shamoon in 2012 in retaliation for international sanctions, Mr. Alperovitch said, adding that the latest attacks came just before a meeting in Vienna of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which agreed on Wednesday to cut oil production for the first time in eight years, prompting an immediate rise in oil prices.   Another security firm, Symantec, reported that the breaches had been timed for the evening of Nov. 17, the end of the workweek, which in much of the Muslim world runs from Sunday to Thursday.   ''The attackers appear to have done a significant amount of preparatory work,'' Symantec reported. ''The malware was configured with passwords that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations and were likely used to allow the threat to spread across a targeted organization's network. How the attackers obtained the stolen credentials is unknown.''   Symantec added, ''It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone home for the weekend in the hope of reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused.''   Another security company, Palo Alto Networks, reported that Shamoon breaches used malware known as Disttrack, ''a multipurpose tool that exhibits wormlike behavior by attempting to spread to other systems on a local network using stolen administrator credentials.'' At least 30,000 computer systems were damaged in the 2012 attacks, Palo Alto Networks reported.     "
Utilities Cautioned About Potential for a Cyberattack,"WASHINGTON --  The Obama administration has warned the nation's power companies, water suppliers and transportation networks that sophisticated cyberattack techniques used to bring down part of Ukraine's power grid two months ago could easily be turned on them. After an extensive inquiry, American investigators concluded that the attack in Ukraine on Dec. 23 may well have been the first power blackout triggered by a cyberattack -- a circumstance many have long predicted. Working remotely, the attackers conducted ''extensive reconnaissance'' of the power system's networks, stole the credentials of system operators and learned how to switch off the breakers, plunging more than 225,000 Ukrainians into darkness.     In interviews, American officials said they have not completed their inquiry into who was responsible for the attack. But Ukrainian officials have blamed the Russians, saying it was part of the effort to intimidate the country's political leaders by showing they could switch off the lights at any time.   ''They could be right,'' said one senior administration official. ''But so far we don't have the complete evidence, and the attackers went to some lengths to hide their tracks.''   Even after it has reached a conclusion, the White House might decide not to name the attackers, just as it decided not to publicly blame China for the theft of 22 million security files from the Office of Personnel Management.   But American intelligence officials have been intensely focused on the likelihood that the attack was engineered by the Russian military, or ''patriotic hackers'' operating on their behalf, since the first reports of the December blackout. The officials have found it intriguing that the attack did not appear designed to shut down the entire country. ''This appears to be message-sending,'' said one senior administration official with access to the intelligence, who requested anonymity to discuss the ongoing inquiry.   Equally interesting to investigators was the technique used: The malware designed for the Ukrainian power grid was directed at ''industrial control systems,'' systems that act as the intermediary between computers and the switches that distribute electricity and guide trains as they speed down the track, the valves that control water supplies, and the machinery that mixes chemicals at factories.   The most famous such attack was the Stuxnet worm, which destroyed the centrifuges that enriched uranium at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran. But that is not an example often cited by American officials -- largely because the attack was conducted by the United States and Israel, a fact American officials have never publicly acknowledged.   Experts in cybersecurity regard the Ukraine attack as a teaching moment, a chance to drive home to American firms the vulnerability of their own systems. ''There's never been an intentional cyberattack that has taken the electric grid down before,'' said Robert M. Lee of the SANS Institute. Mr. Lee said that while it was still not possible to determine who conducted the attack -- what is called ''attribution'' in the cyber industry -- he noted that it was clearly designed to send a political message.   ''It was large enough to get everyone's attention,'' he said, ''and small enough not to prompt a major response.''   The warning issued last Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security provided the first detailed account of the Ukrainian attack, based on the findings of a series of government experts who traveled to Ukraine to gather evidence.   The attack described by the Homeland Security document was highly sophisticated. The attackers gained entry, it appears, by sending a series of ''spearphishing'' messages that led someone in Ukraine to unintentionally give them access. Once they had that, the attackers mapped the system, much as the North Koreans mapped Sony Entertainment's computers before attacking them in the fall of 2014.   Then a series of cyberattacks were carefully coordinated to occur within 30 minutes of one another on Dec. 23. The ''breakers'' that disconnected power were operated ''by multiple external humans'' through secure communication channels. The hackers then wiped many of the systems clean using a form of malware aptly named ''KillDisk'' which erased files on the systems and disabled them. They wiped out the ''human-machine interface'' that enables operators of the electric system to run those systems -- or get them back in service -- from their computers.   For extra measure, the hackers even managed to disconnect backup power supplies, so that once the power failed, the computers could not turn them back on.   Investigators say that in the end, the Ukrainians may have been saved by the fact that their country relies on old technology and is still not as fully wired as many Western nations -- meaning they were able to restore power by manually flipping old-style circuit breakers.   ''The bad news for the United States is that we can't do the same thing,'' said Ted Koppel, the former ABC News anchor who published a best seller last year, entitled ''Lights Out,'' about the vulnerability of the American electric grid.   ''We have 3,200 power companies, and we need a precise balance between the amount of electricity that is generated and the amount that is used,'' he said. ''And that can only be done over a system run on the Internet. The Ukrainians were lucky to have antiquated systems.''   The report from Homeland Security recommended a series of common-sense steps: Make sure that outsiders accessing power systems or other networks that operate vital infrastructure can monitor the system, but not change it; close ''back doors'' -- system flaws that can give an intruder unauthorized access; have a contingency plan to shut down systems that have been infected, or invaded, by outsiders.   But all those systems make it harder for legitimate operators to use the Internet to keep vast systems operating, from a smartphone or laptop if necessary.     "
Apple vs. U.S.: Who's the Black Hat?,"Robert Levine is the author of ''Free Ride: How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business, and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back.'' THE dispute between the Justice Department and Apple over access to the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the gunmen in the San Bernardino massacre, comes down to this question: Shouldn't the government have more legal and moral authority to weigh complicated issues of privacy and national security than a company that makes phones? It should. After all, nobody ever elected Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, to public office. The legal case seems clear enough: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a warrant, Mr. Farook is dead, and his iPhone, which he used for work, is the property of San Bernardino County, which consented to having it searched. The data on the phone could yield valuable intelligence, making its content a legitimate matter of national security.     Apple had obeyed a demand to provide the government with the information in Mr. Farook's iCloud account. But then it was asked to undermine the phone's security system so the F.B.I. could try as many passcodes as possible to open the phone without erasing the stored data. Apple refused. On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion saying that Apple's objections had little to do with security but appeared ''to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.''   The government, not Apple, should guarantee our privacy rights. But this dispute has arisen precisely because the government hasn't done so. Instead, it squandered much of its legal and moral authority when the National Security Agency engaged in widespread surveillance of American citizens for so long. Some N.S.A. abuses targeted Silicon Valley directly.   In one project, revealed in October 2013 by journalists tipped off by Edward Snowden, the N.S.A., along with its British counterpart, essentially hacked into fiber-optic cables that connected the data centers of Google and Yahoo outside the United States. Under American law, the agency already had access to some of the information, but it tapped the lines anyway.   Silicon Valley companies love to celebrate the hacker spirit, but they don't like being on the receiving end. By November 2013, both Google and Yahoo announced that they were encrypting data traveling between its server centers. By the following September, Apple announced that its new phones would by default encrypt data stored on the device in such a way that even the company itself couldn't get at it.   At the time, this seemed like a hopelessly geeky version of Mad magazine's ''Spy vs. Spy,'' with opponents one-upped with algorithms rather than cartoon bombs. But the fight led directly to Tuesday's ruling by a federal magistrate judge in California that Apple must help the F.B.I. unlock Mr. Farook's phone. The laws governing online privacy are woefully out-of-date. To compel Apple to help execute a warrant, the judge cited the All Writs Act of 1789, enacted before there was electricity.   In Apple's public response, the company said it was fighting the F.B.I.'s demands not because it objected to the government unlocking Mr. Farook's phone but because the government could then ask Apple to undermine the security of other iPhones and because such software could potentially help criminals and repressive governments hack iPhones.   By analogy, the company doesn't have a key to the phone so the government is asking it to make the lock weaker. Apple is being asked to undermine not only the security of its products but also potentially its corporate reputation and even its business. The company is especially concerned that a victory for the government would set an informal precedent for other countries to demand that Apple unlock encrypted data. It's hard to have any sympathy for Mr. Farook, but the line between terrorism and criticism of the government can be far fuzzier in other countries, like China, where Apple sold tens of millions of iPhones in the last quarter of 2015. Apple's phones are also sold in Pakistan, where homosexual acts can send people to prison, and in Saudi Arabia, where adultery is punishable by lashing or stoning and apostasy punishable by death.   The United States government may have a reasonable case when it comes to Mr. Farook, but a victory here would open a Pandora's box that can't be closed in the United States or anywhere in the world. Cracking the phone open also may not help as much as we think: Would-be terrorists can use encrypted communication services that operate in other jurisdictions.   What we really need is a robust public conversation around strong privacy laws that would apply to the government and private companies alike and clear limits on what should be done with data. Important choices about the future of technology and privacy should be made by the American people and their representatives, not by Silicon Valley, where even the noblest intentions are mixed with huge financial stakes. If the government wants the power to compel companies to undermine their own security systems, it should go to Congress and ask for it.   Until then, we are left with Silicon Valley executives making engineering decisions that could determine what information the government can and can't have. That's both bad policy and fundamentally undemocratic.   But the current choice is between a government that doesn't seem to recognize limits to its own power to access personal information and a technology company that does. It's a bad choice, but an obvious one. While nobody elected Mr. Cook to protect our privacy, we should be glad someone is.

"Hillary Clinton's Email Was Probably Hacked, Experts Say","When the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said on Tuesday that his investigators had no ''direct evidence'' that Hillary Clinton's email account had been ''successfully hacked,'' both private experts and federal investigators immediately understood his meaning: It very likely had been breached, but the intruders were far too skilled to leave evidence of their work. Mr. Comey described, in fairly blistering terms, a set of email practices that left Mrs. Clinton's systems wide open to Russian and Chinese hackers, and an array of others. She had no full-time cybersecurity professional monitoring her system. She took her BlackBerry everywhere she went, ''sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.'' Her use of ''a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent.''    In the end, the risks created by Mrs. Clinton's insistence on keeping her communications on a private server may prove to be a larger issue than the relatively small amount of classified data investigators said they found on her system. But the central mystery -- who got into the system, if anyone -- may never be resolved.    ''Reading between the lines and following Comey's logic, it does sound as if the F.B.I. believes a compromise of Clinton's email is more likely than not,'' said Adam Segal, the author of ''Hacked World Order,'' who studies cyberissues at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Sophisticated attackers would have known of the existence of the account, would have targeted it and would not have been seen.''   Mr. Comey couched his concern on Tuesday by repeating the intelligence community's favorite phrase -- ''we assess'' -- four times, but ultimately reached no hard-and-fast conclusion. ''We assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account,'' he said.   But that was notable: Until Mr. Comey spoke, Mrs. Clinton and her campaign have said that her server -- there were actually several, in succession -- was never hacked. A State Department inspector general's report issued this year reported what looked like several attempts at ''spear phishing'' -- fake emails intended to get a user to click on a link that would install malware on a computer -- but there is no evidence that those links were activated.   Mrs. Clinton, and her campaign, have always maintained that the server was secure. President Obama backed her up in an interview last October on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' ''I don't think it posed a national security problem,'' he said.   But Mr. Comey painted a different picture.   ''Hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact,'' he said.   And that would have meant that tracking the trail of electronic breadcrumbs back to her server would have been a pretty simple task. After that, their ability to break in would have been a mix of skill and luck, but they had plenty of time to get it right.   Mrs. Clinton's best defense, and one she cannot utter in public, is that whatever the risks of keeping her own email server, that server was certainly no more vulnerable than the State Department's. Had she held an unclassified account in the State Department's official system, as the rules required, she certainly would have been hacked.   Russian intruders were thoroughly inside that system for years -- since at least 2007 -- before the State Department shut its system down several times to perform a digital exorcism in late 2014, nearly two years after Mrs. Clinton left office.   Either out of embarrassment or to protect its sources of intelligence, the Obama administration has never publicly blamed Russia for stealing data from the unclassified systems at the State Department and the White House, just as it has never publicly identified China as the culprit in the theft of security-clearance information on nearly 22 million Americans stored by the Office of Personnel Management.   Mrs. Clinton's campaign has insisted that the server did have some cyber protection software, but they have not said what kind.   But security software is useless unless it is updated constantly to reflect threats that change every day. Even then, there are ways for a determined, state-sponsored hacker to get in. The best hackers use a gap in the software that has never been discovered before called a ''zero day,'' suggesting there are zero days of warning about its dangers, or they wait for a user error, including clicking on a spear-phishing link.   Perhaps Mr. Comey's most surprising suggestion was that Mrs. Clinton had used her private email while in the territory of what he called ''sophisticated adversaries.'' That usually means China and Russia, but could include visits elsewhere, including Eastern Europe.   James A. Lewis, a former government cyber security expert who now studies the cyber activities of nations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said, ''If she used it in Russia or China, they almost certainly picked it up.''   Once the hardware is in a foreign country, and on its phone networks, it is particularly vulnerable. Malware can be placed on it that could turn the phone into a listening device. One lurking question is whether Mrs. Clinton's own practice of taking the phone around the world made it susceptible to tinkering by a foreign government.   The State Department worries so much about corrupted cellphones that visitors to the secretary's suite on the seventh floor must place their devices in lockers near the guard's desk. Mrs. Clinton, her campaign said on Wednesday, took her smartphone to the State Department but kept it in a room outside the secure area around her office suite.   Moreover, for truly sensitive data, the State Department does not use its own networks at all. It quietly uses a network run by one of the major intelligence agencies, according to officials familiar with the system. That suggests a lack of confidence that State's classified systems can be fully trusted.   Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used private email, officials in the government and many outside it have been monitoring the internet, looking to see if any of her messages, or those directed to her, made their way into the public domain. Documents from the Democratic National Committee began circulating after it announced a breach that also appears to have been conducted by Russian intelligence.   Nothing from Mrs. Clinton has surfaced. But that does not mean they were not stolen, only that they have not been made public.

"To Head Off Digital Attacks, a Security Start-Up Is Spying on Hackers","Standing before a crowded room of entrepreneurs and investors at a conference in San Francisco last summer, former Vice President Al Gore described how climate change could be contained, possibly even reversed. Next to take the stage was Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant, a security company acquired by another security company called FireEye, who said nothing could be done to stop hackers from conducting digital attacks.    The juxtaposition did not sit well with Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency. ''I thought, 'Really? We can solve global warming but we can't stop cyberattacks?''' Mr. Falkowitz recalled. He didn't buy it.    For the last two years, Mr. Falkowitz's start-up, Area 1 Security, has been trying to persuade the owners and operators of computer servers that have been compromised by state spies, criminals and hacktivists to allow the company to tap into those servers to monitor the attackers' activities.   Those servers have given the Area 1 team a much clearer picture of who is being targeted and what tools and websites attackers are using. And the security company has started to block attackers, heading them off days or even months before they hit their targets.   It's a new tack in an industry that in recent years has appeared less confident that it can block digital attacks. Most security start-ups seeking funding today have resigned themselves to the inevitability of a breach and are focused more on identifying an attack as it plays out and praying that they can respond before the perpetrator makes off with something important.   It's as if everyone in the cybersecurity industry forgot that customers pay them to keep from being hacked in the first place.   Mr. Falkowitz and his co-founders, Blake Darché and Phil Syme, think they have found a new way to turn attackers' tools against them.   For as long as there have been cyberattacks, hackers have relied on a vast network of compromised servers around the globe to funnel their malicious code, search out targets and steal data. By watching what happens on those compromised servers at dentists' offices, farms, welding shops and tech companies, Area 1 believes it has secured a unique vantage point for monitoring and even blocking attacks.   Area 1's technology addresses one of the most pernicious digital threats: so-called spear-phishing attacks, which bait unsuspecting workers into clicking on links in emails and unknowingly giving attackers a toehold in their employers' systems.   Phishing attacks have become an epidemic. To date, more than 90 percent of breaches have begun with a phishing attack, according to Verizon.   Intelligence experts say that phishing attacks are the preferred method of Chinese hackers who have managed to steal things as varied as nuclear propulsion technology and Silicon Valley's most guarded software code.   ''Oren does not take it as writ law that we have to live that way, and he wanted to do something about it,'' said Ted Schlein, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which has invested in Area 1.   ''If we could look every company in the eye and say, 'We can stop your phishing attacks,''' Mr. Schlein said, ''then Oren could look Kevin Mandia in the eye and say, 'Thanks for the inspiration, but you're wrong.'''   One of the biggest challenges in combating phishing attacks has been a lack of information-sharing among victims, security firms and law enforcement. Victims are reluctant to publicize security breaches, potentially keeping competitors from heading off similar attacks.   And the role of the government in sharing threat data has been constrained since the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked documents revealing the scale of government monitoring. The Obama administration has been pushing to collect and share more threat data with the private sector. But few companies want to share any more data with the government than they are compelled to by law.   Intelligence agencies say the lack of information-sharing works to attackers' advantage.   ''We are in a very complex digital world that's only going to get more complex as innovation presents challenges we haven't even anticipated,'' said Daniel Ennis, former director of the Threat Operations Center at the N.S.A. ''People have incredible expectations of the government to keep them safe'' online.   ''My concern is that the bad guys are going to out-innovate us,'' he added. ''The only way we're going to out-innovate them is a partnership between the government, the private sector, the victims and academia.''   Until that happens, Area 1 may have found a way to circumnavigate the politics by recruiting the owners of those compromised servers around the globe.   ''Cyber is perceived as this 'Matrix'-like structure, but people forget that it's also physical in nature,'' Mr. Falkowitz said. ''The players are not just the attackers and the victim; there's an entire underbelly of the web that has been subverted.''   Area 1 discovers, on average, 859 new targeting phishing sites a day. Now it can use its unusual vantage point to help its customers stave off attacks.   It is still early days, but Area 1 aims to eventually end phishing attacks altogether, Mr. Falkowitz said. ''We just went to Mars and found water, and people are saying we can't solve this?''     "
Apple Will Pay Hackers to Report Vulnerabilities,"LAS VEGAS -- Apple, which has been criticized in recent years for failing to pay outside hackers who report bugs in its products, said on Thursday that it would begin offering a so-called bug bounty to technologists who alert the company to flaws.  At the Black Hat hacking conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including $25,000 for ways around Apple's digital compartments and into its customers' data, $50,000 for bugs that give hackers a way into iCloud data, and $200,000 to turn over critical vulnerabilities in Apple's firmware -- the software that lies closest to the bare metal of the machine.    Apple said that if hackers donated their rewards to charity, it would match their donation. ''We want to reward the people, and frankly the creativity it takes to find bugs in these categories,'' said Ivan Krstic, Apple's head of security engineering and architecture.   For six years, nearly every company in Silicon Valley has been rewarding hackers who turn over bugs -- a term for flaws that can make a product vulnerable to intrusion -- in their systems, with cash. The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them.   But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website -- a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay.   The lack of an Apple bug bounty program made headlines earlier this year when the F.B.I. announced that it had paid hackers more than $1 million for a backdoor into Apple's iPhone.   The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials.   Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them.   ''We made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them'' Mr. Kaminsky told the audience. ''Everybody looks busy but the house still burns.'' Mr. Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.   Notably, a fund-raiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year's conference. Tickets for the ''Hackers for Hillary'' fund-raiser were going for anywhere from $100 to $2,700. According to the event organizers, the fund-raiser focused on ''cyber policy issues the next administration faces.''   Security experts at the conference, echoing earlier reports, maintained that Russia was behind the hack. A number of organizations cited research suggesting that the D.N.C. was hacked by two Russian intelligence groups in what they believed was a campaign aimed at hurting Mrs. Clinton's presidential candidacy.

Why Security Experts Think Russia Was Behind the D.N.C. Breach,"Follow Max Fisher on Twitter @Max_Fisher . WASHINGTON -- Since Democratic National Committee officials first discovered their data networks had been compromised this spring, a growing chorus of experts and officials have seen evidence that the Russian government was responsible. In the months since, the infiltration and its consequences have taken surprising and often bizarre turns, culminating in a political scandal this week as the Democratic National Convention opened in Philadelphia. But one constant has remained: a growing body of forensic evidence implicating the Russian government.    The first hints came in May, after committee officials noticed unusual activity in their network. They hired the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to investigate, and its experts quickly found the source of the activity: a group of hackers had, in late April, gained access to the systems of the committee's opposition-research team, from which the group had stolen two files containing information on Donald J. Trump, who would eventually become the Republican nominee for president.    The investigators determined that the hackers were part of APT 28, a group well-known among cybersecurity experts. The name is short for advanced persistent threat, which usually refers to government hackers. Security firms and law enforcement officials have also used the name Fancy Bear, a reference to a widespread belief that the group is run by Russia's military intelligence agency, the G.R.U.   The investigation might have ended there, but CrowdStrike discovered another, better-hidden infiltrator in the computers of the Democratic committee: A group known as APT 29, or Cozy Bear, which is considered more skillful and has been linked to the F.S.B., the main successor to the K.G.B.   Cozy Bear, it seemed, had had complete access to the committee's systems for almost a year. (Subsequent investigations by two other cybersecurity firms confirmed CrowdStrike's findings.)   Linking a breach to a particular hacker group, and tying a group to a state agency, is always based on circumstantial evidence. But the forensic evidence the experts were able to collect connecting these intrusions to Russian agencies was very strong compared with other cases.   For example, the first group, APT 28, often uses the same tactic: registering a domain whose name is similar to that of its target, to trick users into disclosing their passwords when logging into the wrong site. In this case, hackers set up misdepatrment.com -- switching two letters -- to target users of MIS Department, which manages networks for the Democratic committee.   More tellingly, the hackers linked this domain to an IP address they had used in previous breaches, giving investigators a way to look for patterns. They also used the same malware tools, which sometimes included unique security or encryption keys, a kind of digital fingerprint. Those fingerprints were found in other attacks, like a 2015 breach at Germany's Parliament, which German intelligence officials said Russia, specifically APT 28, had probably carried out.   Both APT 28 and APT 29 use methods ''consistent with nation-state level capabilities,'' according to a CrowdStrike report, and they target foreign militaries and military contractors in a pattern that ''closely mirrors the strategic interests of the Russian government.''   Another report, issued by the security firm FireEye in July 2015, pointed out that the hackers had seemed to go offline on Russian state holidays, and had appeared to operate during hours consistent with the Russian workday.   Such intrusions, while troublesome, are within the expected bounds of international spycraft. The case took a surprising turn in June, after Democratic Party officials, perhaps seeing an opportunity to paint Mr. Trump as Moscow's favored candidate, revealed the apparent Russian infiltration to The Washington Post.   Within 24 hours, someone using the name Guccifer 2.0 had opened a WordPress blog and made a far-fetched claim: He, not Russia, had been responsible for the Democratic committee breach, and he had done it alone.   He also said he had stolen thousands of internal emails, the first public mention of such a theft. He provided evidence, posting a series of stolen documents and leaking others to news outlets, as well as to WikiLeaks. His name, he said, was a homage to a famous Romanian hacker who went by Guccifer and who has been in prison since 2014.   But Guccifer 2.0's documents, while authentic, contradicted his claims that he had acted alone -- and provided evidence of Russian state involvement. Some files, for example, included metadata showing they had been opened by computers set to the Russian language. Another had been modified by a word processor registered to Felix Edmundovich, rendered in Cyrillic script, a clear reference to Felix E. Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet secret police.   Guccifer 2.0 made himself available to journalists, which is not something criminal hackers often do. He insisted that Russia had not infiltrated the Democratic committee, an odd claim because he would have had no way of knowing. When discussing how he had committed the breach, his comments were inconsistent and, according to cybersecurity experts, showed insufficient technical knowledge to understand -- much less carry out -- the attacks.   He also claimed to be Romanian, but was unable to hold a conversation in that language when prompted by a reporter from the technology site Motherboard. But if Guccifer 2.0 was not whom he said he was, how had he acquired thousands of documents stolen from the committee? And why did he lie?   ThreatConnect, a security analysis group, concluded that Guccifer 2.0 ''most likely is a Russian denial and deception (D&D) effort'' meant to cast doubt on Russian responsibility for the hack. It later found metadata in Guccifer 2.0's emails suggesting he had sent them from Russian networks, as well as some parallels with networks used by ATP 28, the Russian group.   The theory, widely shared by cybersecurity analysts, is that the Russian intelligence agencies, once exposed by the June report in The Washington Post, constructed Guccifer 2.0 to distract from those accusations. The thinking behind such methods is detailed in Russia's formal military doctrine, which calls for deception and disinformation, often through so-called information operations, to sow confusion and maintain deniability.   Last week, the hackers made public about 20,000 emails through a different channel: WikiLeaks, which has long experience in scrubbing documents of incriminating information. So this release offers little new forensic information. But security experts say we may have more opportunities to hunt for clues: The hackers had access to far more than just these emails, and after last week's ploy, might be tempted to leak more.

Tech Rivals Lining Up to Support Apple's Case,"Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and a parade of other technology companies filed a barrage of court briefs on Thursday, aiming to puncture the United States government's legal arguments against Apple in a case that will test the limits of the authorities' access to personal data. The extraordinary show of support for Apple from the tech companies, including many rivals, underscores how high the stakes are for the industry with the case, in which the authorities are demanding Apple's help to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.    In all, around 40 companies and organizations, along with several dozen individuals, submitted more than a dozen briefs this week to the Federal District Court for the District of Central California, challenging every legal facet of the government's case, like its free speech implications, the importance of encryption and concerns about government overreach.   ''These companies, which are often fierce competitors, have joined together to voice concern about the attempted government overreach in this case, which threatens the integrity and security of their products and privacy rights of consumers in general,'' said Neal Katyal, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells for the tech companies and a former acting solicitor general of the United States.    Edward J. McAndrew, a lawyer at Ballard Spahr who is not involved in the Apple matter, said it was highly unusual to see a flood of briefs by so many parties this early in a case. He called the outpouring ''Supreme Court-level advocacy'' and said the campaign was intended to have influence beyond the court with legislators and others.   ''This is a show of force,'' said Mr. McAndrew, a former federal prosecutor who focused on online crimes. ''This is a battle for public opinion.''   Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel, said on Wednesday that the company was ''humbled by the outpouring of support.''   The case between Apple and the government became public last month, when a federal magistrate judge in California ordered the company to bypass the security functions on the iPhone. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, opposed the order, arguing the case could have far-reaching implications for other devices and software, with governments everywhere able to demand more access to tech companies' data.   Several tech companies were initially careful and subdued in their support of Apple, with some privately debating whether the San Bernardino attack was the right case for challenging the government. Last week, some tech companies including Microsoft began to back Apple more forcefully, saying they planned to file briefs supporting it in court.   In the brief on Thursday from Amazon, Microsoft and others, the tech companies said they shared the public's outrage over the ''heinous act of terrorism'' in San Bernardino, but said they were united in the view that the government's case exceeded the boundaries of existing law and would hurt Americans' security.   A collection of 17 Internet companies, including Twitter, Airbnb and LinkedIn, filed a separate brief objecting to the government's use of the All Writs Act, a statute from 1789 that underlies many law enforcement requests for tech companies' data, in the San Bernardino case. AT&T and Intel also submitted independent briefs backing Apple.   In the filing from the group that includes Twitter and LinkedIn, the companies said the government ''seeks unbounded authority to compel Apple to design software that does not currently exist and that will circumvent and undermine security measures intended to protect its users' data.''   ''We're facing a very big question as a country, industry and a world about what privacy will look like in the digital era,'' said Aaron Levie, the chief executive of the data storage company Box, which signed on to the brief with Amazon, Google and others. ''There is a global impact for these tech companies if we don't land on the right side of having a strong framework for how companies deal with security and these kinds of requests in the digital age.''   Apart from the tech companies, seven prominent security experts and 32 law professors signed on to joint briefs on Thursday. Several industry trade organizations and digital rights groups submitted their own filings this week.   Some echoed Apple's slippery slope argument that opening up one iPhone would lead to a domino effect from governments worldwide. The Media Institute, a nonprofit research foundation that focuses on communications policy, warned in its filing that the court's order could be ''be applied against media companies as government authorities seek to acquire access to confidential information stored on mobile devices used by journalists.''   The support for Apple was a torrent compared with the stream of filings backing the Justice Department in the case. Among the staunchest supporters on the side of government were six people whose family members were killed in the California attack.   ''Broader questions about the fate of smartphone encryption and data privacy can be saved for another day and another forum,'' the families wrote in a brief. ''This case certainly presents the conditions -- a mass murder by terrorists implicating national security interest -- where requiring Apple's technical assistance is at its apex.''   Stephen G. Larson, the lawyer representing the victims' families, said he was frustrated that Apple was drawing a line in the sand ''over a phone that didn't even belong to the terrorist and that they have permission to unlock.'' The iPhone of the San Bernardino attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook, was issued by his employer.   ''So many of Apple's arguments are red herrings because this is not about privacy more than any other search in a criminal investigation is about privacy,'' Mr. Larson said. ''That is scaremongering and that is false.''   A handful of law enforcement groups also filed briefs supporting the government's position, including a joint one from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys and the National Sheriffs' Association.   Those groups listed several instances when iPhone data was an essential piece of a criminal case, including child pornography and sex trafficking cases. They argued that criminals were moving to iPhones because of Apple's refusal to help the government and that the company was making data extraction from its products impossible.   ''If Apple can refuse lawful court orders to reasonably assist law enforcement, public safety will suffer,'' the trade groups wrote.   Not all family members of San Bernardino victims sided with the government. This week, Salihin Kondoker, whose wife, Anies, was shot three times but survived the attack, wrote a letter to the court saying he thought there was little valuable information on the iPhone used by the gunman. Mr. Kondoker said Apple's fight was about something bigger than one phone.   ''They are worried that this software the government wants them to use will be used against millions of other innocent people,'' he wrote. ''I share their fear.''     "
Phone Spying Is Made Easy. Choose a Plan.,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Want to invisibly spy on 10 iPhone owners without their knowledge? Gather their every keystroke, sound, message and location? That will cost you $650,000, plus a $500,000 setup fee with an Israeli outfit called the NSO Group. You can spy on more people if you would like -- just check out the company's price list. The NSO Group is one of a number of companies that sell surveillance tools that can capture all the activity on a smartphone, like a user's location and personal contacts. These tools can even turn the phone into a secret recording device.    Since its founding six years ago, the NSO Group has kept a low profile. But last month, security researchers caught its spyware trying to gain access to the iPhone of a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates. They also discovered a second target, a Mexican journalist who wrote about corruption in the Mexican government.    Now, internal NSO Group emails, contracts and commercial proposals obtained by The New York Times offer insight into how companies in this secretive digital surveillance industry operate. The emails and documents were provided by two people who have had dealings with the NSO Group but would not be named for fear of reprisals.   The company is one of dozens of digital spying outfits that track everything a target does on a smartphone. They aggressively market their services to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. The industry argues that this spying is necessary to track terrorists, kidnappers and drug lords. The NSO Group's corporate mission statement is ''Make the world a safe place.''   Ten people familiar with the company's sales, who refused to be identified, said that the NSO Group has a strict internal vetting process to determine who it will sell to. An ethics committee made up of employees and external counsel vets potential customers based on human rights rankings set by the World Bank and other global bodies. And to date, these people all said, NSO has yet to be denied an export license.   But critics note that the company's spyware has also been used to track journalists and human rights activists.   ''There's no check on this,'' said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. ''Once NSO's systems are sold, governments can essentially use them however they want. NSO can say they're trying to make the world a safer place, but they are also making the world a more surveilled place.''   The NSO Group's capabilities are in higher demand now that companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are using stronger encryption to protect data in their systems, in the process making it harder for government agencies to track suspects.   The NSO Group's spyware finds ways around encryption by baiting targets to click unwittingly on texts containing malicious links or by exploiting previously undiscovered software flaws. It was taking advantage of three such flaws in Apple software -- since fixed -- when it was discovered by researchers last month.   The cyberarms industry typified by the NSO Group operates in a legal gray area, and it is often left to the companies to decide how far they are willing to dig into a target's personal life and what governments they will do business with. Israel has strict export controls for digital weaponry, but the country has never barred the sale of NSO Group technology.   Since it is privately held, not much is known about the NSO Group's finances, but its business is clearly growing. Two years ago, the NSO Group sold a controlling stake in its business to Francisco Partners, a private equity firm based in San Francisco, for $120 million. Nearly a year later, Francisco Partners was exploring a sale of the company for 10 times that amount, according to two people approached by the firm but forbidden to speak about the discussions.   The company's internal documents detail pitches to countries throughout Europe and multimillion-dollar contracts with Mexico, which paid the NSO Group more than $15 million for three projects over three years, according to internal NSO Group emails dated in 2013.   ''Our intelligence systems are subject to Mexico's relevant legislation and have legal authorization,'' Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement. ''They are not used against journalists or activists. All contracts with the federal government are done in accordance with the law.''   Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said that the sale of its spyware was restricted to authorized governments and that it was used solely for criminal and terrorist investigations. He declined to comment on whether the company would cease selling to the U.A.E. and Mexico after last week's disclosures.   For the last six years, the NSO Group's main product, a tracking system called Pegasus, has been used by a growing number of government agencies to target a range of smartphones -- including iPhones, Androids, and BlackBerry and Symbian systems -- without leaving a trace.   Among the Pegasus system's capabilities, NSO Group contracts assert, are the abilities to extract text messages, contact lists, calendar records, emails, instant messages and GPS locations. One capability that the NSO Group calls ''room tap'' can gather sounds in and around the room, using the phone's own microphone.   Pegasus can use the camera to take snapshots or screen grabs. It can deny the phone access to certain websites and applications, and it can grab search histories or anything viewed with the phone's web browser. And all of the data can be sent back to the agency's server in real time.   In its commercial proposals, the NSO Group asserts that its tracking software and hardware can install itself in any number of ways, including ''over the air stealth installation,'' tailored text messages and emails, through public Wi-Fi hot spots rigged to secretly install NSO Group software, or the old-fashioned way, by spies in person.   Much like a traditional software company, the NSO Group prices its surveillance tools by the number of targets, starting with a flat $500,000 installation fee. To spy on 10 iPhone users, NSO charges government agencies $650,000; $650,000 for 10 Android users; $500,000 for five BlackBerry users; or $300,000 for five Symbian users -- on top of the setup fee, according to one commercial proposal.   You can pay for more targets. One hundred additional targets will cost $800,000, 50 extra targets cost $500,000, 20 extra will cost $250,000 and 10 extra costs $150,000, according to an NSO Group commercial proposal. There is an annual system maintenance fee of 17 percent of the total price every year thereafter.   What that gets you, NSO Group documents say, is ''unlimited access to a target's mobile devices.'' In short, the company says: You can ''remotely and covertly collect information about your target's relationships, location, phone calls, plans and activities -- whenever and wherever they are.''   And, its proposal adds, ''It leaves no traces whatsoever.''     "
Security Czars on Apple's Side in Privacy War,"WASHINGTON -- In their years together as top national security officials, Michael V. Hayden and Michael Chertoff were fierce advocates of using the government's spying powers to pry into sensitive intelligence data. Mr. Hayden directed a secret domestic eavesdropping program at the National Security Agency that captured billions of phone records after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Chertoff pushed for additional wiretapping and surveillance powers from Congress both as a top prosecutor and as Homeland Security secretary.    But today, their jobs have changed, and so, apparently, have their views on privacy. Both former officials now work with technology companies like Apple at a corporate consulting firm that Mr. Chertoff founded, and both are now backing Apple -- and not the F.B.I., with which they once worked -- in its fight to keep its iPhones encrypted and private.   They are among more than a half-dozen prominent former national security officials who, to varying degrees, have supported Apple and the idea of impenetrable ''end-to-end encryption'' during a furious national debate over the balance between privacy and security in the digital age.    In white papers, op-ed articles, conferences, newspaper and television interviews and elsewhere, the former officials have made their support for Apple clear. While their former jobs in the government are always featured prominently in their public appearances, their current business affiliations often go unmentioned.   The barrage of support has given Apple a public relations boost in a fight it once seemed destined to lose, but it has surprised and angered some law enforcement officials.   These officials question whether the business relationships that some of the former officials now have with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies -- jobs that usually pay far above their former government salaries -- are behind their enthusiastic advocacy of privacy and encryption.   Among those who have voiced support for Apple's position are Mike McConnell, a former director of national intelligence; David H. Petraeus, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; R. James Woolsey, another former C.I.A. director; and Richard A. Clarke, a former top White House counterterrorism official. Like Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Hayden, they all now work with firms that have ties to the technology sector, records show.   It is unclear how much money Apple and other technology firms involved in the F.B.I. litigation have paid to the firms where the former officials now work; most of the firms declined to discuss their private business dealings, calling them irrelevant.   Mr. McConnell, who served as national intelligence director under President Obama and George W. Bush, argues that keeping the United States' computer systems safe from rival nations and rogue hackers should outweigh the F.B.I.'s interests in unlocking smartphones in criminal cases.   ''I believe ubiquitous encryption is something that the nation is going to have to embrace,'' Mr. McConnell, who is now a senior executive adviser at the consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, said in a telephone interview. ''Apple has been leading the fight to go down that path, Google is right behind and Microsoft will be there before too long.''   Booz Allen's executive vice president, Thad W. Allen, a former Coast Guard commandant, has also voiced support for Apple's position on encryption, because, he said, American technology firms need to stay competitive in the international market.   Booz Allen has made a recent push to form ''strategic alliances'' with Apple and other technology companies, executives said.   Mr. McConnell and other former national security officials said that their work in the private sector had no impact on their public support for Apple. Not everyone agrees.   ''They've followed the money and adopted pro-privacy positions that they wouldn't have dreamed of taking while in government,'' said Tim Shorrock, a writer and foreign policy commentator who wrote a book on the business side of intelligence.   Some current law enforcement officials say they have been angered by the former officials' sharp and sometimes personal criticism of the F.B.I. (Mr. Hayden, for instance, said in an interview, ''I think Jim Comey's wrong,'' referring to the bureau's director.)   The Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official who is one of the few former officials publicly backing the F.B.I. in the encryption debate, said it was frustrating to see old colleagues now echoing what he sees as erroneous assertions from Apple about the threat to its customers' privacy.   Still, he conceded that the efforts had been effective. What started as a dispute over a locked iPhone used by a terrorist in San Bernardino, Calif., has instead become a broader one over privacy and computer security, Mr. Baker said, and ''they're getting a lot of people to side with Apple.''   So strong is their support that Apple has included comments from several of the former officials in its legal pleadings. One filing included a comment from Mr. Chertoff at a conference last month that if Apple were forced to create a ''back door'' to get around its encryption, it would be like creating ''a bacteriological weapon.''   Another vote of support that Apple has included in its legal filings came from Mr. Hayden, who is one of the top executives at Mr. Chertoff's consulting firm, the Chertoff Group. ''America is more secure -- America is more safe -- with unbreakable end-to-end encryption,'' Mr. Hayden, who led both the National Security Agency and the C.I.A., told a television interviewer a week after the Apple fight broke out.   Mr. Chertoff's firm also produced a 28-page report this year on the value of encryption, and its dealings with technology companies on security issues are extensive. Apple was also a corporate sponsor of a cybersecurity conference it hosted in October.   Mr. Hayden has acknowledged that he might have come down differently in the Apple dispute when he was the head of the N.S.A. If faced with an unbreakable device, he might have gone straight to the budget office and said, ''I'm going to need another $500 million because I'm going to kick my way in,'' he told the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.   Still, Mr. Hayden said in a telephone interview that his strong stance on encryption dated back years and was not influenced by his post-government work at the Chertoff Group.   ''It doesn't have any relevance to what I think about this,'' he said. ''I answered this on its merits.''   Mr. Chertoff was traveling and unavailable for comment, the Chertoff Group said. The firm declined to discuss its financial dealings with Apple.   But Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in a panel discussion last month that during his time inside the government, there were situations in which ''I knew I had to move heaven and earth'' to find out where a threat was coming from. His current focus on encryption, he said, is complementary to that previous stance on security and not contradictory.   The encryption debate erupted in February after the F.B.I. said it needed Apple's technical help to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.   Initially, the F.B.I. appeared poised to win the battle for public opinion. The attack, which killed 14 people, was the worst terrorist strike on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Farook was dead; the phone's owner -- the county of San Bernardino, where he worked -- had consented to the search; and the Justice Department had a court order to do it.   But Apple has since gained public sympathy, with polls giving it a small but growing edge over the F.B.I. in support, and the battle has essentially ended in a draw now that the F.B.I. has managed to get into the phone by paying an outside group to help hack it.   With the F.B.I. still pushing to open other locked phones, Apple's backers are preparing for a long fight.   Mr. Hayden, the former N.S.A. director, warned listeners last month at the American Enterprise Institute that the flare-up in the San Bernardino case was ''not a one-and-done.''   Encryption is at the root of Internet communications, Mr. Hayden said, and ''there is nothing we can do to stop that.'' His advice to his onetime government colleagues on the other side of the fight was simple: ''Get over it,'' he said.

"At Los Angeles Auto Show, an Industry Ponders Its Digital Future","LOS ANGELES -- For decades, the car business has been about style, performance, image and fuel efficiency. But suddenly, the industry is in a technological and sociological upheaval that may force automobiles -- and the companies that make them -- to change more in the next five years than they have in the last 50. That was evident in this week's AutoMobility LA conference, a one-day event held by the organizers of the Los Angeles Auto Show that will continue over the next two weeks.    AutoMobility is an apt name, because much of the innovation seems to involve making the car ever more like a giant smartphone on wheels. But social mobility is a factor, too, as carmakers confront the surging popularity of ride-hailing services, which means fewer people see a need to own a car, while the push toward autonomous vehicles portends a time when many cars will not need people to drive them.    Maybe this auto convention should be renamed the Los Angeles Technology Show, given the presence of companies like Intel, Cisco and Garmin here, all intent on making digital, internet-connected vehicles even more so. Digital security companies, like Argus Cyber Security and QNX, were also here, promising to protect networked cars against hackers.   Automakers, including BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, promoted their digital bona fides and extolled services like Android Auto or Apple CarPlay that are meant to allow the safer, hands-free use of smartphones in the car, even though safety experts say such features may be contributing to the sometimes fatal problem of distracted driving.   Hyundai announced a partnership with Amazon that would enable the South Korean automaker's cars to be remotely started, and the heater or air-conditioner to be turned on, by speaking to an Amazon Echo device inside the home. It was only the latest in a series of car-related apps that Amazon has introduced through Echo and the Alexa personal assistant. Other apps include one that enables Alexa to hail Uber rides.   Uber, of course, and other ride-hailing services like Lyft, are potentially big disrupters of the automakers' conventional business model of selling cars to individual consumers. And new variants are coming along, including See Jane Go, which had a booth at the conference. The company addresses a concern of many women by recruiting only female drivers and accepting only female passengers.   Mark F. Fields, Ford Motor's chief executive, spoke here of the opportunities he saw in selling vehicles to the ride-sharing industry, including, eventually, ones that would drive themselves. But optimism requires the car industry to reimagine itself. Instead of the worldwide automobile industry thinking of itself as the $2.3 trillion business it is now, Mr. Fields said, it should see itself as part of the much bigger global transportation industry.   General Motors is already hedging itself in ride hailing, having taken a $500 million stake in Lyft. Under G.M.'s separate Maven car-sharing service, which offers by-the-hour rental to consumers, the company is also renting cars to Uber drivers. G.M. considers Maven a way to expose consumers to its various models, even if the people are not in the market to buy one.   BMW has its own car-sharing venture, ReachNow, which operates in Seattle and Portland, Ore., and will soon be in Brooklyn. It allows members to drive a BMW or Mini vehicle for 41 cents a minute of operation.   ReachNow's chief executive, Steve Banfield, in an interview here, compared the concept to Netflix, the video service that has helped render ownership of DVDs superfluous. That might seem like a threat to BMW's business of selling cars, but Mr. Banfield described it as more of a get-acquainted marketing approach.   Some ReachNow members sign up simply for extended test drives of BMW cars like the electric i3, Mr. Banfield said. And younger members who cannot afford a vehicle early in their careers can become familiar with BMW's products, making them more likely to become buyers once their salaries catch up with their tastes, he said.   For people who do own cars but who would not mind some help paying for them, there are mobile-app services like Turo, which enable car owners to rent out their cars. By renting their vehicles for nine days each month, owners could probably cover their entire car payments and maybe even turn a profit, David Stewart, Turo's chief business officer, said in a presentation here.   Turo is good news for automakers, Mr. Stewart said, because it might help someone wary of owning a vehicle to afford to buy one, or to move up to a more luxurious model as the rental income made it affordable.   But the question of who does or does not own a car now might one day seem a quaint distinction when cars start driving themselves. And when that time comes, the companies with the biggest identity crises may be ones like Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche that have persuaded the public to spend big money on the thrill of taking the wheel.   Detlev von Platen, executive board member for sales and marketing at Porsche, views it as an evolution.   ''Our cars will always be about the driving experience because that's what we sell -- experiences,'' Mr. von Platen said. ''But we must provide options for our owners, and self-driving technologies that can be activated when desired must be considered.''   And a self-driving Porsche might be more than a robotic tram. Imagine experiencing the throttle, braking and steering inputs of a professional driver on a racetrack. That could be programmed into the car, said Oliver Blume, Porsche's chief executive.   Porsche might also experiment with new types of sales or leasing options to cultivate loyalty. Mr. von Platen said the company might consider a ''flex lease,'' under which someone leasing a two-seat 718 Cayman would gain access to a Cayenne S.U.V. for seven days a year, which could be handy for when five seats are needed.   The other big technology topic was electric vehicles, which all carmakers have been pursuing as a way to address concerns about the climate, as well as government-mandated rules and targets for lower emissions and higher fuel efficiency.   Jaguar announced its I-Pace all-electric S.U.V., a concept car that the company said would be available in 2018.   And yet the election of Donald J. Trump, a climate-change skeptic who is widely expected to scale back automotive emission and fuel-efficiency regulations, could alter the industry's planning for environmentally friendlier cars. The possible relaxation of those regulations was an undercurrent here.   And the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light-truck makers, recently wrote to the Trump transition team urging a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a ''substantial challenge'' to the industry.   Mr. Blume of Porsche said his company would stay on its current technology track, even if fuel-economy and emissions standards were relaxed.   ''When we think of new technology, we don't concern ourselves with political changes,'' Mr. Blume said. ''We think electrification is a technology of the future, and we have a responsibility to the environment.''   That debate simply reinforces a characteristic that was fully apparent at AutoMobility LA: The automotive business is not just about moving vehicles; it's about moving targets.     "

Still Waiting to Hear From Yahoo,"Q. I have a Yahoo account. I have changed the password and taken other recommended security steps but I have yet to hear from Yahoo. Does the company have any obligation to inform its users of the breach? Shouldn't Yahoo have been the first to send out information instead of letting us find out about the hacking from the news?   A. When Yahoo posted online statements to its users and investors on Sept. 22 announcing the 2014 security breach that compromised 500 million accounts, the company said it had begun to notify potentially affected users by email that morning. If you did not receive such a message, there could be a number of reasons: It might have been blocked by a filter or accidentally deleted, or you may not have been included on the email list. But as the experts advise, just assume that your personal information was stolen.    The contents of the security breach message and a set of frequently asked questions can be found on Yahoo's site at yahoo.com/security-update. On the page, the company also suggests switching from a traditional password to the Yahoo Account Key, a user authentication tool that lets you sign in with a smartphone running Android or iOS.   Yahoo's notice to users referred to a continuing investigation, which may have slowed the company's disclosure, but there could be legal consequences for the delay. Along with multiple lawsuits brought by Yahoo users over the company's security practices, Senator Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has called for an investigation into Yahoo's failure to immediately inform its users of the situation.   Six other senators sent a letter to Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, on Sept. 27, calling the delayed announcement ''unacceptable'' and asking for more information about ''how Yahoo intends to safeguard data and protect its users, both now and in the future.''   Security-breach notification laws exist in 47 states already. More legislation is pending.

American Universities in a Gulf of Hypocrisy; On Campus,"WASHINGTON - Cyberespionage may be the new normal, but you wouldn't think that an American graduate student would be a target for state-level spyware and surveillance. Apparently, though, I am. On May 19, I awoke to an email from an unfamiliar sender, ""Wahedk87,"" with the subject line ""Planned visit to Qatar."" The email warned me that ""the U.A.E. authorities have informed their counterparts in Qatar regarding your planned visit"" and accused me of conducting a ""dirty mission"" to ""gather some confidential information."" In college at New York University, in 2013, I had spent a semester of study abroad in the United Arab Emirates; I am now a master's candidate at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and at the time of Wahedk87's email I was a week away from traveling to Qatar. My ""dirty mission"" was my thesis research, and the ""confidential information"" I sought was about the labor conditions of migrant workers in the capital, Doha.  Working with a cybersecurity expert, I learned that my personal email had been hacked twice in April. In advance of the hack, the attacker sent me bait emails including a fake BBC News alert about migrant labor abuses in Qatar. Once the hacker had access, he synced my personal email to an external account. This granted access to every message I had sent and received since my account's inception four years ago. When I landed in Qatar in June, Wahedk87's threat became clear. I was denied entry and detained at the airport in Doha. Qatari immigration officers informed me that my name appeared on a ""blacklist"" maintained by member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council because I had ""made trouble"" in the U.A.E. Later, Emirati officials told the State Department that they had placed me on the blacklist for unspecified ""security-related reasons."" From this, I suspect that it was the U.A.E., an ally of the American government, that hacked my email and shared its intelligence about my research plans with the Qatari authorities. In 2013, while studying at New York University Abu Dhabi, I condemned the treatment of migrant workers who were building my university's new campus on Saadiyat Island, an estimated $1 billion enterprise. In 2014, a New York Times investigation documented the deplorable treatment of those workers, including the unlawful deportation of hundreds for striking while working on the N.Y.U. project. I was eventually allowed into Qatar on a tourist visa, but I remained under surveillance, at times followed by officers I was told were from state security. In August, the Qatari government rejected my application for a student visa to study at Georgetown Qatar this fall. Georgetown's response to my ban was troubling, stating that ""access to study and residence visas varies across individuals and over time."" The administration stressed that they take academic freedom very seriously, even as the university is expanding ""to work in increasingly difficult places."" N.Y.U., my alma mater, had made similar statements after the Emirati authorities denied access to one of its professors, Andrew Ross, in March 2015. He had also been traveling to the U.A.E. to conduct research into migrant worker abuses. N.Y.U. said that it supported the ""free movement of people and ideas,"" but that ""it is the government that controls visa and immigration policy, and not the university."" The administration also offered the somewhat self-serving argument that N.Y.U.'s ""presence in these nations and societies brings more freedom of ideas, not less."" These responses seem uninformed or disingenuous. Both Qatar and the U.A.E. use sophisticated internet attack tools to execute what Human Rights Watch recently called a ""systematic and well-funded assault on free speech to subvert the potentially transformative impact of social media and internet technology."" Generally, it is the citizens of these gulf countries, not foreign visitors, who face the worst of such repression. An Emirati professor named Nasser bin Ghaith was detained with no access to his family or a lawyer for nine months, and claimed in a court hearing to have been tortured, for criticizing the government on Twitter. He has been charged under the 2012 Cybercrimes Law that prescribes up to 15 years in prison for people who post content that could ""damage the reputation"" of the U.A.E. leadership. In May, Citizen Lab, a watchdog group based at the University of Toronto, uncovered a five-year campaign of spyware attacks against Emirati journalists, activists and dissidents, including the human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, who has frequently been targeted by hackers since calling for reform in 2011. In August, Mr. Mansoor became known as the ""million-dollar dissident"" after a costly but failed effort by the U.A.E. government to break into his iPhone. It's clear that N.Y.U. and Georgetown do not want to bite the hand that feeds them, but it may not end there. According to reports, a Maryland-based company called CyberPoint International began providing advice on cybersecurity to the United Arab Emirates government in 2012. CyberPoint's contract reportedly ended last year, but the company's former chief strategy officer, Paul Kurtz, who worked in the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, is still chairman of the advisory board of N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi's cybersecurity center. The center also partners with ""government agencies"" in an effort to ""improve cybersecurity in the U.A.E."" and ""more generally in the G.C.C. region."" There is no evidence that CyberPoint was involved in spying, but it is worrying that N.Y.U. is involved in this field with the Emirates, since the government has used its cyber capabilities against its own citizens, and possibly foreign researchers, too. The gulf states are big investors. Announcing the creation of N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi in 2007, the university's former president, John Sexton, explained, ""The costs of planning, designing and building the campus and all expenses related to the operation of N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi will be assumed by the government of Abu Dhabi."" The failure of Georgetown and N.Y.U. to call out the suppression of critical speech suggests the complicity that gulf money buys. The transactional relationships that underpin these American universities' campuses in U.A.E. and Qatar subvert the very academic freedom they're supposed to promote.

Review: 'Zero Days' Examines Cyberwarfare's Potential Online Apocalypse,"Technology: With every seemingly miraculous advance comes the potential for its catastrophic misuse. If you're inclined toward paranoia, Alex Gibney's sobering documentary ""Zero Days,"" about the spread of malware, exposes a whole arena of potential terror and calamitous destruction surrounded in secrecy. We all know that our digital connectedness has a dark side. But online bullying and pornography, for example, are the least of it. The nightmare of push-button nuclear annihilation that has haunted us since the invention of the atomic bomb now has a parallel in the looming specter of large-scale cyberwarfare.  The agent of doomsday explored in the film isn't an exploding object but the manipulation of computer code to destroy the infrastructure of nation-states by gaining control of nuclear plants, disabling power grids and wreaking chaos by, in effect, shutting down the world. To make a documentary on such a complicated, far-reaching subject and maintain a common-sense perspective requires formidable organizational skills and a steady narrative hand to keep the movie from straying into any number of theoretical byways. It takes the imagination of a science-fiction writer to make it coherent and entertaining enough to hold your attention. Mr. Gibney has demonstrated all of these qualities in other documentaries, most pertinently in his takes on WikiLeaks, Steve Jobs, and American torture and interrogation practices in Afghanistan. ""Zero Days"" has a similarly balanced outlook along with a critical political viewpoint that avoids hysteria and demagogy. Its strongest protest is against what Mr. Gibney sees as the dangers of excessive American secrecy. At the same time, the film is an often intimidating slog through jargon and computer code. The most articulate voices helping to bridge the gap between technological vocabulary and everyday speech are two cybersecurity specialists, Eric Chien and Liam O'Murchu from Symantec Research Labs. ""Zero Days"" begins with the true story of a cyberattack against a nuclear power plant in Iran in which uranium-processing centrifuges were programmed to explode. But the sophisticated worm wreaking the havoc spread to computers around the world. This malicious computer virus, the film reveals, was jointly built by the United States and Israel although neither will publicly confirm it. Numerous officials in Washington officials are questioned about its existence, but none acknowledge it, and a sequence of high-level stonewalling makes for dark comedy. The film contends that the secret program, Stuxnet, also known as Olympic Games, has since been identified as part of a broader plan, code-named Nitro Zeus, that could disable Iran's infrastructure. One presence on camera is David E. Sanger, a reporter for The New York Times who calmly puts the development of cyberwarfare into a broad perspective. He is not alone in suggesting that this is now the frontier of modern warfare and that nations are competing fiercely to stay ahead. The United States has portrayed itself as a leader in cyberwarfare defense strategies, but ""Zero Days"" depicts America as an aggressor, and Israel even more so. An argument is made that Stuxnet's secrecy was blown by an Israeli software variant that may have misfired. In any case, after relating the history of Stuxnet, the movie dismisses it as yesterday's news. In documentary filmmaking, as in news writing, there is a fine line between irresponsible alarmism and dispassionate reportage. And Mr. Gibney has a proven record of tiptoeing to the edge without going too far. The movie makes use of an actress, Joanne Tucker, to repeat testimony by several officials that was deemed too sensitive for these sources to appear on camera. Filmed through a digital filter, she resembles the former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame, which gives her scenes the look and tone of a creepy spy thriller. ""Zero Days"" conveys two messages. The broader one, though hardly new, bears repeating and applies as much to advances in medical science as to war. In a hypercompetitive world, it asks, when do we decide not to pursue innovation and hold back for the greater good? Has technology outrun our capacity to control it? Mr. Gibney's biggest immediate worry is that a global lack of transparency has prevented society from negotiating necessary treaties and safeguards. Without them, humanity risks sealing its doom, should countries like the United States be guided by fear and suspicion. ""Zero Days"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some strong language. Running time: 1 hour 56 minutes.

"5 Possible Ways to Hack the Election, and How Much to Worry About Them","WASHINGTON -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia dismisses the idea that he has the power to interfere with Tuesday's election. ''Does anyone seriously think that Russia can affect the choice of the American people?'' he asked during a foreign policy conference last week in the resort city of Sochi. ''What, is America a banana republic? America's a great power. Correct me if I'm wrong.'' America's top intelligence officials say he is highly unlikely to be able to alter the results. But they expect Russian hackers, or others, to try to disrupt the process -- perhaps to help Donald J. Trump, but more likely to simply undercut what Mr. Putin views as America's holier-than-thou attitudes about its democratic procedures.    The Obama administration has concluded that much of the email hacking that has roiled the campaign was almost certainly approved by the Russian leadership. More recent activity -- including the probing of registration rolls in several states -- might be the work of independent Russian hackers, it says. While no one knows what to expect before the polls close, a tight race is more susceptible to mischief.    So government agencies and commercial enterprises, including some hired by state election boards facing a determined cyberthreat for the first time, are on high alert. But they are not exactly sure what to look for. Russian hackers? Other attackers? Malware that harnesses devices to strike election infrastructure? More email revelations?   Dmitri Alperovitch of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm that found the intrusions into the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, said at a Harvard discussion that while the odds that the results could be manipulated were ''minuscule,'' he thought hackers' ultimate goal was ''to discredit the results of the election.'' That is the sort of activity that Russia has long carried out in Ukraine and other former Soviet states.   Federal and state officials are focusing on five possible ways to hack the election. Here is a look at their biggest concerns:   A flood of disclosures   (Possible, but hard to make an impact)    In an election that has already been shaken by a series of disclosures -- from messages hacked by the Russians that ended up in the hands of WikiLeaks to a cache of emails on the computer of former Representative Anthony D. Weiner that might be related to the Hillary Clinton email inquiry -- it is not hard to imagine a last-minute set of revelations. The question is whether they would make much difference.   So far, the steady drip of documents from WikiLeaks and other sites posting stolen emails and even the National Security Agency's tools for breaking into foreign computer networks has not changed the contours of the election. Emails that seemed to show efforts in the Democratic National Committee to tip the scales in favor of Mrs. Clinton in the primaries led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz as the committee's chairwoman, but they had little long-lasting effect. A disclosure from the hacking of the email account of John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, bolstered the notion that Bill Clinton had been enriched by some of the same people who contributed to the Clinton Global Initiative. But that was not exactly a surprise.   Still, no one knows what else hackers might have stolen, or may be saving for the last frenetic days of the campaign.   _____   Interfering with voter registration rolls   (Lots to worry about)   In the spring, the F.B.I. warned Arizona, and then Illinois, that someone was ''probing'' their central voter registration databases, the ever-changing lists of people who are legally registered to vote and where they live. Once, those rolls were kept in big books and dragged to polling places, but today they are held in databases, often connected to websites that make it easier to register online or when getting a driver's license.   The vulnerabilities in big central systems are hard to find, as the federal government learned with the Chinese theft of nearly 22 million security clearance records from the Office of Personnel Management. Chinese hackers were inside the systems for more than a year before the government noticed.   Voter databases are not treated as ''critical infrastructure'' by the federal government, the way that the Washington Monument or the power grid is. That is largely because few had the foresight to consider that a foreign attacker could tinker just enough to cause chaos on Election Day. ''We've thought in terms of structures,'' Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said recently. ''Data is taking on a much larger value in and of itself.'' But he noted that ''it's the states' responsibility.''   Yet many states have underinvested in their systems, and that is why there is so much concern. Few states even sample their systems to see if the data is correct, so they might not be able to detect a problem. Starting this summer, the Department of Homeland Security has raced to perform tests in states that asked for help -- all but a few have -- but the process was rushed, and the government will not say what it found.   The fear is that intruders could make minor changes in addresses or other identifying information, leading to long lines and accusations of ''rigging'' the polls. Voters could cast provisional ballots, but it could take months to sort out.   _____   Manipulating the count reported to news organizations   (A significant risk, but detectable)   Consider this possibility: It is Tuesday evening, and the networks and other news organizations are clamoring for ''unofficial'' results so they can call the races in swing states. The precincts report returns to regional centers, and that data flows to The Associated Press, the clearinghouse for unverified returns. If hackers could flip such ''data in motion,'' they could alter the first call, even if it is an unofficial one. If the numbers then swing back in the official tally, cries of foul play -- that the numbers got manipulated before the final calculation -- would surely follow.   Sound far-fetched? It happened recently in Ukraine, in an attack organized by Russia, experts believe. As Ben Buchanan and Michael Sulmeyer note in a Harvard Cyber Security Project report, investigations revealed that ''offenders were trying by means of previously installed software to fake election results.'' The effort was discovered 40 minutes before the results were scheduled for announcement. The Harvard report notes that ''curiously, pro-Russian TV nonetheless reported the fake results exactly.''   _____   An internet disruption that makes it hard to get to the polls   (The new big fear)   When internet connections across the East Coast slowed to a crawl on Oct. 21, after a sophisticated attack on a company that serves as a ''switchboard'' of the web, it illustrated a new fear for Election Day: an attack that comes just as voters are looking at their phones to find their polling place, or trying, for instance, to figure out if the bus will get them there.   That hack was a new twist on an old, crude technique: a ''distributed denial of service'' attack that overwhelms websites or the internet's traffic systems with a barrage of data. In the Oct. 21 attack, which is not believed to have been conducted by a foreign power, internet-connected devices like security cameras were infiltrated and programmed en masse to attack Dyn DNS, a firm that helps connect web searches to the right internet sites.   Such an attack could be directed, for example, at computer systems used by a campaign's ''get out the vote'' efforts. ''People think of denial-of-service attacks as very broad,'' said Andy Ellis, the chief security officer at Akamai, a firm that helps companies maintain web connectivity. ''But they can be very targeted, very specific, and hard to defend against.''   The Department of Homeland Security is setting up a war room for Tuesday to look for trouble, connected to the F.B.I. and the Justice Department. But they look primarily at the federal government system. And the National Security Agency, presumably, is turning on the ''implants'' it has placed in foreign systems to detect any attacks. Those implants are all highly classified, so the N.S.A. is silent about what it can see -- or what it could do if it saw the prelude to an attack.   _____   Tinkering with voting machines   (Unlikely, but possible)   At every opportunity, federal and state officials are reminding everyone that voting differs from state to state, or even county to county. That makes it hard to hack.   ''The voting machines themselves are offline, and we think the system is so diversified it is secure,'' said Suzanne E. Spaulding, the under secretary of Homeland Security who oversees cybersecurity efforts.   Outside election experts fear, however, that this nothing-to-see-here confidence fails to take into account known vulnerabilities. While most voting machines are not connected to the internet while voting is underway, they are often connected before Election Day, to update their ballots and software.   Some machines, like the DS200, an optical scanning model used in many districts, comes with an optional wireless ability. The good news: They can report results automatically. The bad news: Any wireless connection is a vulnerability.   There are other worries. Five states do not have paper backups to create an audit trail if the electronic ballots are questioned. Pennsylvania, a swing state, has paper backups in only some communities. Members of the military who are based overseas are often permitted to email their ballots, and Alaskans can use what the state calls ''secure online delivery.''   ''The D.N.C. hack and the release of the emails are a wake-up call,'' said Susannah Goodman, the director of voting integrity for Common Cause. ''Emailing is not something you would do with your Social Security number,'' she added. ''So why would you do it with your ballot?''

Yahoo Reveals Largest Breach Ever Reported,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Yahoo, already reeling from its September disclosure that 500 million user accounts had been hacked in 2014, disclosed Wednesday that a different attack in 2013 compromised more than 1 billion accounts. The two attacks are the largest known security breaches of one company's computer network.    The newly disclosed 2013 attack involved sensitive user information, including names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and unencrypted security questions that could be used to reset a password. Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions -- steps that it declined to take in September.    It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked.   Yahoo said it discovered the larger hacking after analyzing data files, provided by law enforcement, that an unnamed third party had claimed contained Yahoo information.   Security has taken a back seat at Yahoo in recent years, compared to Silicon Valley competitors like Google and Facebook. Yahoo's security team clashed with top executives, including the chief executive, Marissa Mayer, over the cost and customer inconvenience of proposed security measures.   And critics say the company was slow to adopt aggressive security measures, even after a breach of over 450,000 accounts in 2012 and series of spam attacks -- a mass mailing of unwanted messages -- the following year.   ''What's most troubling is that this occurred so long ago, in August 2013, and no one saw any indication of a breach occurring until law enforcement came forward,'' said Jay Kaplan, the chief executive of Synack, a security company. ''Yahoo has a long way to go to catch up to these threats.''   Yahoo has made a steady trickle of disclosures about the 2014 hacking, which it has been investigating with the help of federal authorities. The company said Wednesday that it now believes the attacker in that breach, which it says was sponsored by a government, found a way to forge credentials to log into some users' accounts without a password.   Bob Lord, Yahoo's chief information security officer, said in a statement that the state-sponsored actor in the 2014 attack had stolen Yahoo's proprietary source code. Outside forensics experts working with Yahoo believe that the state-sponsored hackers used Yahoo's code to access user accounts without their passwords by creating forged ''cookies,'' short bits of text that a website can store on a user's machine. By forging these cookies, attackers were able to impersonate valid users, gaining information and performing actions on behalf of their victims. The company has not disclosed who it believes was behind the attack.   In July, Yahoo agreed to sell its core businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. Verizon said in October that it might seek to renegotiate the terms of the transaction because of the hacking, which had not been disclosed to Verizon during the original deal talks.   After the latest disclosure Wednesday, a Verizon spokesman, Bob Varettoni, essentially repeated that position.   ''As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation,'' he said. ''We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions.''   Mr. Lord said Yahoo had taken steps to strengthen Yahoo's systems after the attacks. The company encouraged its users to change passwords associated with their Yahoo account and any other digital accounts tied to their Yahoo email and account.   In the hacking disclosed Wednesday, Mr. Lord said Yahoo believed an ''unauthorized third party'' managed to steal data from one billion Yahoo user accounts. Mr. Lord said that Yahoo had not been able to identify how the hackers breached Yahoo's systems, but that the company believed the attack occurred in August 2013.   Changing Yahoo passwords will be just the start for many users. They will also have to comb through other services to make sure passwords used on those sites are not too similar to what they were using on Yahoo. And if they were not doing so already, they will have to treat everything they receive online, such as email, with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick them out of even more information.   Yahoo recommended that its customers use Yahoo Account Key, an authentication tool that verifies a user's identity using a mobile phone and eliminates the need to use a password on Yahoo altogether.   Security experts say the latest discovery of a breach that happened so long ago is another black mark for the company. ''It's not just one sophisticated adversary that gets in,'' said Ben Johnson, co-founder and chief security strategist at Carbon Black, a security company. ''Typically companies get compromised multiple times due to the same vulnerability or employee culture.''   Mr. Johnson added that the scale of the breaches is only increasing as companies store more and more troves of information in similar databases. ''When you have these huge databases of information, it's millions -- and now billions -- of accounts lost,'' he said.     "
White House Confirms Pre-Election Warning to Russia Over Hacking,"WASHINGTON - Over the past month, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has received two starkly different messages about hacking into American computer networks from the current and future presidents of the United States: Don't you dare, and don't worry, we're not even sure it was you. The White House confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that eight days before the presidential election, the United States ""contacted the Russian government directly regarding malicious cyberactivity"" that was ""targeting U.S. state election-related systems."" It sent the message over a rarely used system: a hotline connecting the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in both countries, which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major cyberincidents.  The pre-election warning - only the latest after verbal cautions by President Obama, his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence - was reported by The Washington Post. The warnings to Russia against further hacking into polling or registration systems, or any further effort to affect the outcome of the election, are being hailed by the Obama administration as a success in deterrence. After all, they argue, a year and a half of Russian hacking activity seemed to slow, or halt, and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on Election Day. But more than a few experts in deterring cyberattacks take a more skeptical view. They say the Russians had already achieved their main goal: to demonstrate how they could disrupt the American electoral process with the leak of hacked emails, including from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. Mr. Putin suffered nothing worse than a warning, they note - no sanctions, no counter cyberstrikes, no embarrassing revelations engineered by the United States. And he now has the satisfaction of dealing with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who during the campaign praised him, promised to build a more productive relationship with Russia and maintained there was no evidence that the Russians were behind the hacking. ""Anytime anything wrong happens they like to"" blame the Russians, Mr. Trump said in an Oct. 10 debate with Mrs. Clinton. ""She doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking."" Mr. Trump contended that the allegations of Russian activity were intended to ""tarnish me"" for advocating a new relationship with Moscow. He frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the campaign, suggesting the hacking was a fabrication. The leaks of emails worked largely to his advantage, embarrassing Democratic leaders like Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Trump's larger strategic message is that the United States and Russia need to cooperate on a range of issues. But for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of American foreign policy and gives Mr. Putin the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until Mr. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. It is also raising the question of whether the Obama White House pushed back hard enough when American intelligence agencies concluded on Oct. 7 that ""only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities."" James A. Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, dismissed the administration's claim that it had deterred Russia's hacking. ""It seems a little bold to claim this is a success for deterrence, since the Russians weren't deterred from doing anything,"" he said. ""Their hacking work was mostly complete. The issue now is whether they will be deterred in the future, and the guessing is they will not. Strong private warnings aren't enough to constitute deterrence."" In fact, the Russians appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than North Korea did for its attack on SonyPictures Entertainment in 2014. That attack melted down about 70 percent of Sony's computers and servers at its studios, wreaking considerable damage, and embarrassed many Sony executives. It was in response to the release of a movie, ""The Interview,"" that imagined a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. After the Sony episode, the United States issued more sanctions against North Korea and encouraged China to limit the North's internet access, all of which runs through Chinese switching centers. Many experts had expected the White House to follow a similar path with Russia. Instead, the White House concluded that the warnings, and the unstated suggestion that the United States had the power to reach inside Russian networks and see the origin of attacks, might suffice. It is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against Russia before Mr. Obama's departure from office, but that seems less and less likely. The Oct. 31 warning did not deal with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or Mr. Podesta's account, which James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the Russian leadership. Instead, it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process itself, and the fear it was originating from Russian territory, though it stopped short of saying it was a state-sponsored attack.

Pentagon: Looking for a Few Good Hackers; Editorial,"In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management announced that foreign hackers had stolen the personnel records of millions of federal employees, one of the most damaging cyberattacks in history. Just weeks later, the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shut down its unclassified email system for several days after officials detected that it had been breached.  These serious intrusions came months after a group affiliated with the Islamic State briefly commandeeredthe Central Command's Twitter account and rebranded it as the ""Cyber Caliphate."" Given the enormity of the problem, one of the responses by the Department of Defense might seem befuddling. They've asked hackers willing to play by strict rules to find vulnerabilities in some of the Pentagon's unclassified computer system. Well-intentioned computer security experts routinely scan the internet in search of vulnerabilities, which they often map out and report. Until now, doing that on Pentagon sites carried the considerable legal risk of running afoul of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. ""Hack the Pentagon"" kicked off in April with a monthlong trial program that attracted 1,400 so-called white hackers to fiddle with Department of Defense websites on the hunt for weak points that could be exploited to steal data or jam systems. Those hackers spotted 138 weaknesses, according to the Pentagon, and were paid $75,000 in rewards. Encouraged by the results, the Defense Department last week announced a formal policy permitting outside computer experts to test for vulnerabilities in the system and report them to the department. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter called the initiative ""a 'see something, say something' policy for the digital domain."" Those hackers won't be paid for their reports, but officials hope they will do it out of a sense of duty. In addition, the department has started ""Hack the Army,"" a program asking hackers who have been approved by the government to test the Army's recruiting websites for weaknesses. While these efforts represent just one aspect of the federal government's effort to protect secret data more rigorously, Mr. Carter deserves credit for championing an unconventional approach. ""Hack the Pentagon"" and ""Hack the Army"" allows defense officials to draw from a talent pool that includes people who would not ordinarily feel at home in the military's hierarchical culture. It may well turn into an unconventional recruitment pipeline for an organization that always benefits from outside perspectives and carefully calibrated disruption.

Hacked Yahoo Data Is for Sale on Dark Web,"SAN FRANCISCO - Some time around August 2013, hackers penetrated the email system of Yahoo, one of the world's largest and oldest providers of free email services. The attackers quietly scooped up the records of more than 1 billion users, including names, birth dates, phone numbers and passwords that were encrypted with an easily broken form of security. The intruders also obtained the security questions and backup email addresses used to reset lost passwords - valuable information for someone trying to break into other accounts owned by the same user, and particularly useful to a hacker seeking to break into government computers around the world: Several million of the backup addresses belonged to military and civilian government employees from dozens of nations, including more than 150,000 Americans. No one knows what happened to the data during the next three years. But last August, a geographically dispersed hacking collective based in Eastern Europe quietly began offering the whole database for sale, according to Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity firm, who monitors the dark corners of the internet inhabited by criminals, spies and spammers. Three buyers - two known spammers and an entity that appeared more interested in espionage - paid about $300,000 each for a complete copy of the database, he said.  The attack, which Yahoo disclosed on Wednesday, is the largest known data breach of a company. And neither Yahoo nor the public had any idea it had occurred until a month ago, when law enforcement authorities came to the company with samples of the hacked data from an undisclosed source. Yahoo still does not know who broke into its systems in 2013, how they got in or what they did with the data, the company said Wednesday. It has made more progress tracking down a separate hacking episode in 2014, which compromised 500 million email accounts and was disclosed in September. The company has said it believes the 2014 attack was sponsored by a government entity but has not identified it. The two huge breaches revealed this fall threaten to erode consumer confidence in the company and are endangering its deal to sell its internet businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. On Thursday, Yahoo's stock plunged 6 percent as investors worried that Verizon would abandonthe purchase. Mr. Komarov said in an interview on Thursday that his company obtained a copy of the database and over the last few months alerted military and law enforcement authorities in the United States, Australia, Canada, Britain and the European Union about the breach. After those parties verified the authenticity of the stolen records, he said, some of them went to Yahoo with their concerns. InfoArmor did not go to Yahoo directly, Mr. Komarov said, because the internet giant was dismissive of the security firm when approached by an intermediary. He also said he did not trust Yahoo to thoroughly investigate the breach since it could threaten the sale to Verizon. Mr. Komarov worked in counterterrorism before joining Group-IB, a Moscow security firm. In 2013, he and a colleague left to form IntelCrawler, which drew attention for its work tracking the Syrian Electronic Army and the young hacker behind a large breach of the retailer Target's systems. IntelCrawler was acquired by InfoArmor in 2015. Yahoo said Thursday that it could not verify Mr. Komarov's claims, which were made public in a Bloomberg article on Wednesday. ""The limited InfoArmor data set provided to us by Bloomberg, based on initial analysis, could be associated with the data file provided to us by law enforcement,"" the company said in a statement. ""That said, if InfoArmor has a report or more information, Yahoo would want to assess that before further comment."" The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was investigating the Yahoo breach. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York also said his office was in touch with Yahoo to examine the circumstances of the data breach. Verizon has said that it is weighing its options, which range from demanding a price cut to walking away altogether. Yahoo may still prove attractive, given the sheer size of its user base. But a huge defection of users would drastically lessen its value to Verizon. The question will be whether the telecom giant can be shielded from potential legal liability. Verizon already has an army of lawyers from heavyweight firms like Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advising it on the deal. If Verizon tried to walk away, the company could still find itself ensnared in a long legal battle. Efforts by companies to wiggle out of deals - usually by exercising escape hatches in transaction contracts - have often failed. Security experts and former government officials warned that the real danger of the Yahoo attack was not that hackers gained access to Yahoo users' email accounts, but that they obtained the credentials to hunt down more lucrative information about their targets wherever it resided across the web. ""This wasn't an attack against Yahoo, but rather reconnaissance to launch other campaigns,"" said Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency who now runs Area 1, a Silicon Valley security start-up. ""Inactive or not, a billion user accounts and hashes means attackers have a golden key for new phishing attacks,"" he said. In a phishing attack, a hacker often poses as a trusted contact and tries to induce the recipient of an email to click on a malicious link or share sensitive information. Users routinely ignore advice to use different passwords for their different accounts across the web, which means a stolen Yahoo user name and password could open the door to more sensitive information in online-banking, corporate or government email accounts. Mr. Komarov said the group that hacked Yahoo in 2013, which he calls Group E, appeared to be motivated by money, not politics. It is believed to have broken into the systems of major American internet companies like LinkedIn, Myspace, Dropbox and Tumblr, as well as foreign-owned services like VKontakte, a Russian social network similar to Facebook. Group E sometimes sells complete copies of the data, Mr. Komarov said. It also combines information from different hacking forays into a master database. Like a corporate marketer, it peddles chunks of the data to spammers seeking to reach specific audiences, like middle-aged women who live in certain ZIP codes. It sometimes operates through intermediaries. Hold Security, another firm that monitors the so-called dark web, said that as recently as the end of October, hackers were actively trying to sell the stolen Yahoo data for as much as $200,000. At the time, the sellers told Hold Security employees that they had been given access to a live Yahoo database through what they claimed was an intermediary at ""DepartmentK,"" a part of the Russian Interior Ministry that combats high-tech crimes. But when Hold Security employees pressed the sellers for samples of the live data, they were instead given screenshots of a stale Yahoo database from 2013, said Alex Holden, the chief executive of Hold Security. That database of 1 billion Yahoo accounts, Mr. Komarov said, is still for sale, although current bids are coming in at $20,000 to $50,000 since the data is much less valuable now that Yahoo has changed the passwords. ""There is now huge interest in Yahoo's database,"" he said. ""We know that there will be some new deals."" Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

How to Win Putin's Information War,"Mark Galeotti is a senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations Prague. PRAGUE -- Welcome to 21st-century conflict, more Machiavellian than military, where hacks, leaks and fake news are taking the place of planes, bombs and missiles. The Russian interference in the United States presidential election is just a taste of more to come. How can countries protect themselves from such methods? As with nuclear weapons, deterrence is better than confrontation. The United States and its allies in the West need to find a way to discourage Russia, the leading practitioner of this kind of political warfare, from striking first.     With nuclear weapons, deterrence relies on demonstrating the possession of similar capabilities -- and the will to use them. This won't work with political warfare.   It is not as though the United States hasn't dabbled in destabilization and disinformation campaigns. But these tactics are less likely to work in Russia, where the news media is mostly state-controlled, the security apparatus quickly stamps out political threats, and citizens have few illusions about their leaders. (For example, when the Panama Papers revealed that President Vladimir V. Putin's cronies had  secret bank accounts, most Russians simply shrugged, unsurprised.) All that such efforts would do is show Russians that Mr. Putin is right to say the West is no better than him.   What Russia's president fears is failure. His macho political persona relies on the conceit that he never gets things wrong, and that he can, with the help of hackers, special forces or brutal allies, outmaneuver the West and consequently regain Russia's status as a global power.   This is why the United States and its allies should pursue a strategy of deterrence by denial. Mr. Putin shouldn't fear retaliation for his information warfare -- he should fear that he will fail.   There are several ways to go about this. First, United States institutions need better cybersecurity defenses. Political parties and major newspapers are now targets just as much as the power grid and the Pentagon are. The government has to help provide security when it can -- but people have a duty to be more vigilant and recognize that their cybersecurity is about protecting the country, not just their own email accounts. The leaked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, revealed how easily hackers fooled intelligent political operatives with phishing attacks.   Instead of trying to combat each leak directly, the United States government should teach the public to tell when they are being manipulated. Via schools and nongovernmental organizations and public service campaigns, Americans should be taught the basic skills necessary to be savvy media consumers, from how to fact-check news articles to how pictures can lie.   Deterrence can also take the form of limiting the Russians' ability to buy media muscle covertly. Global finance is still gangsters and the spooks' best friend, allowing them to secretly move and spend money. By joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's latest and most stringent Common Reporting Standards agreement for sharing financial information, for example, and by putting pressure on American states with notoriously tough secrecy laws, Washington would make it harder for not just corrupt Russians officials but also Moscow's security apparatus to spend money at will in America.   But the United States also needs to declare in advance, and with evident resolve, the kinds of actions it would take in response to certain political attacks. Russia has been taking advantage of the weaknesses and freedoms of the West, so the West should similarly strike back against Russia's vulnerabilities.   For example, punitive measures like sanctions can be a very powerful weapon against the opportunist kleptocrats on whom Mr. Putin relies for support. Media owners whose networks spread disinformation, members of Parliament who cultivate extremists, and oligarchs who allow themselves to be used as Kremlin front men should all be fair game. Treating them like members of an organized crime syndicate would allow Washington to freeze not only their assets, but also those of their families, and bar them from entry.   The West also needs to stand together against the Kremlin's divide-and-rule tactics. NATO members are committed by treaty to defending one another from military attacks, but there aren't similar provisions for cyberattacks or information warfare. Many smaller countries hesitate to play their part in fighting Russian espionage and subversion -- whether expelling spies or closing front organizations -- because they fear Russia's inevitable retaliation. The United States needs to promise its allies it will support them.   Finally, Mr. Putin's own vanity could be turned into a weapon against him. Every time he overreaches, the American government should point it out. Every time he fails, we need to say so loudly and clearly. We should tell jokes about him. He can rewrite the record in Russia, but the West does not have to contribute to his mythmaking -- and we should stop building him up by portraying him as a virtual supervillain.   All of this requires a new mind-set. It means accepting that Russia has chosen to be at war with us -- albeit a special and limited war. Russia needs to be treated as a political combatant.   It also means remembering how much stronger the United States is than Russia, economically, militarily, diplomatically and even politically. Mr. Putin is a geopolitical guerrilla who has adopted a strategy he hopes can play to his own strengths and circumvent the West's. Now the West needs to demonstrate that it has a strategy to combat his adventurism.

Roger Goodell Is Not Dead. It Was Another Twitter Hoax.,"The N.F.L. became the latest victim in a string of recent high-profile Twitter hoaxes and hackings after its verified account sent a series of tweets saying that Roger Goodell, the league's commissioner, had died. ""We regret to inform our fans that our commissioner, Roger Goodell, has passed away. He was 57. #RIP,"" the hoax tweet read.  Initially a flurry of posts expressing shock of the death went up after the tweet about Mr. Goodell, a polarizing figure in his 10 years as commissioner. But others, battle-worn from days of recent Twitter hoaxes targeting celebrities like Jack Black, Mark Zuckerberg, Katy Perry and Drake quickly turned skeptical: Something just didn't seem quite right about this one. The tweet was quickly deleted - but the hacker (or hackers) doubled down. ""Oi, I said Roger Goodell has died,"" an insistent follow-up tweet read. ""Don't delete that tweet."" ""The N.F.L. Twitter account was hacked,"" Brian McCarthy, the league's vice president of communications, said in an email. He added, ""We have engaged law enforcement to look into the matter. We are reviewing and strengthening our cybersecurity measures."" Mr. Goodell jokingly weighed in with a post on his personal Twitter account hours later. Man, you leave the office for 1 day of golf w/ @JimKelly1212 & your own network kills you off. #harshpic.twitter.com/BvtBVzdYTc - Roger Goodell (@nflcommish) June 7, 2016 Mr. Goodell most likely won't be the last victim of what seems to be a spree of hackings committed by people who appear to be using leaked data to gain access to myriad social media accounts. Indeed, minutes after the N.F.L. account was hacked, suspicious tweets began emanating from the singer Lana Del Rey's account. (Like those sent from the N.F.L., those tweets were quickly deleted.) While the N.F.L. hoax was deliberately used to spread bad information, the apparent breach against Ms. Del Rey resulted in the posting of gibberish and offensive statements similar to those in other hacks, including the one against Ms. Perry. In a statement about the hacks, Twitter said: ""A number of other online services have seen millions of passwords stolen in the past several weeks, and we know far too many people use the same password for multiple things online. We recommend people to use a unique, strong password for Twitter."" It's hard to say if the hoaxes were part of a coordinated attack on high-profile accounts, but the rapid-fire timing would suggest some planning. The millions of account names and passwords leaked in data breaches of social media platforms, including LinkedIn and Myspace, suggested that hackers are targeting accounts for which one password was used for multiple accounts. In May, LinkedIn said that hackers were attempting to sell what they claimed were 117 million email addresses and passwords of its users, suggesting that a data breach in 2012 was much larger than initially thought. ""It's quite possible that the LinkedIn breach is to blame again,"" Graham Cluley, an online security expert and consultant, wrote in an email about the N.F.L. hoax. ""Fundamental truth is that too many people reuse passwords, or have failed to enable two-step verification on their Twitter accounts."" Further complicating the N.F.L. hoax was the fact that the hackers had breached an organization's verified account, where death notices are frequently posted to a curious public. One easy way to spot a hoax on Twitter is to check if the tweet had been posted using a different social media application than is usually used for that account. The N.F.L. usually tweets using social applications like Spredfast. The hoax tweet came from Twitter's web client. For their part, the hackers quickly responded when they realized they'd been caught: ""OK, OK, you amateur detectives win. Good job."" Daniel Victor contributed reporting.

Does the Messaging Service Telegram Take Privacy Too Far?,"PARIS -- The encryption of digital information is considered the best protection against hackers, snoops or potential enemies looking to poke around into private exchanges of all sorts. That is why technology experts and privacy advocates in Europe went on high alert last month when the French Ministry of the Interior suggested that it might limit encryption as part of the fight against terrorist threats.    That fear abated somewhat on Aug. 23 when the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, at a joint news  conference with his German counterpart, Thomas de Maizière, stepped back from a more sweeping proposal. Instead, he pressed for a coordinated international effort to get messaging services to comply with judicial warrants for information.    Mr. Cazeneuve named one such service: Telegram, a three-year-old messaging application, that is a favorite of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which has claimed responsibility for a series of terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years.   According to news reports, killers in two attacks in France this summer -- one against two police officers and the other in a church in Normandy, during which they slit the throat of a Catholic priest -- were exchanging messages on Telegram, even boasting of their plans. In August, Telegram was again used in two abortive cases, one involving a 16-year-old girl.   Telegram's vaunted privacy safeguards, involving multiple servers in different countries, are designed to prevent access to information about its users, even by the service itself.   At the news conference, Mr. Cazeneuve admitted as much but claimed that French investigators, armed with a court order, had been unable to even contact ''an interlocutor'' at Telegram.   In response to a query on his Telegram account, Pavel Durov, co-founder of the service, batted back the widely reported French claims.   ''We haven't received any such request and have no idea what the French officials are after,'' he wrote. ''In any case, Telegram Secret Chats and information on them are not logged on our servers.''   Last November, after attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead, Telegram scrubbed 78 Islamic State- related public channels hosted on its servers, but Mr. Durov  insisted that privacy would remain paramount on the rest of the service.   Mr. Durov's background explains his die-hard libertarian attitude on privacy. He left his native Russia in 2014 after refusing to give intelligence information about Ukrainian protesters.   However, most privacy advocates agree that messaging services should cooperate with court-issued warrants, even if they are unable to provide investigators with complete information about their users.   ''There is an issue with Telegram,'' said Mounir Mahjoubi, president of the National Digital Council, an independent advisory group established by former President Nicolas Sarkozy that focuses on privacy issues. ''They had done everything to make it a technological nightmare to find where their server is.''   At a time of heightened public anxiety over terrorism, technology companies and privacy advocates are wary about politicians looking to mandate ''back door'' access to encrypted data.   This, they say, would not only violate privacy rights but put the wider public at an even greater risk, leaving users even more vulnerable to terrorists and other criminals.   Mr. Mahjoubi, for one, supports alternative approaches, such as an international network that could call on judges in individual countries to swiftly react to requests from antiterrorism investigators.   These ideas also are also backed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying organization that counts Amazon, Google and Microsoft among its members.   ''Cyberspace blurs the notion of national jurisdictions, and companies are caught in the middle,'' said Christian Borggreen, the organization's Europe director. ''The tech industry encourages like-minded nations to develop international frameworks for quicker response to law enforcement requests while respecting users' right and the rule of law.''   That kind of targeted approach -- aimed at criminals, not at privacy -- would be more effective than a blank check for law enforcement to break open encoded messages, Mr. Mahjoubi said.   ''I am deeply and heartily against any effort to limit encryption,'' he said, ''and I will fight my whole life against that possibility.''     "
A Cyberattack and Medical Devices,"To the Editor: Re ''When Crib Monitors Double as Web Weaponry'' (front page, Oct. 23):     While many experienced the recent internet attack as a fleeting inconvenience, it portends much more.   As you described, the hack channeled millions of unprotected devices from a widening class of appliances on the Internet of Things (IoT). But the IoT is more than just a hodgepodge of interconnected refrigerators and security cameras; a growing subset is medical instruments and recreational devices -- like heartbeat-monitoring watches -- that report back medically relevant information.   The attack exposed the pervasive lack of cybersecurity for these devices.   With medical IoT, hacking threats are scarier than just a night without Netflix and Twitter; they threaten the privacy of our medical information, or in extremely malicious cases, even lives.   The cross-border portability of many IoT devices means that regulatory control will be ineffective in enforcing security. Rather, there needs to be industrywide cooperation that adopts useful standards before something worse happens.    DOV GREENBAUM   MARK GERSTEIN   Lawrence, N.Y.

Ex-Bush Adviser Named to a Top Security Post,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald J. Trump has named Thomas P. Bossert, a top national security aide under President George W. Bush, to be his homeland security adviser, the Trump transition team announced Tuesday morning. Mr. Bossert will become assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position the transition team said would be equal in status to that of Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump has chosen to be his national security adviser. The same position under President Obama has been a deputy national security adviser.     The change in rank ''reflects the unwavering commitment President-elect Trump has to the safety and security of the nation, its people and territory,'' the transition team said in a statement.   ''Mr. Bossert will focus on domestic and transnational security priorities as General Michael Flynn remains steadfastly focused on international security challenges,'' it said.   Officials on Mr. Obama's national security team challenged the assertion that Mr. Bossert had been elevated to a higher position than his counterpart in the current administration, Lisa Monaco, who also has the title assistant to the president.   A senior national security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters relating to the incoming administration, noted that Ms. Monaco was the chairwoman of the Principals Committee of the Homeland Security Council, had a seat on the National Security Council and participated alongside the national security adviser during daily national security briefings for Mr. Obama.   The new designation for Mr. Bossert may suggest a desire by the new administration to reconfigure the national security apparatus at the White House.   Before Mr. Obama, the homeland security adviser oversaw a staff that was separate from the one run by the national security adviser. Mr. Obama combined those into a single, unified staff when he came into office. Mr. Trump may be thinking about splitting them again.   In the statement, Mr. Trump called Mr. Bossert ''an invaluable asset'' and praised the breadth of experience he would bring to the new administration. ''He has a handle on the complexity of homeland security, counterterrorism and cybersecurity challenges,'' Mr. Trump said.   Mr. Bossert served as deputy homeland security adviser for Mr. Bush, and he runs a risk management consulting firm in Washington. He is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, working on the research institution's Cyber Statecraft Initiative.   Helping to protect the country from cybercrimes is likely to be a major focus for Mr. Bossert in light of the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other incidents in recent years. Mr. Bossert will face the challenge of balancing cybersecurity needs against the privacy concerns of internet companies.   ''We must work toward cyber doctrine that reflects the wisdom of free markets, private competition and the important but limited role of government in establishing and enforcing the rule of law, honoring the rights of personal property, the benefits of free and fair trade, and the fundamental principles of liberty,'' Mr. Bossert said in the statement announcing his appointment.   News of Mr. Bossert's selection drew praise from some members of Congress and former colleagues in the Bush administration, who described him as capable and knowledgeable about threats to the country.   Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island, also praised the choice. Mr. Langevin, a founder of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said Mr. Bossert had approached the issues of cyberthreats in a ''centrist, bipartisan'' manner.   ''I also hope that he will impress upon the president-elect the vital national security concerns tied to Russian information warfare activities, and I encourage him to work closely with Congress in attempting to build our resilience and our defenses to forestall such operations in the future,'' Mr. Langevin said in a statement.   Frances F. Townsend, who was Mr. Bush's homeland security adviser, said she was confident that Mr. Bossert would ''continue to demonstrate the capacity and insight needed to take on the tough challenges facing the country.''   She focused in particular on Mr. Bossert's expertise in another key part of the job: responding to natural disasters and other crises that require coordination among the White House, governors and other state officials.   In a brief text message, Ms. Townsend called Mr. Bossert a ''great pick'' and recalled that he had helped lead the ''after-action review'' after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, helping to create more than 100 recommendations about how to better respond to such crises. ''Tom knows the importance of public-private partnerships and most importantly how best to establish and strengthen them,'' she said.   Also on Tuesday, the transition team formally announced that Jason D. Greenblatt, the chief legal officer of the Trump Organization and a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, would serve as his special representative for international negotiations. Mr. Greenblatt has been the president-elect's business attorney for years, and in a statement, Mr. Trump called him ''one of my closest and most trusted advisers.''   ''He has a history of negotiating substantial, complex transactions on my behalf, as well as the expertise to bring parties together and build consensus on difficult and sensitive topics,'' Mr. Trump said.   As the president's special representative, Mr. Greenblatt is likely to focus on peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, renegotiating trade agreements and the relationship between the United States and Cuba, among other international issues.

A New Digital Privacy Protest,"After hackers breached the computer network  of the U.C.L.A. medical center last summer, Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, and her office moved to shore up security across the university system's 10 campuses. Under a program initiated by Ms. Napolitano, the former secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, the university system began installing hardware and software in its data centers that would monitor patterns of digital traffic, like what websites are being visited by faculty and students, or telltale signs of cyber intruders. The program, which was begun with little notice or consultation, soon rankled a group of professors at one campus, Berkeley, which has a deep-seated ethos of academic freedom as the cradle of the free speech movement in the 1960s.    In recent days, the professors have begun speaking out publicly about the issue. ''My primary concern is monitoring the private information of students and faculty in secret,'' said Eric Brewer, a professor of computer science at U.C. Berkeley. ''I'm sure there's good intent. But I can't see a good reason for doing it.''    The resistance from Mr. Brewer and other professors at Berkeley, which is now becoming a public debate with the university system's administrators, raises the issue of how to define academic freedom in the age of online attacks. While some of the professors criticize the monitoring program as one that invades their privacy, the University of California has responded that ''privacy perishes in the absence of security.''   It's part of the larger challenge that fast-moving technology poses for social values. Every day, corporations, government agencies and universities must balance the need for computer security with the expected right to privacy of the people who use their networks. In different settings, there are different rules, expectations and levels of threat.   ''We're really just starting to sort out the risks and rules for digital security and data collection and use,'' said Elana Zeide, a privacy expert at New York University's Information Law Institute.   The Berkeley dispute stands out because of the place and personalities involved. U.C. Berkeley is not only a leading producer of computer science talent, but also a champion of the free speech movement, so any surveillance is regarded as particularly jarring. For her part, Ms. Napolitano, who joined the California university system in 2013, is no stranger to computer security policy, having served four years as the nation's Homeland Security chief.   The faculty group of 11 professors critical of the monitoring program said the university system enacted the program largely in private, with little transparency about what data is being collected. The monitoring could compromise and constrain academic freedom to research topics that some find objectionable, among other repercussions, they said. In a formal meeting with the University of California's chief information officer in December, the professors asked for the program to be halted.   On Jan. 19, Ms. Napolitano's staff responded in a five-page reply declining to do so; the letter was emailed last Friday to the entire Berkeley faculty and others. The University of California defended the security initiative as a measured step under the circumstances, and added that ''for cybersecurity purposes, a risk to what appears to be an isolated system at only one location may in some circumstances create risk across locations or units.''   The university said Ms. Napolitano was not available for an interview. Steve Montiel, press secretary for the president's office, said he was not aware of any complaints from other campuses about the monitoring program.   The roots of the dispute stretch back to the attack disclosed last July at the UCLA Health System, which potentially put the private information of 4.5 million patients at risk. In an interview on Monday, Tom Andriola, chief information officer of the University of California system, said after the medical center attack the system administrators had to ''move swiftly'' to insure against similar breaches.   Some faculty members, he acknowledged, may have understandably felt there was too little consultation. But Mr. Andriola said that ''moving forward the faculty will be deeply involved.''   Last Oct. 27, the president's office issued a short statement describing the new data-tracking program, called the Coordinated Monitoring and Threat Response Initiative. The program's hardware and software are being supplied and run by an outside contractor, Fidelis Cybersecurity. The president's office has set up a Cyber-Risk Governance Committee to oversee programs like the data center monitoring, which includes a Berkeley representative, though not a tenured faculty member.   The faculty members learned about the monitoring program from people who knew it was being put in place, but who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to disclose the information. Once alerted, the faculty group became concerned.   Just what data is being collected and stored in the monitoring program is unclear. The president's office has not explained the data collection and data use practices of the program, the Berkeley professors said.   ''The issue here is the lack of transparency and the lack of shared governance,'' said Greg Niemeyer, director of the Berkeley Center for New Media.   Lawsuits stemming from the UCLA breach last summer prevent the president's office from disclosing details of the monitoring program, according to Rachael Nava, chief operating officer of University of California system, who signed the Jan. 19 letter. In the letter, she said the legal constraint was ''regrettable'' because she could not share additional information that ''might correct some of these misimpressions.''   Mr. Andriola emphasized that the program monitored network traffic rather than mining the contents of email messages, for example. ''This is not spyware,'' he said.   The standard practice at Berkeley, the professors said, had been to immediately delete the so-called log files that show the websites a person had visited or the origin and destination of email traffic. The exception, they said, was if a pattern of network use signaled the suspicion of data theft or a hacker attack. So in the past, they said, the monitoring in Berkeley data centers was light-touch, and targeted.   The worry, Mr. Niemeyer said, is that if network traffic logs are stored, they could be subject to subpoena. An example, he said, might be if a foreign student from China or some other autocratic nation is visiting the websites of dissidents or emailing them.   ''Before, we could just say that we just don't have the records,'' Mr. Niemeyer said. ''Now, it's not clear we wouldn't or the third-party company wouldn't. That is the kind of scenario that is not unlikely.''   Other examples, he said, might be constraints on academic freedom to research topics that some object to -- say, pornography or Satan worship. Such inquiries, in theory, could become the target of congressional investigations into the use of taxpayers' money that supports a major public university like Berkeley.   In December, the Berkeley faculty group met with Mr. Andriola to voice their concerns and call for a stop to the monitoring program. In the Jan. 19 letter from Ms. Nava, she stressed the ''seriousness of the threat.'' The digital attacks can sometimes jump from one network to another, she said.   The Berkeley professors remain unpersuaded. Corporations often monitor the online behavior of their employees, but American universities have a different tradition.   ''It's a pretty settled point that universities go out of their way not to monitor students, faculty and staff,'' said Jeffrey MacKie-Mason, the university librarian at Berkeley. ''Yes, sometimes security concerns trump privacy. But it's something we should have an informed discussion about.''   Mr. Andriola said he welcomed a dialogue with the university faculty as a whole. ''This is not a technology issue,'' he said. ''It is about how to strike a balance between being a very open university while still protecting the assets of the university from nefarious actors.''     "
Hacking the Democrats,"WASHINGTON -- When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network, he was transferred, naturally, to the help desk. His message was brief, if alarming. At least one computer system belonging to the D.N.C. had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named ''the Dukes,'' a cyberespionage team linked to the Russian government.    The F.B.I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House, the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, one of the government's best-protected networks.   Yared Tamene, the tech-support contractor at the D.N.C. who fielded the call, was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for ''the Dukes'' and conduct a cursory search of the D.N.C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account, he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks -- in part because he wasn't certain the caller was a real F.B.I. agent and not an impostor.    ''I had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call,'' Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo, obtained by The New York Times, that detailed his contact with the F.B.I.   It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and information-warfare campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an information-gathering operation, intelligence officials believe, ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate, Hillary Clinton, and tip the election to her opponent, Donald J. Trump.   Like another famous American election scandal, it started with a break-in at the D.N.C. The first time, 44 years ago at the committee's old offices in the Watergate complex, the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time, the burglary was conducted from afar, directed by the Kremlin, with spear-phishing emails and zeros and ones.   An examination by The Times of the Russian operation -- based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack, intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response -- reveals a series of missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack.   The D.N.C.'s fumbling encounter with the F.B.I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House's reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions, a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks.   The low-key approach of the F.B.I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee's network for nearly seven months before top D.N.C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime, the hackers moved on to targets outside the D.N.C., including Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, whose private email account was hacked months later.   Even Mr. Podesta, a savvy Washington insider who had written a 2014 report on cyberprivacy for President Obama, did not truly understand the gravity of the hacking.   By last summer, Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day -- procured by Russian intelligence agents, posted on WikiLeaks and other websites, then eagerly reported on by the American media, including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail.   The fallout included the resignations of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the D.N.C., and most of her top party aides. Leading Democrats were sidelined at the height of the campaign, silenced by revelations of embarrassing emails or consumed by the scramble to deal with the hacking. Though little-noticed by the public, confidential documents taken by the Russian hackers from the D.N.C.'s sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned up in congressional races in a dozen states, tainting some of them with accusations of scandal.   In recent days, a skeptical president-elect, the nation's intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election.   Many of Mrs. Clinton's closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election, while conceding that other factors -- Mrs. Clinton's weaknesses as a candidate; her private email server; the public statements of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, about her handling of classified information -- were also important.   While there's no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack, this much is clear: A low-cost, high-impact weapon that Russia had test-fired in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States, with devastating effectiveness. For Russia, with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of all-out war, cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap, hard to see coming, hard to trace.   ''There shouldn't be any doubt in anybody's mind,'' Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command said at a postelection conference. ''This was not something that was done casually, this was not something that was done by chance, this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily,'' he said. ''This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.''   For the people whose emails were stolen, this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter, recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices, humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton's instincts ''suboptimal.''   ''It was just a sucker punch to the gut every day,'' Ms. Tanden said. ''It was the worst professional experience of my life.''   The United States, too, has carried out cyberattacks, and in decades past the C.I.A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark -- with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as ''ridiculous,'' insisting that the hacker may be American, or Chinese, but that ''they have no idea.''   Mr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday, a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump's scorn.   ''This tale of 'hacks' resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence,'' Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.   Over the weekend, four prominent senators -- two Republicans and two Democrats -- joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump's skeptical claims.   ''Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,'' said Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed.   ''This cannot become a partisan issue,'' they said. ''The stakes are too high for our country.''   A Target for Break-Ins   Sitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters, below a wall-size 2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama, is a 1960s-era filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture.   ''GOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair,'' reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19, 1972, with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.   Andrew Brown, 37, the technology director at the D.N.C., was born after that famous break-in. But as he began to plan for this year's election cycle, he was well aware that the D.N.C. could become a break-in target again.   There were aspirations to ensure that the D.N.C. was well protected against cyberintruders -- and then there was the reality, Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D.N.C. was a nonprofit group, dependent on donations, with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have.   ''There was never enough money to do everything we needed to do,'' Mr. Brown said.   The D.N.C. had a standard email spam-filtering service, intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D.N.C., the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic, internal D.N.C. memos show.   Mr. Tamene, who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F.B.I. agent, was not a full-time D.N.C. employee; he works for a Chicago-based contracting firm called The MIS Department. He was left to figure out, largely on his own, how to respond -- and even whether the man who had called in to the D.N.C. switchboard was really an F.B.I. agent.   ''The F.B.I. thinks the D.N.C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F.B.I. wanted to know if the D.N.C. is aware, and if so, what the D.N.C. is doing about it,'' Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F.B.I. He added that ''the Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed 'Dukes' by the U.S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles.''   Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D.N.C. Nor could he email anyone there, as that risked alerting the hackers that the F.B.I. knew they were in the system.   Mr. Tamene's initial scan of the D.N.C. system -- using his less-than-optimal tools and incomplete targeting information from the F.B.I. -- found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October, leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene, urging him to call back, ''I did not return his calls, as I had nothing to report,'' Mr. Tamene explained in his memo.   In November, Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D.N.C. computer was ''calling home, where home meant Russia,'' Mr. Tamene's memo says, referring to software sending information to Moscow. ''SA Hawkins added that the F.B.I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a state-sponsored attack.''   Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene, who declined to comment, was fielding calls from the F.B.I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton's main Democratic opponent, had improperly gained access to her campaign data.   Ms. Wasserman Schultz, then the D.N.C.'s chairwoman, and Amy Dacey, then its chief executive, said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee's system had likely been compromised.   Shawn Henry, who once led the F.B.I.'s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services, the cybersecurity firm retained by the D.N.C. in April, said he was baffled that the F.B.I. did not call a more senior official at the D.N.C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response.   ''We are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana,'' Mr. Henry said. ''We are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F.B.I. office that is getting the notification.''   ''This is not a mom-and-pop delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U.S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process, our elected officials, our legislative process, our executive process,'' he added. ''To me it is a high-level, serious issue, and if after a couple of months you don't see any results, somebody ought to raise that to a higher level.''   The F.B.I. declined to comment on the agency's handling of the hack. ''The F.B.I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems,'' it said in a statement, adding that agents ''will continue to share information'' to help targets ''safeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals.''   By March, Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F.B.I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn.   A second team of Russian-affiliated hackers began to target the D.N.C. and other players in the political world, particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart, a former D.N.C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, got an odd email warning from Google.   ''Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account,'' the March 22 email said, adding that the sign-in attempt had occurred in Ukraine. ''Google stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.''   Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a.m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification, he clicked on the ''change password'' button and half asleep, as best he can remember, he typed in a new password.   What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account.   Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets, including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account, several aides also had access to it, and one of them noticed the warning email, sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the ''change password'' button.   ''This is a legitimate email,'' Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta's aides, who had noticed the alert. ''John needs to change his password immediately.''   With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account -- a total of about 60,000 -- were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an ''illegitimate'' email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since.   During this second wave, the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then, through a virtual private network connection, to the main computer network of the D.N.C.   The F.B.I. observed this surge of activity as well, again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D.N.C.'s spam filter. But he had no reason, he said, to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated.   One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D.N.C., seven months after it had first been warned, finally installed a ''robust set of monitoring tools,'' Mr. Tamene's internal memo says.   Honing Stealthy Tactics   The United States had two decades of warning that Russia's intelligence agencies were trying to break into America's most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead.   Their first major attack was detected on Oct. 7, 1996, when a computer operator at the Colorado School of Mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain. The school had a major contract with the Navy, and the operator warned his contacts there. But as happened two decades later at the D.N.C., at first ''everyone was unable to connect the dots,'' said Thomas Rid, a scholar at King's College in London who has studied the attack.   Investigators gave it a name -- Moonlight Maze -- and spent two years, often working day and night, tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end, they concluded that the total number of files stolen, if printed and stacked, would be taller than the Washington Monument.   Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door, and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world.   But for years, the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines, thanks to the Chinese -- who took bigger risks, and often got caught. They stole the designs for the F-35 fighter jet, corporate secrets for rolling steel, even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle, Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn't publish any of it.   The Russians had not gone away, of course. ''They were just a lot more stealthy,'' said Kevin Mandia, a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye -- and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems.   The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia, a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO, sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia's war with Georgia.   But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching ''cyber Pearl Harbor'' -- a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks.   But in 2014 and 2015, a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ''Each time, they eventually met with some form of success,'' Michael Sulmeyer, a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense, and Ben Buchanan, now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project, wrote recently in a soon-to-be published paper for the Carnegie Endowment.   The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier, tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic ''command and control'' messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point, officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them.   Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this, but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly, or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar, and concern that the United States needed Russia's cooperation in negotiations over Syria.   ''We'd have all these circular meetings,'' one senior State Department official said, ''in which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn't happen.''   So the Russians escalated again -- breaking into systems not just for espionage, but to publish or broadcast what they found, known as ''doxing'' in the cyberworld.   It was a brazen change in tactics, moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014, they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a little-known American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine, then in political turmoil.   They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the steal-and-leak strategy. The Open Society Foundation, run by George Soros, was a major target, and when its documents were released, some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members.   Last year, the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station, frying critical hardware. Around Christmas, it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine, dropping a portion of the country into darkness, killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect, it was a warning shot.   The attacks ''were not fully integrated military operations,'' Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness.   Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear   The day before the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in April, Ms. Dacey, the D.N.C.'s chief executive, was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call.   With the new monitoring system in place, Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D.N.C.'s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person, with administrator-level security status, had gained access to the D.N.C.'s computers.   ''Not sure it is related to what the F.B.I. has been noticing,'' said one internal D.N.C. email sent on April 29. ''The D.N.C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week, with password theft, etc.''   No one knew just how bad the breach was -- but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created, including Ms. Dacey, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann, a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie, the Washington law firm that handles D.N.C. political matters.   ''Three most important questions,'' Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the break-in was confirmed. ''1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?''   Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D.N.C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out -- an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D.N.C. was on to them.   ''You only get one chance to raise the drawbridge,'' Mr. Sussmann said. ''If the adversaries know you are aware of their presence, they will take steps to burrow in, or erase the logs that show they were present.''   The D.N.C. immediately hired CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, to scan its computers, identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day, CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia, Mr. Sussmann said.   The work that such companies do is a computer version of old-fashioned crime scene investigation, with fingerprints, bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar, so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.   Those are CrowdStrike's nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D.N.C. network. Cozy Bear -- the group also known as the Dukes or A.P.T. 29, for ''advanced persistent threat'' -- may or may not be associated with the F.S.B., the main successor to the Soviet-era K.G.B., but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014, said Dmitri Alperovitch, CrowdStrike's co-founder and chief technology officer.   It was Cozy Bear, CrowdStrike concluded, that first penetrated the D.N.C. in the summer of 2015, by sending spear-phishing emails to a long list of American government agencies, Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message, the Russians would enter the network, ''exfiltrate'' documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes.   ''Once they got into the D.N.C., they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation,'' said Mr. Alperovitch, who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager.   Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up -- first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then jumping to the D.N.C., investigators believe. Fancy Bear, sometimes called A.P.T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence agency, is an older outfit, tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta's email.   Attribution, as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known, is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time, by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets, it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear, for instance, has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia, and at NATO installations.   That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries, Mr. Alperovitch said. ''There's no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia,'' he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone.   To their astonishment, Mr. Alperovitch said, CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear, apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D.N.C. files for months, took many of the same documents.   In the six weeks after CrowdStrike's arrival, in total secrecy, the computer system at the D.N.C. was replaced. For a weekend, email and phones were shut off; employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean, with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives.   Though D.N.C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected, too, they did not notify their sister organization, which was in the same building, because they were afraid that it would leak.   All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D.N.C.'s chief executive.   ''This was not a bump in the road -- bumps in the road happen all the time,'' she said in an interview. ''Two different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling.''   The D.N.C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F.B.I. officials in mid-June, nine months after the bureau's first call to the tech-support contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting, according to participants: that the federal government make a quick ''attribution'' formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage.   ''You have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D.N.C.,'' Mr. Sussmann said, recalling the message to the F.B.I. ''We need to tell the American public that. And soon.''    The Media's Role   In mid-June, on Mr. Sussmann's advice, D.N.C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak, they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way, they figured, they could get ahead of the story, win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign.   But the very next day, a new, deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2.0 appeared on the web, claiming to be the D.N.C. hacker -- and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump's record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides.   #Guccifer2 #DNC's servers hacked by a lone hacker. #Trump report https://t.co/5fsKlkVouD pic.twitter.com/AMIRp5sf2e -- GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 20, 2016   ''And it's just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks,'' he wrote. Then something more ominous: ''The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon.''   It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee's network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage, an unpredictable, uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns.   Guccifer 2.0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker, a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D.N.C.'s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2.0 called himself a ''lone hacker'' and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers ''sophisticated.''   But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim, Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a writer for Motherboard, the tech and culture site of Vice, tried to contact Guccifer 2.0 by direct message on Twitter.   ''Surprisingly, he answered right away,'' Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. ''I asked him why he did it, and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian.''   That gave Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai an idea. Using Google Translate, he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline, Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai checked with a couple of native speakers, who told him Guccifer 2.0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well -- and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be.   Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2.0 had been edited by someone calling himself, in Russian, Felix Edmundovich -- an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky. Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian, generated by what was clearly a Russian-language version of Word.   When Mr. Franceschi-Bicchierai managed to engage Guccifer 2.0 over a period of weeks, he found that his interlocutor's tone and manner changed. ''At first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later, he was curt and more calculating,'' he said. ''It seemed like a group of people, and a very sloppy attempt to cover up.''   Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks.com, a site that sprang up in June, claiming to be the work of ''hacktivists'' but posting more stolen documents. It, too, seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably, the website was registered in April, suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole.   In addition to what Guccifer 2.0 published on his site, he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications. The steady flow of Guccifer 2.0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6, 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland, Guccifer released the D.N.C.'s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives, it was insider gold.   Then WikiLeaks, a far more established outlet, began to publish the hacked material -- just as Guccifer 2.0 had promised. On July 22, three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks dumped out 44,053 D.N.C. emails with 17,761 attachments. Some of the messages made clear that some D.N.C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger, Mr. Sanders.   That was no shock; Mr. Sanders, after all, had been an independent socialist, not a Democrat, during his long career in Congress, while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party's stars for decades. But the emails, some of them crude or insulting, infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside.   Mr. Trump, by now the Republican nominee, expressed delight at the continuing jolts to his opponent, and he began to use Twitter and his stump speeches to highlight the WikiLeaks releases. On July 25, he sent out a lighthearted tweet: ''The new joke in town,'' he wrote, ''is that Russia leaked the disastrous D.N.C. e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.''   But WikiLeaks was far from finished. On Oct. 7, a month before the election, the site began the serial publication of thousands of private emails to and from Mr. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager.   The same day, the United States formally accused the Russian government of being behind the hackings, in a joint statement by the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, and Mr. Trump suffered his worst blow to date, with the release of a recording in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women.   The Podesta emails were nowhere near as sensational as the Trump video. But, released by WikiLeaks day after day over the last month of the campaign, they provided material for countless news reports. They disclosed the contents of Mrs. Clinton's speeches to large banks, which she had refused to release. They exposed tensions inside the campaign, including disagreements over donations to the Clinton Foundation that staff members thought might look bad for the candidate and Ms. Tanden's complaint that Mrs. Clinton's instincts were ''suboptimal.''   ''I was just mortified,'' Ms. Tanden said in an interview. Her emails were released on the eve of one of the presidential debates, she recalled. ''I put my hands over my head and said, 'I can't believe this is happening to me.''' Though she had regularly appeared on television to support Mrs. Clinton, she canceled her appearances because all the questions were about what she had said in the emails.   Ms. Tanden, like other Democrats whose messages became public, said it was obvious to her that WikiLeaks was trying its best to damage the Clinton campaign. ''If you care about transparency, you put all the emails out at once,'' she said. ''But they wanted to hurt her. So they put them out 1,800 to 3,000 a day.''   The Trump campaign knew in advance about WikiLeaks' plans. Days before the Podesta email release began, Roger Stone, a Republican operative working with the Trump campaign, sent out an excited tweet about what was coming.   Wednesday@HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks. -- Roger Stone (@RogerJStoneJr) October 2, 2016   But in an interview, Mr. Stone said he had no role in the leaks; he had just heard from an American with ties to WikiLeaks that damning emails were coming.   Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder and editor, has resisted the conclusion that his site became a pass-through for Russian hackers working for Mr. Putin's government or that he was deliberately trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. But the evidence on both counts appears compelling.   In a series of email exchanges, Mr. Assange refused to say anything about WikiLeaks' source for the hacked material. He denied that he had made his animus toward Mrs. Clinton clear in public statements (''False. But what is this? Junior high?'') or that the site had timed the releases for maximum negative effect on her campaign. ''WikiLeaks makes its decisions based on newsworthiness, including for its recent epic scoops,'' he wrote.   Mr. Assange disputed the conclusion of the Oct. 7 statement from the intelligence agencies that the leaks were ''intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.''   ''This is false,'' he wrote. ''As the disclosing party we know that this was not the intent. Publishers publishing newsworthy information during an election is part of a free election.''   But asked whether he believed the leaks were one reason for Mr. Trump's election, Mr. Assange seemed happy to take credit. ''Americans extensively engaged with our publications,'' he wrote. ''According to Facebook statistics WikiLeaks was the most referenced political topic during October.''   Though Mr. Assange did not say so, WikiLeaks' best defense may be the conduct of the mainstream American media. Every major publication, including The Times, published multiple stories citing the D.N.C. and Podesta emails posted by WikiLeaks, becoming a de facto instrument of Russian intelligence.   Mr. Putin, a student of martial arts, had turned two institutions at the core of American democracy -- political campaigns and independent media -- to his own ends. The media's appetite for the hacked material, and its focus on the gossipy content instead of the Russian source, disturbed some of those whose personal emails were being reposted across the web.   ''What was really surprising to me?'' Ms. Tanden said. ''I could not believe that reporters were covering it.''   Devising a Government Response   Inside the White House, as Mr. Obama's advisers debated their response, their conversation turned to North Korea.   In late 2014, hackers working for Kim Jong-un, the North's young and unpredictable leader, had carried out a well-planned attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment intended to stop the Christmastime release of a comedy about a C.I.A. plot to kill Mr. Kim.   In that case, embarrassing emails had also been released. But the real damage was done to Sony's own systems: More than 70 percent of its computers melted down when a particularly virulent form of malware was released. Within weeks, intelligence agencies traced the attack back to the North and its leadership. Mr. Obama called North Korea out in public, and issued some not-very-effective sanctions. The Chinese even cooperated, briefly cutting off the North's internet connections.   As the first Situation Room meetings on the Russian hacking began in July, ''it was clear that Russia was going to be a much more complicated case,'' said one participant. The Russians clearly had a more sophisticated understanding of American politics, and they were masters of ''kompromat,'' their term for compromising information.   But a formal ''attribution report'' still had not been forwarded to the president.   ''It took forever,'' one senior administration official said, complaining about the pace at which the intelligence assessments moved through the system.   In August a group that called itself the ''Shadow Brokers'' published a set of software tools that looked like what the N.S.A. uses to break into foreign computer networks and install ''implants,'' malware that can be used for surveillance or attack. The code came from the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A., a secretive group that mastered the arts of surveillance and cyberwar.   The assumption -- still unproved -- was that the code was put out in the open by the Russians as a warning: Retaliate for the D.N.C., and there are a lot more secrets, from the hackings of the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon, that might be spilled as well. One senior official compared it to the scene in ''The Godfather'' where the head of a favorite horse is left in a bed, as a warning.   The N.S.A. said nothing. But by late August, Admiral Rogers, its director, was pressing for a more muscular response to the Russians. In his role as director of the Pentagon's Cyber Command, he proposed a series of potential counter-cyberstrikes.   While officials will not discuss them in detail, the possible counterstrikes reportedly included operations that would turn the tables on Mr. Putin, exposing his financial links to Russia's oligarchs, and punching holes in the Russian internet to allow dissidents to get their message out. Pentagon officials judged the measures too unsubtle and ordered up their own set of options.   But in the end, none of those were formally presented to the president.   In a series of ''deputies meetings'' run by Avril Haines, the deputy national security adviser and a former deputy director of the C.I.A., several officials warned that an overreaction by the administration would play into Mr. Putin's hands.   ''If we went to Defcon 4,'' one frequent participant in Ms. Haines's meetings said, using a phrase from the Cold War days of warnings of war, ''we would be saying to the public that we didn't have confidence in the integrity of our voting system.''   Even something seemingly straightforward -- using the president's executive powers, bolstered after the Sony incident, to place economic and travel sanctions on cyberattackers -- seemed too risky.   ''No one was all that eager to impose costs before Election Day,'' said another participant in the classified meeting. ''Any retaliatory measures were seen through the prism of what would happen on Election Day.''   Instead, when Mr. Obama's national security team reconvened after summer vacation, the focus turned to a crash effort to secure the nation's voting machines and voter-registration rolls from hacking. The scenario they discussed most frequently -- one that turned out not to be an issue -- was a narrow vote in favor of Mrs. Clinton, followed by a declaration by Mr. Trump that the vote was ''rigged'' and more leaks intended to undercut her legitimacy.   Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., became increasingly frustrated as the clock continued to run down on the presidential election -- and still there was no broad public condemnation by the White House, or Republican Party leaders, of the attack as an act of foreign espionage.   Ms. Brazile even reached out to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, urging him twice in private conversations and in a letter to join her in condemning the attacks -- an offer he declined to take up.   ''We just kept hearing the government would respond, the government would respond,'' she said. ''Once upon a time, if a foreign government interfered with our election we would respond as a nation, not as a political party.''   But Mr. Obama did decide that he would deliver a warning to Mr. Putin in person at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China, the last time they would be in the same place while Mr. Obama was still in office. When the two men met for a tense pull-aside, Mr. Obama explicitly warned Mr. Putin of a strong American response if there was continued effort to influence the election or manipulate the vote, according to White House officials who were not present for the one-on-one meeting.   Later that day, Mr. Obama made a rare reference to America's own offensive cybercapacity, which he has almost never talked about. ''Frankly, both offensively and defensively, we have more capacity,'' he told reporters.   But when it came time to make a public assertion of Russia's role in early October, it was made in a written statement from the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security. It was far less dramatic than the president's appearance in the press room two years before to directly accuse the North Koreans of attacking Sony.   The reference in the statement to hackings on ''political organizations,'' officials now say, encompassed a hacking on data stored by the Republicans as well. Two senior officials say the forensic evidence was accompanied by ''human and technical'' sources in Russia, which appears to mean that the United States' implants or taps in Russian computer and phone networks helped confirm the country's role.   But that may not be known for decades, until the secrets are declassified.   A week later Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was sent out to transmit a public warning to Mr. Putin: The United States will retaliate ''at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.''   Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could ''fundamentally alter the election,'' he was asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.   ''Hope not,'' Mr. Biden responded.   Some of his former colleagues think that was the wrong answer. An American counterstrike, said Michael Morell, the former deputy director of the C.I.A. under Mr. Obama, has ''got to be overt. It needs to be seen.''   A covert response would significantly limit the deterrence effect, he added. ''If you can't see it, it's not going to deter the Chinese and North Koreans and Iranians and others.''   The Obama administration says it still has more than 30 days to do exactly that.   The Next Target   As the year draws to a close, it now seems possible that there will be multiple investigations of the Russian hacking -- the intelligence review Mr. Obama has ordered completed by Jan. 20, the day he leaves office, and one or more congressional inquiries. They will wrestle with, among other things, Mr. Putin's motive.   Did he seek to mar the brand of American democracy, to forestall anti-Russian activism for both Russians and their neighbors? Or to weaken the next American president, since presumably Mr. Putin had no reason to doubt American forecasts that Mrs. Clinton would win easily? Or was it, as the C.I.A. concluded last month, a deliberate attempt to elect Mr. Trump?   In fact, the Russian hack-and-dox scheme accomplished all three goals.   What seems clear is that Russian hacking, given its success, is not going to stop. Two weeks ago, the German intelligence chief, Bruno Kahl, warned that Russia might target elections in Germany next year. ''The perpetrators have an interest to delegitimize the democratic process as such,'' Mr. Kahl said. Now, he added, ''Europe is in the focus of these attempts of disturbance, and Germany to a particularly great extent.''   But Russia has by no means forgotten its American target. On the day after the presidential election, the cybersecurity company Volexity reported five new waves of phishing emails, evidently from Cozy Bear, aimed at think tanks and nonprofits in the United States.   One of them purported to be from Harvard University, attaching a fake paper. Its title: ''Why American Elections Are Flawed.''

"Hacker Threat Took Back Seat at Yahoo, Insiders Say","SAN FRANCISCO -- Six years ago, Yahoo's computer systems and customer email accounts were penetrated by Chinese military hackers. Google and a number of other technology companies were also hit. The Google co-founder Sergey Brin regarded the attack on his company's systems as a personal affront and responded by making security a top corporate priority. Google hired hundreds of security engineers with six-figure signing bonuses, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in security infrastructure and adopted a new internal motto, ''Never again,'' to signal that it would never again allow anyone -- be they spies or criminals -- to hack into Google customers' accounts.    Yahoo, on the other hand, was slower to invest in the kinds of defenses necessary to thwart sophisticated hackers that are now considered standard in Silicon Valley, according to half a dozen current and former company employees who participated in security discussions but agreed to describe them only on the condition of anonymity.   When Marissa Mayer took over as chief executive of the flailing company in mid-2012, security was one of many problems she inherited. With so many competing priorities, she emphasized creating a cleaner look for services like Yahoo Mail and developing new products over making security improvements, the Yahoo employees said.    The ''Paranoids,'' the internal name for Yahoo's security team, often clashed with other parts of the business over security costs. And their requests were often overridden because of concerns that the inconvenience of added protection would make people stop using the company's products.   But Yahoo's choices had consequences, resulting in a series of embarrassing security failures over the last four years. Last week, the company disclosed that hackers backed by what it believed was an unnamed foreign government stole the credentials of 500 million users in a breach that went undetected for two years. It was the biggest known intrusion into one company's network, and the episode is now under investigation by both Yahoo and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   Certainly, many big companies have struggled with cyberattacks in recent years. But Yahoo's security efforts appear to have fallen short, in particular, when compared with those of banks and other big tech companies.   To make computer systems more secure, a company often has to make its products slower and more difficult to use. It was a trade-off Yahoo's leadership was often unwilling to make.   In defense of Yahoo's security, a company spokeswoman, Suzanne Philion, said the company spent $10 million on encryption technology in early 2014, and that its investment in security initiatives will have increased by 60 percent from 2015 to 2016.   ''At Yahoo, we have a deep understanding of the threats facing our users and continuously strive to stay ahead of these threats to keep our users and our platforms secure,'' she said.   The breach disclosed last week is the latest black eye for Ms. Mayer, whose failed turnaround effort resulted in Yahoo's agreement in July to sell its core operations to Verizon for $4.8 billion. It is unclear whether the episode will affect the sale. Although Yahoo's email users are its most loyal and frequent customers, the company has been losing market share in email for years.   ''Yahoo is already suffering. I don't think they'll suffer more because of this,'' said Avivah Litan, a security analyst with the research firm Gartner.   Ms. Mayer arrived at Yahoo about two years after the company was hit by the Chinese military hackers. While Google's response was public, Yahoo never publicly admitted that it had also been attacked.   A former Google executive credited with creating the search company's simple, colorful aesthetic, Ms. Mayer turned her attention at Yahoo to beating Google at search, creating new mobile apps, and turning Yahoo into a video powerhouse with television-style broadcasts featuring big-name talent like Katie Couric.   But in matters of security, Ms. Mayer, current and former employees said, was far more reactive. In 2010, Google announced it would start paying hackers ''bug bounties'' if they turned over security holes and problems in its systems. Yahoo did not do the same until three years later, after it lost countless security engineers to competitors and experienced a breach of more than 450,000 Yahoo accounts in 2012 and a series of humiliating spam attacks in 2013. Yahoo said it had paid out $1.8 million to bug hunters.   In 2013, disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, showed that Yahoo was a frequent target for nation-state spies. Yet it took a full year after Mr. Snowden's initial disclosures for Yahoo to hire a new chief information security officer, Alex Stamos.   Jeff Bonforte, the Yahoo senior vice president who oversees its email and messaging services, said in an interview last December that Mr. Stamos and his team had pressed for Yahoo to adopt end-to-end encryption for everything. Such encryption would mean that only the parties in a conversation could see what was being said, with even Yahoo unable to read it.   Mr. Bonforte said he resisted the request because it would have hurt Yahoo's ability to index and search message data to provide new user services. ''I'm not particularly thrilled with building an apartment building which has the biggest bars on every window,'' he said.   The 2014 hiring of Mr. Stamos -- who had a reputation for pushing for privacy and antisurveillance measures -- was widely hailed by the security community as a sign that Yahoo was prioritizing its users' privacy and security.   The current and former employees say he inspired a small team of young engineers to develop more secure code, improve the company's defenses -- including encrypting traffic between Yahoo's data centers -- hunt down criminal activity and successfully collaborate with other companies in sharing threat data.   He also dispatched ''red teams'' of employees to break into Yahoo's systems and report back what they found. At competitors like Apple and Google, the Yahoo Paranoids developed a reputation for their passion and contributions to collaborative security projects, like Threat Exchange, a platform created by Yahoo, Dropbox, Facebook, Pinterest and others to share information on cyberthreats.   But when it came time to commit meaningful dollars to improve Yahoo's security infrastructure, Ms. Mayer repeatedly clashed with Mr. Stamos, according to the current and former employees. She denied Yahoo's security team financial resources and put off proactive security defenses, including intrusion-detection mechanisms for Yahoo's production systems. Over the last few years, employees say, the Paranoids have been routinely hired away by competitors like Apple, Facebook and Google.   Mr. Stamos, who departed Yahoo for Facebook last year, declined to comment. But during his tenure, Ms. Mayer also rejected the most basic security measure of all: an automatic reset of all user passwords, a step security experts consider standard after a breach. Employees say the move was rejected by Ms. Mayer's team for fear that even something as simple as a password change would drive Yahoo's shrinking email users to other services.   ''Yahoo's policy is that if we believe a user's password has been compromised, we lock the account until the user resets the password,'' Ms. Philion said.   With the 500 million accounts involved in the breach disclosed last week, the stolen passwords were encrypted. Yahoo concluded the risk of misuse was low so it notified users and encouraged them to reset their passwords themselves.   On Tuesday, six Democratic senators, led by Patrick Leahy of Vermont, sent a letter to Ms. Mayer demanding more details about the 2014 breach and what Yahoo was doing to prevent a recurrence. Another senator, Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Yahoo's disclosures to investors regarding the incident. And the company is already the subject of several class-action lawsuits from users over the intrusion.     "
F.C.C. Proposes Privacy Rules for Internet Service Providers,"WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators on Thursday proposed a set of privacy rules for Internet service providers that would significantly curb the ability of companies like Comcast and Verizon to share data about their customers' online activities with advertisers without permission from users. In the proposal, before the Federal Communications Commission, the agency's chairman, Tom Wheeler, called for broadband service providers to disclose clearly how data may be collected about users' online browsing and other activities. The plan also called for the companies to bolster the security of customer data.     The proposal, if approved, would for the first time establish privacy rules for the companies that manage the traffic of the web and would create some of the strongest privacy regulations for any segment of the technology and telecommunications industries. They represent the first major regulatory action involving broadband providers after the F.C.C.'s declaration last year that high-speed Internet carriers should be treated like utilities.   In a statement, Mr. Wheeler said that since Internet service providers handle all network traffic, the companies have a ''broad view of all of your unencrypted online activity.'' He added that ''even when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you -- including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems -- based on your online activity.''   The proposed regulations would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited.   Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.   ''This is nothing short of a historic moment,'' Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group, said of the proposed new rules. ''Unlike the Federal Trade Commission, the F.C.C. has the legal authority to enact safeguards that will allow an individual to have real control over how their information can be gathered and used.''   Some privacy experts said an Internet service provider was capable of stitching together a more complete picture of a consumer by tracking the sites the consumer visits using its network. Because more devices in the home are now being connected to Wi-Fi, the broadband providers also have more ways to collect data on their customers for online advertising, said Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the nonprofit media advocacy group Public Knowledge.   In an enforcement action against Verizon this week, the F.C.C. found that the company was using ''supercookies'' to continue tracking the activity of users through mobile browsers even when the customers tried to delete cookies from browsers and clear their browsing histories. Cookies are small files created by sites that are stored on devices and used to track activity.   Under the proposal, broadband service providers could still collect and share data with other communications-related affiliates without permission. That would allow Verizon's broadband business, called Fios, for example, to give personal information about a user to its wireless service to market mobile data plans.   But the Internet service providers would not be able to share data with noncommunications partners without permission. This would prohibit a broadband service like Google Fiber from blending consumer information with search, maps and email habits of a consumer, the F.C.C. said. Verizon also would not be able to share customer data with AOL, a media site it owns, without permission.   The F.C.C.'s proposal drew protest from telecom and cable companies, which have pointed to the F.T.C. as a strong privacy enforcer. The F.C.C. has argued that after it reclassified broadband as a utility, it was compelled by law to create privacy rules.   In a recent blog post, AT&T said Internet service providers were collecting less data as more sites became encrypted. Also, consumers are choosing virtual private networks that prevent broadband providers from seeing the sites people visit, the company said. Websites like Google are leading behavioral advertising companies that should be held to the same standards as broadband access providers, AT&T said.   ''Given the realities of this complex market, there is no basis for treating I.S.P. data as somehow 'proprietary' or subjecting I.S.P.s to unique privacy requirements,'' wrote Bob Quinn, senior vice president for AT&T's federal regulatory affairs, referring to Internet service providers. ''Consumers expect and deserve consistent privacy protections for their online data, regardless of which company is collecting it and the technology used to collect it.''   The F.C.C. will vote on the proposal on March 31 and then will begin to take public comments, in what will be a monthslong process before final rules are considered.     "
"Tech Is Waging a Battle Over Privacy, One Statehouse at a Time","SAN FRANCISCO -- The Biometric Information Privacy Act of Illinois is not a law many are familiar with. But if you have ever shared a photo on social media, the little-known statute turns out to be one of the nation's toughest regulations for how companies like Facebook and Google can use facial recognition technologies to identify you online. For now.     On Thursday, an Illinois state senator, Terry Link, introduced an amendment that would have weakened the law by exempting photo-tagging technologies that are now commonly used on social media. The proposal also had the potential to extinguish several class-action lawsuits against technology companies like Facebook by retroactively removing the right of Illinois citizens to sue companies that might have broken the law in the past.   The amendment was lobbied for by Facebook, according to a person involved in the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And it helps to illustrate how from drone aircraft to genetic information and statutes that govern how companies sell consumer information to data miners, tech companies are in a capital to capital fight to keep new laws from being passed or to soften those already on the books.   ''The Illinois biometric privacy act is one of the best new privacy laws in the country,'' said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''It's bad news for consumers when Internet companies start lobbying against good privacy laws.''   The proposed amendment, which would have carved out an exemption for any biometric information collected through a photograph or video, prompted a host of lawyers and privacy advocates to condemn the proposal. By Friday afternoon, a spokesman in the office of Senator Link said the amendment was no longer being considered but declined to comment further. The senator had also written the original law.   In a comment sent by email, a spokeswoman for Facebook said, ''We appreciate Senator Link's effort to clarify the scope of the law he authored.''   Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, said statehouses were increasingly becoming privacy battlegrounds as legislators wrestle with the question of not just how tech companies use people's names and personal information, but also their faces and voices.   ''We have had a very dysfunctional Congress for quite some time, and as a result the most effective place to work has been the statehouses,'' she said. ''It's where hearts and minds are being won and where laws are still being crafted and passed.''   Biometric information like face and voice recognition has become a huge and potentially costly area as tech companies plow tons of money and powerful artificial intelligence technologies into photo and video applications that can identify people with an accuracy that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.   Laws curbing these programs can be a huge burden for tech companies, because following the laws could mean slowing the arrival of new features or creating a patchwork of features that could be turned off and on in various states.   While the state violations are often small -- the Illinois act gives citizens the right to sue for up to $5,000 per violation -- potential liability can run to billions or even trillions of dollars once multiplied across hundreds of millions of individual users. That has made privacy law a lucrative new area for class-action lawyers who can extract multimillion-dollar settlements just by bringing a case.   Nevertheless, questions of how much tech companies should be allowed to do without notifying their users will multiply, especially as people adopt more live video and voice technologies that have already made it possible for tech companies to identify people who might not even use their services.   ''It's basically a company creating the ability to capture someone's identity when they might not want to reveal their identity,'' Mr. Rotenberg said.   The Biometric Information Privacy Act was passed in Illinois in 2008 and has quickly become the bane of social media companies. Under the current law, companies have to get a user's consent before turning on features that scan and store faces for identification.   The law is at the center of several class-action lawsuits, including one that claims that Facebook has ''secretly amassed the world's largest privately held database of consumer biometrics data.''   That suit, filed by Edelson PC -- a Chicago-based law firm known for suing tech companies for privacy violations -- recently cleared a significant legal hurdle that allowed the suit to proceed and increases the likelihood of Facebook settling the case, which could potentially mean millions in fees for the Edelson firm.   Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC, said of Facebook: ''These guys believe that the rules shouldn't apply to them and have the money to literally rewrite them.''     "
Australia Says Foreign Spies Hacked Into Its Weather Bureau Last Year,"HONG KONG -- Australia said on Wednesday that a foreign intelligence service had hacked into the country's meteorology bureau last year, copying ''an unknown quantity of documents'' from its computer system.  A report, issued by the Australian Cyber Security Center, did not accuse any particular country of carrying out the intrusion. The hacking was reported last year by the Australian news media, which suggested that China was behind the breach, though its Foreign Ministry later denied that.    Australian investigators found evidence of malware popular with ''state-sponsored cyber adversaries,'' according to the report, which called the security controls at the Bureau of Meteorology ''insufficient.''   The bureau has one of Australia's most powerful supercomputers and provides important information to other government agencies. The bureau said on Wednesday that it continued to provide reliable information on the weather, climate, oceans and water, adding that its systems were fully operational.   ''We continue to work with the Australian Cyber Security Center and other partner agencies to protect, secure and improve our I.C.T. systems,'' it said in a statement, referring to information and communications technology.     "
Hurdles for U.S. in Bid to Thwart Russian Hackers,"WASHINGTON -- When a suspected Russian cybercriminal named Dmitry Ukrainsky was arrested in a Thai resort town last summer, the American authorities hoped they could whisk him back to New York for trial and put at least a temporary dent in Russia's arsenal of computer hackers. But the Russian authorities moved quickly to persuade Thailand not to extradite him, saying that he should be prosecuted at home. American officials knew what that meant. If Mr. Ukrainsky got on a plane to Moscow, they concluded, he would soon be back at work in front of a computer.    ''The American authorities continue the unacceptable practice of 'hunting' for Russians all over the world, ignoring the norms of international laws and twisting other states' arms,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said.   The dispute over Mr. Ukrainsky, whose case remains in limbo, highlights the difficulties -- and at times impossibilities -- that the United States faces in combating Russian hackers, including those behind the recent attacks on the Democratic National Committee. That hack influenced the course, if not the outcome, of a presidential campaign and was the culmination of years of increasingly brazen digital assaults on American infrastructure.    The United States has few options for responding to such hacks. Russia does not extradite its citizens and has shown that it will not easily be deterred through public shaming. At times, the American authorities have enlisted local police officials to arrest suspects when they leave Russia -- for vacation in the Maldives, for example. But more often than not, the F.B.I. and Justice Department investigate and compile accusations and evidence against people who will almost certainly never stand trial.   ''You can indict 400 people. They don't care,'' said Robert E. Anderson Jr., who until last year served as the F.B.I.'s most senior executive overseeing computer investigations.   The American government divides the cybersecurity world into two categories: attacks directed or sponsored by governments, and those conducted by criminals. But Russian hacking defies easy categorization, American officials say, because the Russian government tacitly supports many private hackers and occasionally taps them for freelance government work. That has complicated investigations and upended the normal diplomatic order.   In May 2009, for instance, Secret Service agents met in Moscow with their counterparts in the Russian Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B. The Americans said they were investigating a hacker who had installed malicious code in the software that some American businesses used to process credit card transactions. The hacker was stealing millions of credit card numbers and selling them in an underground digital marketplace.   The agents provided a name -- Roman Seleznev -- and the aliases he used online. His father was a member of the Russian Parliament. The Secret Service had followed his digital trail to Vladivostok, and they asked for help catching him.   Within weeks, all evidence of Mr. Seleznev's online identity vanished from the internet. Rather than advancing the case, the Russian government had set it back, the American authorities believed. Prosecutors described their blunt conclusion in court documents: ''Further coordination with the Russian government would jeopardize efforts to prosecute this case.'' The American authorities were left to pursue Mr. Seleznev by themselves.   The Russians are not always uncooperative. This week they deported Joshua Samuel Aaron, 32, who was wanted by the F.B.I. on charges of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from Wall Street banks. But Mr. Aaron, who was arrested Wednesday at John F. Kennedy International Airport after arriving on a flight from Moscow, is an American, not a Russian.   In another computer crime case, in 2014, the Justice Department shut down two global computer networks that had been used to steal millions of dollars. Called Operation Tovar, it involved intelligence agencies around the world. The target was 30-year-old Evgeniy M. Bogachev. Safely in Russia, he watched as the F.B.I. made him a most-wanted fugitive and offered a $3 million reward for his capture.   In that case the F.B.I. was actually able to identify the person sitting at the keyboard. More often, the authorities identify aliases or internet addresses but cannot prove who is behind them unless the hackers get sloppy.   In the Seleznev case, for example, the authorities searched a Yahoo email account that was used to register some of the servers in the credit-card scam. Agents found, among other things, receipts for flowers that Mr. Seleznev had sent to his wife.   In the D.N.C. case and other election-year hacks, the authorities have concluded that people affiliated with the Russian government are to blame. But even if intelligence officials can identify who is behind those attacks, naming the actual perpetrators is even harder. One senior federal law enforcement official said this week that investigators still had many unanswered questions.   If it can be done, naming and prosecuting the hackers would follow a path set in 2014, when the Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on charges of hacking into American networks. The indictment links the men to specific email addresses and aliases, but does not reveal how the authorities made those connections.   ''The chance of us ever getting those Chinese guys is about zero,'' said Mr. Anderson. ''But it does show them that there's a change afoot. At least the way we're looking at it policy-wise.''   Criminal charges have more practical implications, too. ''It's about denying them the ability to travel freely and preventing them from spending their ill-gotten gains anywhere but Russia,'' said Leo Taddeo, the chief security officer at Cryptzone and the former top agent in the F.B.I.'s New York computer operations division. ''You're confining them to a prison that spans 11 time zones that can be a pretty unpleasant place.''   In short, even hackers take vacations. In July 2013, the authorities captured a notorious Russian hacker named Aleksandr Andreevich Panin while he was in the Dominican Republic. Mr. Panin was sentenced to more than nine years of prison for selling malware that resulted in the theft of nearly $1 billion.   ''Cybercriminals be forewarned: you cannot hide in the shadows of the internet,'' said Sally Q. Yates, who was the United States attorney in Georgia at the time and is now the deputy attorney general. ''We will find you and bring you to justice.''   It was certainly true for Mr. Seleznev. After finding the flower receipt and making other connections, the American authorities made secret plans to capture him while he vacationed in the Maldives. Agents arrested him at the airport there in 2014 and hurried him onto a plane to the United States territory of Guam.   After a trial in Seattle, he was convicted in August of 38 counts related to hacking in a scheme that prosecutors said cost businesses more than $169 million.   The Russian government declared Mr. Seleznev's arrest to be an unlawful ''kidnapping.'' It has denied involvement in the D.N.C. hack and criticized the American government's efforts to arrest Russian citizens traveling abroad.   That is playing out now in Thailand with Mr. Ukrainsky, and in the Czech Republic with Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, 29, accused of hacking into LinkedIn and Dropbox. He was captured in October in a raid at a hotel in Prague, where he was vacationing with his girlfriend, the police said.   The Russian response was swift: ''We insist that the detained Russian citizen should be transferred to Russia.'' He remains in the Czech Republic.

Cybersecurity's Debt to a Hollywood Hack,"Fred Kaplan is the author of ''Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War,'' due out March 1. Movies rarely influence public policy, but Washington's policies on cyberattacks, computer surveillance and the possibility of cyberwarfare were directly influenced by the 1983 box-office hit ''WarGames.'' The film -- starring Matthew Broderick as a tech-whiz teenager who unwittingly hacks into the computer of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and nearly sets off World War III -- opened nationwide that June 3. The next night, President Ronald Reagan watched it at Camp David. And that is where this strange story -- culled from interviews with participants and Reagan Library documents -- begins.    The following Wednesday, back in the White House, Reagan met with his national-security advisers and 16 members of Congress to discuss forthcoming nuclear arms talks with the Russians. But he still seemed focused on the movie.   At one point, he put down his index cards and asked if anyone else had seen it. No one had, so he described the plot in detail. Some of the lawmakers looked around the room with suppressed smiles or raised eyebrows. Three months earlier, Reagan had delivered his ''Star Wars'' speech, imploring scientists to build laser weapons that could shoot down Soviet missiles in outer space. The idea was widely dismissed as nutty. What was the old man up to now?    After finishing his synopsis, Reagan turned to Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and asked: ''Could something like this really happen?'' Could someone break into our most sensitive computers? General Vessey said he would look into it.   One week later, the general returned to the White House with his answer. ''WarGames,'' it turned out, wasn't far-fetched. ''Mr. president,'' he said, ''the problem is much worse than you think.''   Reagan's question set off a series of interagency memos and studies that culminated, 15 months later, in his signing a classified national security decision directive, NSDD-145, titled ''National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated Information Systems Security.''   The first laptop computers had barely hit the market; public Internet providers wouldn't exist for another few years. Yet NSDD-145 warned that these new machines -- which government agencies and high-tech industries had started buying at a rapid clip -- were ''highly susceptible to interception.'' Hostile foreign powers were ''extensively'' hacking into them already; ''terrorist groups and criminal elements'' had the ability to do so, too.   General Vessey could answer the president's question so promptly -- and national-security aides could compose NSDD-145 in such detailed language -- because, deep within the bureaucracy, a small group of scientists and spies had been concerned about this looming threat for more than a decade.   In the 1960s, the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency undertook a program called the ARPAnet. The idea, a precursor to the Internet, was to let Pentagon labs and contractors share data and research on the same network.   Just before the program's rollout, in April 1967, an engineer named Willis Ware wrote a paper called ''Security and Privacy in Computer Systems.'' A computer pioneer dating back to the '40s, Mr. Ware headed the computer science department at the RAND Corporation, the think tank in Santa Monica, Calif.   In his paper, he lauded the goals of the ARPAnet but explained some risks of what he called ''on-line'' networks. As long as computers sat in isolated chambers, security wasn't a problem. But once multiple users could gain access to data from unprotected locations, anyone with certain skills could hack into the network -- and, once inside, roam at will, pilfering unclassified and secret files alike. Mr. Ware's warnings went unheeded for decades, though he remained a frequent consultant. (He died in 2013, at the age of 93.)   In 1980, Lawrence Lasker and Walter Parkes, former Yale classmates in their late 20s, were writing the screenplay for ''WarGames.'' (It would be nominated for an Oscar but would lose to Horton Foote's ''Tender Mercies.'') A hacker friend had told them about ''demon-dialing,'' in which a telephone modem searched for other modems by automatically dialing each phone number in an area code and letting it ring twice before proceeding to the next number. If a modem answered, it would squawk; the demon-dialing software would record the number, so the hacker could call back later. In their screenplay, this was how their hero broke into NORAD. But they wondered if this was plausible: Didn't the military close off its computers to public telephone lines?   Mr. Lasker lived in Santa Monica, a few blocks from RAND. Figuring someone there might be helpful, he called the public affairs office, which put him in touch with Mr. Ware, who invited the pair to his office.   They'd come to the right man. Not only had he long known about the vulnerability of computer networks, but he'd also helped design the software for the real NORAD computer. And Mr. Ware proved remarkably open, even friendly. Listening to the writers' questions, he waved off their worries. Yes, he told them, the computer was supposed to be closed, but some officers wanted to work from home on weekends, so they'd leave a port open. Anyone could get in, if the right number was dialed.   ''The only computer that's completely secure,'' Mr. Ware told them with a mischievous smile, ''is a computer that no one can use.''   Ware gave the writers the confidence to go ahead with their project. It's fitting that the scenario of ''WarGames'' -- which aroused Reagan's curiosity and led to the first national policy on reducing the vulnerability of computers -- owed a crucial debt to the man who'd first warned that they were vulnerable.   Meanwhile, Reagan's directive hit a roadblock. It put the National Security Agency in charge of securing all of the nation's computer servers and networks -- government, business and personal. The agency had been established in 1952 to intercept foreign communications; it was expressly barred from spying on Americans. Representative Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat and a fiery civil-liberties advocate, wasn't about to let a classified presidential decree blur the distinction. He sponsored and got passed a law overriding that directive.   The main author of Reagan's NSDD-145 was Donald Latham, the Pentagon's liaison to the National Security Agency -- and a former N.S.A. analyst himself. General Vessey had assigned him to answer Reagan's question on ''WarGames'' (Could something like this really happen?). Mr. Latham answered as he did (The situation is much worse than you think.) because he knew that the N.S.A. had long been hacking into the communications systems of the Soviet Union and China -- and what we were doing to them, they could someday do to us.   Mr. Ware had been among the first to draw this conclusion. Mr. Latham knew about it early on because the two were longtime friends, Mr. Ware having served on the N.S.A.'s scientific advisory board. The N.S.A. was the most secretive branch of the American intelligence community. Reagan's screening of ''WarGames'' brought Mr. Ware's concerns into high policy-making circles for the first time. And it sparked the first public controversy over the tensions between security and privacy on the Internet, as well as the first public power struggle about the subject between the N.S.A. and Congress -- a debate and a struggle that persist today.

"Russian Hackers Penetrated D.N.C. Files, Including Trump Dossier, Party Says","WASHINGTON -- Two groups of Russian hackers, working for competing government intelligence agencies, penetrated computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to emails, chats and a trove of opposition research against Donald J. Trump, according to the party and a cybersecurity firm. One group placed espionage software on the committee's computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion.     A senior government official said Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, based in Brooklyn, also appeared to have been targeted, but it was not clear whether it lost any data. The breach at the Democratic committee was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post.   The committee's systems appeared to have had standard cyberprotections, which are no challenge for determined state-sponsored hacking groups. The attackers were expelled last weekend with CrowdStrike's help, the committee said. It did not provide a detailed account of what had been copied from the systems, and it may never know.   The connection to Russia may be explained simply by the global fascination with the presidential campaign and the mystery surrounding Mr. Trump, who has not been a major subject of foreign intelligence collection. But it also recalls a subplot to the race: Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, previously advised pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, including former President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine.   Opposition research itself is not all that valuable to a foreign government, but it can point to a candidate's vulnerabilities. To a foreign government fascinated by an American election, any intelligence a campaign develops on an opponent could be exploited.   Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committee's servers -- a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach -- appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House.   In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions.   ''These are incredibly sophisticated groups,'' Mr. Alperovitch said. ''They covered their tracks well. It wasn't until the second group came in,'' stealing the opposition research on Mr. Trump, ''that their presence was detected.''   The second group, named Fancy Bear, which appeared to have attacked in April, is believed to be operated by the G.R.U., the military intelligence service. Its past targets have included military and aerospace organizations from the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and South Korea.   CrowdStrike concluded that neither Russian group knew the other was attacking the same organization. ''One would steal a password, and the next day the other group would steal the same password,'' Mr. Alperovitch said.   Mrs. Clinton said on Telemundo that she had learned of the breach only after news outlets reported it. She called it ''troubling,'' but said she was unsure about the hackers' goals.   ''Now, why?'' she asked. ''We don't know yet. So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into, and we're obviously looking hard at that. But cybersecurity will be an issue that I will be absolutely focused on as president. Because whether it's Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage, and we can't let that go on.''   The Office of Personnel Management, whose files on about 22 million Americans with security clearances or applications for them were breached by Chinese hackers, is still trying to assess the damage first detected last year.   The Democratic committee avoided any discussion of its vulnerabilities.   ''The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic national chairwoman. ''When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately. Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.''   The party did not say how it came to suspect the intrusion.   Cyberattacks by foreign governments are a constant threat to political campaigns. Because campaign operations are temporary, they often do not invest heavily in the kind of security that financial institutions, large companies and government agencies spend millions or billions of dollars on each year.   And because campaigns are so far-flung, with volunteers connecting through laptops and cellphones, they are particularly vulnerable. In 2008, hackers traced to the Chinese government infiltrated the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain.   ''It should come as no surprise to anyone that political parties are high-profile targets for foreign intelligence gathering,'' Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been deeply involved in cyberissues, said in a statement. ''Nonetheless, it is disconcerting that two independent operations were able to penetrate the D.N.C., one of which was able to stay embedded for nearly a year.''

Trump Vows to Bolster Cyberattack Defenses,"HERNDON, Va. -- Donald J. Trump on Monday called for strengthening the nation's defenses against cyberattacks, saying that as president he would create a joint law enforcement task force to handle both cybersecurity as well as offensive cyberwarfare. ''Cyberattacks from foreign governments -- especially China, Russia, North Korea, along with nonstate terrorist actors and organized criminal groups -- constitute one of our most critical national security concerns,'' Mr. Trump told a group of retired military veterans on Monday. ''The scope of our cybersecurity problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets and our citizens -- most sensitive information -- are all facing constant cyberattacks and reviews by the enemy.''     Mr. Trump, who once suggested that Russia hack Hillary Clinton's emails, also stressed the importance of being able to wage ''crippling'' cyberattacks against the nation's adversaries, calling it ''the warfare of the future.'' ''We should turn cyberwarfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.''   Mr. Trump's remarks came after a damaging week of largely self-inflicted missteps, underscored by a drop in many polls, which began last Monday with a shaky debate performance against Mrs. Clinton and went on to include a late-night Twitter rant against Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe who is Hispanic.   His comments on Monday, which he delivered from teleprompters before taking several questions from a friendly audience, seemed to be an effort to present a more disciplined front before the next presidential debate, in St. Louis on Sunday.   In the first debate, Mr. Trump gave a rambling response to a question about cybersecurity, ranging from fears of lone wolf hackers (''It also could be somebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?'') to his 10-year-old son's technological prowess (''He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable'').   On Monday, Mr. Trump offered a more tightly focused speech on the need for increased cybersecurity. If elected, he said, he would instruct the Department of Justice to create a task force, in conjunction with international, federal, state and local law enforcement, ''to crush this still developing area of crime.'' And he said he would ask his secretary of defense and the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to present recommendations ''for strengthening and augmenting our cybercommand.''   During a question-and-answer session, the Republican nominee addressed the issue of post-traumatic stress disorder, calling for a ''very, very robust'' mental health program for veterans. Then Mr. Trump seemed to imply that handling the trauma of war was a question of strength.   ''When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat, they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over,'' he said. ''And you're strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can't handle it.''   He also hinted at returning to criminal profiling, citing Israel as an example of a country that engages in successful profiling efforts, and called for a ''more old-fashioned'' method of law enforcement.   ''You know in our country lately we're more interested in protecting the criminals than we are in making sure that we're strong and powerful and know what we're doing,'' he said. ''We're so, so interested in protecting criminals and people that want to do us harm, and I think that we have to go back to a little more old-fashioned method of thinking, if that makes sense. I will appoint an attorney general who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate.''

Senate and House Leaders Call for Inquiry of Russian Hacking in Election,"WASHINGTON - The top two Republicans in Congress said on Monday that they supported investigations into possible Russian cyberattacks to influence the American election, setting up a potential confrontation with President-elect Donald J. Trump in his first days in office. ""Any foreign breach of our cybersecurity measures is disturbing, and I strongly condemn any such efforts,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, adding, ""The Russians are not our friends."" Mr. McConnell's support for investigating American intelligence findings that Moscow intervened in the election on Mr. Trump's behalf could presage friction between the Republicans who control Congress, and who have long taken a hard line against Russia, and the president-elect, who has mocked the findings. Mr. McConnell also went out of his way to address Mr. Trump's claim that the C.I.A. could not be trusted because of flawed intelligence before the Iraq war.  ""Let me say that I have the highest confidence in the intelligence community,"" Mr. McConnell said, ""and especially the Central Intelligence Agency. The C.I.A. is filled with selfless patriots, many of whom anonymously risk their lives for the American people."" The top Republican in the House, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said he supported a continuing investigation by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In a statement, Mr. Ryan said: ""As I've said before, any foreign intervention in our elections is entirely unacceptable. And any intervention by Russia is especially problematic because, under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests."" Congressional Republicans announced their support for inquiries after Mr. Trump railed for much of the weekend against the intelligence findings. But their remarks, especially Mr. Ryan's, were far from fiery, reflecting both a fear of offending Mr. Trump, who has taken many positions against traditional Republican orthodoxy, and the Republicans' belief that Democrats have selectively leaked intelligence information for political gain. Critics from both parties are questioning Mr. Trump's apparent choice of Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, as secretary of state, particularly because of his longstanding business connections with Russia and his close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin, whom he has known for two decades. Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Monday night that he would make a formal announcement on the job on Tuesday morning. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida, both Republicans, have expressed concern about the reports of cyberattacks, as have numerous Democrats. But Mr. Rubio, in an apparent reference to Mr. Tillerson, went a step further on Monday, writing on Twitter, ""Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState."" Mr. McConnell said the Senate investigation would be led by Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will add a subcommittee to look into cyberattacks, led by Mr. Graham. ""The first thing we want to establish is, 'Did the Russians hack into our political system?'"" Mr. Graham said in an interview on Monday. ""Then you work outward from there. I have a high degree of confidence Russia did this."" Mr. Nunes, a member of Mr. Trump's transition team, said in a statement that the Intelligence Committee had been ""conducting vigorous oversight of the investigations into election-related cyberattacks."" Mr. Nunes also noted that his committee would be scrutinizing the review of the Russian effort to influence the election ordered last week by President Obama. Democrats have used the latest intelligence findings to renew their calls for an urgent inquiry. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, demanded on Monday that all information about Russia's meddling be declassified, and that the Obama administration explain what it knows about the hacking and when it knew it. ""We now know that the C.I.A. has determined Russia's interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump,"" Mr. Podesta wrote in a statement. ""This should distress every American. Never before in the history of our republic have we seen such an effort to undermine the bedrock of our democracy."" Three Senate Democrats - Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont - called on Monday for the creation of an independent, nonpartisan commission to comprehensively investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Mr. McConnell stopped short of calling for a special select committee, saying that the Senate Intelligence Committee was ""more than capable of conducting a complete review"" of the matter. While he stopped short of saying whether he agreed that Russia had interfered in the election in support of Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell said, ""We need to approach all these on the assumption the Russians do not wish us well."" Mr. McCain was less equivocal, saying Monday that there was ""no doubt about the hacking"" by Russian intelligence services. He called the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and related accounts ""another form of warfare"" in an appearance on ""CBS This Morning"" with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader. And one week before the Electoral College meets to ratify Mr. Trump's election victory, 10 electors have demanded their own intelligence briefing on Russian efforts to elect Mr. Trump. For his part, Mr. Trump was dismissive of the intelligence findings and suggested that Democrats were simply stirring controversy. ""Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!"" Mr. Trump said in a Twitterpost on Monday. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that the administration would support a congressional review. He also rejected the notion that the administration had failed to adequately highlight the Russian efforts before the election, saying it had extensively briefed Congress all year about Russian electoral meddling. ""There has been intensive cooperation between the intelligence community and other national security agencies, and members of Congress in both parties, both before and after the election,"" Mr. Earnest said. ""The briefings have been provided in a variety of settings, both classified and unclassified."" Even beyond the conclusions of the intelligence community, Mr. Trump's campaign had widely known and extensive ties to the Russian government. A campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had worked for the Russian-backed government in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump's choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, had consulted for a Russian-backed media group, Mr. Earnest noted. Mr. Earnest said that Congress had a ""special responsibility"" to investigate the ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, because those connections were widely known before the election. He added that, for Capitol Hill Republicans, how to ""reconcile their political strategy and their patriotism is something they're going to have to explain.""

Senators Push to Broaden Inquiry on Election Hacking,"WASHINGTON - Pressure mounted on Sunday for a broader congressional investigation of Russian cyberattacks aimed at influencing the American election, even as a top aide to President-elect Donald J. Trump said there was no conclusive evidence of foreign interference. The effort was being led by a bipartisan group of senators, including John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader, who called on Sunday for the creation of a Senate select committee on cyberactivity to take the investigative lead on Capitol Hill. ""Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,"" the senators wrote on Sunday in a letter to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who has said a select committee is not necessary. ""Cybersecurity is the ultimate cross-jurisdictional challenge, and we must take a comprehensive approach to meet this challenge effectively."" The developments served to deepen the fissures between high-ranking lawmakers of both parties who see American intelligence reports implicating Russia as the basis for additional inquiries and Mr. Trump, who continues to reject the conclusions of those reports.  But the developments also put new strain on Mr. McConnell. He now faces calls from Mr. McCain and Lindsey Graham, two Senate Republicans considered well versed on national security issues, to form a select committee. If he were to reject that appeal, he would be subject to criticism that he was trying to avoid a spotlight on an issue that senators in both parties believe is worthy of more focused scrutiny. Mr. McConnell said last week that while he respects the intelligence agencies' conclusions, the Senate Intelligence Committee is ""more than capable of conducting a complete review"" itself. He also acknowledged that Mr. McCain could conduct an investigation on the Armed Services Committee, an option that remains open should Mr. McConnell decide against a select committee. Those divisions, coming as the Electoral College prepares to meet on Monday to ratify Mr. Trump's election and the president-elect completes his cabinet choices, all but ensured that the issue would cloud the first months of Mr. Trump's presidency, when he will be asking Congress to approve an aggressive legislative agenda. Several permanent congressional committees have already been tasked with examining various aspects of the Russian interference, which has been largely accepted as fact by most members of Congress. But in their letter on Sunday, the lawmakers argued the issue was too important and complicated for an existing committee to take on properly. ""We share your respect for, and deference to, the regular order of the Senate, and we recognize that this is an extraordinary request,"" the senators wrote to Mr. McConnell. ""However, we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem."" In addition to undertaking a ""comprehensive investigation of Russian interference,"" the senators recommended that such a committee also develop ""comprehensive recommendations and, as necessary, new legislation to modernize our nation's laws, governmental organization, and related practices to meet this challenge."" Select committees, which are typically created to examine a particular issue for a limited time, are rarely formed. The most prominent recent example is the House Select Committee on the attacks in 2012 on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, an inquiry that Democrats have denounced as unduly partisan. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said last week that the House Intelligence Committee would continue its own examination of Russian hacking. Mr. Schumer said in a news conference on Sunday that they intended to avoid such charges of partisanship. ""We don't want it to just be finger pointing at one person or another,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""We want to find out what the Russians are doing to our political system and what other foreign governments might do to our political system. And then figure out a way to stop it."" A spokesman for Mr. McConnell, David Popp, referred to Mr. McConnell's earlier comments and said the majority leader would be reviewing the latest letter. The letter was also signed by Mr. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that Mr. McCain leads. It follows a signed statement from the lawmakers, released last week, warning that any congressional investigation into the hacks ""cannot become a partisan issue."" Mr. Trump, for his part, has sought to paint the intelligence community's conclusions about the matter as just that - a partisan attack against him. He said last week that the reports were ""just another excuse"" by Democrats frustrated with the election results that might be used to try to undermine his victory. Asked on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday what information Mr. Trump had received that led him to reject intelligence assessments, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump's top advisers, insisted that the reports about the hacking were groundless. ""Where is the evidence?"" Ms. Conway asked, turning the question around. ""Why, when C.I.A. officials were invited to a House intelligence briefing last week, did they refuse to go?"" Robert M. Gates, the former defense secretary under President Obama and President George W. Bush who has offered counsel to Mr. Trump, speculated on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the president-elect ""felt the way this information came out through newspaper stories and so on was somehow intended to delegitimize his victory in the election and that he's reacting to that rather than 'the facts on the ground,' as it were."" But Mr. Gates also said the Russian hacking was aimed at discrediting the American electoral process. ""Whether or not it was intended to help one candidate or another, I don't know,"" said Mr. Gates, who also served as C.I.A. director under President George Bush. ""But I think it clearly was aimed at discrediting our elections, and I think it was aimed certainly at weakening Mrs. Clinton."" Mr. Obama, in a news conference on Friday, vowed that the United States would respond to the attack. He said that he was still weighing a mix of covert and public actions to retaliate before he leaves office. And lawmakers from both parties have proposed new sanctions to punish Russia. Speaking Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Mr. McCain sought to add urgency to the matter. ""There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt that it was cyberattacks,"" he said of the Russians. ""The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we have been totally paralyzed."" Mr. McCain said that he had faith that ""reality is going to intercede at one point or another"" on Mr. Trump, suggesting that the president-elect might come to agree about Russian influence. Asked on CBS about Mr. Obama's pledge of retaliation, Ms. Conway said Mr. Trump ""respects"" Mr. Obama's right to respond as he sees fit for the remainder of his presidency. But, she added, that ""doesn't mean that new President Trump will agree with it and continue it."" ""It does seem to be a political response at this point because it seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can't accept the election results,"" she said.Related Articles   "
Australia Stops a Census Effort After Attacks,"Follow Austin Ramzy on Twitter @austinramzy . Australia has halted online collection of national census data after a website where citizens could upload information was subjected to repeated cyberattacks. The Australian Bureau of Statistics said its website had experienced four denial-of-service attacks, in which a torrent of automated requests is sent to overwhelm a site. The last attack, just after 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, contributed to the overloading of a router, which led to the decision that night to close down online data gathering.     The census, which occurs every five years, has been the subject of intense criticism and questions this year over whether the introduction of online data collection could leave Australians' personal information at risk.   Australian officials said on Wednesday that the census system had not been infiltrated and that no data had been compromised.   Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had been given ''unequivocal advice'' from government agencies on the safety of citizens' filings.   ''The site has not been hacked. It has not been interfered with,'' he said at a news conference. ''Their data is safe.''   Australian officials did not describe the source of the attack, but they said it appeared to have been intended to disrupt the census process.   Alastair MacGibbon, the prime minister's special adviser on cybersecurity, said it was the sort of assault typically used against government systems. ''A denial of service is not a breach. It's not designed to take data,'' he said. ''A denial of service is designed to frustrate.''   Senator Nick Xenophon, an independent, and at least five Greens party senators had said earlier that they would not put their names on their census filings, to protest the data gathering and storage methods. Failing to complete census forms in Australia is punishable by fines, but Mr. Xenophon said he was willing to be a test case to raise questions about information security.   Mr. Xenophon told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that ''there are real concerns'' raised by the census process and the website shutdown.   ''The census, the A.B.S., has had five years to get this right,'' he said, referring to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.   The statistics bureau said it would relaunch the site when ''we know it is robust and secure'' and when the Australian Signals Directorate, the Defense Department agency responsible for cybersecurity, said it was safe.   The government also said Australians could submit their census data until Sept. 23. Two million Australians successfully submitted forms before the system was shut down, the statistics bureau said. People who do not have access to the website can submit a paper form, the government said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Are the Free Wi-Fi Kiosks on New York Streets Safe?,"Q. Are those LinkNYC Wi-Fi things on the street safe to use? Will the city (or anybody else) collect personal information about me? A. The LinkNYC kiosks that began to supplant aging pay phones on the sidewalks around New York City this year can also make calls -- but they do so in a very 21st-century manner. Passers-by can make free phone calls to anywhere in the United States through the Vonage service on each kiosk, using the small display screen, microphone and keypad on the front of each unit. (For privacy and volume control, users can also plug in their own headphones.)     Each of the slender vertical LinkNYC towers also provides a fast, free Wi-Fi connection for mobile devices and laptops. The display screen offers free web browsing, and each Link station has USB ports for charging phone and tablet batteries. For emergencies, each tower has a red 911 button, too.   As explained in the privacy section of the LinkNYC website, when you first use one of the kiosks, you need to supply an email address to be informed of updates or changes to the service. Each unit collects anonymous aggregated data to study for system use and diagnostics -- as well as to influence the large color advertising screens on the sides of the kiosk that subsidize the service.   Using any public wireless network or computer terminal brings a risk of compromised security, and the New York Civil Liberties Union has previously expressed concern about data privacy with the LinkNYC units. However, the kiosks do have certain precautions built in.   For example, there is a standard open network called ''LinkNYC Free Wi-Fi'' that relies on your web browser's security to encrypt data between your device and the hot spot. But this type of network is less secure than others.   The kiosks also include a ''LinkNYC Private'' network for those with the hardware to handle it. This is an encrypted network connection between the towers and the devices that support the Hotspot 2.0 technology -- at this point, mainly Apple iPhones and iPads released in the last three years or so and running at least iOS 7.   For further security measures, the USB ports on the LinkNYC towers can be used only for charging devices but not for transferring data (including malicious software that may be lurking). The LinkNYC's web browser has a content filter designed to help screen out malware, although the software has not been particularly successful yet in blocking adult-oriented sites from public use. And in case you forget to log out of a webpage, the kiosk will automatically log you out after 30 seconds of inactivity.   Even with all the safeguards in place, it is a good idea to treat the LinkNYC kiosks as you would any public network anywhere in the world. Do not log in to sites that store your financial information, do not enter your credit card number into any web forms and stay aware of others on the street who may be playing close attention to your online activity.

Details Emerge on New Attack by Hackers Aimed at Bank,"Just how securely are banks moving money around the world? New details emerged on Friday about a pair of related attacks on banks that use the Swift message service, which allows financial firms and companies to transfer payments around the world.    Computer security researchers briefed on the investigation into one of the attacks, on the Bangladesh Bank, raised several theories about the crime, including the possibility that groups from Pakistan and North Korea may have been spying on the bank. Other analysts investigating the attacks said there were striking similarities between the ''multiple bespoke tools'' used by the hackers in both the banking cases and the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014.    The latest breach detailed by Swift in a letter to its users on Friday occurred at a commercial bank that appeared, according to a leading online security firm BAE Systems on Friday, to be located in Vietnam.   That attack and the $81 million heist from the Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February are thought to be part of a broad assault on the global banking system by thieves whose operating methods and digital fingerprints are being studied carefully by analysts worldwide.   In both attacks on banks, the intruders obtained legitimate credentials to sign in to the Swift network. They initiated fraudulent money transfers, then covered their tracks using tailor-made malware.   Swift, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is a global banking consortium that operates a secure and trusted network that sends payment instructions between banks across international borders. In the predictable finger-pointing that has followed the news of the attacks, Swift has pointed out that its core network was not hacked -- just the end points at which the banks tap into it -- and the New York Fed has reiterated that it followed all proper procedures.   On Friday, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, released a statement calling on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to bolster its security even further.   ''I remain concerned that there are critical security gaps in the international payment system,'' Ms. Maloney said in a statement.   She also released correspondence between her office and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in which the bank's general counsel, Thomas C. Baxter Jr., assured her that ''there is no evidence that any Federal Reserve systems were compromised.''   Investigators briefed on the investigation at the Bangladesh central bank say that they had uncovered the presence of three groups of intruders inside the bank's systems: two nations -- Pakistan and North Korea -- and a third, unidentified group of digital criminals thought to have siphoned the funds from the bank to accounts in the Philippines.   Also on Friday, two forensics investigators at BAE Systems outlined evidence that suggested similarities between the Bangladesh heist and a 2014 attack against Sony Pictures that law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States have traced to North Korea. That year, Sony released the farcical movie ''The Interview,'' which poked fun at North Korea.   The investigators pointed to specialized, identical tools -- including identical encryption keys, file names and a highly unusual data deletion technique -- that were used in the attack on Sony Pictures, the Bangladesh central bank and the Vietnamese bank.   However, people briefed on the actual investigation at the Bangladesh bank, who would speak only on the condition that they not be named, said that while the same tools were present inside Bangladesh's systems, suggesting any link between that heist and the North Korean hackers would be premature.   Banks are frequent targets not just for profit-seeking digital criminals, but also nation states hoping to track spending by their perceived enemies or to gain insights into deal-making activity.   In 2012, investigators at the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab revealed a campaign by nations, presumably the United States or Israel, aimed at banks in Lebanon, including the Bank of Beirut, Blom Bank, Byblos Bank and Credit Libanais, along with Citibank and PayPal.   In that case, the organizations involved in the Lebanese bank intrusions never stole any funds. Rather, they used stolen credentials to track customers' assets and spending.   By their nature, hackers are difficult to trace, and theories advanced immediately after a breach can turn out to be wrong.   In summer 2014, when hackers stole account information from tens of millions of customers at JPMorgan Chase, experts initially pointed to Russia, raising concerns about national security.   In the end, federal prosecutors said that attack might have been partly the work of Israeli nationals and individuals who knew each other from Florida State University, and that their attack on the bank may have been aimed at advancing a pump-and-dump stock scheme. No money was stolen from JPMorgan in that breach.   Large banks in the United States and Europe, which are part owners of Swift, have been monitoring the developments and are studying whether they need to adjust any of their defenses to guard against similar intrusions.   ''We are pretty fast learners,'' said Doug Johnson, senior vice president for payments and security at the American Bankers Association, a trade group. ''We proactively share information about how to mitigate these threats.''   In the heist at Bangladesh Bank, the thieves used the stolen credentials to authorize the transfer of $951 million from the central bank's account at the New York Fed.   The Fed approved five of the payments to accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines. As far as the bank employees in the United States could tell, the payment requests had been authenticated by Swift.   One of those five requests was ultimately blocked by a bank in Sri Lanka, which noticed that the name of the supposed nonprofit group that was to receive the funds was misspelled. Instead of ''Foundation,'' it was spelled ''Fundation,'' according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a continuing criminal investigation.   The New York officials relied entirely on Swift to authenticate the transfers, according to a letter from the New York Fed that Ms. Maloney's office released on Friday. It does not independently vet other users on the Swift network.   The New York Fed withheld an additional 30 requested transfers from Bangladesh because one address that was supposed to receive a payment contained the same name as a ship known for smuggling activity, the person briefed on the matter said.   It turned out the address and the smuggling ship were unrelated, but that was enough to raise the New York Fed's concerns. When they couldn't reconfirm with officials in Bangladesh that transfers were legitimate, the New York bank denied them.     "
North Koreans Tied to Attacks at Asian Banks,"Security researchers have tied the recent spate of digital breaches on Asian banks to North Korea, in what they say appears to be the first known case of a nation using digital attacks for financial gain. In three recent attacks on banks, researchers working for the digital security firm Symantec said, the thieves deployed a rare piece of code that had been seen in only two previous cases: the hacking attack at Sony Pictures in December 2014 and attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea in 2013. Government officials in the United States and South Korea have blamed those attacks on North Korea, though they have not provided independent verification.    On Thursday, the Symantec researchers said they had uncovered evidence linking an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and one in February on the central bank of Bangladesh that resulted in the theft of more than $81 million.   ''If you believe North Korea was behind those attacks, then the bank attacks were also the work of North Korea,'' said Eric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec, who found that identical code was used across all three attacks.    ''We've never seen an attack where a nation-state has gone in and stolen money,'' Mr. Chien added. ''This is a first.''   The attacks have raised alarms in the global banking industry because the thieves gained access to Swift, a Brussels-based banking consortium that runs what is considered the world's most secure payment messaging system. Swift's system is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money from one country to another -- one reason that it is a tempting target for criminals.   Swift has warned publicly that the attacks are part of a broad coordinated assault on banks, though it has not assigned blame. It has also emphasized that it was the banks' connection points to its network -- and not the core Swift messaging network itself -- that the attackers were able to breach. Also, American bankers have noted that the security lapses all occurred at banks in third-world countries, which may give some comfort to banking customers in the United States.   Security researchers and American government officials have tied thousands of attacks to nations in the past. They have linked the United States and Israel to an attack that destroyed Iranian centrifuges, and the Chinese military and contractors to attacks that stole military and trade secrets from thousands of foreign entities.   But the latest spate of attacks on banks in Bangladesh and Southeast Asia would be the first time, security researchers say, that a nation has used malicious code to steal purely for financial profit.   The idea that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft would not be surprising. North Korea's economy has been ravaged by sanctions, food shortages and other deprivations. Pyongyang does not publish economic data, but estimates have put North Korea's gross domestic product between $12 billion and $40 billion, tiny when compared with South Korea's economic output of more than $1.4 trillion.   In the attack at Bangladesh's central bank in February, the thieves tried to transfer $1 billion in funds from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Fed officials became suspicious of the some of requested transfers and released only $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.   ''If you presume it's North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,'' Mr. Chien said. ''This is not small change for them.''   Symantec researchers said it was possible that the bank in the Philippines containing the North Korean code was also involved in the Bangladesh bank scheme and the attempted breach on the Vietnamese bank. The researchers would not identify the Philippines bank and did not say whether the thieves had been successful in transferring funds. Researchers were able to confirm only that the attackers had managed to breach the bank and install identical code strings on the bank's computer systems -- the same code that they discovered in Bangladesh, Vietnam and the two previous attacks at Sony in 2014 and South Korea in 2013.   Mr. Chien noted that the attackers not only used identical numbers but wrote the code in the same, unusual sequence across all three attacks.   Mr. Chien said the evidence pointed to all three attacks being the work of the ''Lazarus Group,'' a name his team gave to the attackers behind the Sony and South Korean attacks.   Officials have pointed to North Korea's threat of ''merciless countermeasures'' against Sony if the studio released ''The Interview,'' a movie by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg that made fun of North Korea and includes a fictional assassination of its leader. F.B.I. analysts also note critical mistakes North Korean hackers made, such as logging into their attack servers from known North Korean Internet addresses and even logging into both their Facebook account and Sony's servers from the same computers.   In the months since evidence of the attacks involving the Swift network started to emerge, investigators have been looking for commonalities at numerous other potential breaches. It remains unclear whether these breaches are connected to the ones in Bangladesh and Vietnam, but they too have occurred in or around Southeast Asia.   There is no evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro, an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were also able to sneak onto the Swift network. The thieves transferred several million dollars to accounts around the world, according to a lawsuit the bank filed in federal court in the United States against Wells Fargo, which facilitated one of the transfers.   Researchers have yet to unearth any of the code used in the Ecuador attack, but banking analysts say it is probably no coincidence that these attacks are happening in the developing world, where security measures tend not to be as tight as they are in financial hubs like New York and London.   Swift has issued numerous warnings in recent weeks urging banks to step up their security protocols. Analysts worry that the breaches could have a chilling effect on global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they can have assurances that their networks have not been compromised by thieves and malware.   At a conference on Tuesday in Brussels, Swift's chief executive, Gottfried Leibbrandt, said the recent attacks could do far more damage than breaches on retailers and telephone companies, which he said suffer largely reputational and legal hits.   ''Banks that are compromised like this can be put out of business,'' Mr. Leibbrandt said.   North Korea has long been known for creative attempts to generate badly needed hard currency. In the last decade, United States government officials accused North Korea of counterfeiting $100 bills, which were known as ''superdollars'' or ''supernotes'' because the fakes were nearly flawless. The Federal Reserve began thwarting that effort by circulating a new $100 bill over the last three years that makes counterfeiting nearly impossible: The redesigned $100 is easier to authenticate and harder to replicate.   ''North Korea is hurting for money,'' said Herb Lin, the senior research scholar for cyberpolicy and security at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation and a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. ''They've been cut out of the financial system because of sanctions. They had been among the best counterfeiters in the world, and only recently have they been stymied in the counterfeiting of superdollars. If it's true that we've cut them off from that, then it's not at all surprising that they would turn to something else.''     "
The Chinese Hackers in the Back Office,"BELLEVILLE, Wis. -- Drive past the dairy farms, cornfields and horse pastures here and you will eventually arrive at Cate Machine & Welding, a small-town business run by Gene and Lori Cate and their sons. For 46 years, the Cates have welded many things -- fertilizer tanks, jet-fighter parts, cheese molds, even a farmer's broken glasses. And like many small businesses, they have a dusty old computer humming away in the back office. On this one, however, an unusual spy-versus-spy battle is playing out: The machine has been taken over by Chinese hackers.    The hackers use it to plan and stage attacks. But unbeknown to them, a Silicon Valley start-up is tracking them here, in real time, watching their every move and, in some cases, blocking their efforts.    ''When they first told us, we said, 'No way,''' Mr. Cate said one afternoon recently over pizza and cheese curds, recalling when he first learned the computer server his family used to manage its welding business had been secretly repurposed. ''We were totally freaked out,'' Ms. Cate said. ''We had no idea we could be used as an infiltration unit for Chinese attacks.''   On a recent Thursday, the hackers' targets appeared to be a Silicon Valley food delivery start-up, a major Manhattan law firm, one of the world's biggest airlines, a prominent Southern university and a smattering of targets across Thailand and Malaysia. The New York Times viewed the action on the Cates' computer on the condition that it not name the targets.   The activity had the hallmarks of Chinese hackers known as the C0d0s0 group, a collection of hackers for hire that the security industry has been tracking for years. Over the years, the group has breached banks, law firms and tech companies, and once hijacked the Forbes website to try to infect visitors' computers with malware.   There is a murky and much hyped emerging industry in selling intelligence about attack groups like the C0d0s0 group. Until recently, companies typically adopted a defensive strategy of trying to make their networks as impermeable as possible in hopes of repelling attacks. Today, so-called threat intelligence providers sell services that promise to go on the offensive. They track hackers, and for annual fees that can climb into the seven figures, they try to spot and thwart attacks before they happen.   These companies have a mixed record of success. Still, after years of highly publicized incidents, Gartner, a market research company, expects the market for threat intelligence to reach $1 billion next year, up from $255 million in 2013.   Remarkably, many attacks rely on a tangled maze of compromised computers including those mom-and-pop shops like Cate Machine & Welding. The hackers aren't after the Cates' data. Rather, they have converted their server, and others like it, into launchpads for their attacks.   These servers offer the perfect cover. They aren't terribly well protected, and rarely, if ever, do the owners discover that their computers have become conduits for spies and digital thieves. And who would suspect the Cate family?   Two years ago, the Cates received a visit from men informing them that their server had become a conduit for Chinese spies. The Cates asked: ''Are you from the N.S.A.?''   One of the men had, in fact, worked at the National Security Agency years before joining a start-up company, Area 1, that focuses on tracking digital attacks against businesses. ''It's like being a priest,'' said Blake Darché, Area 1's chief security officer, of his N.S.A. background. ''In other people's minds, you never quite leave the profession.''   Mr. Darché wanted to add the Cates' server to Area 1's network of 50 others that had been co-opted by hackers. Area 1 monitors the activity flowing into and out of these computers to glean insights into attackers' methods, tools and websites so that it can block them from hitting its clients' networks, or give them a heads-up days, weeks or even months before they hit.   The Cates called a family meeting. ''People work really hard to make products, and they're getting stolen,'' Ms. Cate said. ''It seemed like the least we could do.'' Area 1 paid for the installation cost, about $150.   Shortly after installing a sensor on the machine, Mr. Darché said his hunch was confirmed: The sensor lit up with attacks. Area 1 began to make out the patterns of a familiar adversary: the C0d0s0 group.   Area 1 was founded by three former N.S.A. analysts, Mr. Darché, Oren Falkowitz and Phil Syme. The three sat side by side at Fort Meade, tracking and, in some cases, penetrating adversaries' weapons systems for intelligence. A little over two years ago, they decided to start their own company and raised $25.5 million in funding from major venture capitalists and security entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, including Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers and Cowboy Ventures, and security veterans like Ray Rothrock, the chief executive of RedSeal, and Derek Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security.   Area 1 is a new player in threat intelligence, a nascent subsector of the security business that includes companies like iSight Partners and Recorded Future that track attackers in underground web forums and on social media, gleaning intelligence about them.   Threat intelligence is still more art than science. The jury is still out on whether companies are equipped to use that intelligence to thwart hackers. Area 1 claims that it can head off attacks through the compromised servers it is tracking. It can also use its vantage point to see where attackers are setting up shop on the web and how they plan to target their intended victims.   A handful of Area 1 customers confirmed that its technology had helped head off attackers. One client, a chief information security officer at a large health care provider, said the health care sector had been slammed by digital criminals and governments in recent years. He asked that the company not be named, to avoid becoming a more visible target.   He credited Area 1's sensors with blocking several attacks on his network, helping his company avoid the fates of the health insurer Anthem, which was breached by Chinese hackers last year, and a growing number of hospitals hit by attacks that have forced them to pay a ransom to get important information back.   Mr. Smith, the chief executive of Shape Security, said Area 1 gave his company warning of three attacks before they happened, providing time to block them. Mr. Smith said he was impressed enough that he made a small investment in Area 1.   ''Many of these mom-and-pop shops are ambivalent because the attacks don't directly impact their business and revenue,'' he said. ''Meanwhile, they unwittingly operate this attack infrastructure.''   But Area 1's business model can pose ethical dilemmas. What does the company do when it sees attacks against prominent companies and government agencies who are not Area 1 customers?   ''We think of ourselves as a bodyguard, not a police force that runs around telling everyone they're a victim,'' said Mr. Falkowitz, Area 1's chief executive. ''We're in the business of pre-emption.''   They do warn some victims, he said. For instance, they tipped off a law firm, a manufacturer, a financial services firm and electronics company that were attacked via the Cates' server after they saw the C0d0s0 hackers make off with their intellectual property. Some of those victims, including the law firm, later signed up for Area 1 services.   Not all companies heed the warning. A security consultant for one victim, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements, said that his client chose not to act on a tip from Area 1 last year out of concern that a scandal over a successful online attack against the company would jeopardize its recent acquisition. It figured its acquirer would not have been thrilled to learn that the start-up's proprietary technology was now in Chinese hacker's hands.   Posted on the wall of Area 1's headquarters in a historic house in Redwood City, Calif., is a list titled ''45 Things That Are Harder Than Cybersecurity.'' It includes flight, solar power, the flu vaccine, brain surgery, the internet, heart transplants, skyscrapers, the Thermos and the Q-tip.   Mr. Falkowitz disagrees with a growing concern that it is too difficult or impossible to stop online attacks. As attackers have grown more sophisticated, many security companies have stopped believing they can block attacks with traditional defenses like antivirus software. Instead, many focus on trying to detect an intrusion ''in real time,'' to catch hackers before they steal too much.   Eighty percent of the time, victims learn they have been breached only when law enforcement or someone else shows up with their stolen data, according to Verizon, which tracks breach data.   At the N.S.A., Mr. Falkowitz had worked with teams that detected North Korean missile launches. Much of that early work was done with satellites that would look for sudden heat blasts.   Eventually, Mr. Falkowitz's team tried a more proactive approach. If they could hack the computers that controlled the missile launch systems, they could glean launch schedules. Area 1 is now taking a similar approach to digital attacks, tapping into the attackers' launchpads, as it were, rather than waiting for them to attack.   Hackers don't just press a big red ''attack'' button one day. They do reconnaissance, scout out employees on LinkedIn, draft carefully worded emails to trick unsuspecting employees to open them and click on links or email attachments that will try to launch malicious attacks.   Once they persuade a target to click -- and 91 percent of attacks start this way, according to Trend Micro, the security firm -- it takes time to crawl through a victim's network to find something worth taking. Then they have to pull that data off the network. The process can take weeks, months, even years and leaves a digital trail.   Area 1 watches for this kind of activity and then teams up with firms like Blue Coat, a web security company, to build what it has learned into security software that can try to block attacks when they come.   The owners of Cate Machine & Welding say that living with Chinese attackers in your office can be a strange feeling. Recently, Area 1 executives visited the shop and showed them some of what they had learned from watching their computer. The C0d0s0 group had used their server to pilfer a law firm's due diligence on an impending acquisition, a financial services firm's confidential trading plans, a mobile payment start-up's proprietary source code, some blueprints and loan applications at a mortgage company.   Hearing that, Mr. Cate expressed pride -- and maybe even a hint of schadenfreude. For years, the welding business that is his family's bread and butter has been migrating to China. Now his family is helping American businesses fight back.   ''We want to do the right thing for these businesses,'' Mr. Cate said, ''For our country.''     "
Voice in Russia Adds to Intrigue Over Computer Attacks in U.S.,"BIYSK, Russia -- Living anonymously, down a winding road in the wilderness of western Siberia, not far from the Mongolian border, the only person so far implicated in the flurry of Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political sites was obviously enjoying the moment. ''We have the information, but nobody contacted us,'' said Vladimir M. Fomenko, a tattooed 26-year-old who snowboards in his free time and runs a business out of a rented apartment.    ''It's like nobody wants to sort this out,'' he added with a sly grin.   Mr. Fomenko was recently identified by an American cybersecurity company, ThreatConnect, as the manager of an ''information nexus'' that was used by hackers suspected of working for Russian state security in cyberattacks on democratic processes in several countries, including Germany, Turkey and Ukraine, as well as the United States.    Rather than issuing blanket denials, Mr. Fomenko is apparently eager to discuss his case, lending another, if still cryptic, dimension to the intrigue, restricted before now to digital codes and online fingerprints.   Mr. Fomenko is the owner of a server rental company called King Servers used by hackers in an incursion on computerized election systems in Arizona and Illinois this year. Its other principal clients, he said, have been pornographers.   His response has been a blend of sarcasm, vague denials and an invitation to cooperate with the F.B.I., offering potentially critical evidence in the Arizona and Illinois cases, should officials reach out to him here.   ''If the F.B.I. asks, we are ready to supply the I.P. addresses, the logs,'' he said, referring to internet protocols, which identify a particular web page or device. ''But nobody is asking. That is a big question.''   Another is just how much Mr. Fomenko knows. Attribution in cases like these is a notoriously tricky business, especially when governments route their attacks through proxy servers like his or, in many cases, outsource espionage activities to criminal groups to maintain a measure of plausible deniability.   The investigation that led here began after the hacking of the state voting systems from June until August, what cyberanalysts say could be a bold bid by a resurgent Russia to undermine Americans' faith in their electoral process. The F.B.I. published eight internet addresses used in the attack. The bureau did not name the states, but officials in Arizona and Illinois acknowledged that their computers had been hacked.   ThreatConnect then identified six of the eight addresses as originating from servers owned by King Servers, Mr. Fomenko's company, in Dronten, the Netherlands, and possibly elsewhere. Mr. Fomenko also owns servers in Fremont, Calif.; Garden City, N.Y.; and Moscow.   The hackers, according to ThreatConnect, had used one of the eight internet addresses to send 113 precisely targeted, so-called spear phishing emails intended to dupe election officials and politicians in Turkey, Germany and Ukraine to click on links that downloaded malware. Some emails mimicked Gmail security warnings or notes from LinkedIn, the social networking site.   The emails were sent to members of the governing Justice and Development Party in Turkey, the German Freedom Party and Ukrainian members of Parliament, ThreatConnect said.   This spear phishing activity targeting the three countries was staged from one of the two addresses not originating from King Servers, while a King Servers address used Tor, the anonymity software, in the Illinois and Arizona electoral board hacks.   The security researchers said that the hackers who used Mr. Fomenko's server as part of this broader campaign were ''looking to manipulate multiple countries' democratic processes'' and that their modus operandi was ''more suggestive of state-backed rather than criminally motivated activity.''   Russian officials have denied any involvement in the hacking, but in an interview this month, President Vladimir V. Putin asked Bloomberg, ''Does it even matter who hacked this data?'' implying that the revelations were more important than the source. ''The content was given to the public,'' he added.   The Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary  Clinton, blamed the Russian security services for the hackings, and said that Mr. Putin ''could barely muster the energy to deny'' Russia's involvement. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, has played down the prospect that Russia was involved.   Ambiguity has trailed the Russian hacking story all along. Mr. Fomenko, in an interview in a bar here called Rocks, flatly denied having any ties to the hacking. Yet he sports a collarbone-to-jaw tattoo of what he described as a version of the theatrical mask that is the symbol of the hacking group Anonymous.   He denied any connection to the group, saying he simply liked the symbolism of the mask. ''A person can be evil, or a person can be good, or a person can hide who they are,'' he said.   The equivocation of responses by Mr. Putin and Mr. Fomenko is studied and deliberate, Kenneth Geers, a senior research scientist at Comodo, a cybersecurity firm, and a former cybersecurity officer with NATO, said in a telephone interview.   ''You are not saying yes, you are not saying no, so it's frustrating for the victim, and it's intimidating,'' he said. ''You are suggesting there is more to come.''   The tattoo, though, ''is something of a giveaway.''   Mr. Fomenko, raised by a single mother, studied computer science at a technical college. He said he founded King Servers in 2008 when he was 18, buying computer servers and arranging for their installation remotely in Fremont, a city he said he had never visited.   He said he had about a thousand clients, 20 percent to 30 percent of whom are pornographers. Authorities in the Netherlands, he said, have notified him on several occasions that his servers had been used for spreading malware, advertising counterfeit designer handbags and distributing child pornography; in those cases, he said, he immediately revoked the rental agreements and closed the servers.   ''If the person looks young, maybe 17 or 18, you cannot tell, we shut them down,'' he said. ''Every company has their problems. You cannot control everything.''   Mr. Fomenko said prospective renters using the nicknames Robin Good and Dick Robin had contacted him online in May and paid through WebMoney, an online payment system, not an uncommon profile for his clients.   On Sept. 15, Mr. Fomenko issued a statement saying that he had learned belatedly from news reports of the accusation that the hacking of the Arizona and Illinois voting systems were staged from two of his servers, and that he had shut them down. Mr. Fomenko does not deny that hackers used his servers, but does deny knowing that they did until Sept. 15. He says he does not know who they are, but that they are certainly not the Russian security agencies.   ''The analysis of the internal data allows King Services to confidently refute any conclusions about the involvement of the Russian special services in this attack,'' he said in his statement. But then, apparently striking a sarcastic tone, he said he would send a bill to Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin for server rent left unpaid by the hackers.   He also says he has never been contacted by Russian or foreign law enforcement.   The clients, though, had left a trail through their contact with his billing page, he said. He added that he possessed the next step in the chain to bring investigators in the United States closer to the hackers, about 60 I.P. addresses used by his client -- the hacker of the state electoral systems -- to contact him. He said the addresses belonged to server companies in Britain, Finland, France, Italy, Norway and Sweden.   It was these addresses, he said, that he would be willing to share with the F.B.I., if ''somebody wants to sort this out.''   While ambiguous about the hacking on his servers, Mr. Fomenko minced no words about American presidential politics. ''In Russia, we don't have this type of election,'' he said. ''It looks like little children fighting.''     "
"No Business Too Small to Be Hacked, but Security Need Not Be Costly","Just as the holiday shopping season neared, a toy company, Rokenbok Education, was navigating a nightmare situation: Its database files had been infected by malware. Online criminals had encrypted company files, making them unusable, and were demanding a hefty ransom to unlock the data. Rokenbok, a California-based company that uses building blocks and even robotics to teach children how to think like engineers, lost thousands of dollars in sales in two days.    Rokenbok's founder and executive director, Paul Eichen, was already struggling to adapt his seven-employee company to a fast-changing toy world. Even worse, the malware attack was not Rokenbok's first. The company had been hit earlier with a denial of service attack that shut down the company's website.   ''I sweated that one,'' Mr. Eichen said. ''Customers' first impressions are critical.''    Focusing on revenue over protection is far from unusual for small companies like Rokenbok. But it is an increasingly dangerous path, experts say. Limited security budgets, outdated security and lax employees can leave holes that are easily exploited by ever-more-sophisticated digital criminals.   The threat to small businesses is growing, some experts say. Sixty percent of all online attacks in 2014 targeted small and midsize businesses, according to Timothy C. Francis, enterprise leader of cyberinsurance at Travelers.   ''Smaller companies are easier to hack,'' said Clay Calvert, director of security at MetroStar Systems, a Virginia-based firm. ''They don't have the resources to set up protective barriers.'' Big companies, which have the financial resources to upgrade their security, have become less vulnerable.   These days, businesses like Rokenbok are especially susceptible to a type of malware called ransomware, which holds data hostage in return for money. Data is slowly encrypted by criminals until the entire system is locked up. The process can take up to 42 days, Mr. Calvert said.   Rokenbok's ransomware attack made its database files unusable. But rather than pay the ransom, the company reconstructed its key systems, a process that took four days.   Although figures are hard to come by, experts say these kinds of attacks can be so damaging to revenue and customer expectations that many small businesses are forced to close after an episode like the one Rokenbok experienced.   And increasingly, as in Rokenbok's case, criminals are going after cash through attacks using ransomware rather than through attacks on credit card data.   ''Credit card numbers are harder to monetize,'' said Christopher Young, general manager of the Intel Security Group at Intel Corporation. ''You have to get the numbers and sell them to someone else before you make money.'' Ransomware, he said, is high volume and requires no middleman. Hackers gain entry when employees click on malicious links in emails or download infected material.   Phishing attacks, which use malicious emails to steal data, are also on the rise, security experts added.   Given the increase in such attacks, being unprepared is like playing security roulette, said Robert Siciliano, chief executive of IdTheftSecurity.com.   ''If you're not deploying some level of security, you'll go under,'' he added. ''You have to make time for quality control. The worst thing you can do is nothing.''   Mr. Siciliano recommends a security audit as a first step. The audit should take note of potential areas of risk, like customer data or employee access. ''How secure -- or not -- is your system?'' he said.   Strengthening security can be inexpensive and simple -- something small businesses can do on their own, experts say. It can include updating antivirus software, adding firewalls and strengthening passwords. Or it can mean putting data in the cloud rather than on company servers, which may be more vulnerable. But often, given lean staffing, it makes more sense and can cost less in the long run to hire a firm that specializes in digital security.   Steven Annese, owner of the lighting and home décor company EliteFixtures, knew he needed tighter security as his business soared. So he outsourced security to a web performance and security firm, CloudFlare.   Mr. Annese uses a checklist to make sure security updates are installed. And he logs onto CloudFlare every day to see what threats have been blocked and to review site analytics.   ''So far, we've never been hacked,'' Mr. Annese said. ''Security issues don't keep me up at night.''   Among the simpler precautions small businesses and consumers alike can take is to create strong passwords. That has long been the advice of security experts but many say it is stunning how many people and small businesses fail to heed the advice.   Hackers use big-data analytics to help crack passwords, said Mr. Calvert at MetroStar Systems. ''They have databases of passwords,'' he said, ''and they analyze how we come up with them.''   He recommends using passwords that are 20 characters or longer and that contain a mix of characters. The longer the password, the harder it is to crack. Password managers, which use software to encrypt passwords, are another option, he added.   The 5050 Skatepark, an 8,000-square-foot indoor park on Staten Island for skateboards, BMX bikes and scooters, rejiggered its passwords after being hit with a denial of service attack last fall that made its website unavailable. The skatepark, which generated $100,000 in revenue in 2014, attracts skateboarders from all over the world, said one of its founders, Edward Pollio. Having the website closed down was a blow to revenue, he said.   ''The attack caused havoc,'' said Mr. Pollio, who still has a day job as a carpenter. ''People were asking if we were still in business. Not having a website is like being closed.''   Now, 5050 Skatepark is more strict about its passwords; it follows longstanding recommendations to use different ones for different accounts, like on Instagram and Twitter. And Mr. Pollio, who helped start the business with $50,000 of his own savings, monitors the site every day.   Employee training is also inexpensive, but important. Since most hacking episodes occur when employees click on malicious links or websites, education is the best defense, many security experts said.   Daniel Peebles, information technology manager at Andretti Autosport, the auto racing group based in Indianapolis, tackles education head on. Besides explaining malware and phishing through PowerPoint presentations, he sends emails to employees about the latest threats.    ''You must definitely have a will to learn,'' said Mr. Peebles, who served in the Army. ''Attackers are always finding new methods. So you've got to keep up with the pace.''   Tom Gorup, security operations leader at Rook Security in Indianapolis, advised preaching security to employees from the beginning. He advocates offering monetary rewards for identifying security problems. ''Become a guerrilla work force,'' added Mr. Gorup, who also served in the Army.   Online security tutorials are helpful and free. They can be found on government sites like that of the Small Business Administration, which also has webinars, and the site of the Defense Security Service, part of the Defense Department.   Once security is in place, experts advise hiring ethical hackers, who test a system by hacking into it to spot vulnerabilities. ''And they're less expensive than being hacked,'' Mr. Siciliano said.   Fighting the good fight against online criminals should now be part of any company growth strategy, he said.   Mr. Francis at Travelers said, ''Once data is compromised, the ball is rolling in terms of cost.'' Banks generally are not obligated to repay money taken from an account. And legal bills aimed at recouping that money can quickly pile up.   Worse, the criminals are hard to track down. They typically operate from office complexes in Eastern Europe or Russia. ''It's their business to hack businesses,'' Mr. Calvert said.   Rokenbok reported its malware attack to the local police, who said the F.B.I. was more suited to do the investigation. So far, no one has been arrested in connection with the attack.      "
Business Briefing; Software Demanding a Ransom Targets Mac Operating System,"For the first time, security experts say, a dangerous form of software called ''ransomware'' has successfully targeted a Mac operating system, piercing an image of safety that Apple customers had long enjoyed.  The attack, while noteworthy, affected a relatively small number of people and doesn't mean that typical Mac users should panic, experts say.    The software, when installed on a victim's computer, denies a user access to files unless a ransom is paid: about $400. It targets files that users would most likely find important: photos, videos, Excel spreadsheets and Word documents.   Two analysts from the California-based security firm Palo Alto Networks, Claud Xiao and Jin Chen, discovered on Friday that the ransomware was infecting downloads of Transmission, a legitimate BitTorrent file-sharing application, they said in a blog post.   About 6,500 users had downloaded the infected software over the weekend, a Transmission official told Forbes. That's a small fraction of overall Mac users; Apple sold 5.31 million Macs in the first quarter of 2016.   Attackers had compromised Transmission's website, changing its download link to include both the Transmission software and the ransomware, according to Ryan Olson, the threat intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks. The analysts found it about four hours after it was first uploaded, he said.   Such attacks are more common on machines running Windows, which has far more users, and have grown increasingly common in the past six to 12 months, Mr. Olson said. But even though Apple has had a good record of keeping dangerous software off computers, the successful attack could decrease user confidence, he said.   ''It's important to be aware that nothing is 100 percent,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''And every time we find a new one of these, that's just another signal that 100 percent is not possible.''   Apple revoked a certificate that allowed the software to be installed on Macs, according to Reuters, and Transmission removed the download link from its website on March 5, Palo Alto Networks said.   The ransomware, named KeRanger, would ''sleep'' for three days after being downloaded before encrypting the victim's files, Mr. Olson said.   Such attacks have had destructive effects, largely because they often work. In February, a hospital in Los Angeles paid hackers $17,000 in Bitcoin after its computer system was down for over a week.   Computers running Windows are often infected when users click a malicious link in an email or one hidden in an advertisement. Once their machines are infected, users often have no choice but to meet the hackers' demands.   Mac users have historically enjoyed more security from malicious applications, Mr. Olson said. ''Apple has a lot of gates in the way to prevent that from being successful,'' he said.   While Apple and Transmission responded quickly to limit the damage, the episode illustrates the value of backing up important files, Mr. Olson said. The effect of ransomware is much like a laptop falling into the river -- the damage can be limited if your important files exist somewhere else, he said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
F.B.I. Error Led to Loss of Data in Rampage,"WASHINGTON -- The head of the F.B.I. acknowledged on Tuesday that his agency lost a chance to capture data from the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers when it ordered that his password to the online storage service iCloud be reset shortly after the rampage. ''There was a mistake made in the 24 hours after the attack,'' James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., told lawmakers at a hearing on the government's attempt to force Apple to help ''unlock'' the iPhone.    F.B.I. personnel apparently believed that by resetting the iCloud password, they could get access to information stored on the iPhone. Instead, the change had the opposite effect -- locking them out and eliminating other means of getting in.    The iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the assailants in the Dec. 2 attack in which 14 people were killed, is at the center of a fierce legal and political fight over the balance between national security and consumer privacy. Many lawmakers at Tuesday's hearing of the House Judiciary Committee seemed torn over where to draw the line.   ''The big question for our country is how much privacy are we going to give up in the name of security,'' Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told Mr. Comey. ''And there's no easy answer to that.''   While some lawmakers voiced support for Apple's privacy concerns, others attacked the company's position, saying it threatened to deprive the authorities of evidence in critical cases involving newer iPhones.   ''We're going to create evidence-free zones?'' asked Representative Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who once served as a federal prosecutor. ''Am I missing something?''   ''How the hell you can't access a phone, I just find baffling,'' he said.   Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel, told committee members that the F.B.I.'s demand for technical help to unlock Mr. Farook's iPhone 5c ''would set a dangerous precedent for government intrusion on the privacy and safety of its citizens.'' Apple has said that in many cases investigators have other means to gain access to crucial information, and in some instances it has turned over data stored in iCloud.   Mr. Sewell reacted angrily to the Justice Department's suggestion that Apple's branding and marketing strategy was driving its resistance to helping the F.B.I., an assertion that he said made his ''blood boil.''   ''We don't put up billboards that market our security,'' he said. ''We do this because we think protecting security and privacy of hundreds of millions of iPhones is the right thing to do.''   F.B.I. officials say that encrypted data in Mr. Farook's phone and its GPS system may hold vital clues about where he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, traveled in the 18 minutes after the shootings, and about whom they might have contacted beforehand. While investigators believe that the couple was ''inspired'' by the Islamic State, they have not found evidence that they had contact with any extremists overseas.   A judge last month ordered Apple to develop software that would disable security mechanisms on Mr. Farook's phone so that the F.B.I. could try multiple passwords to unlock the phone through a ''brute force'' attack, without destroying any data. Once the systems were disabled, it would take only about 26 minutes to find the correct password, Mr. Comey said.   He rejected an idea expressed by several lawmakers that the F.B.I. was trying to force Apple to build a ''back door'' to decrypt its own security features. He used a different analogy to explain the government's demands.   ''There's already a door on that iPhone,'' Mr. Comey said. ''Essentially, we're saying to Apple 'take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock.' ''   But the F.B.I. did not help its case with lawmakers when Mr. Comey acknowledged the mistake of changing the iCloud password.   When the dispute over Mr. Farook's iPhone erupted two weeks ago, the Justice Department blamed technicians at San Bernardino County, which employed Mr. Farook as an environmental health specialist and which owned the phone he used. But county officials said their technicians had changed the password only ''at the F.B.I.'s request.''   Mr. Comey acknowledged at the hearing that the F.B.I. had directed the county to change the password.   Mr. Sewell, the Apple lawyer, explained to the committee that before F.B.I. officials ordered the password reset, Apple first wanted them to try to connect the phone to a ''known'' Wi-Fi connection that Mr. Farook had used. Doing so might have recovered information saved to the phone since October, when it was last connected to iCloud.   ''The very information that the F.B.I. is seeking would have been available, and we could have pulled it down from the cloud,'' he said.   The F.B.I.'s handling of the password change drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans at the hearing.   ''If the F.B.I. hadn't instructed San Bernardino County to change the password to the iCloud account, all this would have been unnecessary, and you would have had that information,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York.   Mr. Gowdy leveled a similar criticism during the more than two and a half hours of testimony from Mr. Comey.   ''With all due respect to the F.B.I., they didn't do what Apple had suggested they do in order to retrieve the data, correct?'' Mr. Gowdy asked the director. ''I mean, when they went to change the password, that kind of screwed things up, did it not?''   But Mr. Comey said that even if the F.B.I. had not mishandled the password, he did not think the bureau could have gotten everything it wanted from the phone and would still have needed Apple to help disable the security features in the phone.   ''We would still be in litigation,'' he said, ''because the experts tell me there's no way we would have gotten everything off the phone from a backup.''   Mr. Comey stressed that the fight with Apple was about trying to get as much information as possible about the San Bernardino attack -- not about gaining a powerful law enforcement tool elsewhere.   But when he was asked whether the F.B.I. would seek to unlock other encrypted phones if it prevailed in the San Bernardino case, he responded, ''Of course.''   In the audience were relatives of a Louisiana woman, Brittney Mills, who was shot to death at her doorstep last year when she was about eight months pregnant.   Mr. Comey said the data in her phone could help investigators determine whether she was shot by someone she knew, but they had been unable to break the passcode.

European Privacy Agencies Seek Details on Data Transfer Deal With U.S.,"Europe's national privacy agencies demanded more details on Wednesday about whether the European Union's new data transfer agreement with the United States would adequately protect individuals' personal information. The move by the privacy regulators, which represent individual countries within the 28-nation European Union, indicates an unwillingness to accept the word of officials in Brussels that they can adequately safeguard citizens' personal data.    The group asked the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to provide a fuller explanation of how safeguards would work and to explain how Europeans could seek legal redress in the United States if they believed their data was misused.    The primary concern is how much access American intelligence agencies will have to European citizens' personal information.   Europe's privacy regulators set a Feb. 29 deadline for receiving the new information. If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans' privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate -- and potentially fine -- companies. And because the data pact cannot take effect until all 28 European Union countries have signed off on it, the questions raised by the national data privacy officials could complicate that process.   These uncertainties, legal experts say, may threaten the new data transfer deal -- known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.   ''We want to receive the documents to assess whether the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield can answer our concerns,'' said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France's privacy chief, who is chairwoman of a pan-European body of national data protection authorities. ''We have to review the consequences of this arrangement.''   The data transfer pact, intended to replace a 15-year-old agreement that Europe's highest court struck down in October, covers the trans-Atlantic transmission of people's individual data -- including online search queries, financial information and employee records.   Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.   Ms. Falque-Pierrotin's group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the region's privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.   ''I am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans,'' Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europe's negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, she conceded, ''the current situation isn't ideal.''   The main provisions of the Privacy Shield included written guarantees by the United States that its national security agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans' data when it is transferred to the United States.   The deal also calls for the creation of a data privacy ombudsman within the State Department as the first point of contact for Europeans seeking redress for privacy complaints. These provisions would be reviewed annually to ensure that they met European privacy standards   The national data protection officials, who had a two-day meeting in Brussels before making their announcement on Wednesday, are far from united over how the region's data rules should work.   Some of them, including Ms. Falque-Pierrotin in France and her counterparts in Germany and Spain, have sent letters to companies warning them that the current trans-Atlantic data transfer system is on shaky legal ground. But others -- particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters -- have said they favored the current data transfer approach.   This divide, legal experts warn, could lead to some agencies pursuing investigations into companies' activities, on the behalf of citizens who believe their data may have been misused. Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the world's largest economies.   ''Businesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges,'' said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.   Wednesday's developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.   On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.   On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans' privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.   ''There's a big concern about this agreement,'' said Estelle Massé, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. ''Will it hold up in court?''   Complicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europe's tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.   This standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens' digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europe's data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.   These privacy agencies had set a Jan. 31 deadline for European and American negotiators to agree to a new data transfer pact. And while the negotiators failed to reach an agreement by that deadline, they continued work almost around the clock, resulting in the deal announced on Tuesday.   Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.   Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.   ''Half a trillion dollars of trade is at stake,'' she said. ''We still expect that cool heads will prevail.''     "
The Ad Blocking Wars,"Kate Murphy is journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times. YOU might have noticed that even when using a lightning-fast Internet connection, it takes a few beats, enough time to drum your fingers, for web pages to load. It's likely because of online advertising, which bogs down your browser, drains your battery and jacks up mobile charges -- not to mention collects private data. So it's little wonder that the use of ad-blocking software grew 41 percent last year, with 198 million active users worldwide, according to a study conducted by Adobe and PageFair. This represents an existential threat to the $50 billion online advertising industry and has ignited a bitter feud between advertisers and developers of ad-blocking apps. On the sidelines, privacy advocates are pumping their fists for consumer choice while web publishers wring their hands over lost revenue.    The fight became public last month when Randall Rothenberg, the president and chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, lobbed several verbal grenades at developers of ad blockers during his keynote address to his group's annual leadership meeting. He called them ''an unethical, immoral, mendacious coven of techie wannabes.'' His venom was directed particularly at for-profit ad blockers who, for a fee, will unblock advertisers who meet certain standards of nonintrusiveness. Rothenberg called the practice ''extortion.''    Ad blockers fired right back. ''We are as motivated to protect consumers as advertisers are to abuse them,'' said Roi Carthy, the chief marketing officer for Shine, an Israeli company that recently began offering ad-blocking software to wireless carriers, which are increasingly weary of the burden data-intensive ads place on their networks. Heretofore, ad blockers were mainly sold or given away to individuals. ''This is a holy war for us,'' Mr. Carthy said.   Shine is partly financed by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing who also has stakes in Facebook, Spotify and the Bitcoin payment company BitPay. Shine's first major client is the Caribbean mobile service Digicel, and Mr. Carthy claims his team is negotiating with 60 other carriers.   ''I feel like I'm caught between two parents fighting,'' said Niero Gonzalez, founder of Destructoid, a website for gamers. ''There is a valid security and privacy reason to run ad-blocking software, obviously, but then you have the brands who want their ads to pop up and autoplay and take over. This is killing the free web.''   His primary audience, tech-savvy gamers, were early adopters of ad-blocking software because they realized, more than most, the commotion going on behind the scenes the moment you direct your browser to a website. As many as 100 companies might be alerted, thus setting off a digital scrum as marketing and tracking entities elbow one another to figure out, based on your past online activity, whether you'd be more likely to click on an ad to say, lose weight, refinance your mortgage or improve your sexual potency.   The goal is to make an ''impression'' (industry lingo for when an ad appears on the page you're viewing), and publishers get paid when they allow advertisers the privilege. Advertisers get paid by brands and trackers get paid by, well, everybody. All this is automated and happens in seconds, sometimes milliseconds.   Within the last six months or so, ad blocking has left the geek realm and gone mainstream. Howard Stern raved about ad blockers on his radio show, and ad blocking was the theme of a recent episode of ''South Park.''   Moreover, when Apple made ad blockers available in its App Store last fall, they quickly became among the most downloaded apps. And later this year, Microsoft is reportedly going to allow an extension to its Edge browser that supports the most popular blocker, Adblock Plus. Read what you will into the fact that Apple and Microsoft's business models aren't overly reliant on advertising, unlike their rivals Google and Facebook.   But focusing on ad-blocking software misses the real point, said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade organization that represents digital content companies like ESPN, Bloomberg, Condé Nast, BBC and The New York Times.   ''By installing ad blockers, consumers are telling us very clearly they don't want to be tracked across the web,'' he said. ''That's going to be uncomfortable for a lot of advertising technology companies out there who have been enjoying what has been the Wild West.''   The advertising industry's solution thus far has been AdChoices, a program that allows consumers to opt out of some targeted ads. But critics dismiss it as window dressing because it's confusingly presented, cumbersome to enable and not comprehensive, and does not stop tracking.   While The New York Times is still weighing its options, other web publishers have responded to ad blockers using a variety of tactics. Some, like Forbes, have fought back with technology that blocks the ad blockers. But judging from the experience of the technology news website Ars Technica, blocking the blockers is a futile exercise.   BACK in 2010, Ars Technica tried it, and within 12 hours a coder had uploaded a workaround to Adblock Plus. Following that, the site's founder and editor in chief, Ken Fisher, wrote an article titled ''Why Ad Blocking Is Devastating to the Sites You Love.''   ''That article lowered the ad-block rate by 12 percent, and what we found was that the majority of people blocking ads on our site were doing it because other sites were irritating them,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''It's the worst players in the web publishing world that's driving this.''   But he said the number of ad blockers is creeping back up, so Ars Technica plans to start a program similar to ones that have been used on a trial basis on other sites like Wired, The Washington Post, Slate and The Atlantic. The goal is to detect people who are blocking and inform them of ways to support the site. They can selectively unblock the site, subscribe, buy temporary access or just keep reading knowing it's depriving the site of needed revenue. A possible gauge of the effectiveness of guilt is listener-supported NPR, which has a 36 percent donation rate.   ''The temptation is to block these people who honestly aren't going to respond to ads anyway,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''I think what everybody should focus on is the educational aspect and give people the option to pay for an ad-free experience.''   Google recently began offering that option with its Contributor program. And Sprint's Boost Mobile is testing a program where it actually pays users to look at ads.   But it may be instructive to look at what happened back in the 1990s when spam was the scourge of consumers. The fix came only when entities like Spamhaus started compiling lists of bad actors, based in part on what consumers marked as spam. Email providers then subscribed to those lists so they could block offenders.   Craig Spiezle, executive director of the Online Trust Alliance, a consumer advocacy group, said something similar could happen with online advertising, where stakeholders agree to observe best practices, including respecting Do Not Track, or D.N.T., which is a preference consumers can activate in their browsers. Right now, D.N.T. is largely ignored by advertisers and websites. Obscuring ads and autoplay audio and video would also likely be prohibited.   ''Those who don't follow the rules will be blacklisted like spammers,'' said Mr. Spiezle, who formerly oversaw security of Microsoft's Hotmail.   The Federal Trade Commission has yet to intervene on this issue. And it's unlikely that Congress will act given how heavily politicians rely on tracking and other online advertising technology to court voters.   The Online Trust Alliance conducted an audit of the presidential candidates, and the vast majority received failing grades in terms of tracking and protecting the privacy of the people who visited their websites.   ''Ad blocking is a symptom of a pervasive problem,'' Mr. Spiezle said. ''If consumers enjoyed the web experience and felt there were adequate controls for privacy and the ad industry was making a sincere effort to fight abuse and malfeasance, we wouldn't be having this conversation.''

Protecting Your Digital Life in 7 Easy Steps,"There are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information. Major hacks seem ever more frequent. Investigators believe that a set of top-secret National Security Agency hacking tools were offered to online bidders this summer.    And many of those worried about expanded government surveillance by the N.S.A. and other agencies have taken steps to secure their communications.   In a recent Medium post, Quincy Larson, the founder of Free Code Camp, an open-source community for learning to code, detailed the reasons it might be useful for people to make their personal data more difficult for attackers to access.   ''When I use the term 'attacker' I mean anyone trying to access your data whom you haven't given express permission to,'' he wrote. ''Whether it's a hacker, a corporation, or even a government.''    In an interview, Mr. Larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended. We added a few of our own, based on additional interviews.   We encourage you to write back with feedback on this article. If the instructions are too vague, the apps aren't working for you or you have additional questions, we want to hear about it. Send an email to smarterliving@nytimes.com   Now, let's encrypt.   1. Download Signal, or Start Using WhatsApp to send text messages.   Encryption is a fancy computer-person word for scrambling your data until no one can understand what it says without a key. But encrypting is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around.   Mr. Larson said that by some estimates, with the default encryption scheme that Apple uses, ''you'd have to have a supercomputer crunching day and night for years to be able to unlock a single computer.''   He said that the best way to destroy data was not to delete it, because it could potentially be resurrected from a hard drive, but to encode it in ''a secure form of cryptography.''   Signal is one of the most popular apps for those who want to protect their text messaging. It is free and extremely easy to use. And unlike Apple's iMessage, which is also encrypted, the code it uses to operate is open-source.   ''You can be sure by looking at the code that they're not doing anything weird with your data,'' Mr. Larson said.   ''In general, the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible,'' said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems, the organization that developed Signal.   That means that the app allows you to use emojis, send pictures and enter group texts.   One bit of friction: You do have to persuade your friends to join the service too, if you want to text them. The app makes that easy to do.   WhatsApp, the popular chat tool, uses Signal's software to encrypt its messaging. And in Facebook Messenger and Google's texting app Allo, you can turn on an option that encrypts your messages.   Here's how to do that on Facebook. Here's how to do it on Allo.   Mr. Marlinspike said that the presidential election had sparked a lot of interested in Signal, leading to a ''substantial increase in users.''   When asked to speculate why that was, Mr. Marlinspike simply said, ''Donald Trump is about to be in control of the most powerful, invasive and least accountable surveillance apparatus in the world.''   To download Signal, click here for iOS, or here for Android.   2. Protect your computer's hard drive with FileVault or BitLocker.   Your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket, but Mr. Larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information.   Even if your data were password protected, someone who gained access to your computer ''would have access to all your files if they were unencrypted.''   Luckily, both Apple and Windows offer means of automatic encryption that simply need to be turned on.   Here's the link to do that for Apple computers. Here's the one for Windows computers.   3. The way you handle your passwords is probably wrong and bad.   You know this by now. Changing your passwords frequently is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion.   But making up new combinations all the time is a hassle.   Mr. Larson recommends password managers, which help store many passwords, with one master password. He said that he uses LastPass, but knows plenty of people who use 1Password and KeePass, and that he doesn't have a strong reason to recommend one over another.   Not every security expert trusts password managers. Some noted that LastPass itself got hacked last year.   So that means you may want to write them down in one secure location, perhaps a Post-it note at home. It seems more far-fetched that a hacker would bother to break into your home for a Post-it note than find a way into your computer.   If you take that route, we suggest setting a weekly or biweekly calendar reminder to change your passwords.   As far as making passwords up goes: Don't be precious about it. Use a random word (an object near you while you're hunched over your Post-it) and a combination of numbers. If you're writing passwords down, you don't have to worry about making them memorable.   4. Protect your email and other accounts with two-factor authentication.   When you turn this step on, anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security: a code to access the inbox that is sent to your phone via text message. (Though sadly, not through Signal.)   Here's the link for turning on two-factor authentication for Gmail accounts.   Here's the one for Yahoo accounts, and here's one you can use for Outlook accounts.   You can also set two-factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites. But email is the most important account, since many sites use email for password recovery, a fact that has been exploited by hackers. Once they have access to your email, they can get access to banking, social media, data backups and work accounts.   5. Use a browser plug-in called HTTPS Everywhere.   Mr. Marlinspike recommended this plug-in, developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital security organization. It ensures that you are accessing the secure form of websites, meaning that your connection to the site will be encrypted, and that you will be protected from various forms of surveillance and hacking.   Download HTTPS Everywhere for Chrome here. For Firefox here.   Here's a list of FAQ's about the plug-in, including whether it is available for other browsers.   And this is a good time to note that you should always be aware whether the Wi-Fi network you're using is secure. Public networks -- and even private networks without security keys -- often are not.   6. Remember that incognito mode isn't always private.   You may be in such a hurry to use this feature, available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox, among other browsers, that you do not heed its clear warning.   On Chrome, the second paragraph of the ''incognito'' home screen is clear.   ''You aren't invisible,'' it says. ''Going incognito doesn't hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.''   Mr. Larson recommended Tor in his article, a browser that allows for private web activity. But we're not going to recommend that here, mostly because Tor is relatively slow and clunky at the moment.   ''I'll be honest, I don't use it very often,'' Mr. Larson said.   He said that he suspected other browsers would start adding ways to browse more securely.   ''Apple is very security conscious,'' he said. ''I wouldn't be surprised if they started to incorporate Tor-like features into Safari.''   7. Do sensitive searches in DuckDuckGo.   Mr. Larson said that if people were paranoid about Google, he would strongly encourage them to use DuckDuckGo, an alternative search engine.   He said however, that he personally, was not paranoid.   ''Google is built on the hacker ethic and they have put principle above profits in some aspects,'' he said.   But he also acknowledged that he meets ''people all the time who are extremely skeptical of any large software organization and I think that's reasonable.'' There are trade-offs. Google's search results are more useful and accurate than competitors' precisely because of the ways it collects and analyzes information about its customers' searches.   A Bonus: Cover your webcam with tape.   That way, if someone has found a way to compromise your computer, they cannot spy on you through its camera.   And yes, this happens.   Happy encryption.     "
Protecting the Privacy of Internet Users,"The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission proposed common-sense privacy rules this week that would limit what broadband companies are allowed to do with the Internet browsing history and other personal information of consumers.  Companies like Comcast and AT&T, which operate wired and wireless networks, know a lot about what Americans do online, like the websites they visit and how long they stay on them. But there are no F.C.C. rules that bar those companies from selling that information to advertisers. The commission can, however, take action against the companies for deceptive and unfair practices.    Under the proposal by the chairman, Tom Wheeler, cable and phone companies would be allowed to use personal data for things like billing and pitching more expensive versions of services that customers are already using. Customers could opt out of marketing for other services provided by their broadband companies. And the companies would have to get permission from their customers before they could do more with the data, like selling it to advertisers. Another rule would require companies to protect the data and notify customers, the commission and law enforcement agencies if the information was stolen.   These are similar to the protections the commission has long imposed on phone companies. Those rules have worked so well that most Americans do not worry that Verizon or T-Mobile is listening to their conversations or using call records to market products and services. People should have similar privacy protections when they use cable or phone lines to get on the Internet.   Companies like AT&T, however, argue that new rules are not needed because a lot of Internet traffic is encrypted and phone and cable companies cannot decipher the data. But even when data is encrypted, companies can still tell what websites people are visiting. And many websites still do not use encryption.   Another criticism is that these rules treat broadband providers differently than Internet businesses like Google and Facebook, which collect huge amounts of personal data about users. But the commission has no authority to regulate those websites. And it is far easier for consumers to avoid those sites than to avoid their Internet service providers, especially since in many parts of the country people have only one or two choices for broadband.   Mr. Wheeler is able to make this proposal because the commission wisely decided in February 2015 to treat broadband as a telecommunications service rather than as a lightly regulated information service. That decision also made it possible for the commission to forbid cable and phone companies to create fast and slow lanes on the Internet.   The commission will vote on March 31 to open Mr. Wheeler's proposal to public comments before it can be finalized, probably before the end of the year. Cable and phone companies and their Republican supporters in Congress will undoubtedly oppose this regulation. But these rules are necessary because consumers need to have control over their personal information.

Weighing the System Upgrade Decision,"Q. With all the complaints about Windows 10 and OS X El Capitan out there, I'm wondering if it is worth it to just skip big operating system upgrades. Is it?  A. Every computer user should evaluate his or her situation in regard to upgrades, but there are some general pros and cons to consider.    From a security standpoint, skipping an upgrade could make your computer more vulnerable when the older operating system is not updated with protections against the latest viruses, malicious software and human intruders lurking on the internet. Third-party antivirus and anti-malware tools can shield your computer to some degree, but inherent vulnerabilities in older software may leave parts of your system open to attacks.   Depending on how many versions behind the current system you choose to stay, you may find some applications on your PC or Mac no longer receiving periodic updates from developers because the developers themselves have moved on to newer versions. Hardware manufacturers may also stop creating driver software that allows their peripherals to work on operating systems they deem too old.   While newer features, better security and improved performance can come with a successful upgrade, upgrading to the latest version of Windows or OS X can be also a titanic aggravating hassle -- and can lead to weeks of fussing with the computer to get it working as it once did. On the flip side of the compatibility conundrum, your older programs and devices may not function properly on the newer system unless their makers update their own software. You may have older programs that will never work on the newer system, which can be problematic if you depend on those applications in your daily computing life.   In addition to breaking your stuff, an operating system update can also move things around on you, based on the new user interface and the way it organizes your files. The new system might even run like a turtle if you have an older computer.   The learning curve becomes easier as you become more familiar with the new system. If you do not have any hardware or software incompatibilities in the mix, biting the bullet and upgrading should pay off with better overall security and a longer life cycle of program updates.   If you want to make an informed decision, make a list of all the hardware and software you rely upon and check with those companies about compatibility with the new operating systems. Microsoft and Apple have technical support pages with some useful information, but crowd-sourced databases like the Roaring Apps site let you look for the answers to a lot of compatibility questions at once. No matter what you decide, back up your computer regularly and keep its security software up-to-date.   Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.     "
Hackers Get Employee Records at Justice and Homeland Security Departments,"WASHINGTON --  In the latest cyberattack targeting the federal government, an intruder gained access to information for thousands of employees at the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, but officials said Monday that there was no indication that sensitive information had been stolen.  Most of the information appeared to have been culled from internal government directories, including employees' email addresses, phone numbers and job titles.    Motherboard, a technology news site, reported on Sunday that it had been approached by a hacker who claimed to have obtained employee information on about 20,000 people at the F.B.I. and 9,000 at the Department of Homeland Security.   The hacker professed support for pro-Palestinian groups and vowed to make the information public in an apparent attempt to embarrass federal agencies that play a part in cybersecurity operations. The hacker released the information on Sunday and Monday.   Officials at the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security said they were examining the breach.   ''There is no indication at this time that there is any breach of personally identifiable information,'' said Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department. Marsha Catron, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, echoed that statement.   It was unclear when the breach had occurred or whether it was connected to an intrusion last fall that exposed personal emails of Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director. The hackers who claimed to have carried out those attacks also expressed pro-Palestinian views.   The new breach does not appear to have resulted from an attack using an outside computer to penetrate the system. Instead, officials said, they believe that the intruder impersonated a government employee and used that information to get into other parts of the system.   The officials would not elaborate on how that had been done, but described it as a social engineering breach, which could involve pulling personal information from social media and using it to determine passwords.   Agencies across the federal government have struggled to keep computer information secure from both outside hackers and their own employees.   A much bigger intrusion that targeted the Office of Personnel Management exposed security clearance dossiers and sensitive information for nearly 22 million Americans. Chinese hackers were thought to have been behind the attack, which was much more sweeping than officials initially acknowledged publicly last year.

"In This Standoff, Tech Firms Have a Long-Term Advantage","Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes­.com; Twitter:@fmanjoo The battle between Apple and law enforcement officials over unlocking a terrorist's smartphone is the culmination of a slow turning of the tables between the technology industry and the United States government. After revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor.    But if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.   It may not seem that way at the moment. On the one side, you have the United States government's mighty legal and security apparatus fighting for data of the most sympathetic sort: the secrets buried in a dead mass murderer's phone. The action stems from a federal court order issued on Tuesday requiring Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the two attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.    In the other corner is the world's most valuable company, whose chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said he will appeal the court's order. Apple argues that it is fighting to preserve a principle that most of us who are addicted to our smartphones can defend: Weaken a single iPhone so that its contents can be viewed by the American government and you risk weakening all iPhones for any government intruder, anywhere.   There will probably be months of legal tussling, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor.   Yet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public's collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.   Any crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what's to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Chinese or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the Phone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?   Apple's stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people's data. More than that, Apple -- and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft -- have made their opposition to the government's claims a point of corporate pride.   Apple's emerging global brand is privacy; it has staked its corporate reputation, not to mention invested its considerable technical and financial resources, on limiting the sort of mass surveillance that was uncovered by Mr. Snowden. So now, for many cases involving governmental intrusions into data, once-lonely privacy advocates find themselves fighting alongside the most powerful company in the world.   ''A comparison point is in the 1990s battles over encryption,'' said Kurt Opsahl, general counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy watchdog group. ''Then you had a few companies involved, but not one of the largest companies in the world coming out with a lengthy and impassioned post, like we saw yesterday from Tim Cook. The profile has really been raised.''   Apple and other tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple's public opposition to the government's request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple's help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on privacy, the F.B.I. may have been able to break into the device by itself.   You can expect that noose to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government's reach.   That's not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.   Once armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack -- leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.   ''This is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,'' Mr. Opsahl said. ''We've had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that -- here they come with an order to create that backdoor.''   Yet it's worth noting that even if Apple ultimately loses this case, it has plenty of technical means to close a backdoor over time. ''If they're anywhere near worth their salt as engineers, I bet they're rethinking their threat model as we speak,'' said Jonathan Zdziarski, a digital forensic expert who studies the iPhone and its vulnerabilities.   One relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone -- a user would have to consent to it.   ''Nothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,'' Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge's order in this case required Apple to provide ''reasonable security assistance'' to unlock Mr. Farook's phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers' ''reasonable assistance'' will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force.   In other words, even if the F.B.I. wins this case, in the long run, it loses.     "
A Nuclear Job Half Done,"As he ended the Nuclear Security Summit on Friday, President Obama could claim some success in leading the international community to curb the amount of nuclear materials that could fall into terrorists' hands.  But even with considerable progress, Mr. Obama has not fulfilled his goal of securing all nuclear materials in four years; some 1,800 metric tons of nuclear material remain stored in 24 countries, much of it vulnerable to theft.    The summit meeting, which drew more than 50 world leaders to Washington, produced many practical commitments to secure and eliminate nuclear materials. Mr. Obama announced that a long-stalled treaty requiring countries to comply with standards for securing nuclear facilities and nuclear material while in storage, use or transit would take effect in 30 days.   Japan and the United States said they had completed the transfer of all highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium from a research project in Tokai Mura, Japan, to a facility in South Carolina where the materials will be converted to forms less suitable for use in weapons. South Korea promised to strengthen nuclear detection at its ports, Kazakhstan said it would strengthen its export control laws and Britain pledged to lead a new cyber security initiative in response to growing concerns that a cyberattack could be made on nuclear plants.   Despite serious tensions with Washington on many other issues, China's president, Xi Jinping, promised to convert some of China's nuclear reactors, as well as reactors supplied to Ghana and Nigeria, to low-enriched uranium, which is less suitable for weapons use. The United States also announced plans to look into using low-enriched uranium rather than highly enriched uranium in its naval reactors.   President Vladimir Putin's refusal to attend the summit meeting, however, was a reminder of how troubled ties with Russia are stymieing Mr. Obama's ambitious pledge in 2009 to seek a world without nuclear weapons. The two countries still deploy more than 1,800 strategic warheads each.   In 2013, Mr. Obama said America's arsenal could be reduced by one-third. Even so, he has supported a $1 trillion plan to replace the nuclear arsenal, including bombers, missiles and submarines. Russia is also modernizing its arsenal, while Pakistan, India and China are expanding theirs. Meanwhile, North Korea, despite tough sanctions, is adding to its cache of nuclear weapons and the missiles needed to launch them.   The nuclear security summit meetings have been a useful means of focusing attention on nuclear dangers and persuading countries to be more security conscious. It will be up to the next American president to continue this effort and work to prevent another nuclear arms race.

U.S. Struggles to Hire to Fight Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- At a time of increasing threats of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, the Department of Homeland Security is having trouble recruiting much-needed computer experts because it cannot match the pay of the private sector and does not have the same allure as intelligence agencies. Recent disclosures that Iranian hackers with ties to the government in Tehran had launched a cyberattack against a dam in New York highlighted the need for the department, which is charged with protecting government and private systems from cyberintrusions, to have a staff capable of responding to sophisticated enemies.     ''We are competing in a tough marketplace against a private sector that is in a position to offer a lot more money,'' Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, told senators at a hearing last month. ''We need more cybertalent without a doubt in D.H.S., in the federal government, and we are not where we should be right now, that is without a doubt.''   Concern about the potential for cyberattacks on infrastructure was heightened after a Dec. 23 hack of the Ukrainian power grid that caused a blackout for 225,000 customers. The department, which helped Ukrainian officials investigate the case, confirmed that it was a cyberattack.   But officials said the attack in 2013 on the small dam in New York, which lies less than 20 miles north of New York City and is used mostly for flood control, was alarming, because it underscored that foreign hackers were targeting the nation's infrastructure. Seven men said to be working for two Iran-based computer security companies on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of the Iranian military, were charged in the attack.   Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who is prosecuting the case, called the attack a ''frightening new frontier for cybercrime'' during a news conference last month announcing the indictment.   The cyberattack on the dam, with its antiquated computer system, has raised the specter of similar attacks on power grids, pipelines and the air traffic control system, since many of these systems are also run on outdated hardware and software.   According to federal data, nearly 300 attacks were reported on critical infrastructure last year, up from just under 200 in 2012. The data shows attempted attacks on a wide variety of targets, including in the health care and manufacturing fields.   The reports say the nature of the attacks shows a level of sophistication beyond the ability of most casual hackers. Over all, nearly 600,000 cybersecurity incidents involving government and private computer systems were reported to the department in 2014, the most recent year for which data was available.   To counter these intrusions, the Obama administration and Congress approved the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, which among other things emphasized recruitment of a cybersecurity work force for the government.   But the Department of Homeland Security, even with 691 people staffing its cybersecurity division, has not been able to recruit a work force to match the threat.   The Office of Personnel Management, with the approval of Congress, has given the department the authority to hire up to 1,000 workers by June 30.   ''It's up to D.H.S. to use that new authority to achieve its mission,'' said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.   In addition to pressure from the private sector, department officials say they also find themselves competing against government agencies like the National Security Agency and the Department of Defense for top talent.   ''The deck is stacked against us a little bit,'' said Phyllis Schneck, deputy under secretary for cybersecurity and communications at the Department of Homeland Security. ''So what we are pitching to people is to explore a hybrid: Do a private sector career and then come and do some time in government. It can be a positive experience in both areas.''   Candy Alexander, a board member at the Information Systems Security Association, a trade group of cybersecurity professionals, said many cybersecurity professionals avoided working for the government, particularly the Department of Homeland Security, because it was not seen as cutting edge.   ''For a lot of people who do this work, it is about who gets the coolest toys first,'' she said. ''And D.H.S. doesn't come across as a place where that is going to happen.''   Robert Lee, the chief executive and a founder of Dragos Security, a cybersecurity company that focuses on critical infrastructure, sees a more basic problem.   ''People are looking for meaningful work and flexibility, and nothing about government screams flexibility,'' Mr. Lee said.   ''Countering our adversaries and keeping them from disrupting our critical infrastructure can be just as exciting,'' he said. ''But the D.H.S. is seen as a large bureaucracy, and nothing about it screams change and innovation.''   Ms. Schneck, who was formerly chief technology officer of McAfee, now known as Intel Security, said that the department is trying to change the perception it is not innovative, and that it is making an aggressive push to hire talent by, among other things, changing the long hiring process.   ''I work with some of the smartest people I have ever worked with, and the work is important and fulfilling,'' she said.

Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea,"With private cybersecurity firms linking North Korea to recent computer attacks that absconded with at least $81 million, the Treasury Department moved on Wednesday to choke off Pyongyang's remaining access to the global financial system, designating the country a ''primary'' money launderer. The Treasury, employing sanctions techniques that helped pressure Iran to give up much of its nuclear program, said it would seek to impose what are known as secondary sanctions against the reclusive communist country. That means that it could cut off from the American financial system any bank or company that conducts banking transactions with Pyongyang.     As a practical matter, that would largely affect Chinese banks, which facilitate North Korea's financial transactions with Beijing, its largest trading partner. It could also affect some institutions in the nominally autonomous Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, as well as in Singapore, where Pyongyang has often gone to hide the true nature of its banking activities, and to pay for missiles, nuclear fuel and the huge infrastructure it has built around those programs.   The designation, officials said, was in the works long before evidence emerged linking the country's aggressive hackers to the bank thefts, which involved stealing the credentials that banks use to access the Swift system, a global network that thousands of financial firms use to authorize payments from one account to another.   In interviews, administration officials said they were still sorting through the evidence that North Korea was involved, and left open the possibility that the thieves deliberately left evidence implicating the country to throw investigators off their trail. It could be months, the officials said, before they reach any conclusions, and in the end the perpetrators of the attack may not be definitively known.   Only once -- in the case of North Korea's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which was promoting a movie depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-un, the country's unpredictable young leader -- has President Obama publicly accused another country of using computer code to wreak havoc in the United States.   In this case, the sanctions were proposed most immediately because of a Treasury investigation that concluded North Korea uses hard currency to finance its nuclear and missile programs. The department invoked a section of the Patriot Act to ban banks from processing any banking transaction that runs through North Korea.   It is hard to assess how much the action will hurt North Korea. Such sanctions against financial institutions doing business with Iran proved effective because Tehran had billions of dollars in monthly oil and other energy exports that could be choked off; North Korea has none. Oftentimes Pyongyang deals in cash. Until a few years ago it was one of the largest counterfeiters of $100 bills. But that once-lucrative fraud was largely cut off by the redesign of the $100 bill.   The key test will be the reaction of the Chinese. American officials will have a chance to find out next week: Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew are traveling to Beijing for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, where the isolation of North Korea will be a major subject of discussion. China voted for the latest United Nations sanctions, but Beijing's fears of provoking a collapse of North Korea's government still outweigh its desire to rein in Mr. Kim's government.   Underlying the financial action was the United States' desire to respond to North Korea's third nuclear weapons test, conducted in January, which the country said was its first test of a hydrogen bomb. (There is no evidence that it was, in fact, a hydrogen weapon, which increases the magnitude of the blast.) More recently Pyongyang has attempted, and failed, to launch a Musudan intermediate-range missile. It is based on an early Soviet model, which was launched from a submarine, but the repeated failures have embarrassed Mr. Kim and undermined his effort to convince the world that his nuclear missile program is steaming ahead quickly.   The bigger mystery is whether Mr. Kim is also trying to show that he can undermine the global financial system, his best way of getting back at the West and his Asian neighbors for their support of sanctions. Two cybersecurity firms identified Pyongyang as the culprit behind a series of cyberattacks against Asian banks, including the theft that spirited $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   Private security researchers analyzing those thefts say that unique digital fingerprints in the attackers' code match those of the code used in cyberattacks against Sony in 2014 and South Korean banks and broadcasting companies in 2013. The Sony hack destroyed 70 percent of the firm's computers.   South Korea has blamed North Korea for the attacks on its firms. Elements of the code in those attacks closely track some of the code found in the more recent bank thefts.   Banks in the United States are already prohibited from doing business with financial institutions in North Korea. But the recommended rules would require them to perform additional due diligence to ensure they are not inadvertently transacting with North Korean financial institutions or the Pyongyang government through shell companies or other fictitious entities.   The rules are the result of a monthslong effort by the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to determine whether North Korea is a haven for money laundering.   With that designation established, the Treasury secretary is able to take aggressive measures to cut off the country's access to the United States financial system.   Other countries have also been stepping up efforts to isolate North Korea. In March, the United Nations Security Council said its members had 90 days to sever banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions.   The recent attacks on Asian banks exposed new vulnerabilities in the way banks move money around the world.   North Korea's possible involvement in those cyberattacks has raised alarms about Pyongyang's ability to exploit Swift, the global bank messaging network. But the attack did not go to the core of the Swift system; instead, it was analogous to stealing a credit card number to post a phony transaction in the Visa or MasterCard system.     "
"Software Security Company Blue Coat to Sell to Symantec, Abandoning I.P.O.","SAN FRANCISCO -- Blue Coat Systems seemed poised to begin life as a public company, after selling itself to a private equity firm last year. Now, the cybersecurity software company plans to sell itself to Symantec instead.    Blue Coat said late on Sunday that it would sell itself to Symantec for $4.65 billion. As part of the deal, Blue Coat's chief executive, Greg Clark, will take over as the chief executive of the combined security software maker.   To help finance the transaction, Blue Coat's existing majority investor, Bain Capital, will invest an additional $750 million in the deal. The private equity firm Silver Lake, which invested $500 million in Symantec in February, will invest an additional $500 million.    The deal will create a big provider of security products, both the traditional antivirus kind that has long been Symantec's focus and the newer online protection services in which Blue Coat has specialized. Executives see little overlap between the two businesses.   ''With this transaction, we will have the scale, portfolio and resources necessary to usher in a new era of innovation designed to help protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals,'' Dan Schulman, Symantec's chairman, said in a statement.   In selling itself to Symantec, Blue Coat will abandon its effort to go public, after having filed plans to do so earlier this month. Many companies weighing an initial public offering also run a private sales process, choosing to sell themselves if they receive an attractive enough offer. While Blue Coat did not formally put itself up for sale, it received interest from a number of potential buyers, and held talks primarily with Symantec.   ''Once combined, we will offer customers around the world -- from large enterprises and governments to individual consumers -- unrivaled threat protection and unmatched cloud security,'' Mr. Clark said in a statement.   Blue Coat has had a number of private equity owners in recent years, including both Bain Capital and, before that, Thoma Bravo.   In its I.P.O. prospectus, Blue Coat said that it lost $289 million on top of $598 million in sales for the 12 months that ended on April 30. That compares with a $271 million loss on top of nearly $569 million in sales for the same period a year before.   But the company has sought to grow itself under Bain Capital, having made a number of acquisitions to bolster its capabilities.   ''This represented a compelling opportunity for us because we could realize some gains for our investors but also reinvest into the combined company,'' said David Humphrey, a managing director at Bain Capital. ''We believe very much in the industrial logic and strategic rationale of this transaction.''   Symantec, meanwhile, has sought to turn around its fortunes after years of declining sales. Earlier this year, it sold its Veritas data storage unit to the Carlyle Group for $7.4 billion after failing to fully integrate that business into its core offerings.   The acquisition of Blue Coat is in some ways a move out of the playbook of Silver Lake. The investment firm previously took a stake in the publicly traded chip maker Avago -- and then supported that company through a string of acquisitions, culminating in a $37 billion takeover of Broadcom last year.   Roughly two months after Silver Lake came on board as an investor in Symantec, the software maker's chief executive at the time, Michael Brown, stepped down amid disappointing financial performances.   Symantec then hired Ajei Gopal, a Silver Lake operating partner, as interim president and chief operating officer, as it embarked on a series of cost cuts. The company had also begun to look for a new chief executive, and Mr. Clark of Blue Coat emerged as a candidate.   Silver Lake's investment in Symantec back in February anticipated a transaction like the Blue Coat deal, with the firm setting itself up to provide additional financing if Symantec were to pursue a deal that needed private equity help. And Silver Lake believes that other, smaller acquisitions may be in the offing for the security software provider in the future.   ''Silver Lake has had a history of trying to invest in and catalyze leaders in important categories in technology,'' Ken Hao, the Silver Lake managing partner who sits on Symantec's board, said in an interview. ''Symantec will become the most valuable, profitable and deepest, widest leader in cybersecurity.''   Symantec received financial advice from JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. It took legal counsel from Fenwick & West and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.   Blue Coat received financial advice from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and legal counsel from Ropes & Gray and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Cyberattack: The Story So Far,"''Hello, friend.'' That's how Elliot Alderson, a troubled programming genius, welcomed viewers last summer to the convoluted world of ''Mr. Robot.'' With the show returning July 13, here's a brief refresher:     Elliot, an engineer at a cybersecurity firm called Allsafe and a ''vigilante hacker,'' was recruited by a man known as Mr. Robot into fsociety, an anarchist group partly inspired by entities like the Occupy movement and Anonymous. The cabal's goals included wiping out all debt and taking down E Corp, an Allsafe client that is the world's largest corporation.   Elliot referred to the conglomerate as ''Evil Corp,'' and soon other characters did as well. That's one clue that much of what viewers saw reflected Elliot's unreliable perspective, which stemmed from mental and emotional ailments including depression, social anxiety, morphine addiction and, most crucially, dissociative identity disorder.   Mr. Robot was revealed to be a delusion based on Elliot's dead father. His fsociety comrade Darlene was actually Elliot's sister. ''I am Mr. Robot,'' Elliot said near the end of the season, realizing that he, in fact, was the mastermind of the culminating ''5/9 hack.''   The attack disrupted the world's economies, but we do not yet know how it happened. In the season finale, Elliot woke up in an S.U.V. days after the hack to find the world in chaos and his nemesis and possible collaborator Tyrell Wellick, a cruelly ambitious former E Corp executive, missing. In a scene after the credits, Phillip Price, the E Corp chief executive, revealed that he knew who was responsible for the cyberattack.   ''The 5/9 hack was an explosion, and now we're seeing the bits and pieces going every which way,'' said Sam Esmail, the show's creator. ''Hopefully, we'll see them come back together.''     "
The Putin-Trump Admiration Society,"One curious aspect of the 2016 presidential campaign has been Donald Trump's startling affinity for Vladimir Putin, the increasingly authoritarian president of Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have spoken admiringly of each other; exhibited similar strongman tendencies; and seemed to share certain views, notably a disdain for NATO. But would Mr. Putin really interfere in the American presidential race to help Mr. Trump, the Republican Party nominee, get elected over the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton? As odd as that may sound, it is being considered a serious possibility after the release on Friday of nearly 20,000 emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders. The emails, made public by WikiLeaks, forced the swift resignation of the D.N.C.'s chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And the Democrats expect more leaks.     It may take time to prove who was behind the cyberattacks, but American intelligence agencies have reportedly told the White House they have ''high confidence'' it was Russia. Several cybersecurity firms that examined the metadata said it looked like the work of two Russian intelligence agencies that last year conducted cyberoperations on the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The F.B.I. is investigating.   There is nothing new about intelligence services for the United States and Russia hacking each other's computer systems or trying to covertly influence other countries' domestic politics. In recent years, Mr. Putin has invaded Ukraine, stoking political tensions there and in the Baltic States, and financed right-wing politicians across Europe; during the Cold War, the United States secretly tried to influence elections in Indonesia, Italy, Chile and Poland. What seems new here is the idea that a government would publicly disclose information it got from hacking into the computers of an American political party in order to influence an election.   The Democrats are eager to exploit a Trump-Putin connection. The notion that a foreign power, especially a newly aggressive Russia, might be trying to sway the election is antithetical to democratic principles and America's interests. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who became the Democratic nominee on Tuesday, tried to create a better working relationship with Russia, on issues like arms control and Iran, but the effort ultimately failed. Mr. Putin could also be retaliating against Mrs. Clinton for real or imagined perfidies; he accused her of meddling in Russia's 2011 parliamentary election.   Mr. Trump has dismissed the idea of a Russian intervention on his behalf as a joke. But his past words about Mr. Putin have caused some to suspect that Moscow would seek to give Mr. Trump an edge in the election. At a time when Russia is under sanctions for its Ukraine invasion and isolated from groups like the Group of 7, Mr. Trump has made no secret of his admiration for Mr. Putin. He has even said Mr. Putin is ''a lot stronger than our leader.''   Mr. Trump's lack of commitment to the defense of NATO allies and his retreat from the world would unquestionably serve Mr. Putin's dream of unraveling the Western alliance and re-establishing Russia as a superpower. Although as a developer Mr. Trump never got the real estate foothold in Russia that he craved, he has spent 30 years courting Russian politicians. His campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has extensive financial and political dealings with business executives in Russia and Ukraine, and served as a political strategist for Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed pro-Russia president of Ukraine.   If it is proved that Mr. Putin instigated the D.N.C. hack, it could backfire. But regardless of whether Mr. Putin is out to help Mr. Trump, voters would be right to question the judgment of a candidate who has shown so much admiration for such a dangerous adversary.

Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C.,"WASHINGTON -- American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have ''high confidence'' that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, according to federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence. But intelligence officials have cautioned that they are uncertain whether the electronic break-in at the committee's computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage -- of the kind the United States also conducts around the world -- or as part of an effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.    The emails were released by WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the presidency. It is unclear how the documents made their way to the group. But a large sampling was published before the WikiLeaks release by several news organizations and someone who called himself ''Guccifer 2.0,'' who investigators now believe was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service.    The assessment by the intelligence community of Russian involvement in the D.N.C. hacking, which largely echoes the findings of private cybersecurity firms that have examined the electronic fingerprints left by the intruders, leaves President Obama and his national security aides with a difficult diplomatic and political decision: whether to publicly accuse the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of engineering the hacking.   Such a public accusation could result in a further deterioration of the already icy relationship between Washington and Moscow, at a moment when the administration is trying to reach an accord with Mr. Putin on a cease-fire in Syria and on other issues. It could also doom any effort to reach some kind of agreement about acceptable behavior in cyberspace, of the kind the United States has been discussing with China.   In an interview with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News on Tuesday, President Obama stopped short of accusing the Russian agencies from seeking to manipulate the election but said, ''Anything's possible.''   He noted that ''on a regular basis, they try to influence elections in Europe.''   Stealing information about another country's political infighting is hardly new, and the United States has conducted covert collection from allies like Germany and adversaries like Russia for decades. Publishing the documents -- what some have called ''weaponizing'' them -- is a different issue. Mrs. Clinton's campaign has suggested that Mr. Putin was trying to even the score after the former secretary of state denounced a 2011 Russian election as filled with fraud.   ''The first thing that the secretary of state did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers,'' Mr. Putin said at the time. ''She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,'' Mr. Putin continued. ''They heard the signal and, with the support of the U.S. State Department, began active work.''   Campaign officials have also suggested that Mr. Putin could be trying to tilt the election to Donald J. Trump. But they acknowledge that they have no evidence.   Asked on Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia whether ''there's more to the Trump/Russian relationship that hasn't come out,'' John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, said, ''Well, he certainly has a bromance with Mr. Putin, so I don't know.''   Mr. Podesta said that while Russia had a ''history'' of interfering in democratic elections in Europe, it would be ''unprecedented in the United States.''   The Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, calls on the United States to ''respond in kind and in greater magnitude'' to cyberattacks. ''Russia and China see cyber operations as part of a warfare strategy during peacetime,'' it says. ''Our response should be to cause diplomatic, financial and legal pain.''   But the Trump campaign has dismissed the accusations about Russia as a deliberate distraction, meant to draw attention away from the content of nearly 20,000 emails and documents from the Democratic committee that WikiLeaks started releasing on Friday. They showed efforts to impugn Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his effort to challenge Mrs. Clinton for the nomination.   On Twitter Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that in order to deflect ''the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster,'' Democrats were saying: ''Russia is dealing with Trump. Crazy!''   ''For the record,'' he said, ''I have ZERO investments in Russia.''   Mr. Obama, in his interview with NBC News, criticized Mr. Trump for suggesting last week that the United States should not defend from Russian aggression any country that does not contribute sufficient funds to NATO. He said Mr. Trump was ''undermining'' the country's post-World War II alliances in Europe.   Secretary of State John Kerry raised the cyberattack with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Tuesday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Vientiane, Laos. Mr. Lavrov dismissed the idea that Russia was involved, telling reporters who asked about the charges: ''I don't want to use four-letter words.''   Mr. Kerry made no accusations, saying he had to allow the F.B.I. to ''do its work'' before he drew ''any conclusions in terms of what happened or who's behind it.''   The federal investigation, involving the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, has been going on since the Democratic National Committee first called in a private cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, in April.   Preliminary conclusions were discussed on Thursday at a weekly cyberintelligence meeting for senior officials. The Crowdstrike report, supported by several other firms that have examined the same bits of code and telltale ''metadata'' left on documents that were released before WikiLeaks' publication of the larger trove, concludes that the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., entered the committee's networks last summer.   The G.R.U., a competing, military intelligence unit, was a later arrival. Investigators believe it is the G.R.U. that has played a bigger role in releasing the emails.   In an essay published on Lawfare, a blog that often deals with cyberissues, Susan Hennessey, previously a lawyer for the National Security Agency, called the published evidence about Russian involvement ''about as close to a smoking gun as can be expected when a sophisticated nation-state is involved.''   Mr. Assange's threat to release documents, she wrote, ''means, put simply, that actors outside the U.S. are using criminal means to influence the outcome of a US election. That's a problem.''   But American intelligence agencies have their doubts that the Russian intention, at least initially, was to sway the American election. The intrusion began just shortly after Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. At the time, his chances looked minuscule. One senior official noted that while the cyberattack might have been intended to embarrass Mrs. Clinton, who was the presumptive nominee, it could not have been aimed at bolstering Mr. Trump.   It is far from clear that Mr. Obama or the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, would ever name Russia as the origin of the hack. Mr. Obama has only once accused a country of attacking an American organization, when he said North Korea was the source of the 2014 attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the United States has no relationship with North Korea, and there was little to lose from identifying it.   In the case of Russia and China -- countries with which the United States has complex relationships -- Mr. Obama has in the past made the opposite decision. He never named the Russian intelligence agencies as the perpetrators of hacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   While the administration has called out the People's Liberation Army of China for stealing intellectual property, -- even indicting officers of its now-inactive Unit 61398 -- it never publicly accused the Chinese intelligence services of stealing the security-clearance files on more than 21 million Americans who held or applied for clearances.   By happenstance, the intelligence report on the Democratic National Committee hacking was circulating here the day that Mr. Obama issued a new policy, long in development, to organize the government's response to major cyberattacks and to set up a six-point ''grading system'' to assess the severity of strikes against American companies, government agencies and organizations.   The action against the Democratic committee, they said, would qualify as a ''significant cyber incident,'' which was defined as one that causes ''demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties or public health and safety of the American people.''   Ranking the hacking in the pantheon of other penetrated networks is difficult. The top ranking under Mr. Obama's system would be reserved for an attack that disabled American power grids, for example, akin to the suspected Russian attack on Ukraine's electrical system in December. The attack on the Office of Personnel Management and Sony, which destroyed 70 percent of the studio's computers, would also rank above the ''category 3'' level, which defines a ''significant'' attack.   But the ranking system does not mandate what kind of response the president would authorize. And it was designed before many in Washington imagined the use of cyberattacks to release information in the midst of a dizzying, and volatile, presidential campaign.     "
Cybersecurity Experts Aren't Sure if Email Hacker Is a Person or a Front,"WASHINGTON -- Who is Guccifer 2.0, the self-proclaimed Romanian ''lone hacker'' responsible for copying thousands of emails and other files from the Democratic National Committee -- a real person, or a front created by Russian intelligence officials? Technology specialists have been debating that question since June 15, when CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee, announced that sophisticated hacker groups with Russian links were responsible for breaching the committee's computer servers. Within hours of the announcement, someone using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 started a blog to mock that finding, posting several of the stolen documents and claiming sole credit.    But the publication by WikiLeaks of an archive of the committee's internal emails -- and the uproar they caused on the eve of the Democratic National Convention -- have focused wider attention on who, or what, is operating behind that name. While WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2.0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks.    Cybersecurity specialists have pointed to an array of forensic and technical evidence suggesting that Guccifer 2.0 might not be a Romanian as claimed. That evidence included metadata hidden in the early documents indicating that they were edited on a computer with Russian language settings. American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation.   In blog posts, Twitter messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2.0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong.   Against that backdrop, Guccifer 2.0's words are taking on heightened interest. They may be clues to a person's decision to intervene in the American election, or they may be a case study of a 21st-century Russian information campaign -- the work of different intelligence officials, crowded around a keyboard.   ''Just because the Wizard of Oz says he's a wizard doesn't actually mean he is,'' said Peter Singer, a security strategist at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute.   The original ''Guccifer'' (pronounced GUCCI-fer) is a real person: Marcel Lazar Lehel, a Romanian hacker who used the pseudonym Guccifer to hack various accounts belonging to American celebrities and government officials, including members of the Bush family, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, and Sidney Blumenthal, an informal adviser to Hillary Clinton.   Mr. Lehel was arrested in Romania in 2014 for hacking the email accounts of several Romanian officials. In April, he was extradited to the United States to face hacking charges and pleaded guilty in May before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. While awaiting sentencing, Mr. Lehel claimed to have hacked Mrs. Clinton's private email server, but federal officials have found no evidence to support his claim.   Mr. Lehel is known for his fixation on what conspiracy theorists call the Illuminati, a shadowy group that they believe controls the world. The first Guccifer 2.0 blog post, and messages Guccifer 2.0 sent along with packages of files that same day to the websites Gawker and The Smoking Gun, also denounced the Illuminati.   Other oddities also arose. Technical specialists, scouring metadata on documents posted to Guccifer 2.0's blog, found some that were last marked by a person with a user name in Cyrillic that appeared to be a nod to Felix E. Dzerzhinsky, best known for establishing the early Soviet secret police forces.   On June 21, Motherboard, an online technology magazine, posted a Twitter chat log of an interview with Guccifer 2.0, in which the person using that account claimed to be Romanian and denied working with the Russian government. Pressed on why Russian language markings showed up in the metadata of the documents he had sent out, Guccifer 2.0 claimed that was just a ''watermark.''   ''I don't like Russians and their foreign policy. I hate being attributed to Russia,'' Guccifer 2.0 wrote.   During the interview, Motherboard switched from using English to Romanian and to Russian. Guccifer 2.0 claimed not to speak Russian and abruptly cut off the interview.   Motherboard later reported findings of linguistics specialists who said that his Romanian answers did not seem like those of a native speaker, and that the syntax of several of his English lines echoed Russian sentence constructions.   And a linguistic analysis provided to The New York Times by Shlomo Argamon, a chief scientist at Taia's Global, a cybersecurity firm that has questioned cyberattack attribution claims in the past, also concluded that Guccifer 2 is Russian.   Mr. Argamon, who is a professor of computer science and the director of the master of data science program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, found seven oddities in the hacker's English text, five of which pointed clearly to Russian as the speaker's native tongue.   ''The linguistic evidence consistently points towards the writer being either a native Russian speaker,'' Mr. Argamon said. ''It is possible that the writer is a Romanian speaker who has studied Russian. However, the writer denied knowing any Russian, and so the most reasonable conclusion is that he is a Russian native speaker rather than a Romanian native speaker.''   On June 30, Guccifer 2.0 posted additional documents from the Democratic National Commitee's servers on the WordPress blog. The post again denied Russian links, and spoke admiringly of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks; Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence analyst who leaked archives of surveillance documents; and Chelsea Manning, the Army private who sent a huge trove of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks in 2010.   That post accused Mrs. Clinton of being ''bought and sold,'' in contrast to Mr. Trump, who it said ''has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says.''   But the post still expressed opposition to Mr. Trump's ideas ''about closing borders and deportation policy.'' Of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the post said, ''He never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!''   The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, reported on July 13 that Guccifer 2.0 had reached out to it and had provided documents about Democratic campaign donors and lobbyists.   It quoted Guccifer 2.0 as saying in an electronic chat, ''The press [is] gradually forget[ing] about me, [W]ikileaks is playing for time and [I] have some more docs.'' The next day, Guccifer 2.0 posted those documents on the blog. That was the last blog posting.   The Guccifer 2.0 Twitter account posted a few more messages. The most recent one, on July 22, expressed excitement that WikiLeaks had posted the archive of nearly 20,000 Democratic committee emails that ''I'd given them!!!''   Since then, that account has fallen silent, too. No messages were posted even as the Democratic Party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned and Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager accused the Russian government of providing the leaked emails to WikiLeaks to help Mr. Trump.

U.S. Seeking Ways to Keep Hackers Out of Ballot Box,"WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is weighing new steps to bolster the security of the United States' voting process against cyberthreats, including whether to designate the electronic ballot-casting system for November's elections as ''critical infrastructure,'' Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, said on Wednesday. In the wake of hacks that infiltrated Democratic campaign computer systems, Mr. Johnson said he was conducting high-level discussions about ''election cybersecurity,'' a vastly complex effort given that there are 9,000 jurisdictions in the United States that have a hand in carrying out the balloting, many of them with different ways of collecting, tallying and reporting votes.     ''We should carefully consider whether our election system, our election process is critical infrastructure, like the financial sector, like the power grid,'' Mr. Johnson told reporters in Washington. ''There's a vital national interest in our electoral process.''   A national commission created as part of a voting overhaul enacted in 2002 in response to the controversy surrounding the 2000 presidential election ''raised the bar'' on security, Mr. Johnson said. ''But there is more to do,'' he added. ''The nature of cyberthreats has evolved.''   Mr. Johnson said he was considering communicating with state and local election officials across the country to inform them about ''best practices'' to guard against cyberintrusions, and that longer-term investments would probably have to be made to secure the voting process.   ''There are various different points in the process that we have to be concerned about, so this is something that we are very focused on right at the moment,'' Mr. Johnson said.   His comments were the latest evidence that recent cyberintrusions have caused alarm in the administration about the potential for hacking to disrupt the election, and how to respond.   The administration on Wednesday played down the dangers, saying voters should not worry about cyberattacks wreaking havoc with the election.   ''There are risks out there,'' said Josh Earnest, the press secretary. ''But I think the American people can have quite a bit of confidence in our ability to mitigate those risks.''   Mr. Earnest said the administration was committed to offering support to state and local governments so they could protect the integrity of the voting process, but that given the varied practices and software used in different jurisdictions, there could be no single method for doing so.   ''That varied infrastructure and those different systems also pose a difficult challenge to potential hackers,'' Mr. Earnest added. ''It's difficult to identify a common vulnerability.''   The F.B.I. is investigating the hack of the Democratic National Committee, and Mr. Johnson said officials had yet to attribute it to a particular actor or actors. But private investigators have identified the suspects, and United States intelligence agencies have told the White House that they have ''high confidence'' that the Russian government was responsible.   Without commenting specifically on that breach, Mr. Johnson said it was vital for employers to emphasize to their employees the importance of not falling prey to ''spear phishing,'' in which a hacker, posing as a trusted source, sends a fake email in an attempt to compromise the security of a computer network.   ''The most devastating, intrusive attacks by the most sophisticated actors often originate with a simple act of spear phishing,'' Mr. Johnson said.   Even some of his own employees have been caught by such gimmicks, Mr. Johnson added. He said the Department of Homeland Security had run exercises in which employees receive an email offering free tickets to Washington Redskins football games if they click a link.   ''They're told to report at a certain time and place to pick up their free Redskins tickets,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They get a cybersecurity lecture instead.''

"Hacker Releases More Democratic Party Files, Renewing Fears of Russian Meddling","WASHINGTON -- A hacker believed to be tied to the Russian intelligence services made public another set of internal Democratic Party documents on Friday, including the personal cellphone numbers and email addresses of nearly 200 lawmakers. The files appeared to be less politically embarrassing and damaging than the hacker's initial trove, which came from the Democratic National Committee. Those documents, released by WikiLeaks last month on the eve of the party's convention, led to the resignation of the committee's leader, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz.    But the emergence of another set of leaked documents threatened to intensify international tensions over Russia's suspected meddling in United States politics.    The hacker claiming responsibility for the breach -- working under the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0, which American intelligence officials believe is an alias for a Russian intelligence hacker -- appeared eager to taunt Democrats in releasing the latest files. Those documents came from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm for House Democrats.   ''It's time for new revelations now,'' the hacker wrote in posting the files. ''All of you may have heard about the DCCC hack. As you see I wasn't wasting my time! It was even easier than in the case of the DNC breach.''   On Friday night, the hacker indicated that more leaks would follow, writing on Twitter that ''the major trove'' of the House committee documents would be sent to WikiLeaks. ''Keep following,'' the hacker wrote.   While it became known last month that the House committee had been hacked along with the D.N.C., this was the first time its files had become public.   In a statement, the House committee said it was investigating the authenticity of the documents and was working with federal law enforcement officials. The F.B.I. is leading the investigation.   American intelligence officials said they are virtually certain that Russian intelligence officials were behind the attack. They said that the breach appears to have extended beyond the two Democratic groups to include the personal email accounts of at least 100 Democratic officials.   Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House subcommittee on the National Security Agency and cybersecurity, said he was not overly concerned that his personal information was released.   ''If it's simply my email being sent around, half my constituents have my email,'' he said. ''If it were to turn out that someone was hacking into emails, it would be a different situation. Worse comes to worst I can get a different email or cell number.''   Mr. Himes dismissed the idea that the leak could affect his, or anyone else's, election campaign this year.   ''It's hard for me to imagine how just having a bunch of numbers, cellphones and emails would in any way affect the election,'' he said. ''It wasn't totally unexpected.''   He added that the cybersecurity subcommittee was likely to discuss the hack in more detail, saying the release of personal information made the threat ''feel that much more real'' to members.   ''If there were the ability for someone to hack into those accounts, that really gets worrisome,'' he said. ''Someone could cause a lot of damage if they were able to send emails out from a member's account, but I'm not hearing that that's a risk at this point.''   The D.N.C. documents that were released last month proved intensely embarrassing for committee officials because they contained emails indicating that party leaders favored Hillary Clinton as their nominee over her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.   The committee's interim leader, Donna Brazile, created a special cybersecurity panel this week to guard against future attacks.   Much of the latest batch of documents from the House fund-raising committee, including overviews of particular races and campaigns, appeared largely innocuous in comparison to the D.N.C. breach. Beyond the cellphone numbers and email addresses for Democratic lawmakers, the latest release also included passwords for some internal databases.   Mrs. Clinton's campaign files do not appear to have been directly breached in the cyberattack, but the personal accounts of some campaign officials might have been, and a voting analytics program used by the campaign was opened as part of the D.N.C. breach, officials say.   The American authorities remain uncertain whether the electronic break-in to the Democrats' computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage or as part of an effort to manipulate the presidential election.   The Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, urged the Russians last month to try to find 33,000 ''missing'' emails from Mrs. Clinton's personal server. But after his remark produced an intense backlash, Mr. Trump said later that he was being sarcastic.

A Hacker Releases Democratic Documents,"A hacker who American intelligence officials believe has ties to the Russian government made public on Tuesday a second batch of documents suspected of having been stolen from the Democratic National Committee's computer system, leaving the organization rushing to contain damage or embarrassment less than two months before the presidential election.  The internal documents, which party officials were verifying for authenticity, were distributed at a cybersecurity conference in London.    The release was apparently the work of Guccifer 2.0, a self-identified Romanian hacker who claimed responsibility for publishing a trove of the committee's documents before the Democratic convention in July.   Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, blamed Russian espionage for the hack and said that foreign agents were trying to help Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, be elected.   ''The D.N.C. is the victim of a crime: an illegal cyberattack by Russian state-sponsored agents who seek to harm the Democratic Party and progressive groups in an effort to influence the presidential election,'' Ms. Brazile said in a statement. ''There's one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that's Donald Trump.''   The first batch of documents showed that party officials had favored Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary campaign, and their disclosure appeared to have been timed to sow discord before a unifying moment.   Ms. Brazile said that the committee had expected more documents to be released and that its legal team was working to determine whether they were real or forged.   The documents released Tuesday were not immediately as damaging as the first trove, and they proved difficult to access. WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy platform, posted multiple messages on Twitter explaining how to download the documents after users struggled to do so. Initial reports suggested that they were old records related to the committee's donor outreach program.   Their release is likely to put more focus on Russia's efforts to meddle in the presidential election. American intelligence agencies and private investigators concluded in July that the hack was the work of the Russian government.   President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia denied involvement in the security breach in an interview with Bloomberg News this month, but he did describe it as a public service.   Mr. Trump has dismissed suggestions of Russian involvement, but he drew scorn this summer when he invited Russian hackers to track down missing emails from the private server Mrs. Clinton used as secretary of state.   While Mr. Trump laughed off his remark, the Democratic National Committee said Tuesday that the hacking was not a coincidence.   ''Not only has Trump embraced Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign,'' Ms. Brazile said, calling Mr. Trump's statements ''dangerous, divisive and unprecedented.''

Trump's Jabs on Weight Fuel a Shaming Dialogue,"It was a casual remark tossed off by Donald J. Trump that jolted Johanna Kandel from her seat during the recent presidential debate. An anonymous computer hacker, Mr. Trump said, ''could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.''    ''The hair on the back of my neck definitely stood up,'' said Ms. Kandel, 37, of West Palm Beach, Fla., who has struggled with eating disorders and now works to raise awareness about the issue. Ms. Kandel recalled how vicious comments about size and appearance contributed to her own struggle.    ''How many of our youth were sitting there and watching these debates, and thinking that this is O.K. to talk about and shame people based on their appearance?''   Ever since the Monday debate, another national debate has erupted: What happens when fat-shaming becomes part of the presidential campaign?   How did a question about cyber security lead to #FatShaming? Pretty sure not all hackers have high BMI. #debatenight -- Elana Margolis (@elanahm) September 27, 2016   Did Trump just suggest #cyber war fare is waged by overweight people? #Bodyshaming? REALLY? -- Libbey (@libbey) September 27, 2016   Mr. Trump's personal fixation on weight was on display during and after the debate. He reignited a feud with the comedian Rosie O'Donnell, whom he once said had ''a fat, ugly face.'' He was unapologetic in responding to Hillary Clinton's comments that he had called a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, ''Miss Piggy.''   ''She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,'' he told Fox News the next morning, although he denied calling her the name.   But it's the blithe comment about a hypothetical 400-pound hacker that helped trigger a national conversation about fat-shaming.   More than two-thirds of American adults (including Mr. Trump himself) are considered to be overweight or obese.   ''It would make logical sense that if the majority of Americans are fat, that this would definitely do him in,'' said Kimberly Massengill, a self-described fat person who specializes in photographing people who are fat. But she doesn't think that will happen because fat people often think poorly of themselves. ''The fact is that the majority of fat people feel unworthy.''   After Mr. Trump's comment about the 400-pound hacker, Ms. Massengill said her cellphone buzzed with text messages from friends.   ''They all said the same thing,'' said Ms. Massengill. ''Wouldn't it be great if fat people were the ones to keep Trump out of office?''   But obesity experts and activists say fat-shaming is one of the last bastions of acceptable discrimination, and Mr. Trump's public body shaming simply reflects a culture in which it is still considered acceptable to mock people for their weight.   ''With two-thirds of people struggling with weight, you would think that some of the shaming would be on the decline, or that acceptance or tolerance would increase,'' said Rebecca Puhl, a professor and the deputy director for the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut. ''We are not seeing that.''   Dr. Puhl points to the paucity of laws protecting people from hiring discrimination based on their weight -- so far Michigan, she said, is the only state to forbid it. Studies show that overweight people, women in particular, are discriminated against in the workplace for their size. And research shows that even medical professionals provide worse care to people who are overweight.   The concern is that cavalier comments about weight by a public figure can have far-reaching effects. Being teased about weight is a strong contributor to both disordered eating and weight gain among young people, said Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, the head of the division of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health.   ''In some ways it legitimizes making those types of comments, which we know from our research can be very dangerous,'' she said. ''In my opinion, these things trickle down.''   Kristina Saffran, 24, who was hospitalized with anorexia nervosa in high school, said body-shaming comments from a public figure, even when they aren't directed at an individual, still can be deeply painful to people who struggle with eating disorders.   ''They live in a society where everyone is thinking they are bad and stupid and lazy for being fat, and we have a presidential candidate who is championing those beliefs,'' said Ms. Saffran, who lives in San Mateo, Calif. ''It is going to be even harder for them to seek help.''   Though Mr. Trump's comments may reflect a widely held view that being overweight or obese is a personal failing, some people fear that fat-shaming comments by a presidential candidate will encourage others to go further.   ''Saying these negative things about people's weight and women's appearance will further embolden people to express similar ideas,'' said Lesley Kinzel, a Boston-based author of a memoir about being fat.   Until the debate, Ms. Kinzel said she had not focused on much of what Mr. Trump has said. But during the debate, it became personal. She said she realized overweight people like her were now ''just one in a line of people he wants to dismiss as losers.''     "
"Yahoo Traffic Rose After Hacking, Cutting Verizon's Chances for Better Deal","SAN FRANCISCO -- If Verizon Communications really wants to renegotiate its $4.8 billion deal to buy Yahoo's internet operations, it's probably going to have a fight on its hands. Yahoo said on Tuesday that it had actually gained a slight amount of traffic since its Sept. 22 disclosure that about 500 million accounts had been hacked. That appears to contradict Verizon's assertion last week that the damage to Yahoo's business from the breach could have been severe enough to set off a provision in the sale agreement that would allow Verizon to reopen the deal.    ''We take deep responsibility in protecting our users and the security of their information,'' Yahoo's chief executive, Marissa Mayer, said in a statement reporting the company's third-quarter financial results. ''We're working hard to retain their trust and are heartened by their continued loyalty as seen in our user engagement trends.''    Yahoo's overall business in the quarter exceeded Wall Street's expectations, and the stock rose more than 1 percent in after-hours trading. The company's third-quarter revenue fell 15 percent compared with the previous year, after adjusting for an accounting change. But its profits rose as management cut capital spending and eliminated 300 jobs over the last three months.   Citing the pending Verizon deal, Yahoo did not hold its customary conference call with investors to discuss the results. That left many questions unanswered -- particularly, what Yahoo has learned from its investigation into the data breach.   In its initial disclosure in September, Yahoo said that hackers sponsored by a foreign government had broken into its systems in late 2014 and stolen user information including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, encrypted passwords and, in some cases, security questions. Earlier this month, news reports described a separate 2015 incident in which Yahoo obeyed a secret court order from the United States government to scan all user email for specific material linked to a suspected terrorist group.   Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the Gartner research firm, said it was entirely credible that Yahoo's traffic rose after news of the breach.   ''It raises consumer awareness of the brand,'' she said. ''People remember they have accounts there.''   In 2007, sales at TJX, the parent company of the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls retail chains, rose after the company disclosed that millions of customer credit card numbers had been stolen, Ms. Litan noted. ''I've watched breaches for years, and they don't have an impact,'' she said.   ComScore, which tracks traffic across many websites, said its data showed a slight drop in the number of American visitors to Yahoo's desktop and mobile sites in September compared with August. But Andrew Lipsman, vice president of marketing and insights at the data firm, said that the drop was well within the normal fluctuation of Yahoo's traffic.   Yahoo said its business remained on track as it works to close the Verizon deal. But the performance of its internet operations matters much less to investors than getting the deal done.   Most of the value of Yahoo's shares is from its vast holdings of stock in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and in Yahoo Japan. Before it can monetize those investments, it needs to separate out its internet operations.   Douglas Melsheimer, who heads the North American mergers and acquisitions practice at Bulger Partners, a tech advisory firm based in Boston, said that regardless of the impact on traffic, Verizon was likely to push for a lower price for Yahoo because of the specter of legal liability for the data breach.   ''Verizon has leverage in this situation, and they can use that to drive down the price,'' he said. ''And I think ultimately the price does come down.''     "
"Citing Security, China Will Add Internet Limits","HONG KONG -- In August, business groups around the world petitioned China to rethink a proposed cybersecurity law that they said would hurt foreign companies and further separate the country from the internet. On Monday, China passed that law -- a sign that when it comes to the internet, China will go its own way.    The new rules, which were approved by the country's rubber-stamp Parliament and will go into effect next summer, are part of a broader effort to better define how the internet is managed inside China's borders.    Officials say the rules will help stop cyberattacks and help prevent acts of terrorism, while critics say they will further erode internet freedom. Business groups worry that parts of the law -- such as required security checks on companies in industries like finance and communications, and mandatory in-country data storage -- will make foreign operations more expensive or lock them out altogether. Individual users will have to register their real names to use messaging services in China.   Restrictions on the flow of data across borders ''provide no security benefits but will create barriers to Chinese as well as foreign companies operating in industries where data needs to be shared internationally,'' James Zimmerman, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, wrote in an emailed statement.   He added that by creating such restrictions, China risked isolating itself technologically from the rest of the world.   But in many ways, the regulations are not likely to have a major impact on much about how business is done. Most of the rules are already in effect, but not codified. Other parts are vague enough that the government will determine their meaning on the fly.   The law, however, is an important statement from Beijing on how the internet should be run: with tighter controls over companies and better tracking of individual citizens.   Calling it a ''basic law,'' Chen Jihong, a partner at the Zhong Lun law firm in Beijing, said the rules were set up to deal with the growing number of legal issues regarding the Chinese internet and to seek to strike a balance between privacy and security.   ''The law only stipulates principles; it would take follow-up laws or interpretations to specify the standards,'' he said.   Human Rights Watch said on Monday that it was concerned about several aspects of the law, including that it calls for real-name registration for users of Chinese instant messaging services.   ''The already heavily censored internet in China needs more freedom, not less,'' the group's China director, Sophie Richardson, wrote in a statement. ''Despite widespread international concern from corporations and rights advocates for more than a year, Chinese authorities pressed ahead with this restrictive law without making meaningful changes.''   The final law did soften a few elements. In particular, a second draft of the law said foreign businesses did not need to keep all of their data inside China -- just important business data collected within China or about Chinese consumers.   For years the government has been working to ensure that people's real names are linked to their online activities. Beijing has also long restricted many types of online content, from pornography to political discussion.   Foreign companies have at times dealt with the controls detailed in the new law. For example, during the past two years, American tech companies have had products subjected to government security reviews that target encryption and data storage. Beijing also distributed a pledge to American companies last year asking them to vow to respect Chinese national security and to store data within the country.   The law is also part of a broader set of policy steps to streamline regulation of the internet. Analysts say the regulations seem to indicate that the Cyberspace Administration of China, a relatively new regulatory body created during President Xi Jinping's tenure, ultimately is in charge of setting the agenda.   Last year China passed a national security law that called for technology that supports crucial sectors of the economy and government to be ''secure and controllable.'' Industry groups say that language means companies can be forced to allow third-party access to their networks, provide encryption keys or hand over source code.   After the state news media announced the law's passage, comments on Chinese news and social media sites were largely censored.   On one news app run by the internet company Tencent, some users applauded the law as a way for China to crack down on internet fraudsters and the less savory parts of the web. Others wondered what the cost of that security would be.   ''I hope this won't be a law that does more to limit freedom of speech,'' wrote one user under the screen name Leisa Wenzhou.     "
Kremlin Updates Its Plan to Counter Cyber Threats,"MOSCOW -- The Kremlin published a new plan on Tuesday to defend Russia against what it described as stepped-up cyberattacks and ''information-psychological'' methods by foreign intelligence agencies bent on influencing its population with online information.  The plan updates a similar information security doctrine put in place by President Vladimir V. Putin in 2000, early in his first term, that staked out a renewed role for post-Soviet government in monitoring information.    The latest iteration of the doctrine comes as American officials have mulled retaliating against Russia for what the Department of Homeland Security said was government-orchestrated hacking before the presidential election, including stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee.   The plan, signed by Mr. Putin on Monday but published on Tuesday, described a threat to Russia of technological malfeasance similar to what the United States has accused the Russians of committing. It did not mention, however, any specific online strikes against Russia indicating that American retaliation could be underway.   Russia, the document says, is at risk of attacks on systems of ''information support for democratic institutions'' and the spread of harmful, false information.   It notes the ''increasing scale of certain countries and organizations using information technologies for military and political goals.''   The 16-page document sketches out what the Kremlin sees as the main threats to its security and national interest from foreign information making its way into the country, and sets priorities for countering them. It identifies terrorist recruiting and financial crime as dangers.   Under Mr. Putin, the Kremlin has staked out a role as a defender of conservative values, notably pushing back against gay rights, and the new doctrine is no exception, with a clause raising concern about risks to ''traditional Russian spiritual and moral values'' of Russian young people.   It also notes the risk to Russia of ''a tendency toward an increase of materials containing biased assessments of the state policies of the Russian Federation in foreign media.''   The doctrine supports a plan, in the works for some time, to gain control over the Russian segment of the web by basing more servers inside the country. The plan envisions operating the Russian internet autonomously, if needed in time of war, by switching it off from the rest of the world.   And it directs Russian diplomats to pursue the Kremlin's policy goals on information security at international organizations like the United Nations.   Russia has advocated, without much success so far, replacing the nonprofit group that now controls top-level domains with a global agency, the International Telecommunication Union.   The document calls attention to ''information-psychological actions'' from abroad undermining Russian ''patriotic traditions of defending the Fatherland.''   Russia has already passed laws aimed at regulating internet content and forcing foreign companies to base data servers in Russia. Last month, a Moscow court ordered internet service providers to block LinkedIn, the professional social networking site, for failing to comply.   Under a separate law governing news aggregators, sites with daily traffic exceeding 1 million users would bear responsibility as publishers, including a requirement to verify the truthfulness of the articles reposted on their websites. The law would apply to Google, among other aggregators.   A spokesman for the regulator, Roskomnadzor, on Tuesday denied a report in the Izvestiya newspaper saying Russian officials had already instructed Google to comply.     "
For Sale on the Dark Web: Yahoo Users' Stolen Records,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Some time around August 2013, hackers penetrated the email system of Yahoo, one of the world's largest and oldest providers of free email services. The attackers quietly scooped up the records of more than 1 billion users, including names, birth dates, phone numbers and passwords that were encrypted with an easily broken form of security. The intruders also obtained the security questions and backup email addresses used to reset lost passwords -- valuable information for someone trying to break into other accounts owned by the same user, and particularly useful to a hacker seeking to break into government computers around the world: Several million of the backup addresses belonged to military and civilian government employees from dozens of nations, including more than 150,000 Americans.    No one knows what happened to the data during the next three years. But last August, a geographically dispersed hacking collective based in Eastern Europe quietly began offering the whole database for sale, according to Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, an Arizona cybersecurity firm, who monitors the dark corners of the internet inhabited by criminals, spies and spammers. Three buyers -- two known spammers and an entity that appeared more interested in espionage -- paid about $300,000 each for a complete copy of the database, he said.    The attack, which Yahoo disclosed on Wednesday, is the largest known data breach of a company. And neither Yahoo nor the public had any idea it had occurred until a month ago, when law enforcement authorities came to the company with samples of the hacked data from an undisclosed source.   Yahoo still does not know who broke into its systems in 2013, how they got in or what they did with the data, the company said Wednesday. It has made more progress tracking down a separate hacking episode in 2014, which compromised 500 million email accounts and was disclosed in September. The company has said it believes the 2014 attack was sponsored by a government entity but has not identified it.   The two huge breaches revealed this fall threaten to erode consumer confidence in the company and are endangering its deal to sell its internet businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. On Thursday, Yahoo's stock plunged 6 percent as investors worried that Verizon would abandon  the purchase.   Mr. Komarov said in an interview on Thursday that his company obtained a copy of the database and over the last few months alerted military and law enforcement authorities in the United States, Australia, Canada, Britain and the European Union about the breach. After those parties verified the authenticity of the stolen records, he said, some of them went to Yahoo with their concerns.   InfoArmor did not go to Yahoo directly, Mr. Komarov said, because the internet giant was dismissive of the security firm when approached by an intermediary. He also said he did not trust Yahoo to thoroughly investigate the breach since it could threaten the sale to Verizon.   Mr. Komarov worked in counterterrorism before joining Group-IB, a Moscow security firm. In 2013, he and a colleague left to form IntelCrawler, which drew attention for its work tracking the Syrian Electronic Army and the young hacker behind a large breach of the retailer Target's systems. IntelCrawler was acquired by InfoArmor in 2015.   Yahoo said Thursday that it could not verify Mr. Komarov's claims, which were made public in a Bloomberg article on Wednesday.   ''The limited InfoArmor data set provided to us by Bloomberg, based on initial analysis, could be associated with the data file provided to us by law enforcement,'' the company said in a statement. ''That said, if InfoArmor has a report or more information, Yahoo would want to assess that before further comment.''   The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was investigating the Yahoo breach. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York also said his office was in touch with Yahoo to examine the circumstances of the data breach.   Verizon has said that it is weighing its options, which range from demanding a price cut to walking away altogether. Yahoo may still prove attractive, given the sheer size of its user base. But a huge defection of users would drastically lessen its value to Verizon.   The question will be whether the telecom giant can be shielded from potential legal liability. Verizon already has an army of lawyers from heavyweight firms like Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advising it on the deal.   If Verizon tried to walk away, the company could still find itself ensnared in a long legal battle. Efforts by companies to wiggle out of deals -- usually by exercising escape hatches in transaction contracts -- have often failed.   Security experts and former government officials warned that the real danger of the Yahoo attack was not that hackers gained access to Yahoo users' email accounts, but that they obtained the credentials to hunt down more lucrative information about their targets wherever it resided across the web.   ''This wasn't an attack against Yahoo, but rather reconnaissance to launch other campaigns,'' said Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency who now runs Area 1, a Silicon Valley security start-up.   ''Inactive or not, a billion user accounts and hashes means attackers have a golden key for new phishing attacks,'' he said. In a phishing attack, a hacker often poses as a trusted contact and tries to induce the recipient of an email to click on a malicious link or share sensitive information.   Users routinely ignore advice to use different passwords for their different accounts across the web, which means a stolen Yahoo user name and password could open the door to more sensitive information in online-banking, corporate or government email accounts.   Mr. Komarov said the group that hacked Yahoo in 2013, which he calls Group E, appeared to be motivated by money, not politics.   It is believed to have broken into the systems of major American internet companies like LinkedIn, Myspace, Dropbox and Tumblr, as well as foreign-owned services like VKontakte, a Russian social network similar to Facebook.   Group E sometimes sells complete copies of the data, Mr. Komarov said. It also combines information from different hacking forays into a master database. Like a corporate marketer, it peddles chunks of the data to spammers seeking to reach specific audiences, like middle-aged women who live in certain ZIP codes. It sometimes operates through intermediaries.   Hold Security, another firm that monitors the so-called dark web, said that as recently as the end of October, hackers were actively trying to sell the stolen Yahoo data for as much as $200,000.   At the time, the sellers told Hold Security employees that they had been given access to a live Yahoo database through what they claimed was an intermediary at ''Department K,'' a part of the Russian Interior Ministry that combats high-tech crimes. But when Hold Security employees pressed the sellers for samples of the live data, they were instead given screenshots of a stale Yahoo database from 2013, said Alex Holden, the chief executive of Hold Security.   That database of 1 billion Yahoo accounts, Mr. Komarov said, is still for sale, although current bids are coming in at $20,000 to $50,000 since the data is much less valuable now that Yahoo has changed the passwords.   ''There is now huge interest in Yahoo's database,'' he said. ''We know that there will be some new deals.''     "
Bipartisan Letter Seeks Single Inquiry Into Russian Hacking Claims,"â-  Four senators, including Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham, called for a select committee to investigate Russian hacking of the American election process. â-  Robert Gates said the Russian hacking was designed to hurt Hillary Clinton.    â-  John Podesta said the F.B.I. had contacted him only once about the hacking of his emails.    â-  President-elect Donald J. Trump has defied many conventions. But he will keep one: staying at Blair House.   Bipartisan group of Senators says Russian hack should 'alarm every American.'   A bipartisan group of senators on Sunday urged Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and majority leader, to create a new, select committee on cyberattacks to investigate possible Russian interference in the American election.   ''Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American,'' the senators wrote in a letter released on Sunday. ''Cybersecurity is the ultimate cross-jurisdictional challenge, and we must take a comprehensive approach to meet this challenge effectively.''   They recommended that the select committee undertake a ''comprehensive investigation of Russian interference'' and develop ''comprehensive recommendations and, as necessary, new legislation to modernize our nation's laws, governmental organization, and related practices to meet this challenge.''   Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the armed services committee, signed the letter, along with fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and minority leader; and Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who also serves on Mr. McCain's committee. They had previously warned that any congressional investigation into the hacks ''cannot become a partisan issue.''   Their call is at odds with Mr. McConnell, who has said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is ''more than capable of conducting a complete review'' of the interference without the creation of a select committee. As majority leader, Mr. McConnell has the power to decide whether to form a new committee.   The view is also starkly at odds with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has repeatedly rejected the conclusions of American intelligence reports, saying they are politically motivated.   Gates says Russian hack was a covert operation to discredit the U.S. election.   Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of defense under President Obama and President George W. Bush, said on Sunday that Russian cyberattacks were aimed at discrediting the American electoral process and ''certainly at weakening'' Hillary Clinton.   ''Whether it or not it was intended to help one candidate or another, I don't know,'' said Mr. Gates, who also served as C.I.A. director under President Bush. ''But I think it clearly was aimed at discrediting our elections, and I think it was aimed certainly at weakening Mrs. Clinton.   Speaking on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' he stopped short of saying the meddling was intended to help Mr. Trump, and said the best course of action to respond to the cyberattacks was unclear.   Asked why Mr. Trump appeared not to be taking the allegations against Russia seriously, Mr. Gates speculated that the president-elect ''felt the way this information came out through newspaper stories and so on was somehow intended to delegitimize his victory in the election and that he's reacting to that rather than 'the facts on the ground,' as it were.''   Mr. Trump has chosen to receive intelligence briefs only occasionally.   Podesta said the F.B.I. contacted him only once.   Few people were as directly affected by the hacking as John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton's campaign. But on Sunday he suggested that there was hardly a zealous effort by the F.B.I. to investigate, adding that the only time he had been contacted by federal agents was two days after his hacked personal emails began appearing on WikiLeaks.   Mr. Podesta said he had believed that some of the documents related to the Democratic National Committee published by WikiLeaks last summer could have come from his account. But he only became certain that his account had been fully compromised when WikiLeaks began publishing its contents on Oct. 7.   ''Two days later, the F.B.I. contacted me, and the first thing the agent said to me was, 'I don't know if you're aware, but your email account might have been hacked,''' Mr. Podesta said.   ''I said, 'Yes, I was aware of that,''' he added.   Trump will stand by custom and stay at Blair House.   Mr. Trump will spend his last nights before his inauguration at Blair House after all, keeping alive a tradition that started with President Jimmy Carter four decades ago, a top aide said on Saturday.   Mr. Trump had been considering a stay at his newly opened Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House.   But his transition communications director, Jason Miller, said in a Twitter post reacting to a New York Times article late Saturday night that Mr. Trump would follow conventional practice.   Not accurate. The President-elect is staying at Blair House. https://t.co/LhhyozXSBB -- Jason Miller (@JasonMillerinDC) December 18, 2016   Known as ''the president's guesthouse,'' Blair House is across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House and normally plays host to visiting heads of state and other dignitaries. Every few years, though, it becomes the pre-inaugural headquarters for the incoming president and first family during the festivities that accompany the formal oath of office.   Mr. Trump and his entourage should have plenty of space to spread out. The complex has 14 bedrooms and 35 bathrooms across 70,000 square feet.

Cyberattack: The 'Mr. Robot' Story So Far,"""Hello, friend."" That's how Elliot Alderson, a troubled programming genius, welcomed viewers last summer to the convoluted world of ""Mr. Robot."" With the show returning July 13, here's a brief refresher:  Elliot, an engineer at a cybersecurity firm called Allsafe and a ""vigilante hacker,"" was recruited by a man known as Mr. Robot into fsociety, an anarchist group partly inspired by entities like the Occupy movement and Anonymous. The cabal's goals included wiping out all debt and taking down E Corp, an Allsafe client that is the world's largest corporation. Elliot referred to the conglomerate as ""Evil Corp,"" and soon other characters did as well. That's one clue that much of what viewers saw reflected Elliot's unreliable perspective, which stemmed from mental and emotional ailments including depression, social anxiety, morphine addiction and, most crucially, dissociative identity disorder. Mr. Robot was revealed to be a delusion based on Elliot's dead father. His fsociety comrade Darlene was actually Elliot's sister. ""I am Mr. Robot,"" Elliot said near the end of the season, realizing that he, in fact, was the mastermind of the culminating ""5/9 hack."" The attack disrupted the world's economies, but we do not yet know how it happened. In the season finale, Elliot woke up in an S.U.V. days after the hack to find the world in chaos and his nemesis and possible collaborator Tyrell Wellick, a cruelly ambitious former E Corp executive, missing. In a scene after the credits, Phillip Price, the E Corp chief executive, revealed that he knew who was responsible for the cyberattack. ""The 5/9 hack was an explosion, and now we're seeing the bits and pieces going every which way,"" said Sam Esmail, the show's creator. ""Hopefully, we'll see them come back together.""Related Articles   "
How We Identified the D.N.C. Hack's 'Patient Zero'; Reporter's Notebook,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this article, the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Eric Lipton details how he and his Times colleagues David E. Sanger and Scott Shane constructed a chronological narrative of one of the most famous hacks in history. Epidemiologists, at the outbreak of any major disease, are sent out to the field to find patient zero - the first victim, which helps explain how the contagion began. As David Sanger, Scott Shane and I set out in late November to reconstruct the events surrounding the hacking of the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign, we too wanted to understand, among all factors, how and where this story started. The Times had extensively covered the remarkable story of Russia's effort to influence the election - with David Sanger and our colleague Eric Schmitt first breaking the news back in late July that the hack was almost certainly the work of Russian operatives (after David and Nicole Perlroth had explored how the Russians were casting the Democratic convention into chaos). That was followed in August with an article about suspicions that the N.S.A. itself was hacked by the Russians and in October with analysis of President Obama's options for retaliation.  But we had never taken the opportunity to look back and tell the story as a single, extended narrative, chronicling the people who got swept into one of the most famous hacks in history. Kitty Bennett, our news researcher extraordinaire, helped start the effort by building a chronology of events - based on as many primary source documents as we could find. We then set out to interview every major figure involved in the episode: the executives and staffers at the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign; the private sector investigator at CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, and Perkins Coie, a law firm, both of which were hired by the D.N.C. and the D.C.C.C.; the government investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the director of National Intelligence and the White House officials who advised President Obama on how to respond. We talked to members of Congress and other congressional candidates, and to intelligence officials who, of course, would not speak on the record. And that was just the beginning. We also reached out to WikiLeaks - and its editor in chief, Julian Assange - and tried, though without much success, to engage individuals in the Russian government, as well as Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, the Russian-linked websites that dumped many of the Democrats' emails and other documents. In each of these interviews, we asked the principal players not only to tell their stories, from start to finish, but also to provide us with primary source documents, such as emails or memos, even if they shared them on the condition that we could not reproduce them. Documents are better than human memory: They nail down names and days and times - some of the last captured emails offered windows into how various email accounts were cracked open - and sometimes give us a sense of contemporaneous reactions. The Democratic Party officials were surprisingly open to telling this story, as they almost all felt that the media had focused far too much on the content of the stolen emails themselves and not nearly enough on how the 2016 election had been disrupted by a Russian plot. The White House didn't want to discuss the topic. Kitty Bennett's original chronology grew in length, as we filled it in based on our interviews and collected documents, ultimately reaching more than 10,000 words: a 28-page compilation of people and events that served as the core of our narrative. It was while doing all these interviews that we first heard the story of Yared Tamene, the tech-services consultant at the D.N.C. who had fielded a call in September 2015 from an F.B.I. special agent named Adrian Hawkins - who contacted the D.N.C. to disclose that federal officials had evidence that the D.N.C. computer system had already been hacked. But Mr. Tamene did not believe he was talking to a real F.B.I. agent, so he didn't move definitively to find and shut down this intrusion. Even after Special Agent Hawkins repeatedly called Mr. Tamene and finally met with him in person last January, he remained skeptical, describing their encounter this way in an internal D.N.C. memo: ""During this meeting, SA Hawkins showed his FBI badge to us, and shared his business card, lending some credence to his claim about working for the FBI."" This was five months after the F.B.I. had first contacted the D.N.C. But Special Agent Hawkins's superiors took no steps to independently reach out to the committee's leaders to persuade them to take seriously what appeared to be a Russian government attack. Between the passivity of the F.B.I. and the passivity of the D.N.C., almost no progress had been made to identify and lock out the hackers. Mr. Tamene never agreed to speak with us, although we happened to run into him during one of our visits to D.N.C. headquarters. But based on documents we reviewed - including an internal D.N.C. account of his dealings with the F.B.I. that Mr. Tamene himself had written - we were confident we had found our patient zero. Our story would start in September 2015, when this first warning call had come in from the FBI. When you do reporting like this, you begin to hear the same stories over and over again, told by different players who experienced the same events. These accounts might seem redundant. But for reporters, they're vital stuff, because each person fills in different tidbits - or pieces of color, as we call them. These overlapping stories help increase your confidence that the version of events you're piecing together is fair and true, particularly when backed up with emails and other documents. While I was focused on the D.N.C., David was busy pressing Obama administration officials to explain how they responded to the cyberattacks - a time-consuming process because of the difficulty of getting access to them and, in some cases, because of their reluctance to talk. David is perhaps the best-sourced cybersecurity reporter in the United States: He was the guy who broke the story of the most sophisticated cyberattack in history, the American-Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. (That tale recently became a documentary.) Eventually the White House began to tell its story, and it's no surprise that when President Obama gave his news conference on Friday, his version of events echoed what we had already reported. While David worked, Scott Shane, one of the top intelligence reporters in Washington, focused on the F.B.I. and on a group we called ""the facilitators,"" which included players like WikiLeaks that posted the hacked emails in a public place. He also spent a large chunk of time examining the evidence investigators had gathered as proof that the Russian state was involved in the hack - we went into this project determined to evaluate it on our own rather than base our work on an assumption that this was Russian espionage. What is often most fascinating when you do so-called narrative reconstructs like this is how seemingly minor events can in retrospect have such enormous consequences. Consider the case of Charles Delavan, an aide to Hillary Clinton's campaign, who in March 2016 was forwarded the phishing email that had been sent to John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. Mr. Delavan had been asked to advise Mr. Podesta if this was a real email from Google, asking him to change the password on his personal Gmail account, or a hoax, trying to hack into Mr. Podesta's account. The Clinton campaign, simultaneously, was the target of an aggressive cyberattack that relied in large part on near replicas of this same fake Google email, urging recipients to change their password. So Mr. Delavan, in an interview, said he immediately knew this was a fake. And to me, as a reporter, that was a plausible statement. But somehow - and this action by Mr. Delavan remains inexplicable - he wrote back that the fake Google email was ""legitimate,"" leading Mr. Podesta or one of his aides to fall for the ruse. This opened up to the Russian hackers a decade's worth of Mr. Podesta's emails (60,000 in total), including those that contained copies of speeches Mrs. Clinton had given on Wall Street, as well as hundreds of private exchanges he had had with other close aides. All of these became public, causing a distraction to Mrs. Clinton's campaign in its critical final month. The mistake, Mr. Delavan said in the interview, is ""the worst thing that ever happened in my life."" He has become a target of threats via Twitter, email and telephone, with one person even coming to his house in Brooklyn before the election to tell him, ""You are going to make us lose the election."" It is a burden he will carry with him for the rest of his life. As we moved toward wrapping up our reporting, the history almost overtook us. During one of these weekends, I happened to be at Politics and Prose, a popular Washington bookstore, interviewing a former D.N.C. staffer. At the same time, a gunman entered Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant a few doors down, and fired his weapon. He was there to check out a fictional story suggesting that this pizza place was somehow the center of a child-trafficking ring. This conspiracy had been inspired - with no justification in reality - by the same set of emails stolen from John Podesta. The narrative of the Russian hacks we were reporting had driven right into this bookstore coffee shop. I wondered as I continued the interview, with police officers in body armor holding rifles right outside the window, should I crouch down under the table or keep talking? (Ultimately, I called the weekend editor in our Washington Bureau and wrote a breaking news story on the incident.) The doorstopper-size history books we read make it seem like much of what happens as the pages turn is a matter of fate. It all had to happen that way, right? My impression is quite different. History, as this story once again illustrates, is marked by a lot of happenstance - small but consequential acts that ricochet out into the world, writing the narrative in real time as the events unfold.Related Articles   "
Dodging the Computer Kidnappers,"Q. My computer's antivirus program is going nuts lately blocking something called ''Locky.'' What is this and why am I getting so many alerts about it?  A. ''Locky'' is a type of malicious software known as ransomware, which as the name suggests, encrypts the files on your computer and will not release them until you give a hefty payment to your unseen attackers. Ransomware, which has been featured as a plot device on some television shows, has become decidedly more prevalent and large-scale in recent months, especially with attacks on hospitals in California and Kentucky, as well as on a municipal utility company in Michigan.    Locky is aimed at Windows systems and has been spreading this spring through waves of phishing spam messages. The ransomware can arrive on your computer hidden in an email attachment, like an infected Microsoft Office document (one that prompts you to enable Office macros) or as a bit of JavaScript code tucked inside a .zip file. (Because it can better evade some antivirus programs, the JavaScript version has been increasingly widespread as of late.)   You can take basic steps to protect yourself from ransomware infection. Keep your antivirus program and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches. Do not open any unsolicited file attachments from unknown senders -- or even unexpected attachments from people you know, in case their computers have been compromised.   Disable macro commands in Microsoft Office files you receive by email and if possible, log into your computer with a more limited standard account instead of the all-powerful administrator account. Some ransomware can encrypt files on drives attached to the PC, so back up your computer's files regularly, and keep a copy of the backup on an unconnected external drive or server.   Ransomware is not just a Windows problem. Mac users should also be on guard against the OS X/KeRanger-A ransomware and its variants, which can extort a high price in exchange for getting your computer's files back.

Google Takes New Steps to Comply With European Privacy Ruling,"In its continuing game of hide-and-seek with European privacy regulators, Google is about to make more changes to how people view its search results in Europe. The companyt will soon block access to certain disputed links from all of its domains -- including the main United States one, Google.com -- when people in Europe use its online search engine, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity.    The move is the latest attempt by Google to comply with a May 2014 data privacy ruling by Europe's highest court, while also trying to minimize damage to the company's vast global database of digital information. That ruling, known as the ''right to be forgotten'' and hailed by many national data privacy officials in Europe, forced Google to comply with the region's tough privacy rules, even when those laws were at odds with the company's goal of providing unfettered information to people worldwide.   The 2014 ruling allowed anyone with connections to Europe to ask search engines like Google and the Bing service of Microsoft to remove links to information about themselves, if they could demonstrate that the information was wrong, no longer relevant or not of general public interest.    Google, which provides roughly 90 percent of the online search results in Europe, says that it has done its best to comply with the privacy decision but that the ruling should be limited to the 28 countries of the European Union (and other European countries like Norway). Since May 2014, Google has approved about 40 percent of the 386,000 requests from individuals to remove links, according to the company's transparency report.   Google, though, has been under continuing legal pressure from European countries -- most notably France -- that say the company has still not done enough.   At issue is a fundamental difference between European and American attitudes toward privacy. European law views people's right to privacy as equally important as that of freedom of expression. In the United States, in contrast, privacy is typically perceived as a consumer right, and not on the same level as the First Amendment protections for the free flow of information.   ''There's a cultural gap between Europe and the United States,'' said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of Linklaters, a law firm. ''In Europe, we have a very strong position that views privacy as a fundamental right.''   The 2014 court ruling involved the case of Mario Costeja González, a Spanish lawyer who had complained that entering his name in Google led to legal notices from 1998 that detailed his debts and a forced property sale. The lawyer said the debt issues had been resolved many years earlier and were no longer relevant. The court agreed, ordered Google to remove the links and gave other Europeans the opportunity to make similar demands.   Until now, Google has complied with the European court's decision to remove links to online material at the request of European residents, though it has balked at extending those privacy rights to its global domains like Google.com that would encompass its non-European users.   Now, Google will go further, in part to forestall legal disputes and potential fines from European national privacy agencies. The search giant has told Europe's national data protection authorities that it will start blocking certain links on all of its global domains -- including Google.com -- when they are viewed from the European Union country where the original claim was made.   As part of the change, which will take effect by March, when someone succeeds in asking Google to remove or block access to a link for legitimate privacy reasons, the company will remove the link from its European domains -- like Google.es in Spain, for example -- and block access to the link from all of its global sites that can be used from the country where the request was submitted.   In practice, that would mean a successful request from someone in Spain would lead to the removal of the link from all of Google's European online search domains, while blocking access to it from all of its non-European domains -- including Google.com -- from that specific country.   Search results for individuals outside the European Union, including the United States, will not be affected, and links on Google's non-European domains will still be accessible from other European countries, according to the people with knowledge of h Google's plans.   The company has continually stressed that the European court ruling should apply only within the 28-member bloc. Google argues that if it agreed to alter all of its global search requests on behalf of the Europeans, other countries like China and Russia may soon demand that Google change its practices to meet their own national laws.   ''In the end, the Internet would only be as free as the world's least free place,'' Peter Fleischer, the company's global privacy counsel, said in a blog post last year.   Google has fallen afoul of Europe's privacy rules before, particularly in privacy-sensitive Germany. But several other United States tech companies have also found themselves embroiled in complicated legal disputes over how they collect, monitor and use the data from the likes of people's social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases, which are fast becoming digital currency for companies' lucrative advertising operations.   Facebook, for instance, has faced several legal challenges to how it collects data on European citizens, while the European Commission recently agreed to a new data-transfer agreement with the United States aimed at assuaging Europeans' concerns that their digital information is not sufficiently protected when companies move data across the Atlantic.   Yet it is Google that has often become the target of Europe's privacy concerns. That is partly because the company's activities stretch across people's daily digital activities through Google's dominant search engine, its ever-present mobile phone software known as Android and the company's other online services.   Despite Google's renewed efforts to appease European privacy concerns, it remains unclear whether the company's actions will be enough to head off the continuing legal challenges by Europe's national data protection authorities.   Elsa Trochet-Macé, a spokeswoman for the French privacy authority that has already fined Google for previous privacy infractions, said on Thursday that the company informed Europe's data protection regulators last month about the coming changes to its search results, but that the French agency had not yet decided whether they meant that Google now complied with Europe's privacy rules.   ''We're now analyzing the new changes,'' Ms. Trochet-Macé said.     "
Report Hints N.S.A. Gets Less Data Than Believed,"WASHINGTON -- A newly declassified report by the National Security Agency's inspector general suggests that the government is receiving far less data from Americans' international Internet communications than privacy advocates have long suspected. The report indicates that when the N.S.A. conducts Internet surveillance under the FISA Amendments Act, companies that operate the Internet are probably turning over just emails to, from or about the N.S.A.'s foreign targets -- not all the data crossing their switches, as the critics had presumed.    The theory that the government is rooting through vast amounts of data for its targets' messages has been at the heart of several lawsuits challenging such surveillance as violating the Fourth Amendment.    The report, obtained by The New York Times through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, was classified when completed in 2015, and it still contains many redactions. But several uncensored sentences appear to indicate how the system works: They suggest that the government supplies its foreign targets' ''selectors'' -- like email addresses -- to the network companies that operate the Internet, and they sift through the raw data for any messages containing them, turning over only those.   The distinction is important for evaluating crucial constitutional issues raised by how to apply Fourth Amendment privacy rights to new communications and surveillance technologies. Government secrecy about Internet wiretapping has prevented judges from adjudicating the issues in open court.   Still, Patrick Toomey, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who is helping lead one of several lawsuits challenging the N.S.A.'s Internet surveillance, argued that even if the companies were sifting the data themselves, the constitutional issues were the same if the companies were doing something they would not otherwise do at the government's direction.   ''The equivalent would be if AT&T were compelled to put every phone call through a voice transcription and then give to the government'' copies of only those calls that were linked to a suspect, Mr. Toomey said. ''We would find that disturbing, not just because it could be abused, but because it involves the phone company listening to every phone call.''   The network companies that operate the Internet, like AT&T and Verizon, do not publicly discuss how the surveillance system works, and the government declined to comment about the newly disclosed report.   Congress commissioned the inspector general report after the leaks about surveillance by the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden. A central focus was the FISA Amendments Act program, which permits warrantless collection of communications on domestic soil so long as the target is a noncitizen abroad -- even if the target is communicating with an American.   One part of the program is called Upstream. It involves the collection of emails and other Internet messages as they cross network switches. The report discusses how network providers are legally compelled to give the N.S.A. communications ''related to tasked selectors.'' A little later, after a redacted paragraph, it says, ''The providers should deliver only communications meeting these criteria to N.S.A.''   And the report said that ''for each source of collection, N.S.A. employs processes to determine whether'' -- the middle of the sentence is redacted, before it picks up with, ''are sending communications only for selectors currently tasked and authorized for collection.''   A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said there had been no official policy decision, as part of disclosing the inspector general report, to say more about how Upstream collection works than what the government had said previously.   Still, in previous reports and court documents about the Upstream system, the government has tended to use language that leaves it ambiguous whether the telecommunications companies or the government is filtering and scanning the raw Internet data.   (The inspector general report does not address how the N.S.A. collects foreign-to-foreign Internet messages passing through the American network. Such messages are not protected by domestic law, and the government does collect them in bulk, just as it could do if it intercepted them abroad, according to leaked documents and officials familiar with that system.)   The new report's discussion of how the Upstream collection system works under the FISA Amendments Act dovetails with an article by The Times and ProPublica in August, which was largely based on ''top-secret'' documents provided by Mr. Snowden. But those documents remain classified. And in public, the government has been vague about the system's details, including in its responses to lawsuits.   The cases are important because Internet technology works differently from the telephone technology for which wiretapping rules were developed and tested in court. A suspect's phone call can be intercepted without touching any other people's calls. But on the Internet, data from different messages are broken up and intermingled, so collecting a suspect's email requires temporarily copying and sifting data from many people's messages.   Privacy advocates want a court to address whether that violates the Fourth Amendment. So far, they have not succeeded.

Federal Efforts in Data Privacy Move Slowly,"In February 2012, the White House introduced a blueprint for the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, intended to give Americans the ability to exercise control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used. In his introduction to the report, President Obama went further, writing that his ''administration will work to advance these principles and work with Congress to put them into law.''    Four years later, however, the effort has produced few new data controls for consumers, even as advocates say the need is greater than ever because of the advent of Internet-connected technologies that collect data on people's sleep habits, the temperature in their houses and the like.   ''Why has President Obama's proposal to establish a consumer privacy framework not moved forward?'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research center in Washington that initially supported the administration's effort. ''It's an important question.''    The story of how some of the country's leading civil society advocates came to lose faith in the White House's privacy initiative does not follow the typical plot of Washington gridlock. It is a tale of clashing visions for American society and commerce. And it provides an instructive preview of looming battles among government agencies for control over industries like drones, smartphones and gadgets yet to come.   The ability of companies to freely amass and analyze the personal details of consumers also provides a counterpoint to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I., in which Apple says it wants to protect consumer information from government snoops.   In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission began looking more deeply at online services, advertising networks and data brokers that harvest consumers' information in order to tailor services and market to them. Federal regulators said they were concerned that certain data-driven technologies were outstripping the ability of consumers to manage how companies were using their personal details.   At issue was not the classical notion of ''privacy'' as the right to keep out prying eyes.   When people freely search and share their personal concerns online, their data footprints can leave clues about their most intimate health worries, family matters and financial difficulties. Regulators warned that companies could use those details to narrowly categorize consumers, potentially leading to inferior or unfair treatment.   ''The free availability of this information can cause harm in a variety of ways,'' said Jessica L. Rich, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.   Separately, officials at the Commerce Department were focusing on privacy as an economic issue. They did not want consumers to lose trust in digital services and stop patronizing them, said Cameron F. Kerry, the department's general counsel at the time. Commerce officials also wanted to ensure that American technology companies could continue to innovate with data.   ''Both privacy and security are critical issues for e-commerce and the growth of the digital economy,'' Mr. Kerry, now a lawyer at the firm Sidley Austin, said in a recent phone interview. ''I felt it was important that Commerce should retake that leadership.''   Over the next three years, administration officials developed the privacy initiative. They titled the effort the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to underscore the idea that, among other things, Americans had the right to expect that companies would not use their personal details for unexpected purposes.   The document posited consumer privacy as a basic American right that was not dependent on the kindness of app makers.   ''The critical transition that we made was this focus on individual rights,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner, the former United States deputy chief technology officer for Internet policy in the White House, who shepherded the consumer privacy initiative. Now a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he added, ''That was a significant shift that we made very intentionally.''   In addition to calling for consumer privacy legislation, the 2012 report proposed a parallel self-regulatory process: Under the auspices of the Commerce Department, industry and consumer groups were to work together to devise voluntary privacy practices for mobile apps, drones and other technologies.   ''The Obama administration released the first-ever comprehensive consumer privacy blueprint to provide a template for stakeholders from across the public and private sectors to implement policies that safeguard American consumers and innovation,'' Jennifer Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, said in an email.   The lofty aims ran into challenges.   The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the Commerce Department, began to convene meetings to encourage technology companies, trade groups and consumer advocates to reach consensuses on privacy practices in various industries; the biometric industry would weigh in on facial recognition, for example.   The yearlong discussions on mobile app transparency ultimately resulted in a subset of the participants getting together on their own time to devise data disclosure charts -- akin to nutrition labels on food packages -- that apps could display for consumers.   ''That is a major success,'' said John Verdi, director of privacy initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The app notices, he said, were intended to make ''more transparent to consumers what their privacy policies are, what data they collect, what data they share.''   Intuit subsequently introduced the notices in its QuickBooks Online mobile apps and made them freely available to app developers.   But many other companies have not signed on. ACT: The App Association cautioned its member app makers that the app code of conduct could open them to liability. The group subsequently developed its own disclosure notices for children's apps.   The multistakeholder talks on facial recognition technology were more contentious. Facial recognition can be used to identify unknown people by taking scans of their faces and comparing them with facial scans from a photo database of named people.   Civil society groups warned that companies could use the scans to identify consumers by name as they shopped or traveled, potentially diminishing the ability of ordinary people to go about their business in public anonymously. The consumer advocates walked out of the talks last summer after industry groups would not commit to obtaining consumers' permission before scanning their faces in public places.   Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communications and information at the Commerce Department, said he hoped the civil society groups would ultimately re-engage in the facial recognition talks.   ''This is the single best process for moving this forward,'' he said.   But David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the consensus process had proved to be of little benefit to consumers.   ''If you want to protect consumers,'' Mr. Vladeck said, ''you don't simply allow industry to decide what to do in a way in which they don't have any incentive to compromise.''   The clash continues between consumer advocates who warn that unfettered commercial data collection could chill the daily routines of Americans -- where they go, what they say, how they shop -- and industry advocates who warn that any restrictions on data collection could chill innovation.   After Congress failed to take up baseline consumer privacy legislation, the administration issued its own discussion draft of a bill last year. A number of civil society advocates immediately criticized it, contending it nodded superficially to the idea of privacy rights, but ultimately ceded control over consumers' data to companies.   Administration officials say legislation is still needed.   ''We continue to call on Congress to advance legislation in line with the common-sense protections outlined in the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,'' said Ms. Friedman, the White House spokeswoman.   Consumer advocates are not holding their breath, although some are turning to the states to enact consumer privacy protections for technologies like facial recognition, voice-controlled smart TVs and social media services.   ''An individual should have control over their information,'' said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, ''not a Facebook, Google or Internet service provider.''     "
Justice Dept. and Apple Trade Barbs Over Law,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple on Tuesday emphasized its opposition to a court order requiring it to help unlock an iPhone for law enforcement purposes, saying in a new legal brief that the government's ''methods for achieving its objectives are contrary to the rule of law, the democratic process and the rights of the American people.'' The company's argument quickly drew a response from the Justice Department, which upbraided Apple for trying to stand above the law. ''The Constitution and the three branches of the federal government should be entrusted to strike the balance between each citizen's right to privacy,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman, Emily Pierce, said in a statement. ''The Constitution and the laws of the United States do not vest that power in a single corporation.''     The latest volleys between Apple and the Justice Department represent a final cementing of positions in a case that has pitted the world's largest company against the government, which wants to extract data from an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack last December. Apple has refused to comply with the order and its filing on Tuesday was the last before a crucial hearing in the case, which is scheduled for March 22 before Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.   The case has set off a fierce debate over privacy and security, with heated arguments between Apple and the government. Apple has contended that the court order could have grave consequences for digital security and privacy. The Justice Department has said Apple's inability to get into its smartphones has created a system tailor-made for criminals.   For the last few weeks, the two sides have stumped for their positions before Congress and in the court of public opinion. Each side has asked Congress to decide under what circumstances the government may see private customer data. President Obama said last week  that law enforcement authorities must be legally able to collect information from smartphones and other electronic devices.   In its legal filing Tuesday, Apple tried to move the debate from an intense and personal tone and refocus attention on what it said it sees as the matter at hand, a fight over civil liberties and data privacy. The issue cannot be weighed without taking into account the larger national debate over data privacy concerns, Apple said.   ''The Justice Department and F.B.I. argue that this court must decide this issue in a vacuum,'' the company said in its brief. ''The court not only can consider this broader context, it must do so.''   Apple's filing on Tuesday also reiterated points the company made last month when it asked the court to drop its order, contending that the request would ''inflict significant harm -- to civil liberties, society and national security -- and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.''   The filing emphasized the constitutional arguments that Apple has made, specifically that the court order violates the company's constitutional right to free speech and subjects it to ''arbitrary deprivation'' of its liberty by the government.   Apple also repeated its argument that the government was overstepping its bounds by seeking to force the company to break into the iPhone using a statute called the All Writs Act, which dates to 1789. Apple has said the government is interpreting the law too broadly, and re-emphasized that point on Tuesday.   ''The All Writs Act cannot be stretched to fit this case,'' Apple said.   The filing was less fiery than the brief filed in the case last Thursday by the Justice Department, which suggested Apple was refusing to comply with the government while secretly conducting a different, special relationship with China. Apple's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, has said that the accusations were baseless and cited unnamed sources.   Apple's brief on Tuesday, while less angry in tone, did seek to put to rest what its lawyers called the government's most inflammatory claims about the company's relationship with China and its use of privacy as a marketing tool. To buttress its defense, Apple cited declarations from Craig Federighi, its senior vice president for software engineering, and Robert Ferrini, its senior director for worldwide advertising and planning.   ''Apple uses the same security protocols everywhere in the world,'' Mr. Federighi said in his declaration filed Tuesday. ''Apple has never made user data, whether stored on the iPhone or in iCloud, more technologically accessible to any country's government. We believe any such access is too dangerous to allow.''   Mr. Ferrini also disputed the government's contention that Apple was using privacy as a marketing tool. Of Apple's approximately 1,793 advertisements worldwide, he said, ''not a single one has ever advertised or promoted the ability of Apple's software to block law enforcement requests for access to the contents of Apple devices.''   Any decision by Judge Pym is likely to be appealed and could reach the Supreme Court, which has issued a mixed set of rulings in recent years on the scope of the government's powers to collect evidence.   ''We look forward to responding to Apple's arguments before the court next week,'' said Ms. Pierce of the Justice Department.     "
Microsoft Wins Appeal on Overseas Data Search,"For the last few years, American technology giants have been embroiled in a power struggle with the United States government over when authorities get to see and use the digital data that the companies collect. On Thursday, Microsoft won a surprise victory in one such legal battle against the government over access to data that is stored outside the United States.    In the case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed a lower court's ruling that Microsoft must turn over email communications for a suspect in a narcotics investigation stored in a Microsoft data center in Dublin. The case had attracted widespread attention in the technology industry and among legal experts because of its potential privacy implications for the growing cloud computing business, with implications for internet email and online storage, among other services.    Had the United States government prevailed, Microsoft and others warned, it would set a dangerous precedent that would make it increasingly difficult to resist orders from foreign courts demanding data, such as email from human rights activists or political dissidents. Corporate and government customers abroad also might be unwilling to use cloud services from Microsoft if they thought their data could be seized by American courts, Microsoft said.   The Justice Department, which brought the case, had argued that Microsoft's status as a company based in the United States gave it authority to obtain its data, even if the data was stored outside the country.   The case is part of the broader tussle between American technology companies and the United States government over digital data. While the companies have often invoked privacy rights to resist government interference with the data and to protect their business, law enforcement authorities have argued they need the data access for security reasons. Earlier this year, when Apple battled the F.B.I. over whether to help the agency break into a locked iPhone that had been used by a gunman in a mass shooting, the security and privacy of digital data was also invoked.   On Thursday, Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's president, said the court's ruling was a victory for digital privacy rights. He added that the adoption of cloud services by customers in some countries, especially in the public sector, had slowed as a result of the uncertainty around the privacy of their communications.   ''We've all been worrying about a lack of confidence that people in other countries had when it came to using U.S. cloud services because of their concern the U.S. government would try to reach into their borders,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Today's decision is, I think, very important in bolstering confidence for our customers around the world.''   The government is likely to appeal the ruling, legal experts said. In a statement, Peter Carr, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said, ''We are disappointed with the court's decision and are considering our options.''   Whatever path the case ends up taking, Thursday's decision has big implications for other tech companies like Apple and Amazon, both of which supported Microsoft's position in the case. The behemoths can use the ruling to argue against future attempts by governments to obtain communications beyond their borders.   ''The tech community is breathing a collective sigh of relief,'' said Craig A. Newman, a lawyer with Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler. ''Until this ruling, tech companies with data centers outside the U.S. were stuck in this proverbial rock and a hard place.''   In its ruling, the court said that a provision of an electronic communications law created in the mid-1980s did not allow courts to enforce warrants for the seizure of customer email content that is stored on foreign servers belonging to service providers based in the United States.   ''Three decades ago, international boundaries were not so routinely crossed as they are today, when service providers rely on worldwide networks of hardware to satisfy users' 21st--century demands for access and speed and their related, evolving expectations of privacy,'' the court wrote in its decision.   The office of the Irish Data Commissioner, which sets online privacy rules in Ireland, did not respond to a request for comment.   Digital rights groups praised the decision and joined Microsoft and other technology companies in calling on Congress to modernize laws on electronic communications.   ''This is a significant decision and yet another reminder that the laws that protect our privacy online are dangerously out of date,'' said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. ''As the concurring opinion points out, our online privacy laws are not the bulwarks of privacy that Congress thought they were when it enacted them in 1986.''   The decision caught some people off guard because earlier rulings by other courts had gone against Microsoft.   The case began after a search warrant was granted by a federal magistrate judge in New York in December 2013 as part of a criminal inquiry. In mid-2014, Microsoft challenged the search warrant, questioning whether federal prosecutors could force it to hand over the customer's email communications stored in the Irish data center. The objection was believed to be the first time that a corporation challenged a domestic search warrant seeking digital information overseas.   Organizations that filed briefs supporting Microsoft in the case included Apple, Amazon, Verizon Communications, Fox News, National Public Radio, The Washington Post, CNN and almost two dozen other tech and media companies. Trade associations and advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United States Chamber of Commerce, and 35 computer scientists also signed briefs in the case.     "
Microsoft Case Shows the Limits of a Data Privacy Law,"The battle over the privacy of electronic communications sought in government investigations shifted against the Justice Department last week. The question is whether a judicial decision preventing investigators from obtaining emails stored abroad will finally push Congress to address just how much protection should be afforded to digital information.    Similar issues surfaced this year in the battle between Apple and the F.B.I. over access to an encrypted iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.   In the case of Microsoft v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan last week dealt a blow to efforts to obtain emails that are held in foreign countries.   The government obtained a warrant under a provision of the Stored Communications Act to gain access to emails in a customer's account maintained by Microsoft on one of its servers in Dublin. The company refused to turn over the data, arguing that the warrant applied only to materials in the United States and not those held outside the country. The government claimed that where the electronic files were actually stored was irrelevant because the communications were within Microsoft's control, so the company should be required to produce them.    The case turned on how broadly a court can apply the Stored Communications Act, a law adopted in 1986 as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to give a measure of protection to the then-nascent technology of email. Like almost any 30-year-old law dealing with technology, it is hopelessly out of date because it has not been meaningfully updated by Congress to address how digital information is created and stored.   The Supreme Court has emphasized in the last few years a presumption that American laws should not be applied outside the country unless Congress makes it clear that they extend to extraterritorial conduct. In June, the court reiterated that position in RJR Nabisco v. European Community to limit private lawsuits under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, to violations that affect domestic businesses or property.   The Second Circuit read the scope of the Stored Communications Act along the same lines, limiting the application of any warrant to what is within this country's borders because there was no indication in the statute that Congress wanted the law to permit searches outside the United States.   As a result, the warrants authorized by the statute are much like ordinary search warrants that can be executed only in the United States because American courts do not have the authority to authorize a search abroad.   Of course, digital information does not exist in the same sense that a piece of paper can be found in a specific location. With a few keystrokes, electronic files can be whisked across the globe, and it would have been easy for Microsoft simply to move the information in the customer's email account to the United States. While the files were in Ireland, that was more a product of how the company chose to store them rather than a conscious decision by the account owner to try to keep them outside the United States.   A concurring opinion by Judge Gerald E. Lynch of the Second Circuit makes it clear that the decision to limit the scope of the warrant resulted from an outdated law, not a choice by Congress to hamstring investigations of foreign conduct that might violate American laws. He pointed out that ''there is no evidence that Congress has ever weighed the costs and benefits of authorizing court orders of the sort at issue in this case,'' because in 1986 that was simply not an issue.   The whole idea behind cloud storage is that electronic information would be available anywhere, so focusing on a particular server may not reflect how the data is stored and retrieved. The very notion that electronic communications are in one particular country may be unrealistic about what actually takes place with data. Email files can be scattered throughout the world and broken into different parts, and may be shifted almost continuously through a company's system. This is far from the storage of files in the equivalent of locked cabinets that much of the law seems to envision.   Nor is this Microsoft's first tussle with the government over the Stored Communications Act. In April, the company filed a lawsuit claiming that secrecy orders issued under the law to prevent providers from notifying customers of demands for their information violated its First Amendment rights along with the Fourth Amendment. So it has taken a harder line in its dealings with the government rather than making an easy accommodation to produce the emails sought in an investigation.   The incentives created by the Second Circuit's decision are likely to prove highly problematic for investigators dealing with foreign suspects. It could even affect cases involving domestic conduct if communication providers were to read the opinion as authorizing them to shift data overseas to avoid having to produce customer information in an investigation.   Take it a step further by imagining the possibility that a company might offer an email service -- perhaps called ''Crim Mail'' -- guaranteeing users that their electronic files would be stored overseas. It could even choose to put servers in a location that is notably hostile to the United States and that would welcome the chance to throw a wrench in law enforcement efforts. The company could charge a premium to have files maintained only in specified locations, making it almost impossible for investigators to ever gain access to them.   No doubt such a series of events is far-fetched, but where there is an opportunity to take advantage of the law, someone may try to pursue it. Recall how the Panama Papers showed that lawyers could exploit gaps in how business entities can be created, with virtually no oversight, to help move money across the globe anonymously.   Judge Lynch ended his opinion with a call for Congress to revise the Stored Communications Act. ''I believe even more strongly that the statute should be revised, with a view to maintaining and strengthening the act's privacy protections, rationalizing and modernizing the provisions permitting law enforcement access to stored electronic communications and other data where compelling interests warrant it, and clarifying the international reach of those provisions,'' he wrote.   A bill introduced in Congress in May would extend the use of warrants for electronic communications of foreign citizens located outside the United States if the country where the data was held did not have a cooperation agreement with the United States to turn over that information.   On the other side, the Justice Department disclosed on Friday that the government was working on agreements with foreign governments to allow them to serve orders on technology companies in the United States to obtain emails and conduct wiretaps, according to The Wall Street Journal. Putting such a system in place would require congressional approval.   There was a push this year to mandate that the government always use a warrant to obtain electronic communications, but opposition from the Securities and Exchange Commission helped scuttle the legislation in the Senate. As a civil regulatory agency, the S.E.C. does not have the authority to obtain a warrant, so it claimed it would be hamstrung in trying to obtain email evidence in its securities fraud investigations.   The limits of the Stored Communications Act are now on full display, and it will be up to Congress to solve the puzzle of how much protection should be afforded to personal communications while allowing investigators to gather evidence. But with Congress in recess until early September, and little prospect of significant legislation in the short time before the presidential election, any major changes will most likely have to wait until after November, and perhaps well into 2017.   The question is whether law enforcement agencies can wait months before learning what is needed to obtain electronic information that may be crucial to proving a crime.     "
WhatsApp to Provide User Data to Facebook,"SAN FRANCISCO -- When Facebook bought the start-up WhatsApp in 2014, Jan Koum, one of WhatsApp's founders, declared that the deal would not affect the digital privacy of his mobile messaging service's millions of users. ''We don't know your birthday. We don't know your home address,'' Mr. Koum wrote in a blog post at the time. ''None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that.''     Two years later, in a move that is rankling some of the company's more than one billion users, WhatsApp will soon begin to share some member information with Facebook.   WhatsApp said on Thursday that it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. It will be the first time the messaging service has connected users' accounts to the social network to share data, as Facebook tries to coordinate information across its collection of businesses.   WhatsApp is changing its policy as it begins building a moneymaking business after long placing little emphasis on revenue. The company plans to allow businesses to contact customers directly through its platform. A similar strategy is already being tested on Facebook Messenger, a separate messaging service Facebook owns.   ''We want to explore ways for you to communicate with businesses that matter to you, too, while still giving you an experience without third-party banner ads and spam,'' WhatsApp said in a blog post announcing the changes to its privacy policy.   Among the changes, Facebook will be able to use a person's phone number to improve other Facebook-operated services, such as making new Facebook friend suggestions, or better-tailored advertising, WhatsApp added. It said the data-sharing would also be used to fight spam text messages across its service.   WhatsApp emphasized that neither it nor Facebook would be able to read users' encrypted messages and that individual phone numbers would not be given to advertisers. WhatsApp users are still required to provide a phone number only to sign up for the service, and can opt out of giving it to Facebook.   While WhatsApp operates autonomously from Facebook, Mr. Koum sits on Facebook's board.   The changes were immediately viewed with a critical eye by some who were concerned when Facebook bought WhatsApp that their data could one day be misused. WhatsApp made early inroads with people worldwide partly for its hard-line stance on privacy and individual liberties, which was rooted in Mr. Koum's youth in the 1980s in the Soviet Union, where, he has said, he lived in fear of his communications being monitored. Mr. Koum has also been outspoken against advertising in the app in general.   Many WhatsApp users have appreciated just how different the service is from Facebook. In some countries, like Brazil, WhatsApp's focus on privacy has led to criticism from law enforcement agencies that they cannot gain access to users' encrypted messages.   ''Our values and our respect for your privacy continue to guide the decisions we make at WhatsApp,'' Mr. Koum said in a post on Thursday. ''It's why we've rolled out end-to-end encryption, which means no one can read your messages other than the people you talk to. Not us, not Facebook, nor anyone else.''   He added, ''Our focus is the same as it's always been -- giving you a fast, simple and reliable way to stay in touch with friends and loved ones around the world.''   WhatsApp's privacy policy overhaul raises concerns about potential legal challenges. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group in Washington, said it would file a complaint on Monday with the Federal Trade Commission to stop WhatsApp from sharing users' data with Facebook. The group filed a similar case in 2014, citing promises that WhatsApp had made to protect individuals' privacy.   ''Many users signed up for WhatsApp and not Facebook, precisely because WhatsApp offered, at the time, better privacy practices,'' Mr. Rotenberg said by email. ''If the F.T.C. does not bring an enforcement action, it means that even when users choose better privacy services, there is no guarantee their data will be protected.''   Similar legal steps could be taken abroad, where  data protection rules are tougher. In Europe, for instance, several national regulators have already taken legal action against Facebook, claiming that it illegally collected information online about people who were not signed up on the social network. Facebook has denied the accusations.   Facebook has also been at the heart of a debate over how people's information held in Europe -- the company's users outside the United States are regulated from Dublin -- should be transferred to the United States.   In a legal case involving Facebook last year, Europe's top court ruled that American privacy standards did not offer sufficient protections to the region's citizens. The court, the European Court of Justice, also invalidated the so-called safe harbor agreement that permitted technology giants and 4,000 other companies to routinely move data across the Atlantic.   A new data-transfer pact, known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, recently came into force, but it is facing legal challenges as privacy campaigners remain concerned that data held in Europe could be improperly read by government agencies when moved to the United States.   WhatsApp's new privacy policy may put it in the middle of this tussle, pushing the company to reassure concerned users about how Facebook may use their data.     "
German Regulator Orders Facebook to Stop Collecting Data on WhatsApp Users,"Follow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82. When the messaging service WhatsApp announced last month that it was starting to share some of its users' online information with Facebook, its parent company, many users expressed anger that their digital privacy could be at risk.  Now, a German regulator thinks so, too.    The city of Hamburg's data protection commissioner ordered Facebook on Tuesday to stop collecting and storing data on WhatsApp users in Germany, the first time a privacy watchdog has waded into the debate. The regulator also called on the social network to delete all information already forwarded from WhatsApp on roughly 35 million German users.   ''It has to be their decision, whether they want to connect their account with Facebook,'' Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg data protection commissioner, said in a statement. ''Therefore, Facebook has to ask for their permission in advance. This has not happened.''   Facebook said on Tuesday, after the order had been issued, that it had complied with Europe's privacy rules and that it was willing to work with the regulator to address its concerns. The Hamburg regulator has authority over Facebook's activities in Germany because the company's German subsidiary is based in the city.   The privacy pushback comes as WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion, is trying to forge closer links with the social network and to look for new ways to generate revenue from its more than one billion users worldwide.   As part of its proposed overhaul, WhatsApp said it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook. WhatsApp also has plans to allow businesses to contact customers directly through its platform. A similar strategy is being tested on Facebook Messenger, a separate messaging service Facebook owns.   While WhatsApp has framed the changes as a way to give people a better service, not everyone is convinced. A day after the announcement, the British privacy regulator said that it was looking into the changes.   More than any other region, Europe has pushed back against American technology giants' use of people's digital information, routinely forcing companies like Google and Facebook to change their policies after they breached the European Union's tough data protection rules.   In its decision on Tuesday, which would affect only WhatsApp users in Germany, the Hamburg regulator said that neither the internet messenger nor Facebook had received individuals' permission to share the information and had potentially misled people over how their data would be used in the future.   The watchdog added that millions of people whose contact details had been uploaded to WhatsApp could now have that information shared with Facebook against their will, which would infringe German law.   ''Facebook's answer, that this has merely not been done for the time being, is cause for concern that the gravity of the data protection breach'' will have a more severe impact, Mr. Caspar said.

Arkansas Murder Inquiry Receives Amazon Rebuff,"In a move that promises to raise new questions about electronic privacy, detectives investigating a murder in Arkansas are seeking access to audio that may have been recorded on an Amazon Echo electronic personal assistant. So far, the online retail giant has resisted demands by the police and prosecutors in Bentonville, Ark., for the information. Without addressing the specifics of the case, Amazon said in a statement that, as a matter of course, it ''objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands.''    The tug of war over access to the audio, which was reported by the website theinformation, began when the police started to investigate the death of Victor Collins, who was found on Nov. 22, 2015, in a hot tub at the home of James Bates, according to court records. Investigators discovered signs of a struggle, including spots of blood, broken bottles and pieces of the spa that were on the ground.    Detective Cpl. Josh Woodhams of the Bentonville Police Department wrote in an affidavit that he found an Amazon Echo on the home's kitchen counter. The voice-activated device has seven microphones, and is equipped with sensors to hear users from any direction up to about 20 feet. Among other things, it can play music, make to-do lists, stream podcasts and provide real-time news and information.   In February, Mr. Bates was charged with murder, and as part of the investigation, the police sought from Amazon ''electronic data in the form of audio recordings, transcribed words, text records and other data'' captured by the Echo.   The request has raised concern among some right-to-privacy supporters.   Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said in an email that there should be a ''clear legal standard that governs law enforcement access'' to machines that make up what has become known as the internet of things. The reference is to the constellation of devices -- such as cameras, cellphones and appliances -- connected to the internet.   But Lynn Terwoerds, the executive director of the Executive Women's Forum, which founded and sponsors the Voice Privacy Alliance, said in an email that the request for the information was built on a faulty premise.   She said the Echo is always listening for a ''wake word'' -- Alexa, Amazon or another customizable term -- and records only what is said after it has been activated. She said it has 60 seconds of recorded sound in its storage. ''What this 'always listening' means is that the device is not eavesdropping and interpreting everything you're saying,'' Ms. Terwoerds wrote.   Once it detects the wake word, according to Amazon, the Echo starts streaming audio to the cloud, where it is secured until the customer permanently deletes it.   The case raises ''serious privacy concerns with this kind of nonspecific warrant,'' Ms. Terwoerds said, adding, ''We have to fight against the myth of Echo listening in on our every word and sending that data to Amazon -- it's simply untrue.''   Jon Simpson, the police chief in Bentonville, which, by car, is about three hours northwest of Little Rock, referred questions to Nathan Smith, the prosecuting attorney in Benton County. In an email, Mr. Smith said Amazon had yet to fully comply with two requests, although he said it had provided ''some very limited subscriber information.''   The company said in a statement that it would not ''release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.'' Mr. Smith said that officers had followed the proper procedure in seeking a search warrant from a judge based on probable cause, and that he hoped Amazon would comply and that no further steps would be necessary.   While many right-to-privacy supporters have expressed interest in the request, Mr. Smith said the case was '' really about seeking justice for the victim.'' He added that it was the responsibility of the police to seek the data to determine its relevance to the investigation. A lawyer for Mr. Bates did not respond to an email and a phone call seeking comment.   The Arkansas case is reminiscent of an episode in which the federal government sought to legally compel Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a gunman in a shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year that killed 14 people. The case became contentious as Apple refused to assist the authorities, prompting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important. Federal officials said in March that they found a way to unlock the phone without help from Apple.   The lack of clear-cut legislation over who is legally entitled to the data from such devices means these kinds of cases will continue to surface, Mark A. Testoni, the president and chief executive of SAP National Security Services, which helps agencies track those suspected of terrorism through open source data, said in an interview.   ''It's such a massive gray area,'' he said.     "
Sullivan & Cromwell Hires Online Security Specialist,"Sullivan & Cromwell, a big law firm known for advising major financial institutions, is taking steps to bolster its work in an area of particular concern to large banks: online security.  The law firm announced on Tuesday that it had hired as special counsel Nicole Friedlander, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor who had most recently overseen online crime prosecutions. Ms. Friedlander, 40, was previously co-chief of the complex frauds and online crime unit for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.    As a federal prosecutor for a little over eight years, Ms. Friedlander had helped oversee the investigation into an attack against JPMorgan Chase that resulted in the contact information for 83 million of the bank's customers being compromised. The investigation led to the filing of criminal charges in 2015 against five men in a complex scheme that involved hacking and securities fraud.   Steven R. Peikin, a managing partner in the law firm's criminal defense and investigations group, said that the firm's ''footprint has been a little light'' in digital security and that Ms. Friedlander's hiring would help build that practice area.   Online security has become a big issue for large corporations, in particular financial institutions, given the growing sophistication of hackers who breach computer networks and gain access to sensitive information about customers and corporate strategies.   Ms. Friedlander said her experience in law enforcement should prove instructive to corporate clients in learning how to deal with authorities during an investigation into a breach of a company's network.   ''Companies can be in a very difficult position when they have been hacked,'' she said in an interview. ''While law enforcement may see them purely as victims, other arms of the government may not. As a lawyer for a company, you want to give a coherent message, and I believe my experience will be helpful.''   Ms. Friedlander, during her tenure as a prosecutor, also worked on a number of money laundering and more traditional white-collar criminal cases.   She graduated from New York University Law School in 2001 and worked at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett before becoming a federal prosecutor in Manhattan.     "
"As Apple Resists, Encryption Fray Erupts in Battle","WASHINGTON -- Last month, some of President Obama's top intelligence advisers met in Silicon Valley with Apple's chief, Timothy D. Cook, and other technology leaders in what seemed to be a public rapprochement in their long-running dispute over the encryption safeguards built into their devices. But behind the scenes, relations were tense, as lawyers for the Obama administration and Apple held closely guarded discussions for over two months about one particularly urgent case: The F.B.I. wanted Apple to help ''unlock'' an iPhone used by one of the two attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December, but Apple was resisting.    When the talks collapsed, a federal magistrate judge, at the Justice Department's request, ordered Apple to bypass security functions on the phone. The order set off a furious public battle on Wednesday between the Obama administration and one of the world's most valuable companies in a dispute with far-reaching legal implications.    ''This Apple case really goes right to the heart of the encryption issue,'' said Ira Rubinstein, a senior fellow at the New York University Information Law Institute, ''and in some ways, this was a fight that was inevitable.''   This is not the first time a technology company has been ordered to effectively decrypt its own product. But industry experts say it is the most significant because of Apple's global profile, the invasive steps it says are being demanded and the brutality of the San Bernardino attacks.   Law enforcement officials who support the F.B.I.'s position said that the impasse with Apple provided an ideal test case to move from an abstract debate over the balance between national security and privacy to a concrete one.   The F.B.I. has been unable to get into the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was killed by the police along with his wife after they attacked Mr. Farook's co-workers at a holiday gathering. Reynaldo Tariche, an F.B.I. agent on Long Island, said, ''The worst-case scenario has come true.''   Mr. Tariche, who is president of the agents' association, added, ''As more of these devices come to market, this touches all aspects of the cases that we're working on.''   Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the District of Central California issued her order Tuesday afternoon, after the F.B.I. said it had been unable to get access to the data on its own and needed Apple's technical assistance.   Mr. Cook, the chief executive at Apple, responded Wednesday morning with a blistering, 1,100-word letter to Apple customers, warning of the ''chilling'' breach of privacy posed by the government's demands. He maintained that the order would effectively require it to create a ''backdoor'' to get around its own safeguards, and Apple vowed to appeal the ruling by next week.   ''The same engineers who built strong encryption into the iPhone to protect our users would, ironically, be ordered to weaken those protections and make our users less safe,'' Mr. Cook said.   Apple argues that the software the F.B.I. wants it to create does not exist. But technologists say the company can do it.   Mr. Cook's angry tone reflected the tense discussions, conducted mostly on the telephone, between his company and the government's lawyers over the San Bernardino case. Apple executives had hoped to resolve the impasse without having to rewrite their own encryption software. They were frustrated that the Justice Department had aired its demand in public, according to an industry executive with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions.   The Justice Department and the F.B.I. have the White House's ''full support,'' the spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Wednesday.   His vote of confidence was significant because James Comey, the F.B.I. director, has at times been at odds with the White House over his aggressive advocacy of tougher decryption requirements on technology companies. While Mr. Obama's national security team was sympathetic to Mr. Comey's position, others at the White House viewed legislation as potentially perilous. Late last year, Mr. Obama refused to back any legislation requiring decryption, leaving a court fight likely.   The Justice Department showed no sign of backing down Wednesday.   ''It is unfortunate,'' the department said in a statement, ''that Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil.''   The dispute could initiate legislation in Congress, with Republicans and Democrats alike criticizing Apple's stance on Wednesday and calling for tougher decryption requirements. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential contender, also attacked Apple on Fox News, asking, ''Who do they think they are?''   But Apple had many defenders of its own among privacy and consumer advocates, who praised Mr. Cook for standing up to what they saw as government overreach.   Many of the company's defenders argued that the types of government surveillance operations exposed in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, have prompted technology companies to build tougher encryption safeguards in their products because of the privacy demands of their customers.   ''Apple deserves praise for standing up for its right to offer secure devices to all of its customers,'' said Alex Abdo, staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberty Union's privacy and technology section.   Privacy advocates and others said they worried that if the F.B.I. succeeded in getting access to the software overriding Apple's encryption, it would create easy access for the government in many future investigations.   ''This is not the last step in the journey,'' said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who works on privacy and tech security issues at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. ''The next thing you know, they'll be in the back door of these systems.''   The Apple order is a flash point in a dispute that has been building for more than a decade.   The F.B.I. began sounding alarms years ago about technology that allowed people to exchange private messages protected by encryption so strong that government agents could not break it. In fall 2010, at the behest of Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, the Obama administration began work on a law that required technology companies to provide unencrypted data to the government.   Lawyers at the F.B.I., Justice Department and Commerce Department drafted bills around the idea that technology companies in the Internet age should be bound by the same rules as phone companies, which were forced during the Clinton administration to build digital networks that government agents could tap.   The draft legislation would have covered app developers like WhatsApp and large companies like Google and Apple, according to current and former officials involved in the process.   There is no debate that, when armed with a court order, the government can get text messages and other data stored in plain text. Far less certain was whether the government could use a court order to force a company to write software or redesign its system to decode encrypted data. A federal law would make that authority clear, they said.   But the disclosures of government surveillance by Mr. Snowden changed the privacy debate, and the Obama administration decided not to move on the proposed legislation. It has not been revived.   The legal issues raised by the judge's order are complicated. They involve statutory interpretation, rather than constitutional rights, and they could end up before the Supreme Court.   As Apple noted, the F.B.I., instead of asking Congress to pass legislation resolving the encryption fight, has proposed what appears to be a novel reading of the All Writs Act of 1789.   The law lets judges ''issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.''   The government says the law gives broad latitude to judges to require ''third parties'' to execute court orders. It has cited a 1977 ruling requiring phone companies to help set up a pen register, a device that records all numbers called from a particular phone line.   Apple argues that the scope of the act has strict limits. In 2005, a federal magistrate judge rejected the argument that the law could be used to compel a telecommunications provider to allow real-time tracking of a cellphone without a search warrant.

An $81 Million Sneak Attack on the World Banking System,"Tens of millions of dollars siphoned from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A shadowy set of casinos in the Philippines. A large bank in Bangladesh with creaky technology. An unknown -- and perhaps uncatchable -- group of anonymous thieves with sophisticated hacking skills. What unites this curious cast of characters and enabled one of the most brazen digital bank heists ever is a ubiquitous and highly trusted international bank messaging system called Swift.    Swift -- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication -- is billed as a supersecure system that banks use to authorize payments from one account to another. ''The Rolls-Royce of payments networks,'' one financial analyst said.   But last week, for the first time since hackers captured $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank in February, Swift acknowledged that the thieves have tried to carry out similar heists at other banks on its network by sneaking into the beating heart of the global banking system.    ''There are many banks out there right now saying, 'There but for the grace of God go us,''' said Gareth Lodge, a payments analyst at Celent, a financial consulting firm.   The admission that the attack was not a one-time event in a developing country but perhaps part of a broader threat has thrust Swift into a spotlight, raising questions about how securely money is being moved around the world. Some financial security experts point out the Swift system is only as safe as its weakest link.   The attack also reflects a growing sophistication among digital criminals, who for years have been breaching personal bank accounts and stealing credit card credentials. The thieves in Bangladesh may have spent months lurking inside the central bank's computers, studying how to steal the necessary credentials to gain access to Swift.   It is the digital version of the heist depicted in the movie ''Ocean's Eleven,'' said Adrian Nish, head of the cyberthreat intelligence team at BAE Systems, a defense and security company.   ''The trend is moving from opportunistic crime to Hollywood-scale attacks,'' said Mr. Nish, whose firm has analyzed the malware believed to have been used in the Bangladesh breach.   In the United States, most banks take special precautions with their Swift computers, building multiple firewalls to isolate the system from the bank's other networks and keeping the machines physically isolated in a separate locked room.   But elsewhere, some banks take far fewer precautions. And security experts who have analyzed the Swift breach said they had concluded that the Bangladesh bank may have been particularly vulnerable to an attack.   ''Swift is a great organization,'' said Chris Larsen, the founder of Ripple, a financial technology company that aims to speed up global money transmissions. ''But the system is fractured and antiquated. The way it is set up, you cannot totally isolate problems in a place like Bangladesh from the whole network.''   In some ways, Swift is a testament to how technology has helped all countries -- including poorer ones -- gain access to the financial system. But that broader access has a downside.   The central bank in Bangladesh, by some accounts, employed fewer protections against cyberattacks than many other large banks. The bank, for example, used $10 routers and no firewalls, according to news reports.   The server software that the Bangladesh bank employed was a Swift product called Alliance Access, which connects banks to the central messaging system. In a sign of how seriously Swift regards the breach of Alliance Access, the group issued a ''mandatory software update'' last week to help its members identify possible irregularities.   ''These hackers figured out this was a weak point on the periphery, and they went for it,'' said Jeffrey Kutler, editor in chief at the Global Association of Risk Professionals, a trade group. ''But they were not able to compromise the core.''   Swift's core is built on technology that has been evolving for decades. What began in 1973 as a relatively small network of 240 banks in Europe and North America is now a sprawling network of 11,000 users that includes both banks and large corporations. At first, Swift could be used to authorize payments across national borders. But it is now also used to transmit messages related to domestic payments, securities settlements and other transactions.   Swift's growth in recent years -- it set a record for messages in March -- reflects the increasingly global and interconnected nature of finance. But it also shows the risk of so many financial instructions running through a single system made up of a patchwork of banks and companies with varying levels of online protection.   Each bank on the Swift network is identified by a set of codes. And it was the codes assigned to the Bank of Bangladesh that were recognized -- correctly -- by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it transferred $81 million of the Bangladesh bank's money to the Philippines, not knowing that someone, somewhere, had stolen the credentials of the Bangladesh bank and installed malware to cover his or her tracks.   Initially, the thieves requested the transfer of $951 million into a handful of bank accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines -- a number that prompted the New York Fed to ask the Bangladesh bank to reconfirm that it indeed wanted to move the money.   In the end, the Fed processed only five of the 35 fraudulent payment requests, after it could not reconfirm with officials in Bangladesh.   The hackers seemed to time the attack perfectly: When officials from the Fed tried to reach out to Bangladesh, it was a weekend there and no one was working. By the time central bankers in Bangladesh discovered the fraud, it was the weekend in New York and the Fed offices were closed.   To conceal the crime, the malware disabled a printer in the Bangladesh bank to prevent officials from reviewing a log of the fraudulent transfers.   The money was transferred to accounts in the Philippines and then into the Philippine casino system, which is exempt from many of the country's anti-money-laundering requirements.   The New York Fed has been criticized for letting the $81 million slip out. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat and member of the Financial Services Committee, has called for an investigation, warning that the breach ''threatens to undermine the confidence that foreign central banks have in the Federal Reserve, and in the safety and soundness of international monetary transactions.''   The New York Fed said in a statement that ''there is no evidence that any Fed systems were compromised'' and that the transfer of the money had been ''fully authenticated'' by Swift.   Swift, which prides itself on its secrecy and low public profile, also put out a statement about the attacks. But its executives declined to speak on the record about the episodes, which are still under investigation. The group's chairman, Yawar Shah, who is a senior executive at Citigroup, also declined to comment.   In its statement, Swift emphasized that the hackers had been able to breach only some of the banks that communicate over Swift, not the network itself.   ''The commonality in what we have seen is that (internal or external) attackers have successfully compromised banks' own environments,'' Swift said.   Even if officials at the Bangladesh bank had employed the highest of security measures, the thieves displayed a level of skill, cunning and determination that may have been able to penetrate a far more secure system.   ''If you have an attacker who really wants to get in and knows there is a big prize,'' Mr. Nish said, ''keeping them out over the long term is really difficult.''     "
When Crib Monitors Double as Web Weaponry,"WASHINGTON -- When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and '80s, they were welcomed as a crime-fighting tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China's used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents. But now those cameras -- and many other devices that today are connected to the internet -- have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with election systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society.    The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check Twitter feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary web-connected devices -- many of them highly insecure -- can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after Election Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand.    Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday's events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a long-known vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things.   The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When Google and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur.   But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their factory-set passwords -- often ''admin'' or ''12345'' or even, yes, ''password'' -- and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N.H., called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits.   Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet's giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce Twitter, Reddit and Airbnb -- as well as the news feeds of The New York Times -- to a crawl.   The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway.   The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a nation-state such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of Hillary Clinton's campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday's attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless.   The starkest warning came in mid-September from Bruce Schneier, an internet security expert, who posted a brief essay titled ''Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet.'' The technique was hardly news: Entities like the North Korean government and extortionists have long used ''distributed denial-of-service'' attacks to direct a flood of data at sites they do not like.   ''If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,'' he wrote, ''the attacker wins.''   But in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet -- just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, ''as if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure.'' Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris.   The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government -- or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed.   The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing catch-up. In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results.   The F.B.I. investigates breaches, but that takes time -- and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation's ''critical infrastructure.''   The head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. ''We are over-focused on places and things,'' he said in a talk at Harvard. ''We need to focus on the data,'' and how it flows -- or doesn't flow.   That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords.   And the problem is quickly expanding: Cisco estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. Intel puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7.7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.)   Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or fear-mongering. Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a built-in dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers.   Chester Wisniewski, a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn ''might be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via 'smart' things.''   ''There are tens of millions more insecure 'smart' things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,'' Mr. Wisniewski added in an email.   It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by ''hacktivists.'' Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by Election Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could.     "
Governments Turn to Commercial Spyware to Intimidate Dissidents,"SAN FRANCISCO - In the last five years, Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, has been jailed and fired from his job, along with having his passport confiscated, his car stolen, his email hacked, his location tracked and his bank account robbed of $140,000. He has also been beaten, twice, in the same week. Mr. Mansoor's experience has become a cautionary tale for dissidents, journalists and human rights activists. It used to be that only a handful of countries had access to sophisticated hacking and spying tools. But these days, nearly all kinds of countries, be they small, oil-rich nations like the Emirates, or poor but populous countries like Ethiopia, are buying commercial spyware or hiring and training programmers to develop their own hacking and surveillance tools. The barriers to join the global surveillance apparatus have never been lower. Dozens of companies, ranging from NSOGroup and Cellebrite in Israel to Finfisher in Germany and Hacking Team in Italy, sell digital spy tools to governments.  A number of companies in the United States are training foreign law enforcement and intelligence officials to code their own surveillance tools. In many cases these tools are able to circumvent security measures like encryption. Some countries are using them to watch dissidents. Others are using them to aggressively silence and punish their critics, inside and outside their borders. ""There's no substantial regulation,"" said Bill Marczak, a senior fellow at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, who has been tracking the spread of spyware around the globe. ""Any government who wants spyware can buy it outright or hire someone to develop it for you. And when we see the poorest countries deploying spyware, it's clear money is no longer a barrier."" Mr. Marczak examined Mr. Mansoor's emails and found that, before his arrest, he had been targeted by spyware sold by Finfisher and Hacking Team, which sell surveillance tools to governments for comparably cheap six- and seven-figure sums. Both companies sell tools that turn computers and phones into listening devices that can monitor a target's messages, calls and whereabouts. In 2011, in the midst of the Arab Spring, Mr. Mansoor was arrested with four others on charges of insulting Emirate rulers. He and the others had called for universal suffrage. They were quickly released and pardoned following international pressure. But Mr. Mansoor's real troubles began shortly after his release. He was beaten and robbed of his car, and $140,000 was stolen from his bank account. He did not learn that he was being monitored until a year later, when Mr. Marczak found the spyware on his devices. ""It was as bad as someone encroaching in your living room, a total invasion of privacy, and you begin to learn that maybe you shouldn't trust anyone anymore,"" Mr. Mansoor recalled. Mr. Marczak was able to trace the spyware back to the Royal Group, a conglomerate run by a member of the Al Nahyan family, one of the six ruling families of the Emirates. Representatives from the Emirates Embassy in Washington said they were still investigating the matter and did not return requests for further comment. Invoices from Hacking Team showed that through 2015, the Emirates were Hacking Team's second-biggest customers, behind only Morocco, and they paid Hacking Team more than $634,500 to deploy spyware on 1,100 people. The invoices came to light last year after Hacking Team itself was hacked and thousands of internal emails and contracts were leaked online. Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Hacking Team, said his company no longer had contracts with the Emirates. But that is in large part because Hacking Team's global license was revoked this year by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. For now, Hacking Team can no longer sell its tools outside Europe and its chief executive, David Vincenzetti, is under investigation for some of those deals. New evidence suggests to Mr. Marczak that the Emirates may now be developing their own custom spyware to monitor their critics at home and abroad. ""The U.A.E. has gotten much more sophisticated since we first caught them using Hacking Team software in 2012,"" Mr. Marczak said. ""They've clearly upped their game. They're not on the level of the United States or the Russians, but they're clearly moving up the chain."" Late last year, Mr. Marczak was contacted by Rori Donaghy, a London-based journalist who writes for the Middle East Eye, an online news site, and a founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, an independent organization that tracks human rights abuses in the Emirates. Mr. Donaghy asked Mr. Marczak to examine suspicious emails he had received from a fictitious organization called the Right to Fight. The emails asked him to click on links about a panel on human rights. Mr. Marczak found that the emails were laden with highly customized spyware, unlike the off-the-shelf varieties he has become accustomed to finding on the computers of journalists and dissidents. As Mr. Marczak examined the spyware further, he found that it was being deployed from 67 different servers and that the emails had baited more than 400 people into clicking its links and unknowingly loading its malware onto their machines. He also found that 24 Emiratis were being targeted with the same spyware on Twitter. At least three of those targeted were arrested shortly after the surveillance began; another was later convicted of insulting Emirate rulers in absentia. Mr. Marczak and the Citizen Lab plan to release details of the custom Emirates spyware online on Monday. He has developed a tool he called Himaya - an Arabic word that roughly means ""protection"" - that will allow others to see if they are being targeted as well. Mr. Donaghy said he was frightened by Mr. Marczak's findings, but not surprised. ""Once you dig beneath the surface, you find an autocratic state, with power centralized among a handful of people who have increasingly used their wealth for surveillance in sophisticated ways,"" Mr. Donaghy said. The Emirates have cultivated an image as progressive allies of the United States in the Middle East. Their rulers often highlight their sizable foreign aid budget and their women's rights efforts. But human rights monitors say the Emirates have been aggressive in trying to neutralize their critics. ""The U.A.E. has taken some of the most dramatic steps to shut down individual human rights activists and dissenting voices,"" said James Lynch, the deputy director for Amnesty International's program in the Middle East and North Africa. ""It is highly sensitive to its image and fully aware of who is criticizing the country from abroad."" Last summer, Mr. Lynch was invited to speak about labor rights at a construction conference in Dubai and was turned away at the airport. Officials did not give a reason, but he later saw that his deportation certificate listed reasons of security. Mr. Mansoor, who still resides in the Emirates, has been outspoken about the use of spyware but is increasingly limited in what he can do. He worries that anyone he speaks to will also become a target. And more recently, the state has started punishing the families of those who speak out, as well. In March, the Emirates revoked the passports of three siblings whose father was charged with attempting to overthrow the state. ""You'll wake up one day and find yourself labeled a terrorist,"" Mr. Mansoor said. ""Despite the fact you don't even know how to put a bullet inside a gun.""

"As Russian Hackers Attack, NATO Lacks a Clear Cyberwar Strategy","TALLINN, Estonia -- In the six months since part of Ukraine's power grid came crashing down, turned off by highly sophisticated hackers, cyberspace allies of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have been leaving their mark here in the Baltics and across the sea in Finland and Sweden. Perhaps to discourage the traditionally neutral Finns and Swedes from growing closer to NATO -- this past week NATO conducted a naval exercise from Finnish territory for the first time -- hackers disabled the Finnish Ministry of Defense's website. That was preceded by electronic espionage against a Dutch commission that had concluded that a Russian-made Buk missile brought down a Malaysian airliner two years ago, killing 298 people. And Germany's intelligence agency, the BND, recently told American officials that it believed Russian hackers had been behind a cyberattack that destroyed a German steel mill.    Here in Estonia, where NATO maintains a center to explore the alliance's cyberspace vulnerabilities and potential responses to attacks, there is a widespread recognition that the Western alliance has yet to develop a strategy to counter Russia's increasingly aggressive action in cyberspace.    While there are frequent conferences and papers, there are no serious military plans, apart from locking down the alliance's own networks. Russia, China and Iran have increasingly sophisticated offensive cyberforces; NATO has none, and no established mechanism to draw on United States Cyber Command or its British equivalent.   That stands in sharp contrast to NATO's strategy for dealing with more familiar threats. The alliance is expected to agree at a summit meeting in July to deploy four battalions in Poland and the Baltic States to deter land invasions, though there is no agreement on who will supply troops for the fourth battalion. And it regularly rehearses the procedures for requesting that its nuclear-armed members roll out atomic weapons if a crisis erupts; those weapons are stored near NATO headquarters in Belgium, among other places.   Two years ago, NATO declared that it could rule a cyberattack on one of its member states to be the equivalent of an armed attack, which would lead to a commitment by all NATO members to respond.   But when it comes to deterring the kinds of low-level probes, espionage and attacks that flow through European computer networks every week, NATO commanders do not seem prepared to take aggressive countermeasures.   Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, has taken a low-key, purely defensive view of what the alliance should do in cyberspace. In an interview with the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel last week, he talked of sharing information and expertise, but nothing of the kind of sophisticated probing and early-warning deterrence strategies that large and small powers have begun to develop.   In short, it sounded like a strategy from a previous age, before cyberattacks were regularly used as a weapon and as a tool of espionage.   James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who has written about how NATO could use offensive cyberweapons, said there was ''a huge reluctance to share capabilities.'' The United States and Britain say little about their offensive cyberweapon abilities, even to their NATO allies.   ''The Russians get that,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''And they know that there is lots they can do without triggering any response.''   In part, that is because the Russians are experts at hiding their tracks. Almost all of the studies of the Ukraine power grid attack in late 2015 -- both unclassified and classified -- have pointed to hackers in Russia. But American intelligence officials say they have never been able to track the blackout, which affected 225,000 Ukrainians, directly to Mr. Putin's government, and probably never will.   Instead, American officials are giving cyberutility firms and cybersecurity groups around the United States confidential presentations of an analysis of what happened to the Ukrainian utilities, as a warning of what could occur on home soil.   At United States Cyber Command, which has expanded rapidly since the United States carried out cyberattacks against Iran in 2010, Russia's networks are a regular target of surveillance. By next year, Cyber Command will have more than 130 teams fully in operation around the world, integrated into Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force units, in addition to teams that work alongside the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md.   It has built up a vast early warning network, placing tens of thousands of ''implants'' -- sensors that can also be used to insert malware -- into networks around the world. But NATO is only beginning to explore what it delicately calls ''active defense,'' and says it is not focused on offensive cyberweapons.   The Russians have no such compunctions. But it is unclear what Russian hackers hope to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to make the point, as they did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an electronic halt, that they can get into any system, anytime.   ''Whatever the Russians have in mind -- mostly intimidation -- it usually fails,'' said Estonia's president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew up in New Jersey before coming here to turn this small NATO country into a pioneer in introducing new web-based technology for governing a nation. The 2007 attacks backfired, he noted, because they drove Estonians far more solidly into the European and NATO camps.   In Sweden and Finland, neutral nations in the Cold War, the politics are more complex. As the NATO exercise began in Finland last week, the Finnish foreign minister was in Moscow, meeting his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov.   The more Sweden and Finland turn to NATO, the more their networks, their news sites and their government ministries come under cyberattack. As Adm. John Richardson, the chief of United States naval operations, said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in May, ''The fact is it's a pretty hot war in the cyber domain going on right now.''   A hot war, but a kind that suits Russia well: It is part of what military strategists call ''gray zone'' combat. For Mr. Putin, cyberespionage and cyberattacks keep NATO and its partners off balance. They are enormously difficult and expensive to defend against, and, at least for now, they have operated below the line that is likely to prompt a military or economic response.   ''It stays below the radar,'' Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here, officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.   For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, cyberespionage and weaponry are part of a larger strategy of information warfare and a blitz of propaganda that makes sorting out fact from fiction -- say, the causes of the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine -- all the more difficult. But the attacks also remind the smaller nations here of their vulnerability, even if Russia's troops stay on their side of the border.   So far, NATO has found few effective means of deterring attacks.   ''The biggest problem in cyber remains deterrence,'' said Mr. Ilves, the Estonian president, who has made the issue of avoiding cyber conflict one of the main themes of his time in office. ''We have been talking about the need to deal with it within NATO for years now.''   His fear, he said, is that Russia or other cyberattackers will soon move to the next frontier: subtle manipulation of data like medical records, the operations of weapons systems and navigation data.   But for now, Europe's focus is on keeping its secrets safe and its weapons working. Germany issued a warning last month about Russian attacks; its Parliament was targeted last year in an operation that sought to install software that would have given Russia continuous access to the Parliament's computer networks. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of the German domestic intelligence agency, told The Financial Times that the Russians were ''showing a readiness for sabotage.''   Now, Germany's defense agency has done what NATO has not: It has started its own cyberwarfare unit.   Follow David E. Sanger on Twitter @SangerNYT.     "
"After a Cyberattack, Germany Fears Election Disruption","BERLIN - After hackers infiltrated the German Parliament's computer network in May 2015, it took nearly a year before the country's intelligence agency concluded that the attack was most likely the work of their Russian counterparts. Last week, when 900,000 Germans lost accessto internet and telephone services, it took a matter of hours before politicians began pointing fingers at Moscow. Berlin is now concerned that Germany will become the next focus of Moscow's campaign to destabilize Western democracies as national elections approach next year. Those fears intensified after the Obama administration accused the Russian government of attacking Democratic Party emails during the American presidential campaign.  The increasing dissemination of false news, disinformation and propaganda during the American campaign and before Italy's referendum last weekend has added a related layer of worry about the potential to corrupt public debate and democratic processes. Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, warned in an interview on Thursday of ""growing evidence for attempts to influence the federal election next year."" His agency has seen an increase in ""aggressive cyberespionage"" targeting German politicians, he said. If the advent of the personal computer helped undermine a closed Soviet system that could not compete in an information age, then exploiting the vulnerabilities of the internet and social media may be Russia's revenge. Intelligence and other officials can now point to a growing string of campaigns of disinformation, hacked computer networks and leaked emails fitting a pattern that traces a murky route back to Moscow. The aim, they say, is to undercut liberal opponents of Moscow, destabilize political systems and undermine democratic processes across the European Union and in NATO member countries, while supporting anti-European forces. ""Based on the prevailing Russian strategy of hybrid influence and destabilization, which we have observed over time and for which we have facts, the government, officials and some political parties have become sensitized to this form of conflict,"" said Wilfried Jilge, an expert on Ukraine and Eastern Europe with the German Council on Foreign Relations. ""Such suspicions are the result of observation and experience over the past year and a half,"" Mr. Jilge said. Many of the efforts seem intended to tilt elections in a direction preferred by Moscow or to undercut certain leaders. That was presumably the motivation for hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton, who long had an antagonistic relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. On the other hand, her challenger, the eventual winner, Donald J. Trump, was effusive in his praise for the Russian leader. False news, also linked to Russia, was widely disseminated in Italy by opponents of the push by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for constitutional changes. Many of those opponents are much closer to Moscow than to Mr. Renzi, who lost and has now resigned. Germans have not been immune to such disinformation, either. In January, a news article that said a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had been kidnapped and raped by migrants in Germany spread quickly on Russian-language news channels. Outrage over a supposed cover-up of the abuse drew members of Germany's Russian-speaking minority into the streets across the country, shocking German politicians. German police officials later proved that the events never took place. But the damage was already done, and the false report fed opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open the doors to nearly a million refugees. As for Moscow's motivations in Germany, Eberhard Schneider, a professor of political science at the University of Siegen, has observed Russia's propaganda tactics since the days of the Cold War. Ms. Merkel, he noted, was one of the strongest supporters of the sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Putin has a strong incentive to undermine her. ""Germany is the most important power in the European Union,"" he said. ""If you can harm Germany and prevent that Merkel has a good outcome in the next election, that is in his interest."" The disruption at Deutsche Telekom, which began on Nov. 27, set off a fresh round of alarm over potential Russian meddling and the vulnerability of Germany's computer networks, which could be disrupted or hacked during an election. A day after the breach, Bruno Kahl, head of the Germany's foreign intelligence service, raised the prospect of evidence linking Russia to interference in the United States election campaign and warned that Germany could be next. ""It is known that cyberattacks take place which have no other purpose than to provoke political uncertainty,"" he told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. ""These attempts to interfere focus on Europe, and on Germany especially,"" Mr. Kahl said. ""A kind of pressure is being exercised on public discourse and democracy here, which is unacceptable."" Investigations into the incident later blamed links to ""criminal organizations,"" though neither Deutsche Telekom nor the government disclosed any concrete link to Moscow. Observers like Mr. Jilge of the Council on Foreign Relations say that caution is prudent in assigning blame, but that suspicion of Moscow is warranted given the accumulating pattern. ""The fact that hackers appeared to have carried out this attack does not automatically mean that they are linked to Russia,"" he said of the Deutsche Telekom attack. ""But if we look at the target and the timing, and know that such influence and disinformation is part of the Russian approach, then it is not surprising that some would seek to address this issue,"" he said. Asked about the Deutsche Telekom disruption, Ms. Merkel said she did not know who was responsible, but she also mentioned Russia. ""I will simply say, such cyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. We must inform people a lot on this point,"" the chancellor told reporters last week. ""We cannot allow ourselves to be unsettled by this,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""We must simply know that this exists and learn to live with it."" Both Deutsche Telekom and the government's Office of Information Security said a strain of the Mirai malware, which seeks to embed itself in devices connected to the internet, appeared to have caused the disruption. Mirai was the same malware used in an attack in the United States in October that brought down websites for Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, SoundCloud and The New York Times, among others. In Germany, the malware apparently succeeded only in knocking out the routers and disrupting internet connections. ""According to our analysis, the objective of the attack is to install malware on the routers to add them to a botnet - meaning they could be used as the remote-controlled infrastructure for future attacks,"" Deutsche Telekom later said in a statement. The company pledged to focus on improving its network security to render it better able to resist any form of attack. The speed with which officials began to suspect Russia was a stark contrast to 2015, when hackers used a phishing tactic, using a fake email, to penetrate computers in Germany's lower house of Parliament. Only this past May did Mr. Maassen's domestic intelligence agency confirm suspicions that Russian intelligence was behind the attack. Finally, in October, it issued a broad warning. ""German parties or politicians,"" it cautioned, ""could fall into the focus of Russian cyberespionage campaigns and operations."" PHOTO: The Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn, Germany.

The Lauded Russian Hacker Whose Company Landed on the U.S. Blacklist,"MOSCOW - The blacklist includes two people suspected of cybercrimes, and four others who are military intelligence officers. All are the kinds of figures one might expect to be on a list of people targeted by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russia's malfeasance, including efforts to influence the 2016 election. Then there is the one who calls herself ""mishacker,"" a globe-trotter with a rebellious online persona who is perhaps the most intriguing of the newly revealed Russian spies.  On what appears to be her personal website, called ""Hello, stranger,"" that person, Alisa Shevchenko, introduces herself and expounds on some of her digital accomplishments, including setting up a work space for hackers in Moscow. ""My name is Alisa,"" the site reads. ""I am a human being. Part misfit, part mishacker. A businesswoman in the past as well as in a possible future. Currently I am mostly working on vulnerabilities and exploits, while striving to minimize entropy in the process."" The White House identified the company Ms. Shevchenko founded, Zor Security, as a supplier to the Russian military's Main Intelligence Directorate, or G.R.U., the group said to be behind the hacking attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. The United States government said the company provided technical support to the G.R.U. for the attacks. Ms. Shevchenko had been a minor celebrity in Moscow computer industry circles as a ""legal"" hacker. An article in the Russian edition of Forbes magazine in 2014 described the work of her business as discovering security flaws in the software of banks and other institutions. And a year before the United States government applied sanctions against her company, theDepartment of Homeland Security said she had helpedprevent cybercrime under a program of information sharing between the public and private sector. Ms. Shevchenko was said to have assisted a French company, Schneider Electric, in identifying vulnerabilities in its software. Ms. Shevchenko was recognized in a notice from the department's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, set up to coordinate between the government and industry to protect ""the nation's critical infrastructure."" This nod from the American government illustrates Ms. Shevchenko's ambiguous role and, more broadly, the diversity of people believed to be working inside Russia's government hacking program. The inclusion of Ms. Shevchenko's company on the American sanctions list sheds light on the sprawling scope of the effort, which drew in students, civilians and possibly criminal hackers to bolster the military and intelligence agencies' cyberwar abilities. Praised in the Russian news media as a young talent in 2005, when she was just 21, Ms. Shevchenko worked on cyberdefense projects but embraced the symbols and parlance of criminal hackers. She has tattoos and often posts messages on Twitter under the handle ""badd1e."" In a flurry of Twitter posts on Friday, Ms. Shevchenko mocked an American sanctioning agency, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, with a vulgarism, and said that she had already closed Zor Security. A message sent to Ms. Shevchenko's Twitter account was not answered Friday. ""How my little simple company (closed long ago at that) could possibly appear in the same list with the FSB and international terrorists,"" she wrote, using the initials of the Russian name of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. The Forbes article identified Ms. Shevchenko as the winner of a hacking contest in 2014, in which she had found her way into industrial control software used for such things as running electrical power plants and grids. ""I didn't expect such triviality,"" she was quoted as saying after winning the contest. She said she found ""around 10 vulnerabilities in just a few hours."" On her website, Ms. Shevchenko posted a link to a blog entry on the award she won. ""If exploited in real life, discovered vulnerabilities could cause harmful consequences, such as denial of service, functional failure of critical infrastructure management systems, which in its turn may disrupt normal life of an entire city,"" the blog post said of her hack. Her Twitter feed cultivates the persona of a digital rebel. In Moscow, her website said, Ms. Shevchenko founded a working space for hackers in the Chistye Prudy neighborhood of the capital, called Neuron Hackspace, also ostensibly for legitimate security purposes. The more prominent of the two cybercriminal suspects designated in the sanctions announced by the Obama administration was Yevgeny M. Bogachev, who the Treasury Department said was a developer of malicious software. One product, called Zeus, was used to steal bank account information, while another, Cryptolocker, scrambled the system of victims until they paid a ransom, according to the Treasury Department. The sanction notice said Mr. Bogachev had stolen about $100 million from American companies and government agencies. While the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Mr. Bogachev for criminal activities rather than political ones, at times in Russia's digital underworld, the distinction is one without a difference. In the current wave of Russian politicized hacking, code from the Zeus malware showed up in phishing attacks, according to Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder and the chief technology officer of the American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on Aleksei A. Belan, who is accused in the theft of email addresses and passwords from customers of three e-commerce companies. ""The fact is, the Russian system of mathematical education is quite good,"" Anton M. Shingarev, a vice president at Kaspersky, a Russian antivirus company, said in an interview. ""And it produces a lot of computer programmers. And this is the reason why there are a lot of Russian hackers."" PHOTO: Alisa Shevchenko on her Twitter profile.Related Articles   "
"Farhad and Mike Have a Big Story (Apple), and Some Scraps","Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike: Ahoy, Farhad! How goes it? In the final weeks before I move to San Francisco, I am making a point to eat the most ''New York'' foods I can think of. Today I will have cheesecake for lunch, and tonight I am in search of the best cannoli for dinner.    Farhad: I assume you'll be making a visit to some sidewalk hot dog vendors and greasy-spoon halal carts? And what about the Times Square Olive Garden? It sounds like you're in for some gastric distress.   Mike: Well, I'm saving Guy Fieri's restaurant for last. It'll be an excellent trip to ''flavortown, U.S.A.,'' as it were.    On with the show! If you haven't noticed, this week is all about Apple, Apple, Apple. The company is in the midst of a standoff with the F.B.I. on whether or not it will help the agency gain access to an iPhone used by attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings in December. It's a tricky mess, and we're unpacking new facets practically by the hour.   Farhad: Beyond the legal and national security implications of this story, I found the tech-industry dynamics interesting. Apple's position is far more impassioned than I can ever recall seeing from a tech company; it really seems like Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, is personally animated by the privacy debate. That position is also, of course, compatible with Apple's business model, which does not rely on data-mining and ad sales, as Mr. Cook is quick to remind people. Reaction from the rest of tech was mixed. Google's response to the case was muted, I thought -- in a series of tweets, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, offered what sounded like halfhearted support for Apple's position. Facebook and Twitter, meanwhile, sided more clearly with Apple.   I'm curious if the other tech giants will stick by Apple's side as the showdown with the F.B.I. gets more heated. What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.   Mike: That's pretty much par for the course for you, yeah?   In other security news, a Los Angeles hospital paid a ransom of about $17,000 -- in the form of 40 Bitcoin -- to a gang of hackers who unleashed malware on the hospital's network. The most shocking part of this story was hearing that people still use Bitcoin.   Yahoo continues to lay off people, and it axed a bunch of verticals it promoted heavily under Marissa Mayer, the company's chief. And Facebook's Instant Articles product is going wide, which could spawn a whole new generation of underpaid bloggers.   Farhad: Hey, Mike, you did it again. You forgot Zenefits! This week there was lots more news about this once highflying insurance start-up. In a column, I argued that the company was plagued by an obsession with hypergrowth, one that was spurred by its huge investment rounds. And Will Alden of BuzzFeed reported on a whole bunch of frathouse shenanigans at the company. Also, David Sacks, the new C.E.O., banned drinking on the job!   Mike: Sorry, but I have a setting in my brain that lets me sleep with my eyes open when hearing the phrase ''highflying insurance start-up.''   Here's the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.   Kanye teased his newest album, ''The Life of Pablo,'' this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution -- namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.   So does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of ''windowing,'' something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?   Before you answer that, I want to note that the new album is good, and Kanye is totally nuts on Twitter. Like, worse than you and I.   Farhad: I have taken a bold stance on this: Kanye is bad at Twitter. Really bad.   About Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives -- but I've got to say, I really hate it. I think what we're seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).   This is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They're all getting better, and I don't see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.   That's probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user's tastes -- but no Taylor.   I chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.   Mike: The structure for consumers is bad. I, personally, would love one subscription to get everything -- all my favorite shows, all that jazz -- without having to pay for 19 plans. It would be wonderful.   But there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even à la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don't think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you're willing to go all-in on one or two networks.   And that's sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows -- or music, or whatever -- good enough, you will pay for it.   That's why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it's the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.   The big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.   In sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.   Or maybe not. I won't cry for Kanye. He's famous.   Farhad: And did I mention he's bad at Twitter? He is.   Mike: O.K., tonight I leave in search of the ultimate ramen shop. Do you know of any good ones in Brooklyn?   Farhad: You know what? I've never been to Brooklyn. Honestly. And hopefully I never will. Bye!     "
F.B.I. Fought Encryption in a Case 10 Years Ago,"WASHINGTON -- In early 2003, F.B.I. agents hit a roadblock in a secret investigation, called Operation Trail Mix. For months, agents had been intercepting phone calls and emails belonging to members of an animal welfare group that was believed to be sabotaging operations of a company that was using animals to test drugs. But encryption software had made the emails unreadable. So investigators tried something new. They persuaded a judge to let them remotely, and secretly, install software on the group's computers to help get around the encryption.     That effort, revealed in newly declassified and released records, shows in new detail how F.B.I. hackers worked to defeat encryption more than a decade before the agency's recent fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone. The Trail Mix case was, in some ways, a precursor to the Apple dispute. In both cases, the agents could not decode the data themselves, but found a clever workaround.   The Trail Mix records also reveal what is believed to be the first example of the F.B.I. remotely installing surveillance software, known as spyware or malware, as part of a criminal wiretap.   ''This was the first time that the Department of Justice had ever approved such an intercept of this type,'' an F.B.I. agent wrote in a 2005 document summing up the case.   The next year, six activists were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Protection Act in the case. An appeals court upheld the convictions in 2009, and said that the use of encryption, among other things, was ''circumstantial evidence of their agreement to participate in illegal activity.''   Ryan Shapiro, a national security researcher and animal welfare advocate, provided the documents in the case to The New York Times after obtaining them in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. Several important details remain secret, including whether the tactic worked. The wiretap was disclosed at trial but the software hacking was not, said Lauren Gazzola, one of the defendants, who now works for the Center for Constitutional Rights.   It is also unclear why the Justice Department, which is required to report every time it comes across encryption in a criminal wiretap case, did not do so in 2002 or 2003. The Justice Department and F.B.I. did not comment Wednesday.   The Trail Mix documents provide an unusual, if dated, glimpse at the cat-and-mouse game that the F.B.I. has been playing for years with people who use technology to keep their affairs secret. The records show that, even when encryption was not widely used, there was a growing frustration about it in the F.B.I. To defeat it, agents built and used surveillance software earlier than was known.   ''The documents show that the F.B.I. has been in the hacking business for a long time,'' said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union who reviewed the records.   In 2008 the F.B.I. began a campaign called ''Going Dark'' to build support for laws requiring companies to allow government access to data in unencrypted form. But the Trail Mix records show that agents were frustrated by encryption many years earlier, and saw the fight against terrorism as an opportunity to get new authority.   ''The current terrorism prevention context may present the best opportunity to bring up the encryption issue,'' an F.B.I. official said in a December 2002 email. A month later, a draft bill, called Patriot Act 2, revealed that the Justice Department was considering outlawing the use of encryption to conceal criminal activity. The bill did not pass.   The Trail Mix investigation focused on sabotage and stalking at Huntingdon Life Sciences, a company with a New Jersey laboratory that conducted pharmaceutical testing on animals. The group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty strongly opposed the company's testing and advocated protests to end it.   F.B.I. agents contended members of the group were also behind criminal attacks that included nuisances like sending nonstop faxes of all-black paper and hacking attacks that caused more than $450,000 in damages and lost business. Federal law labeled such attacks eco-terrorism.   The activists communicated using a well-known security program called Pretty Good Privacy, which makes emails unreadable by anyone without a password and a digital key. The agents tried several tactics, including getting a ''full-content'' wiretap that intercepted every byte that left the group's computers. Yet the encryption proved unbreakable.   More than a decade later, the F.B.I. still cannot break sophisticated encryption such as the kind used on Apple's iPhones. Early this year, in its investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack, the Justice Department tried to require Apple to remove some security features from a locked iPhone so the F.B.I. could guess the password. Eventually, a private consultant developed a way to hack into the phone without Apple's help, and sold the idea to the F.B.I.   Agents in the Trail Mix case also found a workaround. Like the San Bernardino case, the Trail Mix solutions were classified.   ''Please be advised that the tool itself is classified SECRET,'' an F.B.I. computer specialist from Quantico, Va., wrote in early 2003 while delivering an early version of the tool. ''Further, any indication that the tool is specifically software in nature is also classified.''   Exactly what the software was built to do is still not clear. But language in the documents suggests that it may have copied the digital keys, kept track of keystrokes to help the F.B.I. identify the passwords, or both.   In a Mafia case years earlier, agents sneaked into a Philadelphia office and attached a device to a computer that recorded every keystroke. That classified device helped agents break into an encrypted file. But until Trail Mix, such a tactic had never been tried using software as part of a wiretap, the documents show.   Cases like Operation Trail Mix and the San Bernardino shootings are examples of why many government officials say they need a new law to guarantee access to encrypted data. Going case-by-case, hack-by-hack is impractical, they say.   ''Individually tailored solutions have to be the exception and not the rule,'' Valerie Caproni, the F.B.I.'s top lawyer, told Congress in 2011.

"Chinese Curb Cyberattacks on U.S. Interests, Report Finds","WASHINGTON - Nine months after President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a broad crackdown on cyberespionage aimed at curbing the theft of intellectual property, the first detailed study of Chinese hacking has found a sharp drop-off in almost daily raids on Silicon Valley firms, military contractors and other commercial targets. But the study, conducted by the iSight intelligence unit of FireEye, a company that manages large network breaches, also concluded that the drop-off began a year before Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced their accord in the White House Rose Garden. In a conclusion that is largely echoed by American intelligence officials, the study said the change is part of Mr. Xi's broad effort to bring the Chinese military, which is considered one of the main sponsors of the attacks, further under his control. As a result, the same political forces that may be alleviating the theft of data from American companies are also responsible for Mr. Xi's stunningly swift crackdown on the Chinese media, bloggers and others who could challenge the Communist Party.  ""It's a mixed bag,"" said Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant, now part of FireEye, which first detailed the activities of a People's Liberation Army cyber-arm, called Unit 61398, that had been responsible for some of the most highly publicized thefts of American technology. ""We still see semiconductor companies and aerospace firms attacked."" But the daily barrage of attacks has diminished, which Mr. Mandia attributed to ""public pressure"" from, among others, the Justice Department's decision to indict five members of the P.L.A. unit about a year after its activities were exposed. Today, Unit 61398 appears to be largely out of business, its hackers dispersed to other military, private and intelligence units. Many China scholars and legal experts remain skeptical that the Chinese are deterred by American indictments, since the P.L.A. officers are unlikely to see the inside of an American courtroom. But John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said the report validated his strategy. ""The lesson is that when you figure out who has done this kind of theft, don't fear making it public,"" he said. ""This is a slow process, but we are beginning to make people realize that even in cyberspace, laws and norms are applicable."" Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi drew up their agreement narrowly. It covers intellectual property theft - Chinese cybercriminals have stolen everything from designs for the F-35 fighter jet to the design of gas distribution networks - but not ordinary espionage against government targets. So, for example, the administration has not publicly talked about penalizing China for the theft of personal data on roughly 22 million Americans, whose security-clearance information was taken from the Office of Personnel Management. In fact, the administration has never publicly blamed China for that theft, although the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., did talk about China's role once, before he was told by the administration not to refer to any specific country. As recently as last week, senior administration officials were in Beijing trying to flesh out the agreement between the two presidents. Participants say that among the points of discussion was how to set up a hotline through which the two countries can alert each other to malicious software they have detected in global networks, with the expectation that Chinese and American investigators would work to find its source. Establishing such norms of behavior is far more likely to be effective than attempting to negotiate a treaty, according to outside experts who have been trying to devise the cyberequivalent of arms-control agreements. ""Treaties are not verifiable in the cyberarena,"" said Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor known for his studies of how nations use ""soft power,"" who in recent years has turned to the problem of regulating activity in cyberspace. ""The same code can be benign or a weapon depending on the user's intent,"" he said. For example, a six-digit code that unlocks a cellphone is a protection for the user - and a potential weapon for a hacker. ""So instead of focusing on the weapons, you have to focus on targets,"" Mr. Nye said. ""You start by saying that you don't target something that has a clearly civilian use, like a power grid."" Mr. Nye and Michael Chertoff, the secretary of Homeland Security during the Bush administration, who now runs a private firm that is deeply involved in cybersecurity, were among the lead authors of a report to be published on Tuesday by the Global Commission on Internet Governance that will describe those norms to the United Nations and other groups. Just how fundamentally the Chinese are changing is a matter of debate. There is some evidence, American intelligence officials say, that while the People's Liberation Army is not stealing as much on behalf of Chinese state-owned firms, much of the hacking activity has been shifted to the intelligence agencies, which can make the case that they are stealing national security secrets, not commercial information. Often, the difference is blurry, especially when the target is, say, the design of a satellite or a ship. Even after Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced their agreement last fall, American officials have said they have discovered malware in power grids, cellphone networks and other purely civilian targets. But it is unclear whether that malicious software is intended to collect information about users, shut the system down or both. The FireEye study concluded that as early as 2014, around the time of the indictment of the P.L.A.'s officers and hackers, the Chinese government had already been modifying its approach to cyberoperations. The study of 72 Chinese hacking groups showed a sharp drop-off in the volume of attacks. But as recently as March, FireEye saw efforts to obtain information on American military projects by stealing access credentials to a contractor, and there has been continual theft of personal information from health care providers. The Chinese hacking groups have also focused on non-American targets, including Russia, South Korea and Vietnam, and have sometimes aimed at targets related to the disputes over Chinese claims in the South China Sea. The report concludes that Chinese attacks have decreased in volume, but increased in sophistication. The result is that Chinese hackers are now acting more like Russian hackers: They pick their targets more carefully, and cover their tracks. ""We see a threat that is less voluminous but more focused, calculated, and still successful in compromising corporate networks,"" the report said.

Chinese Businessman Sentenced to Prison for Hacking U.S. Contractors,"LOS ANGELES - A Chinese businessman who pleaded guilty in March to conspiring to hack the computer networks of the Boeing Company and other major American military contractors was sentenced on Wednesday to nearly four years in prison, prosecutors said.  The businessman, Su Bin, 51, was charged with taking part in a scheme by Chinese military officers to obtain sensitive United States military information over several years. In addition to the 46-month prison term, a judge in the United States District Court in Los Angeles also ordered Mr. Su to pay a fine of $10,000. ""Su Bin's sentence is a just punishment for his admitted role in a conspiracy with hackers from the People's Liberation Army Air Force to illegally access and steal sensitive U.S. military information,"" John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement. ""Su assisted the Chinese military hackers in their efforts to illegally access and steal designs for cutting-edge military aircraft that are indispensable to our national defense,"" the statement said. In an indictment, prosecutors said Mr. Su traveled to the United States at least 10 times from 2008 to 2014 and worked to steal the data with two unidentified co-conspirators based in China. The three conspirators were accused of stealing plans related to the Boeing C-17 military transport plane and the Boeing F-22 and Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, and attempting to sell them to Chinese companies. According to prosecutors, in pleading guilty, Mr. Su admitted sending emails to his co-conspirators telling them which people, companies and technologies to target with their hacking, and translating the stolen material from English to Chinese. Mr. Su admitted taking part in the crime for financial gain, prosecutors said. The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any involvement in hacking. Mr. Su was arrested in Canada in 2014 and ultimately consented to extradition to the United States.  "
Trying to Smoke Out the Players in the Hacking of the D.N.C.,"WASHINGTON - American intelligence agencies believe that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, but many questions remain about how the documents made their way to WikiLeaks, which released them.  Before the WikiLeaks release, a large sampling was published by several news organizations and a hacker called Guccifer 2.0, who investigators now believe was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service. American intelligence agencies say the earlier leaks from Guccifer and the WikiLeaks material have the same bits of code and telltale metadata traced to previous intrusions attributed to the G.R.U. or the F.S.B., another Russian spy agency. However, Julian Assange, the editor of WikiLeaks, makes a distinction between the Democratic National Committee material he released and the earlier releases by Guccifer and others, saying there is no proof that the Russians gave him the documents. In recent weeks, Mr. Assange has threatened to take his revelations to a new level. In August, some of the National Security Agency's source code for breaking into foreign computer systems - the holy grail of the N.S.A.'s Tailored Access Operations unit - was revealed on a website, with the announcement of an auction for the remainder of it. Mr. Assange then declared he would soon publish the rest on WikiLeaks free. So far he has not. Most experts say the code - the digital equivalent of codes for the release of weapons - could have come only from one of two sources: another N.S.A. insider like Edward J. Snowden or, more likely, an external computer server that the N.S.A.'s break-in artists used in the course of an operation. If they had left their digital tool kit on that server, and the Russians or another power was already inside that network, the code would have been stolen. The N.S.A. has not said whether the code released was real or where it came from. This week, suspicions of Russian tampering took a new turn with reports that earlier this summer, the F.B.I. warned election officials in Arizona about Russian hackers targeting voter-registration systems there. The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, asked the F.B.I. to investigate, writing to the director, James B. Comey, that the threat of Russian interference ""is more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results."" The administration has stopped short of publicly accusing the Russian government of engineering the theft of the Democratic National Committee emails, presumably to buy time for President Obama to make a decision. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said last month that American spy agencies were not yet prepared to publicly identify a culprit. David E. Sanger contributed reporting.Related Articles   "
"As Artificial Intelligence Evolves, So Does Its Criminal Potential","Imagine receiving a phone call from your aging mother seeking your help because she has forgotten her banking password. Except it's not your mother. The voice on the other end of the phone call just sounds deceptively like her.    It is actually a computer-synthesized voice, a tour-de-force of artificial intelligence technology that has been crafted to make it possible for someone to masquerade via the telephone.    Such a situation is still science fiction -- but just barely. It is also the future of crime.   The software components necessary to make such masking technology widely accessible are advancing rapidly. Recently, for example, DeepMind, the Alphabet subsidiary known for a program that has bested some of the top human players in the board game Go, announced that it had designed a program that ''mimics any human voice and which sounds more natural than the best existing text-to-speech systems, reducing the gap with human performance by over 50 percent.''   The irony, of course, is that this year the computer security industry, with $75 billion in annual revenue, has started to talk about how machine learning and pattern recognition techniques will improve the woeful state of computer security.   But there is a downside.   ''The thing people don't get is that cybercrime is becoming automated and it is scaling exponentially,'' said Marc Goodman, a law enforcement agency adviser and the author of ''Future Crimes.'' He added, ''This is not about Matthew Broderick hacking from his basement,'' a reference to the 1983 movie ''War Games.''   The alarm about malevolent use of advanced artificial intelligence technologies was sounded earlier this year by James R. Clapper, the director of National Intelligence. In his annual review of security, Mr. Clapper underscored the point that while A.I. systems would make some things easier, they would also expand the vulnerabilities of the online world.   The growing sophistication of computer criminals can be seen in the evolution of attack tools like the widely used malicious program known as Blackshades, according to Mr. Goodman. The author of the program, a Swedish national, was convicted last year in the United States.   The system, which was sold widely in the computer underground, functioned as a ''criminal franchise in a box,'' Mr. Goodman said. It allowed users without technical skills to deploy computer ransomware or perform video or audio eavesdropping with a mouse click.   The next generation of these tools will add machine learning capabilities that have been pioneered by artificial intelligence researchers to improve the quality of machine vision, speech understanding, speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Some computer security researchers believe that digital criminals have been experimenting with the use of A.I. technologies for more than half a decade.   That can be seen in efforts to subvert the internet's omnipresent Captcha -- Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart -- the challenge-and-response puzzle invented in 2003 by Carnegie Mellon University researchers to block automated programs from stealing online accounts.   Both ''white hat'' artificial intelligence researchers and ''black hat'' criminals have been deploying machine vision software to subvert Captchas for more than half a decade, said Stefan Savage, a computer security researcher at the University of California, San Diego.   ''If you don't change your Captcha for two years, you will be owned by some machine vision algorithm,'' he said.   Surprisingly, one thing that has slowed the development of malicious A.I. has been the ready availability of either low-cost or free human labor. For example, some cybercriminals have farmed out Captcha-breaking schemes to electronic sweatshops where humans are used to decode the puzzles for a tiny fee.   Even more inventive computer crooks have used online pornography as a reward for human web surfers who break the Captcha, Mr. Goodman said. Free labor is a commodity that A.I. software won't be able to compete with any time soon.   So what's next?   Criminals, for starters, can piggyback on new tech developments. Voice-recognition technology like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana are now used extensively to interact with computers. And Amazon's Echo voice-controlled speaker and Facebook's Messenger chatbot platform are rapidly becoming conduits for online commerce and customer support. As is often the case, whenever a communication advancement like voice recognition starts to go mainstream, criminals looking to take advantage of it aren't far behind.   ''I would argue that companies that offer customer support via chatbots are unwittingly making themselves liable to social engineering,'' said Brian Krebs, an investigative reporter who publishes at krebsonsecurity.com.   Social engineering, which refers to the practice of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging information, is widely seen as the weakest link in the computer security chain. Cybercriminals already exploit the best qualities in humans -- trust and willingness to help others -- to steal and spy. The ability to create artificial intelligence avatars that can fool people online will only make the problem worse.   This can already be seen in efforts by state governments and political campaigns who are using chatbot technology widely for political propaganda.   Researchers have coined the term ''computational propaganda'' to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.   In a recent research paper, Philip N. Howard, a sociologist at the Oxford Internet Institute, and Bence Kollanyi, a researcher at Corvinus University of Budapest, described how political chatbots had a ''small but strategic role'' in shaping the online conversation during the run-up to the ''Brexit'' referendum.   It is only a matter of time before such software is put to criminal use.   ''There's a lot of cleverness in designing social engineering attacks, but as far as I know, nobody has yet started using machine learning to find the highest quality suckers,'' said Mark Seiden, an independent computer security specialist. He paused and added, ''I should have replied: 'I'm sorry, Dave, I can't answer that question right now.'''     "
Judge Rules for Apple in New York iPhone Case,"A federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government's request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company's pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases. The ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York's Eastern District, is the first time that the government's legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.     Judge Orenstein, in his 50-page ruling on Monday, took particular aim at a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act that underlies many government requests for extracting data from tech companies. The All Writs Act broadly says that courts can require actions to comply with their orders when not covered by existing law. Judge Orenstein said the government was inflating its authority by using the All Writs Act to force Apple to extract data from an iPhone seized in connection with a drug case.   The government's view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote.   The All Writs Act is also being invoked in the fight over an iPhone in the San Bernardino shooting, which has publicly pitted Apple against the government. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has refused to comply with a federal court order to help break into the phone, saying that he needs to protect the data of all customers. That has set off a far-reaching debate over privacy and security.   Both the F.B.I. and Apple have called for Congress to step in to help settle the question of when law enforcement should get access to citizens' private data. On Tuesday, Apple's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, will testify about balancing privacy and safety before the House Judiciary Committee.   ''It's important that a judge for the first time recognizes the All Writs Act doesn't provide the lawful authority the government has been claiming in these cases,'' said Esha Bhandari, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., which supports Apple's position. ''It demonstrates that when the government's arguments are put to the test, a federal court has decided they were not actually right.''   In a statement on Monday in response to Judge Orenstein's ruling, the Justice Department said it would ask the judge to review the decision. Apple had previously agreed to help open up the iPhone in the drug case, and has complied with past All Writs Act orders, the Justice Department said.   ''This phone may contain evidence that will assist us in an active criminal investigation, and we will continue to use the judicial system in our attempt to obtain it,'' the Justice Department said.   An Apple senior executive said Monday's ruling makes clear that helping to open an iPhone is a constitutional issue that should be taken up by Congress.   Judge Orenstein's ruling stands out because the courts have largely been absent on the major questions of electronic surveillance and privacy of our day. While judges around the country have signed at least 70 orders at the request of the government compelling Apple to access data on phones, this was the first time that a judge and Apple have pushed back.   The legal back and forth between Judge Orenstein, the Justice Department and Apple began last October, when federal prosecutors applied for a court order to force Apple to unlock an iPhone 5s seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration in a 2014 drug case, according to court documents.   After federal prosecutors requested the order, Judge Orenstein argued in an 11-page memo last October that prosecutors were misusing the All Writs Act. The judge asked Apple to weigh in, and the company filed a brief that same month. In addition to agreeing with the judge, the company also said the request could create an undue burden and threatened to ''substantially tarnish the Apple brand.''   ''This reputational harm could have a longer-term economic impact beyond the mere cost of performing the single extraction at issue,'' Apple said in a brief.   The government then called Apple's decision to side with the judge a ''stunning reversal.'' Saritha Komatireddy, a Brooklyn federal prosecutor, said the government's application in this case ''was just a simple routine request for assistance in carrying out a valid search warrant issued by a federal court, as Apple has done so many times before.''   During the case, Judge Orenstein said he found it puzzling that Apple had not previously resisted the use of the All Writs Act, including in other cases where Apple had complied with the order.   ''You have had apparently 70 prior instances where you have not taken the steps available to you,'' Judge Orenstein said to Apple's lawyers during a hearing.   Ultimately, Judge Orenstein argued that the government couldn't use the All Writs Act to ask Apple to help extract information from a device just because a different law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or Calea, addresses the issue and does not include an ''information services'' company like Apple. Congress has been debating whether to amend Calea to include tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Alphabet's Google.   Still, the decision is not binding for the San Bernardino case, said Eric A. Berg, a litigation lawyer and special counsel with Foley & Lardner, who is a former Justice Department lawyer.   ''From a technical, legal standpoint, it doesn't really have much of an effect in the California districts,'' Mr. Berg said. But ''if you start with public opinion, this is going to be viewed as a victory for the privacy lobby and a defeat for the government in that battle over privacy.''     "
F.B.I. Director Suggests Bill for an iPhone Hacking Topped $1.3 Million,"WASHINGTON -- The director of the F.B.I. suggested Thursday that his agency paid at least $1.3 million to an undisclosed group to help hack into the encrypted iPhone used by an attacker in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. At a technology conference in London, a moderator asked James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. chief, how much bureau officials had to pay the undisclosed outside group to demonstrate how to bypass the phone's encryption.     ''A lot,'' Mr. Comey said, as audience members at the Aspen Institute event laughed.   He continued: ''Let's see, more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.''   The F.B.I. had been unwilling to say anything at all until Thursday about how much it paid for what has become one of the world's most publicized hacking jobs, so Mr. Comey's cryptic comments about his own wages and the bounty quickly sent listeners scurrying in search of their calculators.   The F.B.I. director makes about $185,100 a year -- so Mr. Comey stands to earn at least $1.35 million at that base rate of pay for the remainder of his 10-year term.   The F.B.I. declined to confirm or deny Thursday whether the bureau had in fact paid at least $1.3 million for the hacking, and it declined to elaborate on Mr. Comey's suggestive remarks.   But that price tag, if confirmed, appears in line with what other companies have offered for identifying iOS vulnerabilities.   Zerodium, a security firm in Washington that collects and then sells such bugs, said last fall that it would pay $1 million for weaknesses in Apple's iOS 9 operating system. Hackers eventually claimed that bounty. The iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman ran iOS 9.   ''A number of factors go into pricing these bounties,'' said Alex Rice, the co-founder of the security start-up HackerOne CTO, who also started Facebook's bug bounty program. Mr. Rice said that the highest premiums were paid when the buyer didn't intend to disclose the flaw to a party that could fix it.   ''The cost of keeping a flaw secret is high,'' Mr. Rice said. He added that buyers like Zerodium's customers and the government might not work to fix problems.   When companies run bug bounty programs, they may pay about $100,000 to hackers that show them system vulnerabilities that must be fixed. ''When you sell at a high price, you have to be O.K. with the possibility that the person you sold the flaw to could do something bad with it,'' Mr. Rice said.   While Mr. Comey's remarks appeared to address the lingering mystery of how much the F.B.I. paid to get into the San Bernardino phone, he said nothing that would indicate the actual identity of the outside group behind the hacking. Some media reports have named an Israeli software company that might have helped the F.B.I., but numerous law enforcement officials have said that company was not involved.   After an intense courtroom fight in Southern California, the F.B.I. disclosed three weeks ago that it had managed to get access to the data inside an iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook, one of the attackers in the San Bernardino rampage, which killed 14 people, by paying the outside group.   The Justice Department had gone to court to try to force Apple to develop a new operating system to allow access into the encrypted phone, setting off an intense national debate about privacy versus national security. But it withdrew its case after the outside party came to the F.B.I. and demonstrated a way around the phone's internal defenses, which would have destroyed the data inside after 10 failed password attempts and would have meant longer and longer intervals in between guesses.   With those mechanisms disabled, the F.B.I. was able to use what is called a brute force attack -- using computers to guess vast numbers of password combinations at once -- in order to get inside the phone.   But the Justice Department is still trying to force Apple in court to help unlock encrypted phones in Brooklyn, Boston and elsewhere.     "
How Does My Browser Recognize Malware?; Tech Tip,"Q. How does my web browser know that a site could be malicious? A. Most modern browsers now include built-in phishing and malware protection to help shield your computer from online attacks. The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer browsers, Mozilla Firefox and the Opera browser are among those with such security features.  To recognize potentially dangerous pages, the browser typically consults a blacklist of sites that have been reported to contain phishing pages or be loaded with infectious and malicious software. If you visit a site on the blacklist, the browser displays a warning as it blocks the page. To keep up with evolving threats, your browser contacts its home server regularly when you are online to download an updated list of suspected malicious sites. The Chrome browser updates itself this way, and Google's software robots constantly comb the web looking for new and revised websites. Mozilla uses Google's so-called Safe Browsing technology and Unwanted Software policy in Firefox to block sites with various levels of bad intentions. Microsoft's browsers use the SmartScreen filter to analyze pages, block blacklisted sites and check downloaded files for potential security issues. If you are not sure if the phishing and malware blockers are turned on, check your browser's settings or preferences area. Website owners who feel that their sites have been unfairly blacklisted can use Google's Report Incorrect Phishing Warning form or request a review from the nonprofit StopBadware.org group in hopes of passing inspection; the group also has online advice for webmasters of hacked sites. Third-party security programs like those offered by Sophos, Malwarebytes and other companies provide additional protection for your computer or device beyond what the browser can block.

U.S. Uncovers More Victims in Hacking,"A federal prosecutor in Manhattan said on Friday that investigators were continuing to learn of possible new victims in the case of a Bahamian man accused of hacking into the email accounts of celebrities and others to obtain and sell stolen scripts of unreleased movies, sexually explicit videos and personal information like passport and Social Security numbers.  The prosecutor's comment came at a status conference in the case of Alonzo Knowles, who is in his early 20s and is being held without bond while pending trial in Federal District Court on charges of identity theft and criminal copyright infringement.    The prosecutor, Kristy J. Greenberg, also told the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, that she and Mr. Knowles's lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, were discussing a possible plea bargain to determine whether ''there is a possibility of a resolution to the case.''   The charges, announced in December, about a year after hackers stole confidential information from Sony Pictures Entertainment and released it online, highlighted concerns about Internet security in the entertainment industry and elsewhere. Mr. Knowles claimed he had ''exclusive content'' that was ''worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' a federal complaint says.   Ms. Greenberg said the authorities had been in the process of obtaining Mr. Knowles's email accounts from Internet providers when the names of other potential victims turned up.   ''The contents of those emails are highly relevant to the case,'' she said, adding that they contained information about how Mr. Knowles ''engaged in hacking, mentions particular victims who he did in fact hack and how he was going about it.''   The emails also contained evidence of purchases he made ''using financial information of new victims that we hadn't known about,'' Ms. Greenberg said.   Judge Engelmayer asked Ms. Greenberg, ''You are following leads that are suggested by some of the material you are still reviewing?'' Ms. Greenberg said that was correct.   Mr. Kaminsky and a spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, did not comment after the hearing.     "
"Putin, Trump and Our Election","Some foreign leaders settle for stealing billions of dollars. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, may have wanted to steal something even more valuable: an American presidential election. As our election takes a turn that could be drawn from a Cold War spy novel (except it would be too implausible), Putin has an obvious favorite in the race: Donald Trump. ''It's crystal clear to me'' that Putin favors Trump, says Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was ambassador to Russia until 2014. ''If I were Putin, I would rather deal with Trump, too, given the things he has said about foreign policy.''    Look, Democratic Party leaders exchanged inappropriate emails showing bias for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, and a hacker's disclosure has properly triggered a ruckus. But that scandal pales beside an effort apparently by a foreign dictatorship to disrupt an American presidential election.    It also seems scandalous to me that Trump on Wednesday effectively invited Russia to hack into Clinton's computers for deleted emails from when she was secretary of state, saying at a press conference, ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.''   Yes, Trump is entertaining. But increasingly, the antonym of ''gravitas'' is ''Trump.'' Clinton could have responded by inviting Russia to hack into Trump's computers and release his tax returns; she didn't because the hack would be illegal and her plea would be unpresidential.   In his press conference, Trump also cast doubt on the idea that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee's computers. ''It's probably not Russia,'' he said, suggesting it might be China, or ''some guy with a 200 I.Q.''   So let's go through the evidence.   America's intelligence agencies have assessed with ''high confidence'' that Russia's government was behind the hack, and private security companies have identified two Russian teams of hackers that were inside D.N.C. computers. One team is called Cozy Bear and is linked to the F.S.B., the successor to the K.G.B., and another is called Fancy Bear and is linked to the G.R.U., or Russian military intelligence. Cyber experts are very familiar with both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.   The next question is whether Russia was also behind the release of the stolen emails to WikiLeaks. Someone using the name Guccifer 2.0 claimed to be behind the hack, denied Russian involvement and claimed to be Romanian -- but wrote Romanian badly. ThreatConnect, a private security firm, issued a meticulous report showing that Guccifer used a Russia-based VPN (virtual private network) service and displayed other ''heavy traces of Russian activity.''   ''Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian propaganda effort,'' ThreatConnect concluded.   After talking to experts, I have the sense that there's considerable confidence that Russia is the culprit, but more doubt about whether Putin gave the order and about whether the aim was to benefit Trump or simply to create havoc.   ''I think the most likely explanation is that someone in Russian intelligence, probably very high up, decided to help Donald Trump,'' said Benjamin Wittes, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, but he added that there's no solid evidence for this.   One reason for caution is that history shows that ''intelligence community'' is sometimes an oxymoron. In the 1980s, the United States accused Russia of conducting chemical warfare in Southeast Asia, citing ''yellow rain'' in jungles there. Years later, it turned out that this ''yellow rain'' may have actually been bee excrement.   Democrats should be particularly wary of hinting that Trump is some sort of conscious pawn of the Russians, or is controlled by Moscow through financial investments. It's true that his son Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that ''we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' But do you really think that if Trump were an agent he would have exaggerated his ties, as he did last year, saying of Putin, ''I got to know him very well''? In fact, Trump acknowledged Wednesday, he has never even met Putin.   The reason Moscow favors Trump isn't some conspiracy. It's simply that Putin dislikes Clinton, while Trump's combination of international ignorance and catastrophic policies would benefit Putin. In particular, Trump's public doubts about NATO renounce more than half a century of bipartisan orthodoxy on how to deal with Russia, and undermine the Western alliance that checks Putin.   One nightmare of security specialists is Russia provoking unrest among ethnic Russians in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania and then using rioting as an excuse to intervene. NATO members would be obliged to respond, but frankly it's not clear that they would -- and Trump's loose rhetoric increases the risk of paralysis and a collapse of the alliance.   In that sense, Trump poses a national security risk to the West, and that's reason enough Putin would be thrilled to see him elected president.

Daily Report: Vote Hacking,"With just four days to go till Election Day, the polls for the presidential race have tightened. Democrats and Republicans alike are worried about the outcome.  But there are other worries, too, among them whether hackers are likely to disrupt the voting process, making an already circuslike campaign season even more of a three-ring spectacle.    David Sanger, national security correspondent for The New York Times, has written on the concerns of federal and state officials going into the election, in particular focusing on five possible ways hackers may be looking to interfere with the election.   Those methods include hackers penetrating voter registration rolls and making their own alterations; taking down websites with an attack of so much data that voters cannot get information about their polling places, as well as directly making mischief with voting machines.   Some of this may seem paranoid, but it has already been a strange few months of online security snafus related to the election.   Last month, the Obama administration alleged the Russian government was trying to influence the election by stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee. Among the email accounts hacked was that of John D. Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton.   So, an overabundance of caution? Perhaps. But this year, maybe it's not too much.     "
"Congress Moves to Curb Ticket Scalping, Banning Bots Used Online","With public attention focused on the scourge of online ticket scalping, Congress has passed a bill outlawing bots, or computer programs that let users scoop up the best tickets and resell them at inflated prices. But will this law be enough to tame an $8 billion secondary ticket market that is increasingly global? On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, or BOTS Act, with bipartisan support, following the bill's passage a week ago in the Senate. It will now go to the White House for President Obama's signature.  The bill accomplishes what advocates like Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of ""Hamilton,"" have long pushed for. It would make it illegal to circumvent the security measures of ticketing websites, which bots often do, and would give enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commission. Critics say bots feed a high-priced resale market that pushes tickets out of reach of ordinary consumers, particularly for hot events like ""Hamilton."" Ticketmaster has estimated that bots have been used to buy 60 percent of the most desirable tickets to many shows. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, who was a sponsor of the bill and campaigned for its passage with Mr. Miranda and others, cheered the action by the House. ""With this soon-to-be-new law that will eliminate 'bots' and slap hackers with a hefty fine, we can now ensure those who want to attend shows in the future will not have to pay outrageous, unfair prices,"" Mr. Schumer said in a statement. Yet in the trenches of the music industry, there is doubt about how much impact the act will have. The world of bots is shadowy and little understood, with much of the software being developed and even operated overseas, complicating enforcement. And there is an enormous incentive for scalping, which is legal and now largely integrated into the mainstream concert business through sites like StubHub and even Ticketmaster. ""There is only one way to stop the scalping industry, and that's to make it illegal,"" said Seth Hurwitz, an independent concert promoter and the owner of the 9:30 Club in Washington. ""Anything else is just Whac-a-Mole, and grandstanding by politicians."" The passage of the BOTS Act is the result of years of frustration among members of the public as well as artists and producers irritated by an industry that profits from their work. In an interview, Jeffrey Seller, the lead producer of ""Hamilton,"" called scalping ""a usurious, parasitic business that only serves to create a new profit center between the artist and the consumer."" This year, an investigation by the New York State attorney general found abuses like a single scalper buying more than 1,000 tickets in under a minute for a U2 concert at Madison Square Garden. Ticket bots are illegal in New York, and last month Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a law increasing penalties for their use. In Britain and Europe, there has been significant political momentum to reform ticketing laws. The British government commissioned a major report on the scalping industry there, and lawmakers in Italy are considering proposals to curtail ticket reselling after reports that the head of the Italian branch of Live Nation, the global concert company, was funneling tickets directly to the secondary market. In the United States, that progress has been much slower. While few spoke against the BOTS Act - the National Association of Ticket Brokers, which bars bots among its members, welcomed the bill - ticket scalping has become a standard part of the entertainment economy, and services like StubHub are often welcomed by fans for their convenience. Economists frequently endorse secondary markets as a true demonstration of supply and demand. Supporters of the BOTS Act believe it could aid law enforcement in ways that were unavailable before. In 2010, federal prosecutors charged a group of men operating as Wiseguy Tickets with fraud for evading online ticketing safeguards in acquiring more than a million tickets that were resold for $25 million in profit. But the case hinged on whether the men had violated federal laws or merely run afoul of TicketMaster's terms of service, and the Wiseguy operators received only probation. The BOTS Act would make it illegal to bypass an online security system like TicketMaster's. ""Laws don't stop every crime, but the fact that there are new civil penalties for circumventing the technology that tries to keep tickets in the hands of fans will create a disincentive,"" said Daryl P. Friedman, the chief advocacy and industry relations officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the organization behind the Grammy Awards, which lobbied for the bill. Yet even the BOTS Act's biggest supporters acknowledge that as much as they welcome the proposed law, it alone will not end the problems of online ticket scalping. ""Is this the exact bill I would write? No. Is it imperfect? Of course,"" said Mr. Seller, the ""Hamilton"" producer. ""Is it better than nothing? You bet.""

Apple Showdown Heightens Challenge of Encrypted Data,"Peter J. Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, is a co-author of ''Securities Crimes (2d edition).'' Twitter: @peterjhenning The clash between the Justice Department and Apple over the court order requiring the company to weaken the security functions on the iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings is only the latest instance of the government's effort to deal with encrypted data. The real challenge is how the courts will apply constitutional protections drafted in the 18th century to deal with the rapidly changing world of digital technology.    The Fourth Amendment grants a measure of privacy for ''persons, houses, papers, and effects'' from ''unreasonable searches and seizures'' while requiring that warrants be issued based only on probable cause. But those protections do not go far in preventing the government from gaining access to a person's digital information in an investigation because probable cause is a low standard for getting a warrant.    Moreover, Apple's resistance to the order, issued under a 1789 law called the All Writs Act, is not based on the Constitution, because there is no question that the government has a sound basis to search for evidence that might be on the iPhone about planning for the attack in December.   A letter issued last week by Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, announcing the decision not to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation gain access to the data makes no mention of the Constitution. Instead, it talks more generally about the need to protect personal privacy and the security of customer information. As The New York Times pointed out, there may be a significant global business advantage to Apple's stance that has little to do with what the law provides.   A much greater stumbling block for the government in obtaining encrypted data is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which can be used to thwart efforts to get passwords required to unlock encrypted files. In the world of cryptology, a secret code known only to the user usually means that the information could be kept away from the government unless there is a means to compel the person to reveal it.   The Fifth Amendment provides that an individual cannot be forced to be ''a witness against himself,'' which generally means the government cannot force someone to disclose information that can be used to convict that person. But whether it lets a person shield electronic files is a more complicated issue.   The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination came up last year in an insider trading case, and it illustrates how the courts have struggled to adapt the Fifth Amendment to gaining access to digital information.   In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Huang, two defendants were accused of gathering confidential information from their employer, Capital One, about credit card usage at retailers to help identify which companies to buy shares. The bank provided smartphones to its employees, and each had a personal passcode known only to the user. The S.E.C. suspected that the defendants' phones, which they returned to Capital One after resigning, contained information that would be helpful to proving the case, so it asked for a court order directing them to reveal their codes so the files could be opened.   The defendants asserted the Fifth Amendment, claiming that revealing the codes could lead to potentially incriminating evidence useful in a criminal case because insider trading violations can be prosecuted by the Justice Department.   The problem is figuring out how far the privilege against self-incrimination goes in protecting passwords that can open encrypted files.   Individuals cannot be forced to reveal the contents of their own mind, but they can be required to turn over records that could reflect their thoughts. The Supreme Court held in Fisher v. United States that the content of documents -- even if they are incriminating -- is not protected by the Fifth Amendment.   But the court then noted that the act of turning over the records, called the ''act of production,'' could convey information about their existence, possession and authenticity, and therefore that could be the basis for asserting the privilege against self-incrimination.   As if that's not confusing enough, the Supreme Court in the Fisher case then explained that the government could still force an individual to turn over documents if any information conveyed by the act of production was a ''foregone conclusion,'' meaning the government learned little new from turning them over.   The nub of the issue is this: Does turning over a password to open up encrypted files reveal new information from the person's mind, or is it just like handing over a folder with documents the government already knows exists and is at your house?   Courts love to use metaphors (or perhaps similes) to illustrate their analysis, even though these rarely have much explanatory power. Here is one Justice John Paul Stevens used in a dissenting opinion in Doe v. United States to explain how the Fifth Amendment operates for producing information: ''He may in some cases be forced to surrender a key to a strongbox containing incriminating documents, but I do not believe he can be compelled to reveal the combination to his wall safe.''   This is where the challenge of digital information makes the Fifth Amendment analysis more difficult. A password is a bit like a key, because it simply opens up files contained in the electronic version of a file cabinet. But it is also similar to the combination to a safe, such as the use of numbers in a specific sequence in the code.   Figuring out which one it is has divided the courts. In the Huang case, the district judge denied the request to reveal the passwords, finding that ''as the S.E.C is not seeking business records but defendants' personal thought processes, defendants may properly invoke their Fifth Amendment right.''   It turned out that denying access to the smartphones did not affect the case, as one defendant settled and a jury found the other engaged in insider trading.   In an earlier case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta reached a similar conclusion when the Justice Department issued a grand jury subpoena requiring the production of unencrypted hard drives from a computer suspected of containing child pornography. The appeals court found that the act of decryption would be testimonial, and therefore subject to the Fifth Amendment.   Other courts have reached the exact opposite conclusion regarding the availability of the Fifth Amendment to maintain the encryption of electronic records. The Federal District Court in Denver, in United States v. Fricosu, found that the privilege against self-incrimination did not prevent ordering an individual to decrypt the hard drive on a laptop computer. The case is similar to the one involving Apple because the court issued the order under the All Writs Act to compel assistance in furthering an investigation of possible wrongdoing.   In Commonwealth v. Gelfgatt, the Supreme Judicial Court in Massachusetts, the state's highest court, found that compelling a lawyer to decrypt files related to a mortgage fraud scheme did not fall within the privilege against self-incrimination. The court noted that the defendant had admitted to installing the encryption program on his computers, so under the foregone conclusion analysis, it would not violate his rights to make him enter the password to decrypt them.   Obtaining access to electronic files, especially emails and messages, can be crucial in white-collar crime cases. Proving a violation usually revolves around establishing a defendant's knowledge and intent, so there is often no better proof than contemporaneous communications and documents created around the time of the transaction. If encryption keeps that kind of information away from investigators, it will make proving violations that much more difficult.   Unlike an individual, companies cannot use the Fifth Amendment to encrypt their files to keep them away from the government because that constitutional protection does not apply to organizations. With the Justice Department's recent emphasis on identifying individuals involved in corporate misconduct as the primary measure of cooperation, getting to the personal data of employees can be crucial to proving a case, especially if companies encourage them to encrypt files as a security measure.   It may be up to the Supreme Court to decide whether the privilege against self-incrimination protects individuals from having to turn over passwords to help the government obtain evidence that may well end up convicting them.   The digital age is making it much more difficult to figure out how far the Constitution should go in dealing with forms of information that were largely unknown a generation ago, much less when the Fifth Amendment was adopted.

"U.S. Opens 2nd iPhone, by Entering the Keycode","WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said Friday night that it had gained access on its own to a locked iPhone used by a Brooklyn drug dealer, the second time in less than a month that it had unlocked such a device after initially insisting it could do so only with Apple's help. In a short letter to a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors said that an unidentified person had given the phone's passcode to investigators. The Brooklyn phone had become the latest battleground in the fight between Apple and the Justice Department over issues of privacy and security.     Last month, in a higher-profile case that set off a national debate, prosecutors dropped their demand that Apple develop software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage in December. The F.B.I. unlocked that phone after paying an outside party to demonstrate how to do so.   In the Brooklyn case, the drug dealer's phone was running an older operating system that lacks the encryption features of the San Bernardino phone, so unlocking that device would involve much less technical sophistication even without the passcode.   Apple had voluntarily helped prosecutors unlock phones in some 70 earlier cases involving phones with the older operating systems, but it changed its stance last fall and began challenging the Justice Department's legal authority to use a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act to force its technical assistance in such cases.   Prosecutors had said for months that they needed Apple to provide what amounted to a technical passkey to the Brooklyn phone because the owner, a confessed methamphetamine dealer named Jun Feng, claimed to have forgotten the passcode.   That changed on Thursday evening, when someone gave the government the passcode, prosecutors said in the letter to the court. Officials would not say whether it was Mr. Feng or someone close to him who provided the passcode.   ''Because we now have access to the data we sought, we notified the court of this recent development and have withdrawn our request for assistance,'' said Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman. ''This is an ongoing investigation and therefore we are not revealing the identity of the individual.''   A judge sided with Apple in the Brooklyn fight in February, issuing a stinging 50-page ruling that said prosecutors had overstepped their legal authority. The Justice Department had been seeking to overturn that ruling and force Apple's cooperation, but that now becomes a moot issue.   Apple, which declined to comment on Friday, has raised similar objections to unlocking iPhones in a Boston case and in at least several dozen others elsewhere, most of which are under court seal.   Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has supported Apple in the recent encryption fights, said that the latest development in Brooklyn was ''very welcome news.''   ''This is a debate that should be had in Congress before asking the courts to weigh in,'' he said. ''That will be better for everyone's digital security.''   In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. was able to get into the phone after a fierce court fight that stretched for two months and drew international attention. The bureau's director, James B. Comey, indicated this week that the group that demonstrated how to unlock the phone was paid at least $1.3 million.     "
A Tug of War Over Data Security Intensifies in the Nation's Capital,"WASHINGTON -- Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption. In a string of meetings with members of Congress, Mr. Vance told central lawmakers that encryption needed to be diminished during criminal investigations. During a 45-minute session with Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Vance said his office had 230 iPhones that might contain crucial information for cases but were useless because Apple refused to help the police break the encryption on the devices.    ''I wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,'' Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.   A day after Mr. Vance was on Capitol Hill, tech executives including Kent Walker, the general counsel of Google, and Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, also met with lawmakers -- but with a very different message on encryption. Tech executives at the meetings said they were concerned about any laws that would force companies to weaken the security of their technology, according to news officials representing these companies.    This kind of behind-the-scenes lobbying has become de rigueur in Washington as the battle over encryption shifts to Capitol Hill. It is the next phase of a bitter divide that spilled into public view this year when Apple refused to comply with a court order to help bypass security functions on an encrypted iPhone used by an attacker in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting last year. Doing so would have let the F.B.I. gain access to the phone. That case ended after the F.B.I. found an alternative way into the device.   Yet the standoff between the United States government and Silicon Valley tech companies continues -- and the flurry of activity around the issue is broadening. Last month, a Senate draft encryption bill, written by Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, rallied the attention of both sides. The bill would require tech companies to give access to encrypted data with court orders.   Law enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.   ''This is an escalating fight,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. ''It's become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.''   Law enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.   ''There's no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,'' said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.   Facebook, Google and Microsoft declined to comment on their lobbying activity. An Apple spokesman said the company has met regularly with members of Congress on encryption and other issues.   The amount of lobbying on the encryption bill is unusual at this early stage of a bill's life, showing the stakes involved. Tech companies are reluctant to give access to encrypted information from their users, for privacy reasons and because it may affect their businesses. Law enforcement officials say their efforts to prevent and solve crime are hampered if they cannot see digital data on phones, messaging services and other technology services.   ''Today, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,'' Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. ''We need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.''   The rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.   The bill is ''dangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,'' said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. ''This bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.''   Other tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.   Bob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the ''unintended consequences'' of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.   ''The notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,'' Mr. Lord said.   Law enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs' group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.   Tech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.   Mr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.   ''I have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,'' Mr. Wyden said in an interview. ''The bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.''   For all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.   ''I'm reserving judgment,'' said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. ''The issues are so complex, it's like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.''     "
"Encryption Debate Not a Matter of 'Privacy vs. Security,' Senator Says","WASHINGTON -- After Apple and the F.B.I. made their battle over encryption public in February, members of Congress quickly jumped into the debate. Some lawmakers promised new rules that would give authorities more access to smartphones, while others promised to fight off those laws. Yet after several hearings and bills, and the formation of congressional working groups, little has been done to resolve the central tug of war between the tech industry and federal authorities over civil rights versus national security.     Law enforcement officials have argued that hundreds of criminal investigations have been held up by their inability to get access to locked smartphones and encrypted apps. Privacy advocates and tech companies say such access would cost people their personal information and lead to a slippery slope of surveillance.   The debate has flared anew recently, with Open Whisper Systems, maker of the encrypted messaging app Signal, revealing it had received a federal subpoena for user information earlier this year, along with a gag order. Last week, reports also surfaced that Yahoo worked to satisfy a secret court order by scanning incoming emails for digital ''signatures'' tied to a state-sponsored terrorist organization.   Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, has been a leading voice on the side of encryption and against giving the Justice Department more power to get consumer data from tech companies. Mr. Wyden, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, recently talked to The New York Times about the privacy-versus-security debate. Cecilia Kang   Q. What is the state of encryption and other security debates on Capitol Hill?   A. This is going to be a big, big two months.   First, obviously, there are those who want to weaken encryption. They are still at it.   Then, the F.B.I. wants authority to circumvent court oversight to obtain Americans' browsing histories. Third, there is what's known as Rule 41, where the F.B.I. wants the authority to hack thousands or millions of hacking victims with one warrant from a single judge.   These and other issues will come up right when we get back in session in November, after the election.    A draft proposal released in May by Senators Richard Burr of North Carolina and Dianne Feinstein of California to give law enforcement greater access to encrypted devices never caught on. What is the status of encryption proposals?   You'll have to ask them, but if an anti-encryption bill gets out of the Intelligence Committee, which is where its strength is greatest, I will do everything I can to prevent that. If it goes to the floor, then I will filibuster. I will use every procedural tool to block legislation that in my view would make us less safe and jeopardize our liberty.   There seems to be no change in the standoff between companies that want strong personal privacy and security protections, and law enforcement, which argues that it needs to get past encryption for national security.   There were tens of thousands of news stories during the first days of the encryption discussion that said, ''Today, in the ongoing debate between privacy and security, the following happened.''   I don't think that's the right way to think about it. I think it is about more security versus less security. If you want to be in a safe community, you shouldn't be able to weaken encryption.   We pushed back very, very hard on the idea that this is a battle between privacy and security.    Is this a minority point of view or are you seeing more people adopt this?   I think you are starting to see surprising voices in this discussion, like Mike McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, raise questions about what it means to weaken encryption.   What else is coming up for consideration in the cybersecurity space?   Browser spying. Senators John McCain and Richard Burr have a proposal to give any F.B.I. field office new authority to scoop up Americans' browsing history and a slew of American digital records without going to a judge. Email, text message logs and certain location information would be included. We had a vote on this at the end of June.   Yet this would give law enforcement access to valuable information to aid in  investigations.   My view is that if you know a person is visiting a website of a substance abuse group, a political organization or mental health clinic, then you know a lot about that person. It's practically a window into their innermost thoughts. This should come with court oversight. The F.B.I. can already get this information with a court order today.    One thing that civil liberties groups have protested is what's known as Rule 41. Can you explain what that is?   It would allow the government to hack into multiple devices with a single warrant from a single judge. The Justice Department will say this is a modest thing. But one tech person said this whole Rule 41 thing is coming forward under ''cover of dullness.''   The F.B.I. says that the changes to Rule 41 are the best way for them to investigate cybercriminals, including child abusers. What's your response?   Everyone believes that the F.B.I. should have the tools it needs to catch dangerous criminals. But too often over the past decade, intelligence and law enforcement agencies choose approaches that sweep up information from millions of innocent Americans instead of targeting terrorists and criminals. These approaches don't make us safer.   The changes to Rule 41 allow the F.B.I. to hack millions of victims of cybercrime. These victims of hacks are regular people, not criminals.   This is a serious issue that the American people and their elected representatives should consider and debate, rather than allowing the Department of Justice to put into law through an obscure bureaucratic process. There would be overwhelming congressional support for something that gives the F.B.I. the tools it needs, while providing the American people the strong protections they deserve.    Is the encryption debate between tech companies and law enforcement unsolvable?   It will be a long debate. But look, it's still possible to use metadata when the government thinks there is a problem. On the security side, we are no longer collecting millions of phone records on people, so that's solid policy.   There is a way to address security while also addressing liberty: by emergency authority and focusing on people who are a threat.     "
A Russian Cybersleuth Battles the 'Dark Ages' of the Internet,"Follow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter @NeilMacFarquhar . MOSCOW -- A sense of menace stirs right off the elevator on the fifth floor of Kaspersky Lab's Moscow headquarters, where a small television screen displays cyberthreats occurring in real time around the world -- a blinking, spinning, color-coded globe brimming with suspicious emails, malware and evil botnets that could be infecting a computer near you. That feeling of unease intensifies when Eugene V. Kaspersky -- the stocky, garrulous, 50-year-old founder and chief executive of the global computer security company -- begins to catalog possible threats: The computerized elevator you just left is vulnerable to cyberattacks, as are your smartphone and smartcar. Your bank, without question. Your electricity and water supplies could be at risk. Cybercriminals grow smarter, bolder and more elusive every year.    ''We are living in the middle cyberage, the dark ages of cyber,'' said Mr. Kaspersky, whose modest corner office with glass walls overlooks a stretch of canal and a boat club. He has longish salt-and-pepper hair, a trim beard and a ruddy, tanned complexion. ''Right now, it is more functionality, more technology, more services, but not enough security.''    Kaspersky Lab is most famous for being the home of the brainy geek squad that exposed Stuxnet and Flame, the American-Israeli cyberweapons that disrupted Iran's nuclear program.   Mr. Kaspersky and his company find themselves at the forefront of the battle against cybergangs, one of the largest emerging threats, for two rather simple reasons, he said: ''Russian software engineers are the best; unfortunately Russian cybercriminals are the best, as well.''   Hacking methods developed in the Russian-speaking world are going global, suggesting a thriving black market in malicious code. ''They don't just hack the victims, they trade the technology to other gangs,'' he said. ''Now there are hundreds of victims, in the United States and Asia.''   One gang alone is believed to have stolen up to $1 billion from banks, mainly in Russia, in 2013 and 2014. And this month, Kaspersky Lab experts helped Russia catch its largest hacking gang yet -- 50 people were arrested and accused of stealing $45 million since 2011. Investigators now believe the North Korean government hacked an international financial messaging system in February in an effort to drain $1 billion from the central bank of Bangladesh. They managed to get $81 million before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York became suspicious and cut off the transaction.   After banks, commodities are a big new target. Hackers manipulate supply records, disguising surpluses to sell. ''We now have reports that it is massive, it is everywhere,'' said Mr. Kaspersky, who speaks colorful English with a Russian accent.   Mr. Kaspersky is something of an anomaly in Russia, a businessman who built a global brand from scratch, using brains and persistence. His firm is among the most successful international computer security operations in the world, with offices in 32 countries, about 400 million people using its software (by its own estimate) and high-profile advertising campaigns, like its sponsorship of Ferrari's Formula One team.   However, given the tense relations between Russia and the West, Kaspersky Lab is fighting a rear-guard battle along with combating cybercrime: allaying concerns that a Russian security company can be trusted to protect confidential data stored online by Western companies and individuals.   Some of the questions are rooted in Mr. Kaspersky's past -- even in Russia, where the company and its founder generate both pride and suspicion.   Mr. Kaspersky was born in 1965 in Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea, to an engineer father and a mother working in the national archives. His mother nurtured his early aptitude for mathematics and, after the family moved to Moscow, he blossomed into a prodigy.   After he placed second in a major Russian math contest at age 14, he was recruited by the prestigious Kolmogorov Physics and Mathematics School, a boarding school run by Moscow State University that fosters high school math whizzes.   Mr. Kaspersky went on to a K.G.B.-sponsored university education intended to transform mathematicians into cryptologists, and pictures of him in a K.G.B. uniform are readily available online. ''I was not good enough to become a true cryptologist,'' he said, laughing.   Instead, he turned to software engineering, becoming the go-to guy in the Red Army for computer problems. ''I wrote the code for the Soviet military,'' he said.   He published an early book on computer viruses and founded Kaspersky Lab in 1997 with his first wife, Natalya. (He married three times and has four children.)   There is a strong sense in Russia that no company, particularly no computer security company, could succeed without Kremlin support, and Russian tech experts invariably refer to two episodes that fed mistrust.   Mr. Kaspersky once advocated requiring an individual passport for web access, an idea the Kremlin encouraged, although he has come to focus on controlling access only to sites of high national security interest, like utilities. Government critics also found Kaspersky Lab slow to react during protests in 2011, when numerous opposition websites collapsed under a severe criminal attack widely attributed to the Russian government.   In December, Mr. Kaspersky raised questions by signing his first cooperation agreement with a major state-run Chinese enterprise. Some Russian internet experts saw that as proof of choosing sides, becoming the anti-West cybercop and endorsing the Chinese model of a highly filtered internet.   Mr. Kaspersky said his China contract was simply a matter of capitalizing on its need for better security, especially since he sees Russian malware emerging there.   Others said he had to make his peace with the system -- or leave. ''He decided to accept the rules and to stay here,'' said Andrei Soldatov, the co-author of ''The Red Web,'' a book documenting the Kremlin's efforts to transfer ubiquitous Soviet surveillance techniques onto the web. ''He is part of the Russian tradition of engineers who really believe in order.''   Mr. Kaspersky said he stayed in Russia for its skilled software engineers. He and others attribute their prowess to a Russian educational system that, while less regimented than in Soviet times, still nurtures elite math skills. Widespread hacking is partly rooted in the tradition of not paying a kopeck for anything that could be grabbed free off the web, like software or movies.   Mr. Kaspersky appears in self-effacing nerd mode around Kaspersky Lab headquarters, busing his own cafeteria tray and riding the elevator downstairs to smoke outside like everybody else, despite the vast balcony outside his office.   He claims not to know his net worth, which Forbes recently estimated at $1.1 billion, putting him at 66th among Russia's top 200 richest people. He wears a Swatch and usually flies commercial airlines. In addition to Formula One, he underwrites various quirky or scientific projects -- including the excavation of the mysterious Minoan civilization of Akrotiri, on the Greek island of Santorini -- and he delights in exploring remote spots in eastern Russia, the American West and New Zealand, among other places.   ''I want to be not only a very professional, very correct, very good security company,'' he said. '' I also want to be an unusual company.''   Mr. Kaspersky works as his brand's high-profile envoy, spinning around the globe seemingly at the speed of the lights on his cyberthreat map. His travels last year included 116 flights and included more than 50 presentations. He documents every step on a blog translated into nine languages.   ''You wonder if he is ever asleep or ever at home,'' said Anton Nossik, a Russian tech pioneer and journalist, noting that the entrepreneur maintains a particularly sunny disposition online for someone selling the need to fight crime.   Where Mr. Kaspersky breaks out of the nerd mold is with his brash, booming presence at large corporate events.   ''He loves to be in the spotlight,'' said Aleksandr Plushev, who covers tech for the Echo of Moscow radio station. ''He is a very bright, funny, smart and open-minded person, with his own opinion. A little bit crazy, like almost all very talented people.''   Hundreds of Kaspersky employees converge on Moscow twice a year: for the company birthday party in July (when Mr. Kaspersky often serves as the M.C. for a talent contest), and for a New Year's Eve celebration.   The venues sometimes reflect his impish sense of humor. One year, he chartered a train to Uryupinsk, a town about 435 miles southeast of Moscow whose name the Russians use to signify ''the middle of nowhere.''   Photography is a favorite pastime of his, and he was thrilled when the magazine GQ Russia recently recommended his Instagram account as ''enticing and not banal.''   That closely reflects his take on web security, as well. ''It is getting much more complicated,'' he said, ''and at the same time much more interesting.''     "

"Daily Report: Russia Is Punished for Hacking, but for How Long?; Bits","Hacking has dominated technology news over the course of 2016, with revelations of major breaches at Yahoo and the hacked emails of Democrats.  Now we close out the year with the news that President Obama, in the waning days of his administration, is punishing Russia for its cyberattacks against the United States, which probably affected the American presidential election. David E. Sanger, a New York Times national security correspondent, writes that President Obama's administration has imposed sanctions against two of Russia's leading intelligence services, including four top officers, for their roles in cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. The United States also released samples of malware and other indications of Russian cyberactivity. The response - the strongest American action ever taken against a state-sponsored cyberattack - is expected to have repercussions on the relationship between the United States and Russia that will play out for many months. One unknown is how President Obama's successor, Donald J. Trump, will act on the conflict when he takes office next month. The president-elect has been skeptical of the American intelligence reports of Russia's cyberattacks. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that it was time to ""move on"" from the issue, but that he would meet with intelligence officials. Russia, at least, seems to be betting on an improved relationship with Mr. Trump. On Friday, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, said he would not retaliate against the Obama administration's decision to impose sanctions. The Bits newsletter will be on hiatus until Jan. 3.  "
Global Network Exploited Again in a Bank Theft,"Thieves have again found their way into what was thought to be the most secure financial messaging system in the world and stolen money from a bank. The crime appears to be part of a broad online attack on global banking. New details about a second attack involving Swift -- the messaging system used by thousands of banks and companies to move money around the world -- are emerging as investigators are still trying to solve the $81 million heist from the central bank of Bangladesh in February. In that robbery, the attackers were able to compel the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to move money to accounts in the Philippines.     The second attack involves a commercial bank, which Swift declined to identify. But in a letter Swift plans to share with its users on Friday, the messaging network warned that the two attacks bore numerous similarities and were very likely part of a ''wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.''   The unusual warning from Swift, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, shows how serious the financial industry regards these attacks to be. Some banking experts say they may be impossible to solve or trace. Swift said the thieves somehow got their hands on legitimate network credentials, initiated the fraudulent transfers and installed malware on bank computers to disguise their movements.   ''The attackers clearly exhibit a deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operation controls within the targeted banks -- knowledge that may have been gained from malicious insiders or cyberattacks, or a combination of both,'' Swift said in its warning, which is expected to be posted on a secure part of its website on Friday.   Security experts who have studied the attacks said the thieves probably were lurking inside the bank systems for months before they were detected.   In its warning, Swift pointed to another worrying situation: that the gang of thieves may have been able to recruit bank employees to hand over credentials and other key details.   In both cases, the core messaging system of Swift was not breached; rather, the criminals attacked the banks' connections to the Swift network. Each bank is responsible for maintaining the security of its connection to Swift. Digital criminals have found ways to exploit loopholes in bank security to obtain login credentials and dispatch fraudulent Swift messages.   ''As a matter of urgency, we remind all customers again to urgently review controls in their payments environments,'' Swift urges its customers in the letter to be sent on Friday.   Banks -- like many major corporations -- are constantly under attack by criminals, seeking to find the weak point in their defenses. An attack in the summer of 2014 on JPMorgan Chase compromised the accounts of 76 million households and seven million small businesses, but no money was stolen. Thieves frequently steal bank customer's A.T.M. and credit card credentials.   But these attacks involving Swift stand out, because million of dollars were stolen -- not from a large number of customers, but from the banks themselves. It is as if the thieves used their hacking skills to reach inside a bank vault.   Emboldened and enriched, the thieves are likely to strike again, security experts predict.   ''An event like this changes the risk profile for the banking system, since the attackers will inevitably reinvest some of their profits in new large-scale attacks,'' said Paul Kocher, a security and encryption expert who is the president of Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.   Initially, many banks and security experts dismissed the Bangladesh attacks as brazen, but probably isolated, events in a developing country. A stream of news reports from the capital of Dhaka cited rudimentary technology at Bangladesh Bank, like a $10 router and an absence of firewalls. Bangladesh officials have blamed the New York Fed, saying it failed to block the fraudulent transfers.   On Tuesday, representatives from Swift, the New York Fed and Bangladesh Bank met in Basel, Switzerland, to discuss the breach and the vulnerabilities it exposed in the system.   In a joint statement, the three sides said they had agreed to cooperate in trying to ''bring the perpetrators to justice, and protect the global financial system from these types of attacks.''   But the details of the second attack -- which Swift said occurred in the last few months -- suggested a highly sophisticated threat that did not necessarily hinge on weak digital defenses. Swift declined to say how much money was stolen from the bank, which was not located in Bangladesh.   Somehow the thieves obtained a valid Swift credential that allowed them to ''create, approve and submit'' messages on the network. Those messages -- sent from PCs in the bank's back offices or from laptops -- were then used to move money from one of the bank's accounts.   Many banks have a system of checks and balances by which they can validate and review transactions to root out fraud.   But in this latest case, the thieves used a form of malware that targeted a PDF reader that the bank used to confirm that payments had been made. The malware, according to Swift, then manipulated the PDF to ''remove traces of the fraudulent instructions.''   That the thieves knew that the bank used a PDF program to confirm its payments shows the level of detail gleaned about how the particular system worked. At Bangladesh Bank, Swift transactions were tracked using physical printouts. So the thieves tailored their malware in that attack to interfere with the printer and cover their tracks.   The attacks have been a major headache for the ubiquitous and publicity-shy Swift, an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Based in Belgium, Swift is partly owned and overseen by the world's biggest banks, which have used the technology to facilitate money transfers since the 1970s. It prides itself on not disclosing any information about its users.   After the attacks, Swift has had to walk a fine line trying to shore up confidence in the security of its network among its 11,000 users, while urging those members to take additional security measures to defend against future attacks.   ''Your first priority should be to ensure that you have all the preventative and detective measures in place to secure your own environment,'' Swift said in its message. ''This latest evidence adds further urgency to your work.''     "
Top-Secret Code Released by Hackers Points to Breach at N.S.A.,"The release on websites this week of what appears to be top-secret computer code that the National Security Agency has used to break into the networks of foreign governments and other espionage targets has caused deep concern inside American intelligence agencies, raising the question of whether America's own elite operatives have been hacked and their methods revealed. Most outside experts who examined the posts, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, said they contained what appeared to be genuine samples of the code -- though somewhat outdated -- used in the production of the N.S.A.'s custom-built malware.     Most of the code was designed to break through network firewalls and get inside the computer systems of competitors like Russia, China and Iran. That, in turn, allows the N.S.A. to place ''implants'' in the system, which can lurk unseen for years and be used to monitor network traffic or enable a debilitating computer attack.   According to these experts, the coding resembled a series of ''products'' developed inside the N.S.A.'s highly classified Tailored Access Operations unit, some of which were described in general terms in documents stolen three years ago by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor now living in Russia.   But the code does not appear to have come from Mr. Snowden's archive, which was mostly composed of PowerPoint files and other documents that described N.S.A. programs. The documents released by Mr. Snowden and his associates contained no actual source code used to break into the networks of foreign powers.   Whoever obtained the source code apparently broke into either the top-secret, highly compartmentalized computer servers of the N.S.A. or other servers around the world that the agency would have used to store the files. The code that was published on Monday dates to mid-2013, when, after Mr. Snowden's disclosures, the agency shuttered many of its existing servers and moved code to new ones as a security measure.   By midday Tuesday Mr. Snowden himself, in a Twitter message from his exile in Moscow, declared that ''circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility'' for publication, which he interpreted as a warning shot to the American government in case it was thinking of imposing sanctions against Russia in the cybertheft of documents from the Democratic National Committee.   ''Why did they do it?'' Mr. Snowden asked. ''No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack.''   Around the same time, WikiLeaks declared that it had a full set of the files -- it did not say how it had obtained them -- and would release them all in the future. The ''Shadow Brokers'' had said they would auction them off to the highest bidder.   ''I think it's Snowden-era stuff, repackaged for resale now,'' said James A. Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. ''This is probably some Russian mind game, down to the bogus accent'' of some of the messages sent to media organizations by the Shadow Brokers group, delivered in broken English that seemed right out of a bad spy movie.   The N.S.A. would say nothing on Tuesday about whether the coding released was real or where it came from. Its public affairs office did not respond to inquiries.   ''It certainly feels all real,'' said Bruce Schneier, a leading authority on state-sponsored breaches. ''The question is why would someone steal it in 2013 and release it this week? That's what is making people think this is likely the work of Russian intelligence.''   There are other theories, including one that some unknown group was trying to impersonate hackers working for Russian or other intelligence agencies. Impersonation is relatively easy on the internet, and it could take considerable time to determine who is behind the release of the code.   The Shadow Brokers first emerged online on Saturday, creating accounts on sites like Twitter and Tumblr and announcing plans for an auction. The group said that ''we give you some Equation Group files free'' and that it would auction the best ones. The Equation Group is a code name that Kaspersky Labs, a Russian cybersecurity firm, has given to the N.S.A.   While still widely considered the most talented group of state-sponsored hackers in the world, the N.S.A. is still recovering from Mr. Snowden's disclosures; it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars reconfiguring and locking down its systems.   Mr. Snowden revealed plans, code names and some operations, including against targets like China. The Shadow Brokers disclosures are much more detailed, the actual code and instructions for breaking into foreign systems as of three summers ago.   ''From an operational standpoint, this is not a catastrophic leak,'' Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., wrote on the Lawfare blog on Tuesday.   But he added that ''the big picture is a far scarier one.'' In the weeks after Mr. Snowden fled Hawaii, landing in Hong Kong before ultimately going to Russia, it appears that someone obtained that source code. That, he suggested, would be an even bigger security breach for the N.S.A. than Mr. Snowden's departure with his trove of files.   However, the fact that the code is dated from 2013 suggests that the hackers' access was cut off around then, perhaps because the agency imposed new security measures.   The attack on the Democratic National Committee has raised questions about whether the Russian government is trying to influence the American election. If so, it is unclear how -- or whether -- President Obama will respond. A response could be public or private, and it could involve sanctions, diplomatic warnings or even a counterattack.   ''The real problem for us is that the Russians seem to have taken the gloves off in the cyberdomain,'' said Mr. Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ''and we don't know how to respond.''

Yahoo Said to Have Adapted Email Scanner to Aid U.S. Surveillance,"A system intended to scan emails for child pornography and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court order requiring it to search for messages containing a computer ''signature'' tied to the communications of a state-sponsored terrorist organization, several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Justice Department obtained an individualized order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year. Yahoo was barred from disclosing the matter.    To comply, Yahoo customized an existing scanning system for all incoming email traffic, which also looks for malware, according to one of the officials and to a third person familiar with Yahoo's response, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.    With some modifications, the system stored and made available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. The collection is no longer taking place, those two people said.   The order was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users' emails rather than individual accounts; several other tech companies said they had not encountered such a demand.   News of the order has opened a new chapter in a public debate over the trade-offs between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the United States government.   It comes six months after a standoff between the F.B.I. and Apple, in which the government obtained a federal magistrate's order to force the company to help it unlock an encrypted iPhone from one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The F.B.I. gave up the fight with Apple after it found a way into the iPhone without the company's help.   By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly lighter than the one the F.B.I. placed on Apple.   Details of Yahoo's cooperation with the court order come two weeks after the company reported that hackers had broken into its computer network, stealing the credentials of 500 million users. Yahoo engineers discovered the breach this summer, two years after it had occurred, and just weeks after Verizon Communications announced plans to buy the troubled internet company for $4.8 billion.   The two government officials familiar with the matter said the digital signature Yahoo was ordered to look for last year was individually approved in an order issued by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power.   Investigators had learned that agents of the foreign terrorist organization were communicating using Yahoo's email service and with a method that involved a ''highly unique'' identifier or signature, but the investigators did not know which specific email accounts those agents were using, the officials said.   The officials' description of the unusual surveillance operation carried out at Yahoo shed new light on a report by Reuters that has attracted widespread attention and provoked outrage among privacy and technology specialists.   The Reuters article reported that in response to a ''broad demand'' from the government, Yahoo had ''secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.''   According to the government officials, Yahoo was served with an individualized court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization. Two sources, including one of the officials, portrayed it as adapting the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a brand-new capability. The other official did not comment on the technology. The officials did not name the terrorist organization.   Asked on Wednesday about the information obtained by The New York Times, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to say. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was ''misleading.''   ''We narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,'' the Yahoo statement said. ''The mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.''   Richard Kolko, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined in a statement to discuss specific foreign intelligence collection techniques, but referred to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.   ''Under FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does not involve bulk collection or use generic key words or phrases,'' he said. ''The United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people.''   Technology companies like Yahoo, Google and Microsoft scan for child pornography and are required to report any discoveries to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They similarly search traffic for malware and spam, which companies disclose in their terms of service.   There is no engineering limitation preventing technology companies from using their spam and child pornography filtering systems to search email traffic for other sorts of digital signatures, said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth, who helped develop the child pornography scanning system with Microsoft.   But the use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare, and one of the officials portrayed it as innovative.   ''This is another example of how the government is pushing secretly novel or innovative interpretations of surveillance law'' to conduct wiretapping in broader ways than the public realizes, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society.   The government has not released any intelligence court opinion explaining how the judge interpreted FISA to authorize such surveillance. Although Congress in June 2015 enacted a law that required the government to make public novel and significant rulings by the court, the order to Yahoo appears to have predated that legislation, the USA Freedom Act, by several months.   Yahoo has an inconsistent record with meeting government data demands. In 2007, the company settled a lawsuit related to allegations that it helped the Chinese government crack down on journalists by passing along their Yahoo emails.   But that year, the firm fought a legal battle, then secret, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, challenging a mandate that it turn over, without a warrant, emails from user accounts the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency said belonged to noncitizens abroad who had been targeted for surveillance.   That litigation became an important test of whether Congress could legalize the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program through the Protect America Act and, later, the FISA Amendments Act. Ultimately, the intelligence court ruled against Yahoo, and after being threatened with a huge fine, the company cooperated.   Yahoo was not able to clarify details of the Reuters article on Tuesday because orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are secret by law, and an increasing number of other government requests come with gag orders that prohibit tech companies from even acknowledging they exist.   Tech companies complain that such gag orders make it impossible for them to explain to customers what sort of data they do and do not turn over. Twitter and Microsoft have separately sued the Justice Department over the gag order practice, and both cases are pending.   Dozens of other companies have filed briefs in support of Microsoft. In its brief, Apple said it had received about 590 gag orders, of unlimited or indefinite durations, in the first eight months of 2016.

Donate Your Computer's Spare Time to Science,"Q. I have heard about volunteer computing, but I am wondering how exactly it works and how secure it is. Would my computer be at risk? A. Volunteer computing involves donating a share of your computer's unused storage space and processing power to analyze small chunks of research data. The data -- which belongs to a larger scientific project -- is automatically uploaded and downloaded to your computer by software you install after you sign up to volunteer.     In regards to security, it is possible that hackers could put malware online disguised as volunteer-computing projects or try to compromise an existing project data, so the experience is not entirely risk-free. However, volunteer-computing organizations have put security measures in place to minimize potential risks. If you decide to volunteer, use trusted software from established academic or research institutions.   The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing, known casually as BOINC, is probably the best-known volunteer-computing platform out there, and it supports a number of different projects from universities and institutes around the world. A page on the University of California-Berkeley website explains BOINC's security measures, which include code-signing to help prevent malware from getting onto project servers.   Once you read over the security explanation and decide to proceed, download the BOINC software, install it and then sign up for a project in the program's settings.   Current BOINC projects include LHC@Home from CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), Rosetta@Home for the University of Washington's protein-structure project, and Berkeley's own long-running SETI@Home initiative for analyzing radio telescope data from space. IBM's World Community Grid for medical and humanitarian research is also offered, and has its own notes on project security.   BOINC is not the only volunteer-computing software around, but it does let you select from multiple projects within its menus. Still, you can easily find other trusted volunteer-computing programs around the web, including Stanford University's Folding@home project that helps researchers study Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as certain types of cancers.

"After Cyberattacks, Germany Fears Russia May Disrupt Vote","BERLIN -- After hackers infiltrated the German Parliament's computer network in May 2015, it took nearly a year before the country's intelligence agency concluded that the attack was most likely the work of their Russian counterparts. Last week, when 900,000 Germans lost access to internet and telephone services, it took a matter of hours before politicians began pointing fingers at Moscow.    Berlin is now concerned that Germany will become the next focus of Moscow's campaign to destabilize Western democracies as national elections approach next year.   Those fears intensified after the Obama administration accused the Russian government of attacking Democratic Party emails during the American presidential campaign.    The increasing dissemination of false news, disinformation and propaganda during the American campaign and before Italy's referendum last weekend has added a related layer of worry about the potential to corrupt public debate and democratic processes.   Hans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency, warned in an interview on Thursday of ''growing evidence for attempts to influence the federal election next year.''   His agency has seen an increase in ''aggressive cyberespionage'' targeting German politicians, he said.   If the advent of the personal computer helped undermine a closed Soviet system that could not compete in an information age, then exploiting the vulnerabilities of the internet and social media may be Russia's revenge.   Intelligence and other officials can now point to a growing string of campaigns of disinformation, hacked computer networks and leaked emails fitting a pattern that traces a murky route back to Moscow.   The aim, they say, is to undercut liberal opponents of Moscow, destabilize political systems and undermine democratic processes across the European Union and in NATO member countries, while supporting anti-European forces.   ''Based on the prevailing Russian strategy of hybrid influence and destabilization, which we have observed over time and for which we have facts, the government, officials and some political parties have become sensitized to this form of conflict,'' said Wilfried Jilge, an expert on Ukraine and Eastern Europe with the German Council on Foreign Relations.   ''Such suspicions are the result of observation and experience over the past year and a half,'' Mr. Jilge said.   Many of the efforts seem intended to tilt elections in a direction preferred by Moscow or to undercut certain leaders.   That was presumably the motivation for hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton, who long had an antagonistic relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.   On the other hand, her challenger, the eventual winner, Donald J. Trump, was effusive in his praise for the Russian leader.   False news, also linked to Russia, was widely disseminated in Italy by opponents of the push by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for constitutional changes. Many of those opponents are much closer to Moscow than to Mr. Renzi, who lost and has now resigned.   Germans have not been immune to such disinformation, either.   In January, a news article that said a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had been kidnapped and raped by migrants in Germany spread quickly on Russian-language news channels.   Outrage over a supposed cover-up of the abuse drew members of Germany's Russian-speaking minority into the streets across the country, shocking German politicians.   German police officials later proved that the events never took place. But the damage was already done, and the false report fed opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open the doors to nearly a million refugees.   As for Moscow's motivations in Germany, Eberhard Schneider, a professor of political science at the University of Siegen, has observed Russia's propaganda tactics since the days of the Cold War.   Ms. Merkel, he noted, was one of the strongest supporters of the sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Putin has a strong incentive to undermine her.   ''Germany is the most important power in the European Union,'' he said. ''If you can harm Germany and prevent that Merkel has a good outcome in the next election, that is in his interest.''   The disruption at Deutsche Telekom, which began on Nov. 27, set off a fresh round of alarm over potential Russian meddling and the vulnerability of Germany's computer networks, which could be disrupted or hacked during an election.   A day after the breach, Bruno Kahl, head of the Germany's foreign intelligence service, raised the prospect of evidence linking Russia to interference in the United States election campaign and warned that Germany could be next.   ''It is known that cyberattacks take place which have no other purpose than to provoke political uncertainty,'' he told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.   ''These attempts to interfere focus on Europe, and on Germany especially,'' Mr. Kahl said. ''A kind of pressure is being exercised on public discourse and democracy here, which is unacceptable.''   Investigations into the incident later blamed links to ''criminal organizations,'' though neither Deutsche Telekom nor the government disclosed any concrete link to Moscow.   Observers like Mr. Jilge of the Council on Foreign Relations say that caution is prudent in assigning blame, but that suspicion of Moscow is warranted given the accumulating pattern.   ''The fact that hackers appeared to have carried out this attack does not automatically mean that they are linked to Russia,'' he said of the Deutsche Telekom attack.   ''But if we look at the target and the timing, and know that such influence and disinformation is part of the Russian approach, then it is not surprising that some would seek to address this issue,'' he said.   Asked about the Deutsche Telekom disruption, Ms. Merkel said she did not know who was responsible, but she also mentioned Russia.   ''I will simply say, such cyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. We must inform people a lot on this point,'' the chancellor told reporters last week.   ''We cannot allow ourselves to be unsettled by this,'' Ms. Merkel said. ''We must simply know that this exists and learn to live with it.''   Both Deutsche Telekom and the government's Office of Information Security said a strain of the Mirai malware, which seeks to embed itself in devices connected to the internet, appeared to have caused the disruption.   Mirai was the same malware used in an attack in the United States in October that brought down websites for Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, SoundCloud and The New York Times, among others.   In Germany, the malware apparently succeeded only in knocking out the routers and disrupting internet connections.   ''According to our analysis, the objective of the attack is to install malware on the routers to add them to a botnet -- meaning they could be used as the remote-controlled infrastructure for future attacks,'' Deutsche Telekom later said in a statement.   The company pledged to focus on improving its network security to render it better able to resist any form of attack.   The speed with which officials began to suspect Russia was a stark contrast to 2015, when hackers used a phishing tactic, using a fake email, to penetrate computers in Germany's lower house of Parliament.   Only this past May did Mr. Maassen's domestic intelligence agency confirm suspicions that Russian intelligence was behind the attack. Finally, in October, it issued a broad warning.   ''German parties or politicians,'' it cautioned, ''could fall into the focus of Russian cyberespionage campaigns and operations.''     "
U.S. Indicts 7 Tied to Iranian Unit in Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON --  The Justice Department on Thursday unsealed an indictment against seven computer specialists who regularly worked for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, charging that they carried out cyberattacks on dozens of American banks and tried to take over the controls of a small dam in a suburb of New York. The indictment, while long expected, represents the first time the Obama administration had sought action against Iranians for a wave of computer attacks on the United States that began in 2011 and proceeded for more than a year, paralyzing some banks and freezing customers out of online banking.     The indictment stops short of charging that the attacks were directed by the Revolutionary Guards, a branch of the Iranian military. But it referred to the seven Iranians as ''experienced computer hackers'' who ''performed work on behalf of the Iranian government, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.''   Nothing in the indictment addresses the motives for the attacks. But intelligence experts have long speculated that the cyberactions directed at roughly four dozen financial institutions -- including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One and PNC Bank -- were intended to be retaliation for an American-led cyberattack on Iran's main nuclear enrichment plant. That attack, which employed the so-called Stuxnet virus, was revealed in 2010.   All of the Iranian attacks -- which, the indictment said, included actions against the New York Stock Exchange and AT&T -- were ''distributed denial of service'' attacks, often called DDoS attacks. In those assaults, the target's computers are overwhelmed by coordinated computer requests from thousands of machines around the world. The targeted networks often crash, putting them out of service for some period.   But the case of the Bowman Dam in Rye, N.Y., was entirely different: It appeared to be an effort to take over the dam itself. The attempt failed because the dam was under repair and offline, but in some ways it worried American investigators more because it was aimed at seizing control of a piece of infrastructure.   ''The most likely conclusion is that it was a warning shot'' from the Iranians, who were saying, '''Don't pick on us, because we can pick on you,''' said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.   But Mr. Schumer said that the lesson from this case was ''not that we should not employ cyberweapons, but that we should be able to protect ourselves.''   It is doubtful that any of the named Iranians will ever appear in an American courtroom. In that respect, the indictment is similar to one the Justice Department issued two years ago against members of Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army of China, which it accused of stealing data from American corporations. The Chinese have never been arrested.   But the administration argues that such indictments send a strong signal and make it difficult for those who are indicted to travel, for fear of extradition.   On Tuesday, the Justice Department indicted two other hackers who it said were members of the Syrian Electronic Army, which has supported the government of Bashar al-Assad, and it believes that it has a chance to gain custody of one of them. On Wednesday, the department obtained a guilty plea from a Chinese national living in Canada, Su Bin, whom it accused of mounting a cybercampaign to steal the designs of military aircraft from Boeing, on behalf of Chinese intelligence agents.   The Iran indictment comes eight months after the nuclear deal reached between Tehran and six other nations, including the United States, which appeared to be putting Tehran and Washington on a track toward a more productive relationship after 35 years of enmity. But Iranian missile launches in recent months -- also organized by the Guards -- have led to calls in Congress for new sanctions.   The indictment appeared to be part of an American effort to keep Iran from shifting activity from its nuclear program to its growing corps of cyberwarriors, some of whom work directly for the government, while others, like those named in the indictment, seem to be contractors.   As a measure of the importance the administration placed on the indictment, it was announced by Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, in a news conference in Washington with Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, where the indictment was handed up. It was unclear how long it had been under seal.   The Iranians named in the indictment included Ahmad Fathi, Hamid Firoozi, Amin Shokohi and Sadegh Ahmadzadegan, who went by the online handle of ''Nitr0jen26.'' Also named were Omid Ghaffarinia, known as ''PLuS,'' Sina Keissar and Nader Saedi, also known as ''Turk Server.'' Their whereabouts was not described, but some worked for a firm the indictment called the ITSec Team, and some for the Mersad Company, both described as security companies in Iran.   John P. Carlin, who heads the national security division of the Justice Department, said in an interview that the indictments arose from a new approach within the Obama administration. ''Prior to 2012, we dealt with these cases as intelligence matters,'' which were hard to bring to court, Mr. Carlin said, because the evidence was classified. ''Now we are following traditional investigative rules,'' he said, assembling data that can be entered into court records.   Iran's computer networks have been a primary target of the National Security Agency for years, and it is likely that in penetrating those networks -- for intelligence purposes or potential sabotage -- the N.S.A. could have traced the attacks to specific computers, IP addresses or individuals.    But naming individuals, some experts suggested, could lead to retaliation. Jason Healey, a cyberconflict expert at Columbia University and the Atlantic Council, asked in a Twitter post on Thursday whether naming individuals, rather than governments, put cyberoperators for the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency ''at risk for similar indictments.''

U.S. Unleashes Digital Arsenal in War With ISIS,"LONDON -- The United States has opened a new line of combat against the Islamic State, directing the military's six-year-old Cyber Command for the first time to mount computer-network attacks that are now being used alongside more traditional weapons. The effort reflects President Obama's desire to bring many of the secret American cyberweapons that have been aimed elsewhere, notably at Iran, into the fight against the Islamic State -- which has proved effective in using modern communications and encryption to recruit and carry out operations.    The National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic surveillance, has for years listened intensely to the militants of the Islamic State, and those reports are often part of the president's daily intelligence briefing. But the N.S.A.'s military counterpart, Cyber Command, was focused largely on Russia, China, Iran and North Korea -- where cyberattacks on the United States most frequently originate -- and had run virtually no operations against what has become the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world.    A review of what should be done to confront the Islamic State is on Mr. Obama's agenda on Monday, when he is scheduled to attend a conference in Hanover, Germany, with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany. Of these efforts, the cybercampaign is the newest. It is also the one discussed in least detail by officials of many countries, and its successes or failures are the most difficult to assess from the outside.   The goal of the new campaign is to disrupt the ability of the Islamic State to spread its message, attract new adherents, circulate orders from commanders and carry out day-to-day functions, like paying its fighters. A benefit of the administration's exceedingly rare public discussion of the campaign, officials said, is to rattle the Islamic State's commanders, who have begun to realize that sophisticated hacking efforts are manipulating their data. Potential recruits may also be deterred if they come to worry about the security of their communications with the militant group.   Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is among those who have publicly discussed the new mission, but only in broad terms, and this month the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, was more colorful in describing the effort.   ''We are dropping cyberbombs,'' Mr. Work said. ''We have never done that before.''   The campaign has been conducted by a small number of ''national mission teams,'' newly created cyberunits loosely modeled on Special Operations forces.   While officials declined to discuss the details of their operations, interviews with more than a half-dozen senior and midlevel officials indicate that the effort has begun with a series of ''implants'' in the militants' networks to learn the online habits of commanders. Now, the plan is to imitate them or to alter their messages, with the aim of redirecting militants to areas more vulnerable to attack by American drones or local ground forces.   In other cases, officials said, the United States may complement operations to bomb warehouses full of cash by using cyberattacks to interrupt electronic transfers and misdirect payments.   The fact that the administration is beginning to talk of its use of the new weapons is a dramatic change. As recently as four years ago, it would not publicly admit to developing offensive cyberweapons or confirm its role in any attacks on computer networks.   That is partly because cyberattacks inside another nation raise major questions over invasion of sovereignty. But in the case of the Islamic State, officials say a decision was made that a bit of boasting might degrade the enemy's trust in its communications, jumbling and even deterring some actions.   ''Our cyberoperations are disrupting their command-and-control and communications,'' Mr. Obama said this month, emerging from a meeting at the C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., on countering the Islamic State.   Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered broad outlines of the new campaign against the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL, during a news conference in February.   ''We're trying to both physically and virtually isolate ISIL, limit their ability to conduct command and control, limit their ability to communicate with each other, limit their ability to conduct operations locally and tactically,'' he said.   ''But I'll be one of the first ones arguing that that's about all we should talk about,'' General Dunford said. ''We want them to be surprised when we conduct cyberoperations. And, frankly, they're going to experience some friction that's associated with us and some friction that's just associated with the normal course of events in dealing in the information age.''   In an interview this month in Colorado Springs, where she talked to Air Force Academy cadets, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, said that the fight against the Islamic State had to be thought of as a multifront war -- and that computers were just another weapon in the arsenal.   ''It should not be taken out of proportion -- it is not the only tool,'' she said when asked about Mr. Work's ''cyberbombs'' comment. In fact, some of Mr. Work's colleagues acknowledged that they had winced when he used the term, because government lawyers have gone to extraordinary lengths to narrowly limit cyberattacks to highly precise operations with as little collateral damage as possible.   But Ms. Rice said the Islamic State had ''uniquely utilized cyberspace'' to recruit, to communicate over encrypted apps and to coordinate its operations from Syria to Europe.   Ms. Rice would not comment on reports from officials in the Pentagon that Mr. Obama had asked -- quite pointedly -- in the fall why the arsenal of cyberweapons that had been developed at a cost of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars was not being used in the fight against the terrorist group.   Several officials said that Mr. Carter had complained that Cyber Command was too focused on traditional adversaries, and that he had set deadlines for a new array of operational cyberplans aimed at the Islamic State. Those were ultimately delivered by Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the commander of Cyber Command and the director of the National Security Agency.   But inside Fort Meade in Maryland, home to the N.S.A. and Cyber Command, initial demands from the White House generated some resistance, according to officials involved in the debate.   The N.S.A. has spent years penetrating foreign networks -- the Chinese military, Russian submarine communications, Internet traffic and other targets -- placing thousands of implants in those networks to allow it to listen in.   But those implants can be used to manipulate data or to shut down a network. That frequently leads to a battle between the N.S.A. civilians -- who know that to make use of an implant is to blow its cover -- and the military operators who want to strike back. N.S.A. officials complained that once the implants were used to attack, the Islamic State militants would stop the use of a communications channel and perhaps start one that was harder to find, penetrate or de-encrypt.   ''It's a delicate balance,'' Ms. Rice said. ''We still have to keep our eye on the Russia-China state-sponsored activity, but this was a new mission, one where we have to balance the collection equities against the disruption equities.''   In Britain, the Government Communications Headquarters, the country's equivalent to the N.S.A., has been going through a similar debate. It is a familiar one for the British: According to an oft-repeated legend from World War II, Winston Churchill decided to let the Nazis bomb Coventry, at a cost of hundreds of lives, rather than reveal that Britain had used its Enigma machine to crack German codes. (There is a historical dispute about whether Churchill knew the city was to be targeted.)   Lisa O. Monaco, a deputy national security adviser and Mr. Obama's top adviser for counterterrorism, has led efforts examining how to disrupt the use of social media for recruiting. She has met technology executives in Silicon Valley; Austin, Tex.; Boston; and Washington to come up with a more integrated plan for both taking down social media posts and encouraging the development of a counternarrative.   One effort has included amplifying the testimony of Islamic State recruits who have escaped and now describe the group's brutality and question its adherence to the true tenets of Islam. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are also growing more efficient at finding and removing Islamic State posts -- which they can take down without court orders because the posts are a violation of the companies' terms of service, executives say.   But Ms. Monaco suggested that the effort was just beginning. ''We are not going to kill our way out of this conflict,'' she said. ''And we are not going to delete our way out of it, either.''     "
Chinese Businessman Sentenced in Hacking,"LOS ANGELES -- A Chinese businessman who pleaded guilty in March to conspiring to hack the computer networks of the Boeing Company and other major American military contractors was sentenced on Wednesday to nearly four years in prison, prosecutors said.  The businessman, Su Bin, 51, was charged with taking part in a scheme by Chinese military officers to obtain sensitive United States military information over several years. In addition to the 46-month prison term, a judge in the United States District Court in Los Angeles also ordered Mr. Su to pay a fine of $10,000.    ''Su Bin's sentence is a just punishment for his admitted role in a conspiracy with hackers from the People's Liberation Army Air Force to illegally access and steal sensitive U.S. military information,'' John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.   ''Su assisted the Chinese military hackers in their efforts to illegally access and steal designs for cutting-edge military aircraft that are indispensable to our national defense,'' the statement said.   In an indictment, prosecutors said Mr. Su traveled to the United States at least 10 times from 2008 to 2014 and worked to steal the data with two unidentified co-conspirators based in China.   The three conspirators were accused of stealing plans related to the Boeing C-17 military transport plane and the Boeing F-22 and Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, and attempting to sell them to Chinese companies.   According to prosecutors, in pleading guilty, Mr. Su admitted sending emails to his co-conspirators telling them which people, companies and technologies to target with their hacking, and translating the stolen material from English to Chinese.   Mr. Su admitted taking part in the crime for financial gain, prosecutors said.   The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any involvement in hacking.   Mr. Su was arrested in Canada in 2014 and ultimately consented to extradition to the United States.     "
"In Hacked Audio, Clinton Rethinks an Obama Plan","WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton expressed doubts about whether the United States should go forward with a trillion-dollar modernization of its nuclear forces at a fund-raiser in February, questioning an Obama administration plan that she has remained largely silent on in public. Mrs. Clinton also suggested she would be far tougher against foreign nations that hack into American computer networks and would kill one of the Pentagon's pet projects, a nuclear-tipped cruise missile.     ''The last thing we need,'' she told the audience, ''are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear armed.''   Her comments were contained in an audio recording of the fund-raiser that appeared on the website of The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, which said it was gleaned from the hack of a campaign staff member. But it said nothing about who did the hacking.   At a moment when Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration have warned that Russia is trying to influence the American election, the mysterious release of the tape is also certain to raise new questions about the scope of attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.   A former Defense Department official present at the fund-raiser, Andrew C. Weber, who raised the question about nuclear modernization, verified the contents of the tape, but also suggested its release was part of the same hacking campaign that exposed D.N.C. emails.   Before she turned to nuclear matters, Mrs. Clinton used the fund-raiser to suggest that she would be much firmer against foreign nations that hack into American networks. Though the administration never formally accused China of stealing the security-review records of nearly 22 million federal employees and contractors, she called the theft ''a gold mine for Chinese intelligence.''   ''They are at it all the time,'' she said of the Chinese state-sponsored hackers. But she also seemed to suggest -- more directly than she did in Monday night's debate -- that she thinks the best deterrent to the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans, all of whom she named, was a dose of American offensive cyberweaponry.   ''They have physical assets that are also connected on the internet,'' she said. ''So they have to know we would retaliate. So that provides a certain level of deterrence.''   It may not: The Russian-backed hacks of the Democrats' infrastructure, so far without a visible American response, suggest that the deterrence Mrs. Clinton is relying on is not working.   The 50-minute recording was made in February during a fund-raising event at the home of Beatrice and Anthony Welters in McLean, Va. Mrs. Welters was ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago when Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state.   Mr. Weber was an assistant secretary of defense for nuclear programs from 2009 to 2014. Last year, after leaving office, he joined William J. Perry, a secretary of defense in the administration of President Bill Clinton and one of the Democratic Party's most influential nuclear advisers, to write an op-ed in The Washington Post strongly opposing White House approval of an upgraded nuclear cruise missile.   The missile is part of a sweeping modernization of the American nuclear arsenal that is estimated to cost up to $1 trillion over three decades. Undertaken by the Obama administration, it features new factories, refurbished nuclear arms, and a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. The new bombers are to carry the new cruise missile.   At the fund-raiser, Mr. Weber asked Mrs. Clinton about the modernization push and whether she, as president, would cancel the cruise missile, which he called a ''particularly destabilizing, dangerous type of nuclear weapon.''   ''I certainly would be inclined to do that,'' she answered. ''The last thing we need are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear-armed.''   Mrs. Clinton went beyond the question to warn of an emerging nuclear arms race, naming Russia and China as well as Pakistan and India. ''This is one of the most dangerous developments imaginable,'' she told the audience.   ''Pakistan is running full speed to develop tactical nukes in their continuing hostility with India.'' she said. ''But we live in fear that they're going to have a coup, that jihadists are going to take over the government, they're going to get access to nuclear weapons, and you'll have suicide nuclear bombers. So, this could not be a more threatening scenario.''   The United States, Mrs. Clinton said, needs to ''do everything we can'' to restrain the competitions, including exploring new treaties with Moscow that would go beyond the New Start treaty of 2010, which she helped negotiate.   Mrs. Clinton proceeded to praise Mr. Perry, saying the more he spoke out publicly and joined with Republican statesmen in trying to curb nuclear arms, ''the better off we'll be in trying to really cut this off.'   ''This is going to be a big issue,'' she added. ''It's not just the nuclear-tipped cruise missile. There's a lot of other money we're taking about to go into refurbishing and modernization.''   ''Do we have to do any of it?'' Mrs. Clinton asked. ''If we have to do some of it, how much do we have to do? That's going to be a tough question, so I will look to people like you and Bill Perry to help me answer that question.''   Mr. Obama has said he wants to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American strategy, and his aides have hinted he may believe the modernization program needs reconsideration. But he seems to have left that to his successor, and the cruise missile Mrs. Clinton spoke about so disparagingly remains in the Pentagon budget.

Warning Russia on Hacking Isn't Enough,"After the stunning disclosures last month that Russia had tried to interfere with the election by hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Obama administration hinted at some kind of retaliation. So far, however, its only known response has been to publicly identify the Russians as the culprits and warn them against interfering again in America's democratic processes.  President Obama should not stop there, as some administration officials suggest he might. Doing so would allow Russia to believe it can operate with impunity in cyberspace and could even invite further hacking. Because Donald Trump, an outspoken  admirer of Vladimir Putin, is unlikely to act, it is up to Mr. Obama to hold the Russian president to account. (Even after intelligence briefings confirming Moscow's involvement, Mr. Trump refused to blame the Russians and said, ''Maybe there is no hacking.'')    A stronger White House response would begin with Mr. Obama revealing more information about how the hacking was done and by whom. He could also decide to disclose Russian computer codes, embarrass wealthy Kremlin officials by exposing their overseas bank accounts and even disable Russian networks. And he could impose sanctions on Russians who were responsible for the hacking or on military leaders who are bombing civilians in Syria. Whatever he decides, the trick will be to do it without igniting a cyberwar.   The hacking involved emails from the Democratic National Committee and from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, which were then leaked to WikiLeaks. Democratic leaders were embarrassed, and Mr. Trump's campaign gained an advantage. ''This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect,'' Adm. Michael Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, said last week.   Mr. Obama is said to have chosen a conservative response to this behavior because he did not wish to invite further Russian interference in the election. Nor did he wish to be seen as acting for political reasons. At least for now, the warnings appear to have halted further Russian cyberattacks. And there is an understandable reluctance in the White House to pre-empt Mr. Obama's successor by taking additional action.   Americans cannot know for certain that the hacking has ended. Many experts doubt that warnings alone will be enough to deter Mr. Putin, who has shown no hesitation in challenging America during the postelection transition by continuing to bomb Aleppo, in Syria, and by installing new nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad, Russia, near the NATO border.   Senator Lindsey Graham has called for congressional hearings to broadly examine Russia's relationship with the United States, including its role in the hacking, while Senator Ben Cardin has suggested imposing new sanctions. Regardless of what Mr. Obama decides, Congress has a responsibility to pursue paths to ensure that the country's electoral system is not similarly compromised in the future.

"Beware, iPhone Users: Fake Retail Apps Are Surging Before Holidays","SAN FRANCISCO - Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple's App Store in recent weeks - just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard's and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo. ""We're seeing a barrage of fake apps,"" said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time. Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless - essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said.  But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple's process for reviewing every app before it is published. That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google's less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company's intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers. In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them. With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pokémon Company, among others. ""It's important that brands monitor how their name is being used,"" he said. Apple removed hundreds of fake apps on Thursday night after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits. ""We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,"" said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. ""We've set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We've removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk."" In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove ""apps that no longer function as intended, don't follow current review guidelines or are outdated."" The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing. Despite Apple's efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple's monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered. ""It's a game of Whac-a-Mole,"" Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said. On Friday, for example, an entity calling itself Overstock Inc. - an apparent attempt to confuse shoppers looking for the online retailer Overstock.com - was peddling Ugg boots and apparel through a fake app that was nearly identical to one banished by Apple on Thursday. The same Chinese app developer, Cloaker Apps, created both fake Ugg apps on behalf of Chinese clients. Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients. ""We hope that our clients are all official sellers,"" he said. ""If they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services."" Mr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi - about $3,000 - for an app written in English. But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, Calif. In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have ""tens of employees"" at the Facebook address. China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts. Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, ""Our angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday."" Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. ""Would give zero stars if possible,"" wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. ""Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over."" Mr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands. ""The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,"" he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard's, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps. But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real. The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store - including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear. Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume. Some of the fake apps have even used Apple's new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store. Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple's tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google's Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said. But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokémon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available. ""The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,"" Mr. Clay said. Emily Feng contributed reporting from Beijing.

Apple's Newest Challenge: Learning How Government Cracked Its iPhone,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Now that the United States government has cracked open an iPhone that belonged to a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting without Apple's help, the tech company is under pressure to find and fix the flaw. But unlike other cases where security vulnerabilities have cropped up, Apple may face a higher set of hurdles in ferreting out and repairing the particular iPhone hole that the government hacked.    The challenges start with the lack of information about the method that the law enforcement authorities, with the aid of a third party, used to break into the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, an attacker in the San Bernardino rampage last year. Federal officials have refused to identify the person, or organization, who helped crack the device, and have declined to specify the procedure used to open the iPhone. Apple also cannot obtain the device to reverse-engineer the problem, the way it would in other hacking situations.    Making matters trickier, Apple's security operation has been in flux. The operation was reorganized late last year. A manager who had been responsible for handling most of the government's data extraction requests left the team to work in a different part of the company, according to four current and former Apple employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the changes. Other employees, among them one whose tasks included trying to hack Apple's own products, left the company over the last few months, they said, while new people have joined.   The situation is in many ways a continuation of the cat-and-mouse game Apple is constantly engaged in with hackers, but the unusually prominent nature of this hacking -- and the fact that the hacker was the United States government -- creates a predicament for the company.   ''Apple is a business, and it has to earn the trust of its customers,'' said Jay Kaplan, chief executive of the tech security company Synack and a former National Security Agency analyst. ''It needs to be perceived as having something that can fix this vulnerability as soon as possible.''   Apple referred to a statement it made on Monday when the government filed to drop its case demanding that the company help it open Mr. Farook's iPhone. ''We will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated,'' Apple said.   Apple has been making many long-term moves to increase the security of its devices. The company's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has told colleagues that he stands by Apple's road map to encrypt everything stored on its devices and services, as well as information stored in Apple's cloud service iCloud, which customers use to back up the data on their mobile devices. Apple engineers have also begun developing new security measures that would make it tougher for the government to open a locked iPhone.   For now, with the dearth of information about the flaw in Mr. Farook's iPhone 5C, which runs Apple's iOS 9 operating system, security experts could only guess at how the government broke into the smartphone.   Forensics experts said the government might have attacked Apple's system using a widely discussed method to extract information from a protected area in the phone by removing a chip and fooling a mechanism that blocks password guessing, in order to find the user's password and unlock the data.   The authorities may have used a procedure that mirrors the phone's storage chip, called a NAND chip, and then copied it onto another chip. Often referred to as ''NAND-mirroring,'' this would allow the F.B.I. to replace the original NAND chip with one that has a copy of that content. If the F.B.I. tried 10 passcodes to unlock the phone and failed, it could then generate a new copy of the phone's content and try another password guess.   ''It's like trying to play the same level on Super Mario Brothers over and over again and just restoring from your saved game every time you kill Mario,'' said Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert.   Newer iPhone models may be less susceptible to NAND-mirroring because they have an upgraded chip known as the A7, with a security processor called the Secure Enclave that has a unique numerical key not known to the company and which is essential to the securing of information stored in the phone.   Security vulnerabilities in Apple products have become increasingly prized by hackers in recent years, given the ubiquity of the company's mobile devices. Yet as interest has grown in attacking Apple's hardware and software, the company's own security teams have been in flux.   Apple previously had two main security teams -- a group called Core OS Security Engineering and a product security team. The product security team included a privacy group that examined whether data was properly encrypted and anonymized, among other functions, according to three former Apple employees. The product security team also had people who reacted to vulnerabilities found by people outside Apple, as well as a proactive team, called RedTeam, which worked to actively hack Apple products.   Last year, the product security team was broken up and the privacy group began reporting to a new manager, the former employees said. The rest of product security -- the proactive and reactive pieces -- was absorbed by the Core OS Security Engineering team, which itself experienced shifts.   The leader of the Core OS Security Engineering team, Dallas DeAtley, left the security division last year to work in a different part of Apple. Mr. DeAtley was one of the few employees who over the years had taken care of government requests to extract data from iPhones. Mr. DeAtley did not respond to requests for comment.   A few other members of the team also departed. Others joined Apple as the company acquired a handful of security outfits last year, including LegbaCore, which previously found and fixed flaws for Apple.   Some of the departures had more to do with market forces, the former Apple employees said. Security professionals are some of the most sought-after engineers in the technology sector.   Whether Apple's security operation will ever obtain information about how the government hacked into Mr. Farook's iPhone remains unclear.   It's possible that the government won't say how it opened the iPhone because the method is ''proprietary to the company that helped the F.B.I.,'' said Stewart A. Baker, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson and the Department of Homeland Security's first assistant secretary for policy.   Within the security community, researchers and professionals said they were incensed that they -- and Apple -- may not find out how the F.B.I. was able to crack Mr. Farook's iPhone.   ''There is very little debate that it is in everyone's best interest that Apple find out about this vulnerability and everyone should be asking why that is not the case,'' said Alex Rice, the chief technology officer at HackerOne, a security company in San Francisco that helps coordinate vulnerability disclosure for corporations.

D.N.C. Hack Raises a Frightening Question: What's Next?; The Interpreter,"If Russia was indeed behind last week's leak of stolen data from the Democratic National Committee, we may be seeing one of the most sordid tools of its domestic politics deployed as a hostile weapon in foreign policy. There is a Russian word for this practice: ""kompromat."" A portmanteau of the Russian words for ""compromising"" and ""material,"" it refers to the timeworn tradition of obtaining information and using it to smear or influence public officials. Unscrupulous Russian politicians have been doing it for decades; there are kompromat websites (which, unsurprisingly, are often blocked or harassed). The way it works is simple. First, Kremlin insiders or other powerful individuals buy, steal or manufacture incriminating information about an opponent, an enemy, or any other person who poses a threat to powerful interests. Then, they publish it, destroying the target's reputation in order to settle public scores or manipulate public events. If American officials and analysts are correct in their assessment that Russia was behind this spring's hack of the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, it seems that kompromat is being translated to the international stage.  The United States has had plenty of experience with hackers, government and otherwise, but the D.N.C. hack is something new. Rather than using the information seized for intelligence purposes, the hackers selected damaging excerpts from the cache of stolen data, and then leaked them at a pivotal moment in the presidential election. And analysts are worried that such activity could soon become a routine element of geopolitics. ""This is not just about the United States, it is not just about Trump or Clinton, or just about American democracy,"" said Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King's College London. ""If they consider this a success, they may conclude that, 'Of course, we can do this elsewhere. We can do this again. We can probably also find things, kompromat, on the next president.' "" Risks with leaks The history of kompromat in Russia shows how damaging this practice can be to democracy and the rule of law. A 2008 article in Wired, for instance, detailed how the Kremlin leaked footage of a well-known broadcaster at an orgy to a website, apparently in order to relieve the Russian government of a prominent news media critic. In another case, leaked surveillance video showed a prosecutor investigating high-level official corruption frolicking in bed with two young prostitutes. (The investigation eventually died.) The term may be Russian, but kompromat is not limited to the country's borders. Chinese officials and businessmen, for instance, have long been rumored to spy on their personal and professional rivals, searching for information that could be used to discredit them. For instance, Bo Xilai, a senior party official who was jailed for corruption in 2013, reportedly wiretapped a call by China's president at the time, Hu Jintao, as part of a widespread surveillance operation that gathered information on party leaders and other powerful individuals, to aid in Mr. Bo's political ambitions. Last week's leak of data stolen from the Democratic National Committee fits that pattern, only now it is playing out in a new arena - in an attack by one state against the political system of another. A future of hacking To be sure, history offers numerous examples of countries, including the United States, meddling in one another's elections. But although the aims may not be new, these technological methods and their potential consequences are. The D.N.C. leak shows that kompromat need not reveal anything illegal to be damaging: The party's chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to step down after party officials were shown to have taken sides during the primaries. This sets a precedent in which virtually anyone who uses email or social media could be vulnerable to any state or private group with a grudge and access to hackers. The Chinese and Russians are used to these tactics to settle political and business rivalries. The D.N.C. hack, in exporting kompromat abroad, has established a precedent that may tempt other hackers foreign and domestic, state-sponsored and private. Because technology makes hacks easier to start than to counter, the risk is difficult to overcome. And anyone with money or expertise can undertake a hack, particularly against nonstate targets that have weaker security systems, and often with little risk of being caught because the attack can be denied. ""In counterintelligence before, there was a kind of granularity of targeting individuals,"" said Adam Segal, who studies cybersecurity at the Council on Foreign Relations and is the author of ""The Hacked World Order."" ""And now with digital technology, you can do that with a scope and scale you couldn't have done before."" In the past, he pointed out, someone who wanted to obtain lurid details of an adversary's sex life would have had to set up a ""honey trap"" operation and then photograph the target in flagrante. ""But now if you break into someone's email,"" Mr. Segal noted, ""you can find a message that 'so-and-so is an idiot,' or their porn history"" - private, personal information that could be tremendously embarrassing or discrediting if released. In that climate, everyone who has something to lose, has enemies, or is a public figure is susceptible to this kind of reputational destruction. The higher a person climbs, the greater the risk becomes - and the greater temptation to a rival. How to respond More attacks may already be on the way. Last year, the federal Office of Personnel Management announced that hackers had breached its computers and stolen vast quantities of data gathered for security clearances and background checks. Mr. Segal said that the stolen data included information on government employees' sex lives, relationships, finances, contacts with foreign governments and other private details. The data, which goes back to 1985, was gathered so that American counterintelligence officers could assess employees' vulnerability to blackmail. But that well-intentioned project may have ended up conveniently cataloging their most vulnerable points for the hackers. And on Friday, federal law enforcement officials revealed that computer systems used by the Clinton campaign had also been hacked in an attack that appeared to have come from Russia's intelligence services. Government offices and political organizations are hardly the only targets. In 2014, North Korea hacked Sony Pictures in retaliation for its release of the film ""The Interview,"" a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. The released emails included information on salaries, Amazon receipts for a network executive's personal-grooming products, and plenty of embarrassing and offensive conversations. It damaged reputations and careers. Analysts said hacking is likely to expand in the realm of foreign policy by giving states a new, low-risk method to tweak one another or to meddle in one another's internal affairs. State-sponsored hacks meant to weaponize information are relatively inexpensive and difficult to defend against, making them a tempting tool. But it is precisely their appeal that gives these tactics the potential to make the international arena more volatile. It is hard to determine responsibility, which creates a risk that states will punish the wrong culprit - or respond too harshly, forcing an unintended cycle of escalation. Because there are no established norms for what is and is not tolerated in such attacks, or for how a targeted state is expected to respond, even the prospect of this kind of hacking creates dangerous uncertainty. This practice is beyond the reach or enforcement of most laws, and outside the scope of the norms that limit states' interference in one another's affairs. And because effective defense is so difficult, it is hard to predict what the limits - or the consequences - of that might be. Follow Amanda Taub on Twitter @amandataub.

U.S. Citizen Living Abroad Returns to Face Charges in Vast Data Breach,"A United States citizen living in Moscow was arrested on Wednesday after he flew to New York to face charges that he stole contact information for more than 100 million customers of American financial institutions, brokerage firms and financial news publishers, the authorities said.  The man, Joshua Samuel Aaron, 32, was arrested at Kennedy Airport. He pleaded not guilty to a federal indictment charging him with conspiracy, computer hacking, securities fraud and wire fraud, among other charges. Mr. Aaron's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said that his client had waived extradition and asylum in Russia and had voluntarily returned to the United States ""to responsibly address the charges."" The prosecution was announced last year by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said that two men had been arrested in Israel after conspiring with Mr. Aaron to carry out ""the single largest theft of customer data from a U.S. financial institution ever."" Mr. Bharara said the thieves took data related to more than 83 million JPMorgan Chase customers in 2014. The prosecutor said that Mr. Aaron was charged with working to break into the networks of dozens of American companies. In a news release issued on Wednesday, Mr. Bharara said the men had engaged in ""what we have called 'hacking as a business model.'"" JPMorgan Chase is the nation's largest bank by assets. A federal court indictment said that identifying information for millions of customers from companies other than JPMorgan Chase had been stolen from 2012 to last summer as well. Mr. Aaron's co-defendants - Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein - were arrested by the Israeli authorities in July 2015 and were extradited from Israel in June. They have also pleaded not guilty. If convicted of the charges, the defendants could face decades in prison. Mr. Aaron pleaded not guilty to the charges during a brief appearance before a magistrate judge. With the consent of his lawyer, he was scheduled to be held overnight pending another court appearance on Thursday before a Federal District Court judge.Related Articles   "
Security Logs of Clinton's Email Server Are Said to Show No Evidence of Hacking,"WASHINGTON --  A former aide to Hillary Clinton has turned over to the F.B.I. computer security logs from Mrs. Clinton's private server, records that showed no evidence of foreign hacking, according to people close to a federal investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails. The security logs bolster Mrs. Clinton's assertion that her use of a personal email account to conduct State Department business while she was the secretary of state did not put American secrets into the hands of hackers or foreign governments.      The former aide, Bryan Pagliano, began cooperating with federal agents last fall, according to interviews with a federal law enforcement official and others close to the case. Mr. Pagliano described how he set up the server in Mrs. Clinton's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and according to two of the people, he provided agents the security logs. The law enforcement official described the interview as routine. Most of those close to the case spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the continuing investigation.   Mrs. Clinton's work-related emails as secretary of state, which have been made public as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, show that she received spam emails intended to try to lure her into clicking a malicious link. Those emails, known as ''spear phishing'' attempts, were traced to Russia, but it was not clear from the emails alone whether anyone clicked on those links or whether the security was compromised.   Mr. Pagliano told the agents that nothing in his security logs suggested that any intrusion occurred. Security logs keep track of, among other things, who accessed the network and when. They are not definitive, and forensic experts can sometimes spot sophisticated hacking that is not apparent in the logs, but computer security experts view logs as key documents when detecting hackers.   Mrs. Clinton's campaign reiterated Mr. Pagliano's information on Thursday. ''We're not aware of any evidence whatsoever that the server was hacked,'' said Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman.   Mrs. Clinton's exclusive use of a private email server prompted an F.B.I. investigation into whether she or her aides mishandled classified information. Of 30,068 emails released by the State Department, 22 have now been classified by the State Department as ''top secret,'' 65 are classified as ''secret,'' and 2,028 have received the lowest classification level of ''confidential.''   The question of whether Mrs. Clinton's server was hacked is separate from whether a crime occurred. But if the information was never compromised, it provides a basis for her supporters to portray Mrs. Clinton's use of a private account as a mistake, but ultimately an inconsequential one.   Barring any changes, the F.B.I. investigation could end by early May. Then the Justice Department will decide whether to file criminal charges and if so, against whom.   Federal law makes it a crime to knowingly remove classified information from secure government channels or to allow classified information to be removed through ''gross negligence.''   Many of the ''secret'' and ''top secret'' emails were written or forwarded by Mrs. Clinton's senior aides. None of the emails were marked classified at the time.   Mr. Pagliano, who last year invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before Congress, cooperated with the F.B.I. under a limited immunity deal. Limited immunity, which means that prosecutors may not use Mr. Pagliano's words against him, is a far more narrow agreement than what is commonly known as ''blanket immunity,'' in which the government promises not to prosecute someone for crimes.   Mark MacDougall, Mr. Pagliano's lawyer, said in an email that the limited immunity deal allowed his client to answer specific questions from investigators freely. ''That's all there is to it,'' Mr. MacDougall said in an email. ''Every citizen has that right. The government has the authority to grant immunity in order to obtain answers. In this case, they exercised that authority, we reached an agreement, and Bryan answered the questions.''   It is common for lawyers to request -- and receive -- such deals before allowing their clients to cooperate. Independent lawyers say that is true even in cases in which witnesses have nothing to hide.   ''Any good lawyer is going to say 'I want immunity before I talk,''' said Barbara Van Gelder, a Washington lawyer with the firm Cozen O'Connor, who has represented numerous witnesses in high-profile congressional and Justice Department investigations. ''Just because someone gets immunity isn't indicative of guilt. It's just protection.''   Mrs. Clinton is the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. While aides see a clear path to the convention in July, the fallout from her emails is likely to create distractions in the weeks ahead. F.B.I. agents could seek to question her closest aides, and possibly Mrs. Clinton herself before they close their case. Mrs. Clinton has offered to meet with investigators and has encouraged her aides to cooperate.

A Bitcoin Believer's Crisis of Faith,"Mike Hearn, a British computer programmer, holed up in his two-bedroom apartment in Zurich over several days and nights last week, writing a cri de coeur. Two years ago, Mr. Hearn quit a cushy programming job at Google's Swiss headquarters to devote himself full time to what was his great passion: the virtual currency Bitcoin. He was one of a handful of developers around the world dedicated to maintaining the basic software that governs both the creation of new Bitcoins and the network on which the financial transactions take place.    But a nasty fight has torn apart the small brotherhood of Bitcoin developers and raised questions about the survival of the virtual currency. Mr. Hearn, until recently one of the most prominent leaders of the Bitcoin project, became so disillusioned that in December he sold the few hundred Bitcoins he had left and quietly took a job at a new start-up.   The impassioned blog post he was working on last week was an announcement that he was leaving Bitcoin behind entirely: ''Bitcoin has gone from being a transparent and open community to one that is dominated by rampant censorship and attacks on bitcoiners by other bitcoiners.''    The dispute -- which grew out of a question about the number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle -- may sound like something of interest only to the most die-hard techies. But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin's commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies.   The divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn's primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats.   These internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency -- including many instances of theft and fraud -- the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts.   Part of the basic appeal of Bitcoin has been its promise to provide a more reliable and trustworthy alternative to existing currencies and financial networks. Unlike the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, institutions that are managed by humans, Bitcoin was supposed to rest on the infallible logic of math and computer code. In this system, programmers like Mr. Hearn, who often volunteered their expertise and effort, were viewed as neutral technicians.   The current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software -- like all computer code -- is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals.   There may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software -- and the virtual currency itself -- in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn's concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins.   Gavin Andresen, a close collaborator of Mr. Hearn's and one of the longest-standing contributors to the Bitcoin software, said the dispute was likely to cause disruptions in the short term, but he disagrees with the notion that it will damage Bitcoin's long-term prospects. Other Bitcoin leaders have expressed a similar sentiment, and investors have been inclined to believe them: The price of a Bitcoin has actually risen in recent months, to about $430 this week.   Some of Mr. Hearn's allies in the battle are hoping the deadlock can be broken if the largest Bitcoin companies get behind something like Bitcoin Classic, a new version of the basic Bitcoin software that was announced this week, and that aims to expand the network's capacity while also introducing new standards of governance.   But Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.   ''It never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,'' Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. ''It's really shaken my faith in humanity.''   An Early Advocate   Mr. Hearn, 31, grew up in Manchester, England, where he played music and went rock climbing in his free time. He was one of the first serious programmers to take an interest in Bitcoin, back in April 2009, just a few months after its mysterious founder, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, let it loose in the world.   At the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he'd had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.   ''So many questions,'' Mr. Hearn wrote. ''But it's rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.''   Like many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling.   Satoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn't like, they didn't have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy -- a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws.   It took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project.   Mr. Hearn joined a small but growing group of volunteers who worked on the basic Bitcoin software from various corners of the globe -- the most committed of whom became known as the core developers. They met in person only a handful of times, but they would chat constantly online and send emails discussing potential changes. The leader of this effort, after Satoshi bowed out in 2011 (without ever revealing a real identity), was Mr. Andresen, a genial father of two from central Massachusetts who kept everyone on the same page.   Mr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes -- as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left.   Mr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up.   When tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises.   Things Turn Sour   The bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions.   The problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through.   When Mr. Hearn began pushing for changes to the core Bitcoin software to allow for larger blocks of transaction data, he faced immediate resistance. Gregory Maxwell, a largely self-taught programmer who had worked on Wikipedia and the Mozilla web browser, both open-source projects, said that larger blocks of transaction data would be harder for ordinary computers to process. The result, Mr. Maxwell warned, would be to hand control over the network to big companies that could afford powerful computers.   For Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority.   ''It's far from clear to me that the world will get a second shot at this in the next several decades if Bitcoin lapses into the same-old, same-old,'' he wrote to other developers.   Mr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn't such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin's existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second.   The debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell's start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important.   After leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley.   As the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart.   In the past, the leader of the Bitcoin software project, Mr. Andresen (no relation to Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz), would have stepped in to mediate. Mr. Andresen says that as ''lead maintainer'' he always sought consensus, but on the few occasions when there was irresolvable disagreement, he made the final call, acting as a sort of ''benevolent dictator.'' But Mr. Andresen stepped back from his day-to-day role in 2014 and gave the job of lead maintainer to another volunteer on the project, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a Dutch programmer, who said he did not intend to follow Mr. Andresen's lead.   ''I cannot be the decider for network-level issues,'' Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. ''No one 'owns' Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it's some kind of company.''   Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software -- largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions -- which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system's users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land -- what is known in open-source terminology as a fork.   Forks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins.   ''So this is it. Here we are. The community is divided, and Bitcoin is forking,'' Mr. Hearn wrote on Aug. 15, announcing the new software.   The release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts -- not by populist campaigns.   In an interview with Vice a few days after the announcement, Mr. Maxwell compared the Bitcoin XT team to a ''guy standing on the sidelines with a beer cup hat.'' One of Mr. Maxwell's confidants likened it to an attempted coup. Their supporters blocked Mr. Hearn's announcement of Bitcoin XT -- and any discussion of it -- from the Bitcoin.org website and several other online forums where Bitcoin members met to discuss the project.   The fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it.   The hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone ''payed me for killing XT'' -- though he declined to say who was responsible.   In the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell's allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network's capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn't go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position.   ''It's likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,'' he said in an interview last week.   Mr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn's camp -- saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor.   An Uncertain Future   Mr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making.   Mr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed.   Despite the discord, Mr. Hearn has not lost faith in all of the ideas behind Bitcoin. The start-up in New York where he has taken a job, R3, is developing Bitcoin-like networks for banks to enable cheaper and faster ways to trade assets of all sorts. The start-up aims to take advantage of the less-centralized record-keeping methods of Bitcoin, but still allow for someone to be in charge, to handle the software and to manage access to the system.   This work lacks the purity of Bitcoin, but after months of sleepless nights, fretting about betrayed promises, he said, ''I want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.''

$50 Million Hacking May Scuttle a Virtual Currency Project,"A hacker on Friday siphoned more than $50 million of digital money away from an experimental virtual currency project that had been billed as the most successful crowdfunding venture ever -- taking with him not just a third of the venture's money but also the hopes and dreams of thousands of participants who wanted to prove the safety and security of digital currency. The attack most likely puts an end to the project, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, which had raised $160 million in the form of Ether, an alternative to the digital currency Bitcoin. While the computer scientists involved in the project are aiming to tweak the code that underpins Ether in a way that will recover the money, the theft is nevertheless prompting a bigger debate about the viability and principles of virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ether.    ''This is one of the nightmare scenarios everyone was worried about: Someone exploited a weakness in the code of the D.A.O. to empty out a large sum,'' Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell who co-wrote a paper pointing out problems with the project, said on Friday.    Central banks and financial firms have been exploring how to use the technology underlying virtual currencies -- known as blockchain -- to improve their own internal systems. The technology is considered to have advantages in terms of transparency and security. Just last week, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told central bankers at a trade industry conference that they should accelerate their efforts to explore blockchain.   But the incident on Friday provided another reminder of how the code can be just as vulnerable to human greed and mistakes as paper bills.   The D.A.O. was meant to be a standard-bearer for online currency ventures. It was funded by investors from around the world using Ether, which has become popular over the last year. But just before the project stopped raising money in late May, computer scientists pointed out several vulnerabilities in its underlying code -- effectively warning that what happened to the experimental consortium would be possible or even likely.   ''The D.A.O. is being attacked,'' Griff Green, a community organizer with the company that wrote the project's software, Slock.it, wrote on a chat channel for the project Friday morning. ''This is not a drill.''   The money that the hacker moved appeared to be frozen on Friday as a result of a safeguard previously built into the code. The thief was caught in what might be thought of as a digital version of the airtight double doors that sometimes protect valuable sites (known in security circles as man traps).   Programmers working on the Ethereum network, which hosts Ether, were debating on Friday whether to make a one-time change to the code to recover the frozen money. That faced immediate opposition from many virtual currency purists who were attracted to the technology because of its ostensible freedom from human meddling.   ''The strength of blockchain tech is that it is a ledger, a statement of truth,'' Bruce Fenton, a board member with the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote on Friday. ''That ledger is only as good as its resistance to censorship, change, demands or attack.''   If the leaders of the Ethereum project decide to move forward with a change to the code -- known as a fork -- they will need to win the support of the people who lend their computing power to the network, and who have what amounts to a vote over any changes to the Ethereum software.   The hacking on Friday underscored the complicated governance structure employed by so-called cryptocurrencies. These currencies are not run by any company or individual but by the computers of anyone who chooses to support the network.   The D.A.O. was supposed to be a further extension of this concept of group decision-making. Thousands of people around the world financed the project by sending in Ether. The D.A.O. was supposed to act as a sort of venture capital fund, investing in projects that were voted upon by people who contributed money. The attack on Friday took place before any projects had been funded.   The specific mechanism the hackers used is known as a recursive call vulnerability, -- essentially a malicious transaction that moves money away from the D.A.O. into a side fund in an endlessly repeating loop.   The attack led to chaos on the online message boards where D.A.O. investors and Ether users gather.   ''How can we help and protect our funds?'' one user wrote on the Slack chat channel for D.A.O. investors.   The programmers who wrote the D.A.O. code immediately suggested that investors vote to move their money to another, unrelated project known as Congo Split, primarily to protect their investments.   ''The community needs to spam the network so that it can mount a counterattack,'' Stephan Tual, an employee with Slock.it, wrote on that company's website. Programmers with Slock.it wrote the code for the D.A.O. but said they had no formal continuing role with the project.   By the time it was over, the hacker had managed to gain control of 3.6 million Ether -- more than a third of the 11.5 million that were there at the beginning of the day.   ''The D.A.O.'s journey is over,'' Mr. Tual said in an email on Friday.   The incident on Friday was a reminder of the dozens of hacking attacks and thefts that have rattled Bitcoin since it was released in early 2009. In 2014, Mt. Gox, which was previously the largest Bitcoin exchange, announced that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin.   The attacks on Bitcoin have generally led to a temporary lull in public interest in virtual currencies. But Bitcoin has bounced back each time. Over the last week, the price of Bitcoin has risen swiftly to the highest level since the Mt. Gox fiasco; it stood at $770 on Thursday night.   Some of the recent demand for Bitcoin has come from anticipation of a coming event known as halving. Currently, the Bitcoin software releases 25 new coins -- a block -- every 10 minutes or so to computers helping support the network. In mid-July, the blocks will shrink to 12.5 coins. The shrinking supply has led some to assume that the price will go up.   The price of Ether had been rising alongside Bitcoin over the last month, in part because of the interest generated by the D.A.O. On Thursday, both were up more than 60 percent over the previous month. But the attack Friday morning sent the price of Ether into a downward spiral.   By Friday afternoon, the price of Ether had fallen 33 percent from its high a day earlier, to around $13. Bitcoin had also fallen, though less sharply, to around $750.   The founder and lead programmer on the Ethereum project, Vitalik Buterin, wrote on Friday that he supported a change to the code that would reclaim the money from the hacker. But he said he recognized that he might not win the argument.   ''I recognize that there are very heavy arguments on both sides, and that either direction would have seen very heavy opposition,'' Mr. Buterin wrote on Reddit.   Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor, wrote: ''There is no good solution here.''     "
New Clinton Emails Show Mixed Concerns on Security of Information,"WASHINGTON --  On a Friday morning in June 2011, after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had waited more than 12 hours for a set of talking points to be sent to her, a top aide told her the delay was because staff members were having problems sending faxes that would be secure from probing eyes. ''If they can't, turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure,'' Mrs. Clinton responded in an email released early Friday by the State Department, one of about 3,000 newly released pages of Mrs. Clinton's emails during her time as secretary of state. Of those, 66 documents contained classified information.     The note she sent to the top aide, Jacob J. Sullivan, instructing him how to strip sensitive material of official markings and send it in a ''nonsecure'' way is heavily redacted, so it is unknown what the talking points were about.   But that and other messages provide a window into Mrs. Clinton's approach to handling email and other communications, at times cavalier, at times calculated to ensure information would not fall into the wrong hands. She even seemed taken aback upon learning that an officer, like herself, had used a personal email address for official business.   In February 2011, senior aides sent Mrs. Clinton a dispatch from the officer, John Godfrey, analyzing the situation in Libya. She asked whom he worked for. When told he was a State Department employee, she responded, ''I was surprised that he used personal email account if he is at State.''   In January 2010, she admonished two officials not to forward a message she had just sent them, and to ''delete after reading'' because she had failed to remove the email addresses of the original senders.   The instructions were sent to Rajiv Shah, then the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, and Cheryl D. Mills, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, five minutes after she had forwarded them email messages from her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky. Her daughter had written under the alias Diane Reynolds about an outbreak of diarrhea and measles in Haiti.   The 1,262 documents posted online early Friday were part of a monthly disclosure ordered by a court after the revelation that Mrs. Clinton had used a private email server while she was secretary of state.   They were made public in line with a court order that the State Department release 82 percent of the 55,000 pages of documents Mrs. Clinton turned over last year by the end of 2015, a deadline the department missed last week.   The latest release was also chaotic; it was originally expected on Thursday evening, then at midnight, and finally took place at 1:39 a.m. Friday. Even then, the Internet database where the emails were posted was not searchable by sender, recipient or subject, as past releases have been.   The emails emerged one day after the inspector general released a report that found that the State Department provided an ''inaccurate or incomplete'' response to a government watchdog group when it said in 2013 that it had no records related to Mrs. Clinton's use of alternate email addresses while she was secretary of state, even though senior officials there knew she was using a private account.    The report said the failure was part of a longstanding pattern of dysfunction in how the department handles Freedom of Information Act requests, and officials there have said they are working to rectify the problems.   With the latest cache, the State Department has released 43,148 pages of Mrs. Clinton's emails. None of the material in Friday's batch was marked classified at the time it was sent, but 65 of the documents have since been deemed ''confidential'' -- the lowest level of classification -- and one as ''secret,'' a more sensitive ranking.   The emails included a condolence note after the death of J. Christopher Stevens, the American ambassador to Libya killed in the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a United States compound in Benghazi, from Bob Bergdahl, the father of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.   Sergeant Bergdahl was being held at the time by the Taliban in Afghanistan, and would later be released in 2014 in a prisoner swap engineered by the Obama administration; he is now facing a court-martial for desertion.   ''The 'crusade' paradigm will never be forgotten in this part of the world and we force our diplomats to carry a lot of baggage around while walking on eggshells,'' the elder Mr. Bergdahl wrote in the note, which asked that condolences be conveyed to everyone in the Foreign Service and was transmitted to Mrs. Clinton.   ''Pls prepare a response,'' she replied.   Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.     "
Antitrust Chief Takes Swipe in Privacy Issue,"MUNICH --  Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's antitrust chief, warned on Sunday that the collection of a vast amount of users' data by a small number of tech companies like Google and Facebook could be in violation of the region's tough competition rules. Ms. Vestager's comments are the latest in a growing chorus of European criticism about the privacy practices of American tech giants, many of which rely on crunching data based on people's social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases to fuel their digital advertising businesses.     The comments by Ms. Vestager, who, as the region's top competition official, has sweeping powers to fine companies that are found to abuse their dominant market positions, show that European officials are stepping up their fight to strengthen data protection. In the European Union, an individual's right to privacy is viewed on par with other fundamental rights like freedom of expression.   ''If a few companies control the data you need to cut costs, then you give them the power to drive others out of the market,'' Ms. Vestager said at the DLD conference, a gathering of digital executives and policy makers.   She said that ''it's hard to know'' how much data is given up when using an online messaging service.    ''But it's a business transaction, not a free giveaway,'' she continued. ''As consumers, we need to be treated fairly.''   Ms. Vestager's warning shot in the often-rancorous privacy debate comes ahead of a Jan. 31 deadline for Europe and the United States to reach a new data-sharing agreement.   The new so-called safe harbor agreement is needed after the European Court of Justice ruled last year that Europeans' digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. Negotiations between the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and the United States Commerce Department are continuing -- though legal experts, government officials and industry watchers think that an agreement may not be reached by the end of the month.   A number of European executives echoed Ms. Vestager's fears about how a small number of American tech companies could use their large-scale data collection to favor their own services over those of rivals. Among them was Oliver Samwer, the German entrepreneur who co-founded Rocket Internet, one of the region's most high-profile tech companies.   ''If someone like Google or Facebook has all of the data, then that's not good,'' Mr. Samwer said here on Sunday.   But for Ms. Vestager, a 47-year-old Danish politician who has garnered both fans and detractors for her ambitious competition activities, adding data protection to her portfolio could prove difficult.   She has already begun, for example, investigations into Apple's tax practices in Ireland and has started a wide-ranging inquiry into e-commerce that analysts say could encompass the likes of Amazon, among others.   Ms. Vestager also brought antitrust charges against Google last April, saying the search giant had unfairly favored some of its digital services over those of rivals. An announcement in that case is expected in late spring, according to officials, while a separate European investigation continues into whether Google used Android, its popular mobile software, to unfairly restrict rivals from operating in the 28-member bloc.   On Sunday, Ms. Vestager denied claims that Europe was unfairly targeting American tech companies, although some executives in the United States have claimed that European officials are trying to bolster local technology companies at the expense of their large American rivals.   Ms. Vestager added that she was not against further consolidation within the industry, despite European antitrust officials' balking at a number of recent proposed takeovers in the region's telecommunications sector that they said would reduce competition at the consumer level. Future mergers, she said, should not reduce consumer choice and worsen market competition.   ''You can't just go out there and buy yourself a monopoly,'' Ms. Vestager said.     "
No Deal Yet in U.S. Talks With Europe About Data,"American and European officials failed on Sunday to reach an agreement over how digital data -- including financial information and social media posts -- could be transferred between the two regions. Despite last-minute talks, the two sides remained far apart on specific details required to approve a comprehensive deal. Without an agreement, companies that regularly move data, including tech giants like Google and nontech companies like General Electric, could find themselves in murky legal waters.    European and American officials had until Sunday evening to meet a deadline set by Europe's national privacy agencies, some of which have promised aggressive legal action if the current negotiations founder. Those agencies will publish their own judgment on how data can be moved safely between the two regions on Wednesday.   With time ticking down, the two sides are now hoping to agree to a broad deal before European national regulators act on Wednesday, according to several officials with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.    Still, negotiators said sticking points remained -- including over how Europeans' data would be protected from surveillance by the American government and how Europeans could seek legal remedies in American courts -- and neither side could guarantee the final outcome.   The rules governing the transfer of online data have become a vital issue for many businesses. Facebook and Google, for example, use the information to help tailor the advertisements that are central to their businesses. Many nontech companies, like G.E., move data related to their customers and employees, as well as on how their products are used.   No big American company is expected to change how it does business immediately. But many have gathered teams of lawyers to protect themselves in case no deal emerges.   ''There's a lot of uncertainty,'' said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of the Linklaters law firm, who represents companies that may become tangled up in the standoff. ''We need a solution. Global business relies on transferring data. You cannot stop that.''   The most recent talks have been taking place in Brussels. Senior officials from the Commerce Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other American agencies traveled there last week. They have been meeting with the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union that is in charge of the negotiations, along with senior national politicians from across Europe.   With the talks increasingly stalled, Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, was expected to call Vera Jourova, the European commissioner of justice, on Sunday in the hopes of brokering a deal.   The negotiations began three months ago after Europe's highest court invalidated a 15-year-old data-transfer pact, a so-called safe harbor agreement. The judges ruled that Europeans' data was not sufficiently protected when being transferred to the United States.   European and American negotiators had been talking for years about a new deal, but the court's decision -- which went into effect immediately -- made action increasingly urgent.   In recent weeks, American officials have offered a number of concessions to their European counterparts. They include increased oversight over American intelligence agencies' access to European data, according to several officials involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   American officials have also proposed the creation of a so-called data ombudsman within the State Department. That office, according to officials, would give Europeans a direct point of contact in the United States if they believed government agencies had misused their data. Europeans also may seek arbitration directly with American companies that they accuse of unlawfully using their digital information.   European officials, though, have expressed doubts that those moves would hold up if challenged in European courts. They have asked the Americans to provide specific details about how the current proposals would work in practice, according to two officials. In particular, Europeans want more information on the limits to American intelligence agencies' access to European data, and on how Europeans can file legal claims in the United States.   American officials have argued that their proposals will stand up to European legal challenges. They also believe the United States has levels of data protection comparable to those in the European Union, where privacy is valued as highly as freedom of expression.   ''We've agreed to make major changes,'' Bruce H. Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, said on Jan. 15. ''The U.S. takes individuals' privacy very seriously.''   Any company -- large or small -- that transfers information between the two regions may face legal challenges. But the most likely targets for litigation, privacy advocates say, are large American tech giants like Google and Facebook that rely so heavily on people's data.   Several of Europe's national data regulators, including Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, the French privacy chief who is chairwoman of a Pan-European data protection group, have said they will back a new data-transfer agreement if all of Europe's privacy rights are upheld in the United States.   But if a new pact is not approved -- or does not meet national regulators' standards -- some European privacy watchdogs may demand new limits on the movement of data.   Several consumer groups plan to file complaints about how companies transfer data as soon as Monday, arguing that people's rights are not upheld when information is moved to the United States.   ''These issues are going to end up back in court,'' said Peter Swire, a law professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who helped negotiate the original safe harbor agreement while working for the Clinton administration.   The importance of the deal to the companies and privacy groups has crystallized in recent weeks, as American executives and government officials made it a top priority.   At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for instance, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of the social network Facebook, held high-level discussions with a number of European and American politicians to voice the company's concerns about the pending deadline, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.   Secretary Pritzker also met with Andrus Ansip, the European official in charge of the region's digital agenda, among other local policy makers, at Davos to discuss the new pact.   On their way to negotiations in Brussels, a delegation of American officials made a stop in Paris last week, sitting down with a group of European national regulators to address concerns over how their citizens' data was used in the United States.   In Brussels, several trade groups regularly shuttled between meetings with senior European officials last week. The groups representing the tech industry came armed with a series of legal opinions from leading data protection experts that played down the differences in the way privacy was handled in the two regions.   The legal arguments included details about why current United States rules were on par with those of Europe -- a view that critics of America's position jumped on almost immediately.   ''That assessment just isn't true,'' said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has called for stronger data protection rules. ''There's a massive difference over how this issue is treated in Europe compared to the U.S.''     "
Deal Struck to Balance U.S.-Europe Data Fears,"European officials on Tuesday agreed to a deal with the United States that would let Google, Amazon and thousands of other businesses continue moving people's digital data, including social media posts and financial information, back and forth across the Atlantic. With billions of dollars of business potentially at stake, the data-transfer deal was the result of more than three months of often tense negotiations between United States and European Union policy makers, who have clashed over what level of privacy individuals can expect when companies and government agencies follow ever-expanding digital footprints.    Part of the challenge is balancing individuals' privacy concerns with national security obligations, particularly in light of mounting fears about international terrorism.   The agreement announced on Tuesday aims to address those privacy concerns and strike that balance by including written guarantees by the United States -- to be reviewed annually -- that American intelligence agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans' digital data when it is sent across the Atlantic. Whether that provision will reassure privacy-rights groups remains to be seen.    Many obstacles still await the deal, which must be officially approved by the European Union's 28 member states. National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.   The data-transfer agreement, replacing a 15-year-old pact that Europe's highest court struck down in October, is intended to let the free flow of digital data -- the lifeblood of many global businesses -- continue as usual.   In seeking to ensure the continued free flow of data, the deal announced on Tuesday could especially benefit big American companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon that tend to dominate Internet searches, social media and digital commerce in Europe. But it is also meant to let nontech companies like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial conglomerate General Electric continue to send customer and employee data between the United States and Europe.   Europe's privacy watchdogs had demanded that European and American officials agree to a new deal by Jan. 31. Although negotiators missed that deadline, they had been meeting almost continuously in Brussels since Sunday to reach an agreement. They were driven by a sense of urgency, as industry executives and trade bodies on both sides of the Atlantic worried that the means for transferring data between two of the world's largest economies remained in jeopardy.   Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.   The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.   These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe's more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.   ''We will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,'' Vera Jourova, the European Union's justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.   The new deal ''is a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,'' Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. ''It provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.''   Both sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.   But the deal's first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe's increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.   Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people's digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans' data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.   ''We are part of the game,'' Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France's privacy chief, said in an interview last month in Paris. ''If you provide these services, then you have to protect people's privacy rights.''   Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.   The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.   John Higgins, the group's director general, called in a statement for national privacy agencies ''to view this signal from the European Commission as a sign of good faith and to hold off with any potential enforcement action until the new agreement has been fully implemented.''   Privacy groups, though, expressed concern that the data-transfer deal does not comply with European law, which views an individual's right to privacy almost on par with freedom of expression.   Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.   ''The problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,'' said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.   Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.   In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans' data.   The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.   Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency's surveillance of foreign citizens.   During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies' use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.   National security arguments had become more vehement following the terrorist attacks in Paris last November, those officials said. United States ambassadors had defended the integrity of oversight of American intelligence agencies in discussions with senior politicians in countries like France, Germany and Britain in recent weeks, according to the officials who asked to remain anonymous.    But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states' national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.   ''This isn't going to be a one-off decision by the commission,'' said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. ''We have achieved effective protection of Europeans' rights.''     "
"Torn, but Obama Nods to Security","WASHINGTON -- For years, President Obama has struggled to reconcile a civil libertarian's belief in personal privacy with a commander in chief's imperatives for the nation's security. This week, security won.    The decision by Mr. Obama's Justice Department to force Apple to help it breach an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino terrorists has ended, at least for now, the president's attempts to straddle the feud over encryption between Silicon Valley and law enforcement.   Asked about the president's backing of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's inquiry into San Bernardino, one of the worst terror attacks in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Obama's press secretary declared on Wednesday that ''the F.B.I. can count on the full support of the White House.''    The decision may have been all but inevitable for Mr. Obama, who every morning receives a classified intelligence briefing about the terrorist threats facing the United States. But he took the position after years of trying to find middle ground on the issue.   In a meeting with technology company executives in the Situation Room last spring, Mr. Obama pleaded with them to allow national security and law enforcement officials some access to private data, according to one participant in the room. In an interview last year with Re/Code, a technology website, Mr. Obama lamented being stuck, ''smack-dab in the middle of these tensions.''   ''I think he realizes there's no clear-cut answer here,'' said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a Democrat who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. ''But if ever there was going to be a nod to the law enforcement view, this was the one to do it.''   For much of his presidency, Mr. Obama has been unwilling to become a champion for either side, even as technological advances in encryption made a clash between privacy and security inevitable.   After Edward J. Snowden exposed some of the government's most secret surveillance programs in 2013, the president repeatedly expressed support for the protection of user data on iPhones and other devices. But he also acknowledged the ''legitimate need'' to penetrate encryption, especially during terror investigations.   Starting in 2010, top law enforcement officials for Mr. Obama, including officials at the F.B.I., began pushing for legislation to force technology companies to ensure that law enforcement agencies could have access to personal data. By 2015, Mr. Obama's administration had backed away from support for a new law, saying the president preferred to seek cooperation with Silicon Valley instead.   Mr. Obama has a close relationship with Silicon Valley -- he has dinners with its tech titans and raises money there -- but like his predecessors, he has been torn by the responsibilities he faces every day: securing the country against terrorists, supporting criminal investigations and prosecuting a war against extremists who are increasingly turning to encrypted technologies to evade detection.   ''There are times where folks who see this through a civil liberties or privacy lens reject that there's any trade-offs involved, and in fact there are,'' Mr. Obama said in the interview with Re/Code. ''We can't pretend that there are no trade-offs whatsoever.''   Several former Obama administration officials said they believed the president personally leaned, at least slightly, toward the view that technology companies must be allowed to secure personal data if they want to earn the trust of their customers.   He also understands, they said, the problems that could arise if governments like China and Russia demand the same backdoor access to American technologies that the F.B.I. wants. In the same interview, he said, ''I lean probably further in the direction of strong encryption than some do inside of law enforcement.''   But some civil libertarians view Mr. Obama as, at best, a weak supporter of their views and one who has too often been swayed by his national security and law enforcement apparatus.   Some of those civil libertarians said Thursday that Mr. Obama's vocal support for the F.B.I.'s aggressive legal tactics against Apple was evidence that the president is too willing to accede to the demands of his national security advisers. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive, who in the past has expressed deep respect for Mr. Obama, has vowed to fight the order.   ''This is yet another disappointment in a string of disappointments when it comes to privacy,'' said Kevin Bankston, the director of the Open Technology Institute at the New America Foundation.   Mr. Bankston said the F.B.I.'s decision to choose the San Bernardino case to press, legally, had been a smart way to put pressure on Mr. Obama and the technology companies. But he urged the president to consider the broader implications for privacy if Apple loses the case.   ''The fact that it's linked to the shootings makes it much more difficult politically,'' Mr. Bankston said. ''But the answer is to highlight that it's not just about this case. It's about every encrypted device.''   Mr. Schiff said the specifics of the California case might provide courts with the ability to narrow that impact. The phone in the case was owned by the terrorist's employer, who has given permission for law enforcement to search it. To do that, officials need Apple's help. If courts agree with the government, they might attempt to apply their ruling in limited cases.   Regardless of the outcome of the case, any final resolution is unlikely to come before Mr. Obama leaves office early next year -- timing that in some ways works for the president.   ''Taking this case to the courts buys the administration a bit more time on these issues,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''This is a very challenging issue for the administration. There simply is no easy answer.''   Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.     "
Gates Says Government Must Find a Balance on Privacy and Safety,"Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist and a founder of Microsoft, has injected his voice into the fierce debate over how far Silicon Valley should go in assisting the government on criminal investigations. There's no easy answer, he said during an interview with Bloomberg News, but the discussion is welcome.    In an interview published Tuesday morning with The Financial Times, the newspaper portrayed Mr. Gates as siding with the government in its attempt to force Apple to help investigators extract data from an iPhone that belonged to an attacker in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.    ''This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information,'' Mr. Gates told the newspaper. ''They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case.''   Later, speaking with Bloomberg News, he said the newspaper had gone too far in characterizing his allegiances.   ''I do believe that with the right safeguards there are cases where the government, on our behalf, like stopping terrorism which could get worse in the future, that that is valuable,'' he said. ''But striking that balance -- clearly the government's taken information historically and used it in ways that we didn't expect going all the way back, say, to the F.B.I. under J. Edgar Hoover.''   Since Apple challenged a court ruling on extracting data from the phone last week, most technology industry leaders have either lined up behind Apple or stayed silent. Several prominent Silicon Valley leaders -- including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive; Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter; and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive -- have cautiously indicated support for Apple's position that the order posed an unacceptable threat to user privacy.   Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has forcefully argued that the order by a federal magistrate judge to assist the government in getting data from the accused terrorist's phone would open a so-called back door to consumer phones that could obliterate the privacy protections.   ''At stake is the data security of hundreds of millions of law-abiding people, and setting a dangerous precedent that threatens everyone's civil liberties,'' Mr. Cook said in an internal email sent to Apple employees this week.   The government has portrayed its request as limited in nature, a one-time demand focused on a single device, the work phone issued to Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino gunmen who killed 14 people late last year.   The order was issued on Feb. 16 by Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of Federal District Court for the District of Central California. Apple has until Friday to file a formal brief opposing the order to cooperate with the F.B.I.   The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey Jr., made the case in a public statement on Sunday. ''We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly,'' he said. ''That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.''   In a video interview on Monday with The Associated Press, Mr. Gates said, ''It's a good debate to be having. I'm hopeful that government safeguards, and it varies country to country, will be enough that people will feel like this can work.''   He added: ''The courts are going to rule, and it will be good to have that precedent. I do think people want the government to act on their behalf that they feel like the safeguards are there.''     "
U.S. Will Try to Open Phone Without Apple,"RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- The Justice Department said on Monday that it might no longer need Apple's assistance in opening an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year. The disclosure led a judge to postpone a court hearing over the issue and temporarily sidesteps what has become a bitter clash with the world's most valuable publicly traded company.    In a new court filing, the government said an outside party had demonstrated a way for the F.B.I. to possibly unlock the phone used by the gunman, Syed Rizwan Farook. The hearing in the contentious case -- Apple has loudly opposed opening the iPhone, citing privacy concerns and igniting a heated debate -- was originally set for Tuesday.    While the Justice Department must test this method, if it works ''it should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple,'' it said in its filing. The Justice Department added that it would file a status report by April 5 on its progress.   The change is a reprieve in the clash that has erupted over how and when the authorities should use the troves of digital data collected and stored by tech companies. The two sides have traded barbs over the issue since last month, when Apple received a court order demanding that the company weaken the security of the iPhone so law enforcement officials could gain access to the data in it.   The case has been viewed as a watershed moment in the debate over privacy and security.   Apple had opposed the court order, arguing that it would be a slippery slope that could force the company to open many iPhones, thus compromising the privacy of its customers and the strength of its product security. President Obama said this month that the law enforcement authorities must be able to legally collect information from smartphones and other devices, adding that he opposed the stance on encryption taken by tech companies like Apple.   Late on Monday, Judge Sheri N. Pym, the federal magistrate judge in the United States District Court for the Central District of California who was set to hold the hearing, agreed to grant the Justice Department's motion to postpone the hearing.   The emergence of a potential third-party method to open the iPhone was a surprise, as the government said more than a dozen times in court filings that it could open the phone only with Apple's help. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., also reiterated that point several times during a hearing before Congress on March 1.   The new method could forestall, but is unlikely to entirely head off, a showdown between Silicon Valley and the Justice Department over encryption.   ''This will only delay an inevitable fight over whether the government can force Apple to break the security of its devices,'' said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group.   For the Justice Department, cracking the iPhone would be a mixed blessing. While it would give investigators access to data that they see as crucial to a terrorism investigation, it would cut short the encryption debate that the F.B.I. had been trying to start for years before the Apple case came along.   While contentious, the Apple case neatly crystallized that debate in a way that abstract discussions never had. The court fight, regardless of its outcome, would have increased the likelihood that Congress took up legislation to address the issue. Shelving the San Bernardino case could remove a sense of immediacy on the topic.   The case could flare anew in court if the third-party method for opening the iPhone falters. In a conference call late Monday, a federal law enforcement official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said the government legally had to explore all outside methods of opening up the iPhone. If the government exhausted those options, then it could turn back to the courts to compel Apple to help open the device.   The law enforcement official declined to name the outside party that approached investigators with a possible method for opening the phone. He said that investigators were cautiously optimistic about getting data from the phone, but that further testing is required.   The government has been using the All Writs Act, a legal statute that dates to 1789, as a key underpinning of its case.   ''The issue at hand is whether the government can use the All Writs Act to force an unwilling third party, Apple, to create what it claims is a back door,'' said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who filed a brief on behalf of law enforcement groups that supported the Justice Department in this case. '' But if it can find a willing third party to break into the phone, then the All Writs Act argument is moot.''   In a statement, Melanie Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the F.B.I. had continued to work on ways to gain access to the contents of the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, even as the fight between Apple and the government was unfolding.   A senior Apple executive, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity late Monday, said should the government fail to unlock the phone and continue its fight with the company, Apple would want to know more about the outside party that has claimed it can break into the iPhone, in order to learn what methods could circumvent the company's security features. The executive said that Apple had no knowledge of what capability the government might soon have and that it learned about it on Monday.   In the meantime, Apple has continued to repeat its message of privacy. At a product event on Monday at the company's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, emphasized a philosophy of helping to protect users' data.   ''This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility,'' Mr. Cook said.     "
Google Fined in France Over 'Right to Be Forgotten',"Google is once again in trouble with Europe's authorities about privacy. The company was fined $112,000 on Thursday by France's data protection watchdog for failing to comply with demands to extend a European privacy ruling across its global domains, including Google.com in the United States.     The financial penalty -- a paltry sum compared to Google's $75 billion in annual revenue -- relates to the ''right to be forgotten'' ruling issued in 2014 by Europe's top court. The ruling allows anyone with connections to Europe to ask search engines like Google to remove links about themselves from online results.   Google has fought hard to limit the legal decision to its European operations like Google.fr in France, saying that applying the ruling worldwide would infringe people's freedom of expression.   But French privacy regulators, among others, have demanded that the company apply the ''right to be forgotten'' across its global domains to comply with Europe's tough data protection rules that enshrine an individual's privacy as a fundamental human right.   On Thursday, France's privacy regulator said its citizens' rights could be upheld only if the European privacy decision was applied globally, and that Google had failed to remove -- or ''delist'' -- links from search results outside the European Union.   ""For people residing in France to effectively exercise their right to be delisted, it must be applied to the entire processing operation, i.e. to all of the search engine's extensions,'' the agency, known as the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, or CNIL, said in a statement.   Google said that it would appeal the decision, adding that it had adopted Europe's privacy ruling across its European operations.   ""We disagree with the CNIL's assertion that it has the authority to control the content that people can access outside France,'' the Silicon Valley company said in a statement.   Google is facing the new regulatory headache as it also grapples with antitrust investigations in Europe over whether it unfairly favored some of its own online services over those of rivals. Europe's competition officials are expected to rule on those charges in the coming months. Google is also facing a separate investigation into whether its Android smartphone operating system may have breached the region's antitrust rules.   Google has pushed back at some of the charges, particularly connected to the competition investigations, where the company may face billions of dollars in fines if found to have breached local rules.   Yet in the privacy case, Google agreed last month to block access to certain disputed links from all of its domains -- including the main United States one, Google.com -- when those sites were accessed from Europe.   That represented a significant change from Google's previous efforts to limit the ''right to be forgotten'' ruling after a number of European national privacy regulators expressed concerns that their citizens' rights were not protected.   Despite this olive branch, Google was unable to convince French authorities that it was now in compliance with the country's privacy rules.   Google's proposed solution, France's privacy regulator said on Thursday, ''does not give people effective protection of their right to be delisted.''     "
E.U. Likely to Approve Data Pact With U.S.,"European officials are expected to approve a new agreement with the United States aimed at helping companies like General Electric and Google, among others, move online data between the two regions despite concerns about how the digital information of Europeans may be retrieved by the American government. The decision, according to a draft of the agreement obtained by The New York Times, is based on renewed assurances by United States officials that Europeans' data will be sufficiently protected when it is transferred outside the 28-member bloc.     Many of Europe's national privacy regulators had raised concerns that the new agreement, known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, did not go far enough to protect Europeans' fundamental rights. They said the bulk collection of Europeans' data by United States and European intelligence agencies failed to comply with the region's data protection rules   But in the lengthy document, with several letters from American officials, including new explanations of United States privacy safeguards by Robert Litt, general counsel of the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the European Commission said it was satisfied that Europeans' data would not be unfairly used or retrieved by American intelligence agencies.   The draft document still requires approval from Europe's member states, which are expected to meet as early as next Monday to approve the data transfer pact. The final agreement, though, may be postponed until the week of July 11, when Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, who helped to negotiate the Privacy Shield, is expected to visit Brussels.   ''This new framework for trans-Atlantic data flows protects the fundamental rights of Europeans and ensures legal certainty for businesses,'' Christian Wigand, a European Commission spokesman, said in a statement. ''We are now in the process toward formal adoption.''   A representative for the Commerce Department was not immediately available to comment.   The completion of the new trans-Atlantic data agreement would put an end to months of wrangling between American and European policy makers over how the world's largest companies transfer digital information about people's social media posts and online search queries, among other data, across the Atlantic.   Europe's highest court ruled last October that a previous agreement did not sufficiently protect Europeans' privacy rights, which are viewed on par with other fundamental rights like freedom of speech.   European officials forced their American counterparts to offer Europeans more control over how their data was collected when transferred to the United States. A new position, called the Privacy Shield Ombudsman, also was created in the State Department to review European data protection complaints.   In the draft agreement, the European Commission said it had been reassured that this position would remain independent of American intelligence agencies and that United States officials had offered further commitments to limit the bulk collection of Europeans' online data.   ''On the basis of all the above, the commission concludes that the United States ensures effective legal protection against interferences by its intelligence authorities with the fundamental rights of the persons whose data are transferred from the Union to the United States under the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield,'' the document said.   The agreement may be short-lived. Many national regulators remain concerned about how it will be put into effect, and several data protection campaigners have said they will probably file legal cases against the new pact. These legal challenges, expert say, are likely to be heard by the European Court of Justice, the region's highest court.     "

Snowden to Help Develop a Safer Phone for Journalists,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden said Thursday that he planned to help develop a modified version of Apple's iPhone for journalists who are concerned that they may be the target of government surveillance. The announcement was made during a one-day conference on ''Forbidden Research'' held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab.     Mr. Snowden, who spoke via a video connection from Russia, where he is living in exile, said he was working with Andrew Huang, a computer hacker known as Bunnie who studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., to see if it would be possible to modify a smartphone to alert journalists working in dangerous environments to electronic surveillance.   Mr. Snowden, who is a board member of a nonprofit group called the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said he was concerned that cellphones and smartphones serve as tracking devices that automatically create electronic dossiers that give third parties, including governments, detailed information on location.   As an example of the dangers of location data, he cited the mortar attack in 2012 by the Syrian government that killed Marie Colvin, an American journalist who was reporting in Homs, Syria, for The Sunday Times of London.   ''The radio frequency emissions of her communications that she used to file those news reports were intercepted by the Syrian Army,'' he said.   He said it was increasingly difficult for users to trust their smartphones. They may be tampered with by malware programs, causing them to transmit location information even when the user may believe that the device has been placed into a safe ''airplane mode.''   Mr. Huang said the project was still experimental, but he hoped it would provide journalists with modified phones that would come in a special case with a separate display that would provide an alert when the phone was active and transmitting data at improper times.   The conference focused on issues raised by computer hacking, as well as controversial scientific research in areas such as genetic engineering and geoengineering.   Also at the conference, Reid Hoffman, one of the founders of LinkedIn, which recently agreed to be acquired by Microsoft for $26 billion, announced that he planned to offer a $250,000 ''Disobedience Prize'' aimed at promoting positive social change and opposing injustice.   ''It will go to a person or group engaged in what we believe is excellent disobedience for the benefit of society. The disobedience that we would like to call out is the kind that seeks to change society in a positive way, and is consistent with a set of key principles,'' wrote Joichi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, in a web posting about the prize. The timing of the award has not yet been determined.   In separate panels, biologists and climate scientists explored the risks and rewards of scientific research that might have unexpected consequences.   Kevin Esvelt, a biologist who is director of the Sculpting Evolution research group at the M.I.T. Media Lab, spoke about new, easily accessible genetic engineering technologies that might be used to preserve species that are at risk of extinction, and alternatively to eradicate pests that threaten human populations by spreading disease.   He described a discussion scientists had on Wednesday with residents of Martha's Vineyard about the use of advanced genetic engineering techniques to introduce a type of mouse that had been modified to be unable to carry Lyme disease. The idea would be to break the transmission of the disease to ticks and then to humans.   He said that before beginning the experiment, the scientists engaged the community to discuss potential risks.   Scientists on several panels acknowledged that it was impossible to be certain about unforeseen effects from new engineering techniques.   ''What we're worried about is something that we do that could be very attractive in the short term but have some triggering mechanism or some slow events that occur far in the future,'' said George Church, a Harvard geneticist who is exploring genetic engineering techniques to revive extinct species.

Daily Report: Malware Damages Aviation Systems in Saudi Arabia,"An attack on the computer systems of Saudi Arabia's aviation agency, reported on Thursday, is a reminder that the problems of malware and bots are still very much with us.  The attack relied on malware called Shamoon, which was also used to target Saudi energy companies four years ago, Sewell Chan writes. It is not yet clear who was responsible, but computer experts believe the attack in mid-November came from outside the country, and hackers in Iran are possible suspects. Similar malware was used two years ago in attacks on the Las Vegas Sands and Sony.    About a month earlier, still-unidentifed hackers shut down access to a range of computer sites by sending a flood of traffic to a New Hampshire company that manages chunks of the internet's infrastructure. They relied on corrupted internet-connected devices, like cameras, to generate that huge volume of traffic.   And earlier this week, someone broke into the computers of San Francisco's mass transit system, forcing the service to offer free fares.   Who is doing it? Most likely, experts say, it's a combination of nation states and hacking groups. But the recent attacks show that the stakes are rising, from hacking for fun or credit card numbers to bringing down important infrastructure systems.     "
WhatsApp Encryption Now Covers All Messages,"SAN FRANCISCO -- WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook and used by more than one billion people, on Tuesday introduced full encryption for its service, a way to ensure that only the sender and recipient can read messages sent using the app.  Known as ''end-to-end encryption,'' it will be applied to photos, videos and group text messages sent among people in more than 50 languages across the world, including India, Brazil and Europe. Previously, only one-to-one text messages were fully encrypted.    ''Every day we see stories about sensitive records being improperly accessed or stolen,'' WhatsApp said in a blog post. ''And if nothing is done, more of people's digital information and communication will be vulnerable to attack in the years to come.''   ''Fortunately, end-to-end encryption protects us from these vulnerabilities,'' the company said.   The move thrusts WhatsApp further into a standoff between tech companies and law enforcement officials over access to digital data, one that pits Silicon Valley's civil libertarian ideals against the federal government's concerns over national security. Increased encryption will make it more difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to intercept WhatsApp communications for investigations.   The government has faced similar issues with companies like Telegram, Signal and Wickr Me, messaging services that also offer encrypted communications.   The debate over access to digital data erupted in February when a federal court in California ordered Apple to help crack open an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, resisted the order, saying that the company needed to protect individuals' privacy. Law enforcement officials, including the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, have criticized encryption as a hindrance to investigations, including in terrorism cases.   Last month, President Obama said in a speech that he opposed the stance on encryption taken by technology companies. The Justice Department later dropped its demand that Apple help open the iPhone of the San Bernardino killer after saying that it had found another, undisclosed, way into the device.   End-to-end encryption for WhatsApp is of particular concern to the F.B.I., considering the service's huge subscriber base and large international footprint. With increasing amounts of communications now sent across messaging services, encrypted texts, video, photos and the like may end up being more problematic for law enforcement than locked devices. The encryption on WhatsApp will be turned on by default, so users will not be required to enable it themselves.   WhatsApp has previously clashed with law enforcement over its digital data. Last month, the federal police in Brazil arrested a Facebook executive for not turning over information from a WhatsApp account in a drug trafficking case. The executive was released.   In the United States, the Justice Department has been discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp's encryption.

Prime Danger in Vote Hack: Sowing Doubt,"WASHINGTON -- Russian hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the United States presidential election, the nation's most senior intelligence and law enforcement officials have assured Congress and the White House in recent weeks. But disrupting it, they acknowledge, would be far easier -- causing doubts in battleground states, prompting challenges to results and creating enough chaos to make Florida's hanging chads seem like a quaint problem from the analog age. By some measures, in fact, the disruption has already begun.    And meddling around the edges of an election could sow doubts about the legitimacy of the results -- especially in a year in which the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, has told his supporters that the only way he will lose is if the election is ''rigged,'' and while campaign officials for his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, have held a series of meetings about preparing for the possibility that the vote will be hacked.   The White House has declined to name Russia publicly as the chief suspect in a series of recent hacks, and has worded its public warnings carefully. The greatest danger, Lisa O. Monaco, President Obama's domestic security adviser, said on Wednesday, is from attempts to cause ''concern or confusion'' about the voting system.    The systems most vulnerable to cyberattacks are large, centralized databases, where breaking into one part of the system can often give access to all of it. That is what happened to the Office of Personnel Management, which was unaware for more than a year as Chinese hackers stole credentials to get into its system, copied the highly sensitive security-review documents for nearly 22 million federal employees and contractors, encrypted the data and transmitted it out of the country.   By contrast, the American voting system, with its hodgepodge of state and local polling places, is protected by being decentralized and disconnected. ''That makes it extremely disparate, extremely diffuse and, as a consequence, extremely difficult to have an effect across the board that would result in a change in results,'' Ms. Monaco said.   At a meeting last week that attracted many of the nation's top intelligence leaders, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, described the voting system as ''clunky as heck,'' but a blessing ''because it makes it more resilient and farther away from an actor who might be looking to crawl down a fiber-optic cable.''   A recent attempt to steal voter registration rolls in Arizona by what the F.B.I. told state officials were Russian hackers, and a successful theft of voter information in Illinois, raised the question of whether the lists of registered voters at polling stations could be manipulated. One fear is that newly registered voters could be struck from the rolls. They could still cast provisional ballots, but the result would be long lines and delays. Another is that nonregistered voters, foreigners or felons who have been barred from voting might be able to enter the voting booth, leading to challenges.   The attempted breach in his state led Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, to charge in a Senate hearing this week that the Obama administration had been far too sanguine about the dangers facing the electoral process.   ''Any attempt to interfere with American elections must be treated as a threat to our vital national security interests,'' Mr. McCain said after questioning Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, at the hearing. ''Yet so far, the only response from the Obama administration has been a warning from the secretary of defense.''   It is unclear if Mr. Obama raised the issue with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when they met 10 days ago in China. If an F.B.I. investigation finds overwhelming evidence of Russian government responsibility in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or other recent breaches, the president would have to decide whether or how to respond.   Any response may not be made public, since Mr. Putin is seen as responding better to private warnings, or demonstrations of retaliation, than to anything that openly challenges his authority.   One reason officials like Mr. Comey have expressed confidence in the security of the vote is that most states (Pennsylvania is a notable exception) keep a paper backup of votes as they are cast. Paper trails are not foolproof. But their existence means that after a lengthy audit -- even one as politically paralyzing as the 2000 recount in Florida -- an accurate count would probably be made.   Voting machines are not supposed to be connected to the internet (though there are some exceptions), providing some additional measure of protection. But results are reported online, and one fear that federal cyberexperts have discussed is that a sophisticated ''man in the middle'' attack could allow hackers to take over internet systems used to report unofficial results on election night. Such a breach might not alter the official ballot count, but it could sow deep mistrust about the numbers that are broadcast.   ''If I were a bad guy, I know I could manipulate the system,'' said Stuart McClure, the author of ''Hacking Exposed'' and the chief executive of Cylance, a company that uses artificial intelligence techniques to repel attacks on networks. ''But the problem here is not really about manipulation. It's about the damage you can do with disruption, so that people lose confidence in the system.''   Mr. McClure likened the problem to causing a blackout that would bring down part of a power grid. Chaos ensues, but eventually power is restored. The difference is that the nation's utilities now conduct twice-yearly ''stress tests'' of their resilience.   But the voting system has never been designated ''critical infrastructure'' by the Department of Homeland Security, something it suggested recently may soon change. And only a few states have even tried to subject their voting systems to a serious test attack, called ''red teaming,'' by the military and intelligence agencies that regularly try to replicate how the systems would hold up against a sophisticated cyberattacker.   The two states that have conducted the most comprehensive top-to-bottom reviews of their voting systems, drawing on computer scientists, are California and Ohio. But those largely involved systemic audits, and they took place in 2007 -- almost another era in the world of cybersecurity. And many other states have not even gone that far.   So far, the kinds of attacks on voting machines themselves have seemed pretty unsophisticated -- they would embarrass any serious hacker working for Russia's old K.G.B., now called the F.S.B. -- but have sometimes been extremely effective.   In Clay County, Ky., eight local election officials were convicted in 2010 of fooling voters who used ''iVotronic'' election machines, which resemble A.T.M.s. After casting their ballots, the voters pressed a big red button on a screen marked ''Vote.'' But some of the machines then required the voter to touch another button, ''Confirm Vote.''   The officials were accused of trying to hide this last fact from voters, having them leave the booth as soon as they touched ''Vote.'' When they left, the officials would review and sometimes change the votes, then confirm the selection.   The fraud left no paper trail and preyed on voters unfamiliar with the machines. But it also required hands-on tinkering with the actual machines. And since the machines are offline, that could not be done en masse, or from afar.   Keeping voting machines off a network is critical, but it is hardly a guarantee against hacking. The Iranians kept their nuclear centrifuges off any network, and it did not stop the United States and Israel from putting malware in the system -- but again, it was a single, central system.   And there have been some isolated cases where states discovered they had machines that were not as insulated from the networked world as they thought. Last year, Virginia decertified the use of a certain brand of voting machines that had a wireless internet capcity, said Lawrence Norden of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. He said he was unaware of any equipment currently in use that still had that vulnerability.   ''When you think about someone in Moscow hacking into the voter registration database or D.N.C. email server, they are not going to be able to do that for voting machines'' because they would have to gain access to each machine, said Mr. Norden, who has written several reports about election systems as deputy director of the Brennan Center's Democracy Program.   After the initial attack on the Democratic National Committee, the Department of Homeland Security began offering states a ''computer hygiene'' check that would automatically scan the internet addresses of any networked servers an election agency uses. That scan would look for malware or vulnerabilities, and the department would assist in patching them. The department will also send half a dozen or so specialists to the election agency's facility to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment.   The department also intends to have specialists working on election night at its National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, which serves as a clearinghouse for information about cyberattacks.   So far, at least nine states have reached out to the department for consultations, the agency said.   The issue traces back to the botched 2000 vote count in Florida. The ''hanging chads'' defeated electronic vote-reading machines: The tiny bit of punched-out cardboard remained, and the machines could not count them accurately. Sometimes alternative systems are just as bad. While optical scanners avoid the chad problem, they can be confused when voters fill in the oval of a preferred candidate and then circle it for emphasis.   The first versions of A.T.M.-style touch-screen machines did not produce backup printouts, and many of those machines are still in service around the country. That makes it impossible to conduct a meaningful audit. Election officials and voter integrity advocates have been studying such gaps and trying to fix them over the past decade.   Still, some states have lagged, in part because buying new machines can be costly. Several other states, including Virginia and Florida, still have a few paperless machines available to provide special access to voters with vision problems.   Until recently, said Pamela Smith, the president of Verified Voting, a San Diego-based nonprofit that advocates improvements to voting equipment and systems, a manipulated election seemed more like a theoretical problem than a real possibility.   But the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's internal emails and of voter registration databases in Arizona and Illinois has focused minds.   ''It's a reality check for the whole country,'' Ms. Smith said.     "
Microsoft to Notify Users of Government Hackings,"SEATTLE --  Microsoft says it will begin notifying users of its online services if they have been targets of suspected state-sponsored online attacks, joining a growing list of Internet companies stepping up their security policies with similar measures.  The company, which announced the change on Wednesday in a blog post, joins Google, Facebook and others in disclosing when users of email and other services have probably been targeted by hackers working on behalf of governments. Such attacks have increased in intensity in recent years and often involve more sophisticated, sustained forms of trickery to gain control of online accounts than those employed by ordinary digital criminals.    Reuters reported on Wednesday that Microsoft managers determined in 2012 that hackers affiliated with the Chinese government had hacked into more than a thousand Hotmail accounts, some of which belonged to leaders of China's Tibetan and Uighur minorities.   Microsoft did not notify the targets of the hacking that the attacks came from state-sponsored sources, a decision that Reuters, citing unnamed former Microsoft employees, said was motivated by a desire to avoid inflaming Chinese government authorities.   In a statement responding to the Reuters reporting, Microsoft said it was not sure the attacks had come from state-sponsored hackers in China. It said that at the time, it notified its customers of suspicious activity on their accounts and forced them to reset passwords, without specifying where the attacks might have come from.   ''We weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,'' Microsoft said in the statement. ''We also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.''   Few Internet companies at the time had publicly committed to letting their users know when they suspected government hackers of targeting them. One exception was Google, which in June 2012 began posting banners atop Gmail accounts warning users when states or state-sponsored groups seemed to be trying to gain control of their accounts.   In a blog post describing their warnings, Google declined to say exactly how it knew the attacks were state-sponsored, but said its alerts were the result of detailed analysis and victim reports. Google advised users to take additional precautions, like using stronger passwords and turning on two-step verification, which provides users with secondary codes via text messages or phone calls for accessing their accounts.   In October, Facebook said that it had begun notifying its users of state-sponsored efforts to take over customers' accounts.   Around that time, Iranian hackers had compromised the social media and email accounts of State Department officials who focused on Iran and the Middle East, The New York Times reported in November.   In December, Twitter also began issuing similar alerts to its users, followed by Yahoo.     "
Military Honors Will Be Given to Drone Operators,"WASHINGTON --  For years, the military's drone pilots have toiled in obscurity from windowless rooms at bases in suburban America, viewed by some in the armed forces more as video game players than as warriors. But in a reflection of their increasingly important role under President Obama, the drone operators will now be eligible for military honors akin to those given to pilots who flew over the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.    The Defense Department on Thursday is scheduled to announce that it has created a designation to recognize service members who had a direct effect on combat operations even though they were operating remotely, Pentagon officials said. Drone pilots are likely to receive many of the awards, but they may also be given to operators who launch cyberattacks.    ''It's way past time,'' said David A. Deptula, a retired three-star Air Force general who pushed the military to embrace drones. ''People should be acknowledged and rewarded for their contributions to accomplishing security objections regardless of where they are located.''   Current and former military officials had been deeply divided about whether to recognize the drone pilots. An initial Pentagon plan in 2013 to honor them with a ''Distinguished Warfare Medal'' was criticized by some veterans' groups, which feared that the award would rank higher than combat medals like the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.   The Veterans of Foreign Wars sent a letter to Mr. Obama expressing its objections to the proposed medal. Some veterans have derided such recognition as a ''geek cross.'' Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced the planned medal during his final days at the Pentagon in 2013.   But the proposal was scuttled by his successor, Chuck Hagel, amid the fury from the veterans' groups.   The Pentagon's efforts to recognize service members who operate from afar reflect the changing nature of how the military uses force. With the American public weary of war, Mr. Obama has relied on drones as the military has moved toward a leaner footprint in its engagements in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen.   ''As the impact of remote operations on combat continues to increase, the necessity of ensuring those actions are distinctly recognized grows,'' said a Pentagon document outlining changes to how the military gives awards and other decorations.   The use of drones has been widely credited with diminishing Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. But civilians have also died in drone attacks, fueling anger toward the United States among Muslims across the Middle East.   The military has also increased its use of cyberweapons. In 2010, a cyberattack took out nearly 1,000 centrifuges that Iran had been using to purify uranium.   The new awards, a Pentagon official said, will allow the military to recognize service members who operate other technology that will be developed in the future as military tactics evolve.   The Pentagon is also planning to make changes that officials hope will shorten the time that it takes to award the Medal of Honor, and to standardize what define ''acts of combat valor.''   Along with those changes, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is scheduled to announce a review of how Silver Star and Service Cross medals have been awarded for combat in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The review will examine whether the standards for earning those medals have remained the same throughout the years since the wars began, and it could result in upgrades for some service members.   According to the Pentagon, the first seven Medal of Honor awards for service in Iraq and Afghanistan were given to those who had died. But since 2010, all 10 people who have received the Medal of Honor have been living at the time it was awarded.   Some commanders have been more willing to upgrade their recommendations for medals as the wars dragged on, according to Pentagon officials. So some service members could receive upgraded honors for actions that took place early in those conflicts.     "
"It's No Cold War, but Putin Relishes His Role as Disrupter","WASHINGTON -- Escalating airstrikes in Syria. Sophisticated cyberattacks, apparently intended to influence the American election. New evidence of complicity in shooting down a civilian airliner. The behavior of Russia in the last few weeks has echoes of some of the uglier moments of the Cold War, an era of proxy battles that ended in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. President Obama, fresh from a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin this month, wondered aloud whether the Russian leader was content living with a ''constant, low-grade conflict.'' His reference was to Ukraine, but he could have been addressing any of the arenas where Mr. Putin has reveled in his new role as the great disrupter of American plans around the globe.    ''It seems to me we have Mr. Putin's answer,'' said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of a coming book, ''A World in Disarray.'' ''He's answered in the affirmative. Low-grade conflict is his thing. And the question is how directly or indirectly we introduce costs.''    None of these conflicts have, in fact, cost Mr. Putin very much. Cyberpower in particular is tailor-made for a country in Russia's circumstances -- a declining economy with the gross domestic product of Italy. It is dirt cheap, hard to trace to a specific aggressor and perfect for sowing confusion, which may be the limits of Mr. Putin's goals.   The bigger question confronting American intelligence officials, though, is whether the Russian president has a grander scheme at work. So far, their conclusion is probably not. Mr. Putin's moves, they argue in background conversations, are largely tactical, intended to bolster his international image at a moment he has plenty of troubles back home.   For a year now, the White House has argued that these escalating clashes, while worrisome, do not constitute a new Cold War. There is no great ideological struggle underway. No one is brandishing nuclear weapons, though after two decades of reducing their forces, each is now racing to modernize them. Syria is a humanitarian disaster of barely imaginable scope, but it is not a fundamental strategic threat to American interests.   Yet the few veterans of that era still in senior posts see similarities. ''It shouldn't come as a big shock to people,'' James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said about the ''information warfare'' that has been put to sophisticated use from Kiev, Ukraine, to Washington. ''I think it's more dramatic maybe because now they have the cybertools.''   Mr. Clapper's colleagues go a step further in less public conversations. They argue that Mr. Putin has played his hand skillfully, stringing along Secretary of State John Kerry in a yearlong negotiation over cease-fires and political transitions in Syria, all the while bolstering their proxy, President Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Kerry's efforts in Syria all but collapsed this week in waves of Russian and Syrian government airstrikes.   The deal in Ukraine is hanging on, but just barely: Russia conveniently ignores many of the commitments it signed and has denied involvement in the downing two years ago of a Malaysia Airlines jet flying over Ukraine that killed 298 people.   The theft of voter rolls in Arizona and Illinois -- and ''poking around'' in the networks of other states, as James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, described it to Congress this week without naming the Russians as perpetrators -- may be intended to rattle the United States, rather than change votes.   ''It's probably not real, real clear whether there's influence in terms of an outcome,'' Mr. Clapper said. ''What I worry about more -- frankly -- is just sowing the seeds of doubt, where doubt is cast on the whole process.''   So far, the American response has been decidedly mixed. The West's sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea have clearly stung; Russian officials make no effort to hide their desire to get them lifted. But the White House has not publicly blamed Russia for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the theft of the Arizona and Illinois voter registration rolls, or breaking into the cellphones of Democratic operatives.   Mr. Obama pulled Mr. Putin aside in China for a conversation that officials decline to recount, and Mr. Kerry has done the same with his counterpart during the long effort to find common ground in bringing peace to Syria.   The president's reluctance to publicly blame the Russians -- born of concern that taking on Mr. Putin head-on would only invite him to escalate -- has led to something of an uprising in parts of the White House and the State Department. A range of cyberstrategists and younger diplomats have complained over the past nine months that the failure to draw lines has encouraged Mr. Putin to see what else he can accomplish, especially at a time of political transition in the United States.   Few in the American intelligence community predicted much of this. Intelligence assets have been so focused for the past 15 years on counterterrorism that traditional targets have taken something of a back seat -- they have not been ignored, one senior intelligence official said recently, but only lately have they begun to receive new resources.   Perhaps that contributed to some misjudgments. It was more than a year ago that Mr. Obama said Russia would find itself in a ''quagmire'' in Syria; it may yet, but so far Mr. Putin's air war has propped up Mr. Assad, though at such a horrific human cost in the city of Aleppo that the United Nations' humanitarian chief, Stephen O'Brien, told the Security Council on Thursday that it had become a ''merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe.''   Mr. Kerry threatened earlier this week to cut off all negotiations with the Russians. The Russian Foreign Ministry responded that the United States was in an ''emotional breakdown'' and rejected the effort to restore a seven-day pause in hostilities, the first step in an agreement Mr. Kerry reached with his counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Sept. 9.   That was mild compared with what the spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said. He called the opposition leaders the United States has been not-so-covertly arming in Syria ''a U.S.-controlled terrorist international,'' using a phrase that was a throwback to Soviet times.   And he warned that ''should any attempt be made to carry out any threats against Russia or Russian servicemen in Syria, it is far from guaranteed'' that the American-backed militias would have enough body bags.   So far, though, Mr. Putin has shown some caution. While he has tried to intimidate NATO nations with overflights of bombers, nuclear submarine runs along coasts and military exercises near the borders of Estonia and Latvia, he has been careful to stay on his side of the boundaries.   ''These are all occurring in gray-zone locations with gray-zone tactics,'' said Robert Kagan, a historian at the Brookings Institution who has written on the return of geopolitical conflict. The question the United States will have to face, he added, is ''Are we willing to operate in the gray area, too?''     "
Biden Hints at U.S. Response to Russia for Cyberattacks Related to Election,"WASHINGTON -- Since the Obama administration formally accused Russia about a week ago of trying to interfere in the election, there has been intense speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory cyberstrike. The strongest hint so far has come from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who either revealed American plans for a strike or engaged in one of the better bits of psychological warfare in recent times.     Taping an interview for NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Biden was asked whether the United States was preparing to send a message to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Days before, the American intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security declared that the Russian leadership was responsible for attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of stolen emails.   ''We're sending a message,'' Mr. Biden told Chuck Todd, the show's host. ''We have the capacity to do it.''   ''He'll know it,'' Mr. Biden added. ''And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.''   Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could ''fundamentally alter the election,'' Mr. Todd asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent.   ''Hope not,'' Mr. Biden responded.   His warning seems to suggest that Mr. Obama is prepared to order -- or has already ordered -- some kind of covert action after the stolen emails were published online. That would require what is known in the intelligence agencies as a finding -- a presidential determination authorizing covert action.   Such a finding would allow the United States to make use of its newly developed arsenal of cyberweapons, which are under the control of the military's Cyber Command, the N.S.A. and, in some circumstances, the C.I.A.   Mr. Biden's statement does not exclude the possibility of a response outside the realm of cyberspace. But most of the other options under discussion in the White House involve actions that would be public, such as economic sanctions under a 2015 presidential order on responding to cyberattacks. Such sanctions have never been invoked, but are well suited to cases like the presumed effort to influence the election.   Some experts, however, say they may be insufficient. James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, wrote in Foreign Policy last week that the first step could be making America's evidence against Russia public.   ''Revealing the names of the officials who authorized the cyberattacks against the United States would put Moscow in an extremely uncomfortable position,'' wrote Mr. Stavridis, a former admiral who is now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ''Ideally, the United States could reveal emails or conversations between Russian officials that demonstrated their intent to undermine the U.S. electoral process.''   But that would run counter to Mr. Biden's ''hope not'' statement. Mr. Stavridis and others have advocated other steps, including knocking holes in the Kremlin's wall of censorship so that opponents of Putin could begin to conspire with one another.   ''As a response to the Russian attacks on the U.S. democratic system, this would be both proportional and distinctive,'' Mr. Stavridis wrote. It might also be deniable -- a key to any covert action approved by the president.   Many others have advocated using cybertechniques to expose Mr. Putin's links to Russia's oligarchs and reveal his financial holdings overseas, which are believed to be vast. But such steps would risk escalation, and advisers have warned Mr. Obama that the United States is more vulnerable than most nations.   Mr. Putin initially denied any Russian involvement in the attacks. But in an interview several days ago, he said the important thing was not how emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign had been hacked, but what they said. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, went further. ''We did not deny this,'' he said of the hacking. But he added that the United States had offered no proof.   A crucial question being debated in the White House is whether warnings like Mr. Biden's will be enough to make Russia, or others, pull back in their hacking. The calculus behind the decision to formally accuse Russia was that the mere publication of the conclusion could temper the activity.   If so, it may not have worked. WikiLeaks in the past few days has published thousands of emails stolen from the Gmail account of John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign. While Mr. Podesta has blamed Russia for the attack, intelligence agencies say they have not formally reached that conclusion.   There are only two known cases in which Mr. Obama has authorized an offensive cyberaction. One was the operation against Iran's nuclear program, code-named Olympic Games. That operation was not detected by the Iranians for years, until an accidental release of the computer code made it obvious that its centrifuges were exploding because of a cyberattack.   The other case has been action against the Islamic State, mostly to interfere with its communications or alter data in its systems. Those attacks were publicly announced by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and others, though no details were offered.   The announcement seemed intended in part to cause Islamic State insurgents to question whether their internal communications were genuine.     "
Covert Election Plot. Muted Coverage.,"LAST winter, as primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire headed to the polls, a covert and cunning Russian plot was underway to disrupt the American political process. With aliases like Guccifer 2.0 and Fancy Bear, Russian hackers were targeting critical computer systems. In June, they struck, hitting the Democratic Party, and by July its chairman was ousted in the fallout. Soon embarrassing emails were spilling from the computers of Hillary Clinton and her staff. Republican officials were hit, too. So was the National Security Agency. Now, hackers are meddling with the voting systems in several states, leaving local officials on high alert. Come Election Day, they'll find out what, if anything, the cyberspies have in store.     This is an act of foreign interference in an American election on a scale we've never seen, yet on most days it has been the also-ran of media coverage, including at The New York Times.   The emails themselves -- exposing the underside of the Democratic political machinery, and the conflicts, misjudgments and embarrassing communications of its top ranks -- have received bountiful attention. What rarely makes the main narrative is the spy-versus-spy cyberwarfare: the tactics, the players and the government efforts to tame it. In a calamitous campaign unlike any in memory, it's not surprising that other story lines get squeezed out. But one of the most chilling chapters of this election is the role of Russian intelligence and the growing threat of digital espionage. With days to go, readers have been shortchanged on this part of history.   The email dumps and the hacking have posed challenges for the press, requiring tough calls on news judgment and ethical standards. Some of the emails were personal communications between family and friends, and some contained gossipy exchanges. How does The Times balance the right to privacy against the public interest?   And then there is the unease that comes with feeling used by a foreign superpower. How does the paper avoid becoming an amplifier for a plot that needs the media to work? How does it verify the accuracy of several thousand illegally obtained emails? And most critically, what has it done to try to establish whether Donald Trump was colluding with Russian intelligence, as Clinton suggests?   Considering the journalistic swamp, The Times acquitted itself well on some of these questions. Editors restrained themselves from publishing every email, avoiding the reckless decisions of that some news outlets made. And The Times made reasonable attempts to determine the accuracy of the emails -- though when solid verification couldn't be had, it went with its gut.   Carolyn Ryan, the political editor, acknowledges the challenges when the provenance of information is so suspect. ''We do not want anyone, including hackers, to dictate the news cycle in this campaign, or determine what we cover,'' she said. ''We have been restrained.''   History will judge The Times's institutional commitment to reporting on the actual foreign intervention less favorably, I suspect. The team in Washington produced commendable, competitive work on an exceptionally difficult reporting target. Led by David Sanger, The Times was first to link the Russians to the hacks, to examine the baffling role of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and to smartly explore the options that the Obama administration could use to retaliate. I have no substantive complaints about the stories The Times has done.   What was missing is a sense that this coverage is actually important. After The Washington Post broke the story that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked, The Times came back with its own solid piece, but it didn't crack the front page and it earned only a modest mention on the home page. A piece laying out evidence that the Russians may be trying to falsify voting results in state databases ran on A15 and got minimal play digitally. Another on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. signaling that the White House was prepared to order a rare covert cyberattack against Russian found a home on page A19.   What's more, while several reporters have periodically contributed to the coverage, no one was dedicated to it full time. That's too bad. In my view, The Times should have assembled a strike force and given it a mandate to make this story its top priority. You can tell from the outside when the newsroom is turbocharged by a story. The latest coverage of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, is one example. Industrial-scale cybercrime, it appears, is not.   Turbocharged coverage might have led readers inside the cloak-and-dagger underworld of the hackers and the hacked. It might have more fully explored the government lapses in protecting information systems. And it could have told readers more about the effort to uncoil Trump's involvement, if any, in the hacking. When you think about it, there are few more crucial assertions than whether a possible occupant of the White House participated in an act of espionage against his country.   Many readers have raised concerns. Jack Archer, a resident of Oakland, Calif., asks: ''If reports of ties between Trump and the Russians are accurate, and several of them are, as we now know, why is The Times ignoring what is potentially the most important story about presidential politics in how long? In your and my lifetime, at least.''   The Times finally weighed in on this question last week, concluding that there is no compelling evidence linking Trump to the hackers. The piece, which ran on A21 and down page on the website, appeared to have been in the works for some time. Yet it was published just seven days before the election, and was unsatisfying in exploring the back story that led to its conclusions.   I asked Sanger, a highly knowledgeable and seasoned hand on matters of cyberwarfare, about the challenges in covering information hacks. ''American drone strikes and Russians bombing a hospital in Syria are immediate, gripping, tragic human stories,'' he said. ''A cyberstrike, by nature, is subtle, its effects often hidden for months, its importance usually a mystery. The bigger story here is that a foreign power has inserted itself in the fundamental underpinnings of American democracy using cybertechniques. We've never seen that before.''   That sounds like a pretty powerful argument for all-hands-on-deck coverage. After all, Trump's treatment of women, Clinton's email servers, the foundations of each candidate -- all of it will soon fade out. The cyberwar, on the other hand, is only getting started.

Following the Links,"The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that the Russian government deployed computer hackers to help elect Donald J. Trump. Russian government    American intelligence officials said they believed that the hackers were associated with two Russian intelligence agencies.    STATE-SPONSORED HACKERS   June 2015 Federal Security Service   A hacking group possibly linked to the agency, the main successor to the K.G.B., entered Democratic National Committee servers undetected for nearly a year, security researchers said. The group was nicknamed Cozy Bear, the Dukes or A.P.T. 29 for ''advanced persistent threat.''   April 2016 G.R.U.: Military Intelligence   Investigators believe that the G.R.U., or a hacking group known as Fancy Bear or A.P.T. 28, was the second group to break into the D.N.C., but it has played a bigger role in releasing the committee's emails.   LEAKERS   Guccifer 2.0   A self-proclaimed hacker that investigators believe was a group acting as an agent of the G.R.U. It published documents itself and leaked a series of D.N.C. documents.   DCLeaks   Investigators say it is a front for the Russian hackers who have tried to disrupt the election this year. It appeared in June as the release of the stolen Democratic Party documents began.   PUBLISHERS   WikiLeaks   The website released about 50,000 emails from the D.N.C's computer servers. It is unclear how WikiLeaks obtained the emails. But Russian intelligence agencies are prime suspects, researchers said.   Media   Dozens of newspapers, television stations, bloggers and radio stations around the United States -- including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal -- pursued reporting based on the hacked material, significantly increasing the effects of the cyberattack. In some cases, Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks took requests from reporters, releasing documents to them directly.   RESULTS   Obama ordered a report about Russian influence   President Obama warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in early September to stay away from the American election. In December, he ordered intelligence agencies to assemble a ''lessons learned'' report before he leaves office on Jan. 20. The goal of the report, in part, is to create a comprehensive history of the Russian effort to influence the election.   The leaks cast doubt on the electoral process   According to intelligence officials, the Russians were as surprised as everyone else by Mr. Trump's victory. But the leaks disrupted the campaign and undercut confidence in the integrity of the vote.   House races in a dozen states were affected   Tens of thousands of pages of hacked D.N.C. documents were selectively released by Guccifer 2.0 to political bloggers and newspaper reporters, causing a backlash against Democrats, like Annette Taddeo, pictured left, running for the House in highly competitive contests   The hacked Podesta emails dominated news   Weeks before the election, about 60,000 hacked emails from the account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, were released, in small amounts, spread over many days. They sparked extensive news coverage about the campaign's internal dynamics (as well as fake news stories).   The leaks fueled a rift in the Democratic Party   The emails forced the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman of the D.N.C. and added to the divide between supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton's campaign.

The Russian Hack in 200 Words,"President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for trying to influence the 2016 election through cyberattacks. Here's what led to the sanctions.  The Hack    Two state-sponsored hackers in Russia are believed to have broken into the Democratic National Committee servers in 2015 and 2016.   Hackers are believed to have created outlets on the internet to make the Democratic documents public. Political bloggers and newspapers reported on the hacked material.   The Rift   Leaks of documents stolen from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee caused a backlash against Democrats in nearly a dozen House races.   Leaked emails forced the D.N.C. chairwoman to resign and fueled a rift between supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.   Hacked emails from the account of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman revealed the campaign's internal dynamics and dominated the news for days.   The Response   In September, President Obama warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to stay out of the American elections.   On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions on two intelligence services, four top officers and three companies in Russia.   The administration also expelled 35 Russian diplomats and their families. Officials say some may have been linked to the cyberattacks.   The State Department shut down two ''recreational facilities'' in New York and Maryland that were allegedly used for Russian intelligence activities.     "
How the Kremlin Recruited an Army of Specialists for Cyberwar,"Follow Andrew E. Kramer on Twitter @AndrewKramerNYT . MOSCOW -- Aleksandr B. Vyarya thought his job was to defend people from cyberattacks until, he says, his government approached him with a request to do the opposite. Mr. Vyarya, 33, a bearded, bespectacled computer programmer who thwarted hackers, said he was suddenly being asked to join a sweeping overhaul of the Russian military last year. Under a new doctrine, the nation's generals were redefining war as more than a contest of steel and gunpowder, making cyberwarfare a central tenet in expanding the Kremlin's interests.    ''Sorry, I can't,'' Mr. Vyarya said he told an executive at a Russian military contracting firm who had offered him the hacking job. But Mr. Vyarya was worried about the consequences of his refusal, so he abruptly fled to Finland last year, he and his former employer said. It was a rare example of a Russian who sought asylum in the face of the country's push to recruit hackers.   ''This is against my principles -- and illegal,'' he said of the Russian military's hacking effort.    While much about Russia's cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy, details of the government's effort to recruit programmers in recent years -- whether professionals like Mr. Vyarya, college students, or even criminals -- are shedding some light on the Kremlin's plan to create elite teams of computer hackers.   American intelligence agencies say that a team of Russian hackers stole data from the Democratic National Committee during the presidential campaign. On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia for interfering in the election, the bedrock of the American political system.   The sanctions take aim at Russia's main intelligence agencies and specific individuals, striking at one part of a sprawling cyberespionage operation that also includes the military, military contractors and teams of civilian recruits.   For more than three years, rather than rely on military officers working out of isolated bunkers, Russian government recruiters have scouted a wide range of programmers, placing prominent ads on social media sites, offering jobs to college students and professional coders, and even speaking openly about looking in Russia's criminal underworld for potential talent.   Those recruits were intended to cycle through military contracting companies and newly formed units called science squadrons established on military bases around the country.   As early as 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a ''head hunt in the positive meaning of the word'' for coders.   The Defense Ministry bought advertising on Vkontakte, Russia's most popular social network. One video shows a man clanging a military rifle on a table beside a laptop computer, then starting to type.   ''If you graduated from college, if you are a technical specialist, if you are ready to use your knowledge, we give you an opportunity,'' the ad intoned. Members of the science squadrons, the video said, live in ''comfortable accommodation,'' shown as an apartment furnished with a washing machine.   University students subject to mandatory conscription in the nation's armed forces, but who wanted to avoid brutal stints as enlistees, could opt instead to join a science squadron. A government questionnaire asks draftees about their knowledge of programming languages.   The ministry posted openings on job forums, according to an investigation by Meduza, a Russian news site based in Riga, Latvia, that first disclosed the recruitment effort. One post from 2014 advertised for a computer scientist with knowledge of ''patches, vulnerabilities and exploits,'' which refers to sabotage used to alter a computer.   Given the size of Russia's cybercrime underworld, it was not long before the military considered recruiting those it described as ''hackers who have problems with the law.''   In an article titled ''Enlisted Hacker'' in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the government newspaper, a deputy minister of defense, Gen. Oleg Ostapenko, said the science squadrons might include hackers with criminal histories. ''From the point of view of using scientific potential, this is a matter for discussion,'' he was quoted as saying in 2013.   Experts say the strategy was more than just talk.   ''There have been cases where cybercriminals are arrested but never ended up in prison,'' said Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company that first identified the group known as Fancy Bear as the perpetrator of the Democratic National Committee hacking.   Mr. Vyarya, the programmer who turned down the government's job offer, was an attractive recruit from the opposite end of the spectrum: someone with a career protecting people against hackers.   Specifically, he had experience shielding websites from a maneuver called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack, in which the sites are overwhelmed and disabled by a torrent of fake traffic. Among his clients were Vedomosti, an independent newspaper; TV Rain, an opposition-leaning television station; and the website of Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader.   Mr. Vyarya said that in 2015 he was invited to accompany Vasily Brovko, an executive at the military contracting company Rostec, on a trip to Sofia, Bulgaria. But he said it turned out to be a demonstration of a new software suite capable of staging DDoS attacks.   The Bulgarian firm demonstrating the software briefly crashed the website of Ukraine's Defense Ministry and Slon.ru, a Russian news website, Mr. Vyarya said. Slon.ru has confirmed its site went down inexplicably for about two minutes that day, Feb. 5, 2015.   After the demonstration, Mr. Vyarya said Mr. Brovko asked him how the program might be improved. Then, according to Mr. Vyarya, Mr. Brovko offered him a job running the DDoS software, which he said the Russians planned to buy from the Bulgarians for about $1 million.   Mr. Vyarya said his problems began when he turned down the offer: He was surveilled, and an acquaintance in law enforcement advised him to flee the country. He left in August 2015 for Finland to seek asylum, he and his former employer said. The Finnish government, citing safety and privacy concerns, would not comment on the asylum application.   ''As soon as we saw what was on the table, Sasha was given direct instructions to return to his hotel and stop all contacts,'' said his former boss, Aleksandr V. Lyamin of Qrator, a cyberdefense company in Moscow, using Mr. Vyarya's Russian nickname. But the overtures from the military contractor persisted, Mr. Lyamin said, and Mr. Vyarya fled.   Rostec strongly denied Mr. Vyarya's account. Mr. Brovko did travel to Bulgaria with Mr. Vyarya, the company said, but to evaluate software for defensive, not offensive, cybersystems. A spokeswoman for Mr. Brovko called the account of crashing sites in a product demonstration the imagination of a ''mentally unstable'' man.   The military's push into cyberwarfare had intensified in 2012, with the appointment of a new minister of defense, Mr. Shoigu. The next year, a senior defense official, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov published what became known as the Gerasimov Doctrine. It posited that in the world today, the lines between war and peace had blurred and that covert tactics, such as working through proxies or otherwise in the shadows, would rise in importance.   He called it ''nonlinear war.'' His critics called it ''guerrilla geopolitics.''   But Russia is certainly not alone.   ''Almost all developed countries in the world, unfortunately, are creating offensive capabilities, and many have confirmed this,'' said Anton M. Shingarev, a vice president at Kaspersky, a Russian antivirus company.   Recruitment by Russia's military should be expected, he said. ''You or I might be angry about it, but, unfortunately, it's just reality. Many countries are doing it. This is the reality.''   American intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, have for decades recruited on college campuses. In 2015, the N.S.A. offered a free summer camp to 1,400 high school and middle school students, where they were taught the basics of hacking, cracking and cyberdefense.   In Russia, recruiters have looked well beyond the nation's school system.   In 2013, as Russia's recruitment drive was picking up, Dmitry A. Artimovich, a soft-spoken physicist, was awaiting trial in a Moscow jail for designing a computer program that spammed email users with advertisements for male sexual enhancement products.   One day a cellmate, who had been convicted of selling narcotics online, sidled up to him with some news. The cellmate said that people incarcerated for cybercrimes could get out before trial, in exchange for working for the government. Another inmate had already taken a deal, he said.   ''It was an offer to cooperate,'' Mr. Artimovich said.   ''Why else would you work for the government?'' he added. ''The salaries are tiny. But if you do something illegal, and go to prison for eight or nine years, the F.S.B. can help you,'' he said, using a Russian abbreviation for the Federal Security Service.   Mr. Artimovich said he decided to take his chances at trial, and served a year in a penal colony.   As Russia ramped up its abilities, government agencies were also in the market for surveillance and hacking software, including some from legal suppliers in the West.   In 2014, a Russian company called Advanced Monitoring that has a license to work with the F.S.B., the agency that succeeded the K.G.B. after the fall of the Soviet Union, bought iPhone hacking software from an Italian company called Hacking Team, according to invoices published by WikiLeaks. Hacking Team has since lost its export license.   Western cybersecurity analysts believe they have identified the one responsible for the breaching the Democratic National Committee: a group nicknamed Fancy Bear.   First known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28, the group has been active since 2007 but its abilities evolved to emphasize attacks, rather than gather intelligence, after the military placed a priority on cyberwarfare.   It stepped up ''faketivist'' actions that released stolen data through contrived online personalities like Guccifer 2 and websites like DCLeaks, according to Kyle Ehmke, a senior intelligence researcher at ThreatConnect, a cybersecurity company. The group had been called Pawn Storm, named for a chess maneuver. It was nicknamed Fancy Bear in 2014.   This year, the group appropriated the nickname for its own use, setting up the website fancybear.net and publishing hacked data from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which showed that many American athletes, including the American tennis star Serena Williams, had medical exemptions to take banned substances. The hacking was apparently in retaliation for revelations of Russian doping in sports.   President Vladimir V. Putin has said repeatedly, most recently at his annual year-end news conference, that the information released in the recent hacking of the Democratic National Committee was more important than who was behind them.   ''The main thing, to my mind, is the information the hackers provided,'' Mr. Putin said of this summer's cyberattack.   Democratic Party members and the Obama administration should not look abroad for someone to blame for losing the election, Mr. Putin said. ''You need to learn how to lose gracefully,'' he said.     "
"Mr. Obama Punishes Russia, at Last","While it is definitely too late, and may also be too little, there should be no doubt about the correctness of President Obama's decision to retaliate against Russia for hacking American computers and trying to influence the 2016 presidential election. It would have been irresponsible for him to leave office next month and allow President Vladimir Putin to think that he could with impunity try to undermine American democracy. That would have been a particularly dangerous legacy given President-elect Donald Trump's alarming affinity for Mr. Putin and stubborn refusal to accept the conclusion of American intelligence agencies that Russia's cyberattacks were aimed at helping him and hurting Hillary Clinton. The president-elect told reporters dismissively before Mr. Obama's decision was announced that Americans should ''get on with our lives'' and forget about the hacking scandal. So much for that wishful thought.     Mr. Obama's action was slow in coming, and until Thursday his only public response, a weak one, had been to ''name and shame'' the Russians by identifying them as the culprits behind the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations and to warn the Kremlin against future interference.   His latest response shows real teeth, chiefly in the form of sanctions on Russia's two leading intelligence services, the F.S.B. and GRU, including four top officers of the military intelligence unit who the White House believes ordered those attacks. Mr. Obama also placed sanctions against a number of other individuals and companies, such as the Special Technology Center, which conducts signal intelligence.   Mr. Obama also expelled 35 Russian intelligence operatives and barred Russian diplomats from using two recreational compounds in the United States. The White House said this action was specifically in response to a two-year pattern of harassment of American diplomats in Russia by Kremlin security personnel.   Mr. Obama should have retaliated against this treatment a long time ago; still, the expulsion adds to the severity of the American response and directly affects Russian citizens, whereas the travel bans and asset freezes imposed by the sanctions may not. Russian intelligence officials rarely travel to the United States or stash their assets here. Sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine have been in place for two years, yet it is debatable how much effect they have had on Mr. Putin. There is thus a legitimate question about whether Mr. Obama's penalties will be sufficient. Already Moscow is threatening retaliation.   Mr. Obama is in a tricky place. He has been concerned, rightly so, about tailoring a response that imposes costs on Russia and acts as a deterrent to further Russian attacks without escalating a cyberwar. At the same time, he would be wise to explore possible covert actions that would reinforce his public responses to further drive home the point that attacks on American elections, by Russia or any other country, cannot and will not be tolerated. One such action, some have suggested, would be to leak detailed information about Mr. Putin's vast wealth, which could undermine his credibility with the Russian people.   Mr. Obama's actions clearly create a problem for Mr. Trump, who has rejected the intelligence agencies' findings and questioned whether Russia was behind the hacking. In addition to announcing the sanctions, the administration released further evidence of Russia's interference, including a report by the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security that contained samples of malware and other indicators of Russian cyberactivity. Many more details could well surface if Congress, as many have urged, names a special bipartisan investigative commission.   Once the sanctions were imposed, Mr. Trump repeated his call for the country to ''move on.'' But after flaunting his refusal to take regular intelligence briefings, he also said he would meet next week with leaders of the intelligence community for an update on the hacking. Leading members of his Republican Party in Congress have already drawn their conclusions: The House speaker, Paul Ryan, called the sanctions appropriate, while Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham promised to lead an effort to impose even tougher penalties. In less than a month, Mr. Trump will have to decide if he stands with his democratic allies on Capitol Hill or his authoritarian friend in the Kremlin.

"In D.N.C. Hack, Echoes of Russia's New Approach to Power; The Interpreter","Of the questions raised by charges that Russia was involved in the release of hacked Democratic National Committee emails, at least one - why would Russia do such a thing? - can be answered with a little-noticed but influential 2013 Russian military journal article. ""The very rules of war have changed,"" Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, wrote in the Military-Industrial Courier.  The Arab Spring, according to General Gerasimov, had shown that ""nonmilitary means"" had overtaken the ""force of weapons in their effectiveness."" Deception and disinformation, not tanks and planes, were the new tools of power. And they would be used not in formally declared conflicts but within a vast gray between peace and war. Those ideas would appear, the next year, in Russia's formal military doctrine. It was the culmination of a yearslong strategic reorientation that has remade Russian power, in response to threats both real and imagined, into the sort of enterprise that could be plausibly accused of using cyberattacks to meddle in an American presidential election.  'We are protecting our sovereignty' Like so many military rethinks, what became known as the Gerasimov Doctrine began as an effort to solve a seemingly urgent problem. Throughout the 2000s, popular uprisings in Eastern Europe and Central Asia overturned their pro-Kremlin leaders, replacing them with democratically elected governments more inclined to the West. In Moscow, these ""color revolutions,"" as well as the subsequent Arab Spring, were seen as a wave of hostile American operations, engineered to topple Russia's allies and weaken Russia itself. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, said in a 2014 speech that such uprisings were ""used as an excuse to replace nationally oriented governments with regimes controlled from abroad."" The Kremlin felt encircled and threatened by what it took to be a vast American conspiracy whose ultimate goal, it concluded, was the subjugation or outright destruction of the Russian state. In December 2011, thousands gathered in Moscow to protest legislative elections that had been marred by accusations of fraud. The demonstrations didn't come to much, but they engendered a fear among Russian leaders that they were next. President Vladimir V. Putin, at a news conference in 2014, warned that the West was seeking to ""defang"" the Russian bear - to remove its nuclear weapons so as to gain access to its natural resources. ""Once they've taken out his claws and his fangs, then the bear is no longer necessary,"" Mr. Putin said. ""The issue is that we are protecting our sovereignty and our right to exist."" Russian military planners, apparently obsessed with such fears, concluded that their best defense would be to go on the offense. Believing that the Americans were already conducting a clandestine war through intelligence operations, media disinformation, and deniable proxy forces, they set out to do the same. The phrase ""hybrid war"" - a common label in the West for Russia's actions - was first used by Russian analysts to describe the supposed American tactics they believed they were countering. They called their own strategy something different: ""new generation war."" Projecting power beyond Russia's strength Even before this doctrine became formalized, Russia had developed tools of coercion and subterfuge, providing a model for wider usage. As Russian power has resurged under Mr. Putin, the country has often used asymmetrical methods to assert its interests, particularly in the former Soviet republics it still considers its ""near abroad"" and rightful zone of influence. In 2007, amid tensions with the small Eastern European nation of Estonia, Russian media falsely reported that members of Estonia's Russian minority were being drugged and tortured by police, contributing to riots that injured several people and killed one. The next day, cyberattacks, attributed to a pre-Kremlin Russian group, forced many of Estonia's major institutions offline. At no point, in the 2007 episode, did Russia commit an act of military aggression against its neighbor. Yet Estonian leaders say these actions were meant as a message: Even if their country had joined NATO and the European Union, Moscow was still the boss. These sorts of tools allowed Russia to project power beyond its strength and, just as importantly, to assert its interests abroad despite Western military and political dominance. To paraphrase Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia's military, this is a country whose economy is smaller than Canada's or South Korea's, yet is seeking a great power role akin to China or the United States. Traditional methods won't cut it. Information struggle and Maidan technology Russia deployed its ""new generation war"" to startling effect in early 2014, when, amid Ukraine's political crisis, it seized and subsequently annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. While that action is most remembered for the ""little green men"" - unmarked Russian special forces who seized key locations in a clandestine invasion - there were subtler components as well. Russian state news media flooded Crimea's airwaves with false stories about neo-Nazis taking over Ukraine and systematically attacking ethnic Russians, who are a majority in Crimea. As a result, many Crimeans welcomed the unmarked Russian troops, believing they were being saved from possible ethnic cleansing. Dmitry Adamsky, an Israeli analyst, wrote in a 2015 report that this ""information struggle"" is central to Russia's new strategy. This information war, he wrote, ""comprises both technological and psychological components designed to manipulate the adversary's picture of reality, misinform it and eventually interfere with the decision-making process of individuals, organizations, governments and societies."" While this was especially visible in Crimea, Mr. Adamsky warned that it was also deployed in peacetime and against any target where Moscow seeks influence. It may be intended to pursue a ""strategic goal,"" such as the weakening of pro-American political parties in Europe, or to simply foment a degree of instability that weakens adversaries. Mr. Adamsky described this as a form of ""subversion"" that ""aims to deceive the victim, discredit the leadership, and disorient and demoralize the population and the armed forces."" That sheds light on why Russia might want to release Democratic National Committee emails, whose greatest effect is creating a kerfuffle within Democratic politics. It's not as if the resignation of the party chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, was some strategic Russian ambition. While some observers say Moscow sees a potential friend in Donald J. Trump, it would also be well within Russian strategy to stir up trouble just to stir up trouble. This is what Mr. Adamsky calls ""managed stability-instability"" - low-level confusion and disunity that Russia could perhaps one day exploit. Russia has long seen itself as the victim of these very tactics, accusing Western governments of using vague ""Maidan technology,"" named for the square where Ukraine's 2014 protests began, to create ""managed chaos"" in targeted countries. Embarrassing stories, such as the Russian doping scandal and the Panama Papers, are seen as American information warfare meant to weaken Moscow. In this view, Kremlin leaders could see releasing internal Democratic emails as a tit-for-tat retaliation in the information struggle. Such a thing would make little sense in the Western conception of geopolitics. But as Mr. Adamsky wrote in his 2015 study, Americans have long tried to conceptualize Russian strategy within Western ways of thinking, when it is anything but.Related Articles   "
Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton's Missing Emails,"DORAL, Fla. - Donald J. Trump said on Wednesday that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Hillary Clinton's email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Mr. Trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. Clinton's deleted emails. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."" Mr. Trump's call was another bizarre moment in the mystery of whether Vladimir V. Putin's government has been seeking to influence the United States' presidential race. His comments came amid questions about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, which American intelligence agencies have told the White House they have ""high confidence"" was the work of the Russian government.  At the same news conference, Mr. Trump also appeared to leave the door open to accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea two years ago - which the United States and its European allies consider an illegal seizure of territory. That seizure, and the continued efforts of Russian-aided insurgents to undermine the government of Ukraine, are the reason that the United States and its allies still have economic sanctions in force against Moscow. When asked whether he would recognize Crimea ""as Russian territory"" and lift the sanctions, Mr. Trump said: ""We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking."" Mr. Trump's apparent willingness to avoid condemning Mr. Putin's government is a remarkable departure from United States policy and Republican Party orthodoxy, and has fueled the questions about Russian meddling in the campaign. Mr. Trump has denied that, saying at the news conference that he has never met Mr. Putin, and has no investments in Russia. ""I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly, but there's nothing I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now,"" he said, ""so that we can go and knock out ISIS together."" Mr. Trump later tried to modify his remarks about hacking Mrs. Clinton's emails, contending they represented an effort to get the Russians to turn over their trove to the F.B.I. With the political conventions coming to an end on Thursday, Mr. Trump is expected to receive his first national security briefings from American intelligence agencies in coming days. It is unclear whether those briefings - which describe the global challenges facing the United States but not continuing covert operations or especially sensitive intelligence - will change any of his views. His comments about Russian hacking came on a day when Obama administration officials were already beginning to develop options for possible retaliation against Russia for the attack on the Democratic National Committee. As is often the case after cyber incidents, the options for responding are limited and can be viewed as seeming too mild or too escalatory. The administration has not publicly accused the Russian government of the Democratic National Committee hacking, or presented evidence to back up such a case. The leaked documents, first published by a hacker who called himself ""Guccifer 2.0"" and who is now believed to be a character created by Russian intelligence, portrayed some committee officials as favoring Mrs. Clinton's candidacy while denigrating her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. The release of the internal party emails and documents led to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman of the party. Mr. Trump contended on Wednesday that the political uproar over whether Russia was meddling in the election was a ""total deflection"" from the embarrassing content of the emails. Many Republicans, even some who say they do not support Mr. Trump, say they agree. If Mr. Trump is serious in his call for Russian hacking or exposing Mrs. Clinton's emails, he would be urging a power often hostile to the United States to violate American law by breaking into a private computer network. He would also be contradicting the Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, saying that cyberespionage ""will not be tolerated,"" and promising to ""respond in kind and in greater magnitude"" to all Chinese and Russian cyberattacks. In the past, the Obama administration has stopped short of retaliating against Russia - at least in any public fashion - for its attacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on networks used by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It never even publicly identified Russian intelligence as the source of those intrusions, though the subject was widely discussed by senior United States officials when they were not speaking for attribution. In contrast, the United States did bring indictments against Chinese and Iranian hackers for thefts of intellectual property and attacks on American banks, and imposed economic sanctions against North Korea in early 2015, for hacking into Sony Pictures Entertainment's computers. Almost as soon as Mr. Trump spoke, other Republicans raced in to try to reframe his remarks and argue that Russia should be punished. A spokesman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan termed Russia ""a global menace led by a devious thug."" The spokesman, Brendan Buck, added: ""Putin should stay out of this election."" Even Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump's running mate, issued a statement, saying that ""if it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences."" Mr. Pence did not attend Wednesday's news conference because he was giving local television interviews, and an aide to Mr. Pence said that his team had written his statement about Russia before Mr. Trump began speaking. Shortly after that Mr. Trump sent a message on Twitterdeclaring ""If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!"" The fact that the Democratic committee's servers were targeted - and, apparently, not those of the Republican National Committee - has brought up inevitable comparisons with the origins of the Watergate scandal, when burglars found little after breaking into Democratic committee offices before the 1972 election. The hackers, more than 40 years later, were more successful: A reconstruction of events suggests the first successful piercing of the Democrats' networks occurred in June 2015, long before the Russians, or anyone else, could have known Mr. Trump would get the nomination. The Clinton campaign, eager to turn the subject from the chaos caused by the email release to the question of Russian interference, accused Mr. Trump of encouraging Russian espionage. ""This has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,"" said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton's chief foreign policy adviser, whose emails from when he was a State Department aide were among those that were hacked. ""This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue,"" he added. For his part, Mr. Trump cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking. ""I have no idea,"" he said. He said the ""sad thing"" is that ""with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the Democratic National Committee emails."" Mr. Trump then argued that if Russia, or any other foreign government, was behind the hacking, it showed just how little respect other nations had for the current administration. ""President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations"" than a President Clinton, Mr. Trump said. ""I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton."" Former Representative Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, a Republican who had served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Trump was right to keep hammering Mrs. Clinton on the subject of her private emails. Mr. Hoekstra said he was untroubled by Mr. Trump's goading of a foreign power, particularly in light of Mrs. Clinton's use of a private server while she was secretary of state. ""Trump is bringing up a fairly valid point: Hillary Clinton, with her personal email at the State Department, has put the Russians in a very enviable position,"" Mr. Hoekstra said. ""Most likely the Russians already have all that info on Hillary."" But Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who led the House oversight committee that looked into Mrs. Clinton's emails, was more critical. If Mr. Trump's comments were meant literally, he said in an interview, ""I think he was absolutely wrong and out of line. I would never have said it that way, and I think it was ill-advised."" If the remark was tongue-in-cheek, he added, it failed at political humor.

Hillary Clinton Accuses Russia of Interfering With U.S. Election,"MOLINE, Ill. - Hillary Clinton accused Russian intelligence of interfering with the American election, implying that President Vladimir V. Putin viewed a victory by Donald J. Trump as a destabilizing event that would weaken the United States and buttress Russian interests. ""It's almost unthinkable,"" Mrs. Clinton said on Monday, referring to what she called recent ""credible reports about Russian interference in our elections"" and citing a hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails in July.  ""We've never had the nominee of one of our major parties urging the Russians to hack,"" Mrs. Clinton said in a news conference. ""I want everyone - Democrat, Republican, Independent - to understand the real threat that this represents."" The comments, Mrs. Clinton's most extensive yet on one of the more unusual subplots of the presidential campaign, came after a Washington Post report that United States intelligence and law enforcement agencies are probing a wide, covert Russian effort to disrupt the presidential election. Asked by a reporter if Russia's actions amounted to a cyberwar, Mrs. Clinton said, ""I'm not comfortable using the word 'war.'"" But she said she viewed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, which American officials have linked to Russian intelligence agencies, and warnings there could be additional breaches intended to influence the presidential campaign ""a threat from an adversarial foreign power."" In conversations lately with donors, Mrs. Clinton has urged noncomplacency. She has stressed that foreign enemies who hope Mr. Trump will succeed, in order to weaken the United States, may try to disrupt the November results, perhaps with a cyberattack. Hours after President Obama met with Mr. Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou, China, Mrs. Clinton delivered a harsh assessment of the Russian leader's role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and potential future breaches. ""When Putin was asked about it, he could barely muster the energy to deny it, if any of you saw it,"" Mrs. Clinton said, adding that the Russian president, whom she clashed with as secretary of state, ""and the team around him certainly believe that there is some benefit to them to doing this."" After talks stalled between Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin on how to handle the humanitarian crisis in Syria, Mrs. Clinton cast blame partly on the Russians for failing to come up with a solution. ""The whole situation has deteriorated in many ways because of the refusal of the Russians and the Iranians to put the kind of pressure on Assad that is necessary to reach an accommodation that would save lives,"" she said, referring to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. While the White House opposes putting into effect a partial no-fly zone in Syria, Mrs. Clinton reiterated her support for such action. ""I think we need leverage,"" she said. ""I've always believed that if that were on the table and it were clear we were going to pursue it, that would give us the leverage we don't have now."" Asked about potential conflicts of interest between Clinton Foundation donors and aides who worked in Mrs. Clinton's State Department, she brought the lengthy exchange with reporters back to national security and defended her tenure as the nation's top diplomat. ""Everything I did at the State Department, I did in furtherance of America's interest and security,"" she said. ""The State Department said there's absolutely no evidence of any kind of external influence."" Even amid her tough talk regarding Mr. Putin, Mrs. Clinton stopped short of saying the Russians wanted to help elect Mr. Trump. Instead, she pointed to an old saying from Arkansas. ""If you find a turtle on a fence post, it didn't get there by itself,"" she said.

The Tainted Election; Op-Ed Columnist,"The C.I.A., according to The Washington Post, has now determined that hackers working for the Russian government worked to tilt the 2016 election to Donald Trump. This has actually been obvious for months, but the agency was reluctant to state that conclusion before the election out of fear that it would be seen as taking a political role. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. went public 10 days before the election, dominating headlines and TV coverage across the country with a letter strongly implying that it might be about to find damning new evidence against Hillary Clinton - when it turned out, literally, to have found nothing at all.  Did the combination of Russian and F.B.I. intervention swing the election? Yes. Mrs. Clinton lost three states - Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania - by less than a percentage point, and Florida by only slightly more. If she had won any three of those states, she would be president-elect. Is there any reasonable doubt that Putin/Comey made the difference? And it wouldn't have been seen as a marginal victory, either. Even as it was, Mrs. Clinton received almost three million more votes than her opponent, giving her a popular margin close to that of George W. Bush in 2004. So this was a tainted election. It was not, as far as we can tell, stolen in the sense that votes were counted wrong, and the result won't be overturned. But the result was nonetheless illegitimate in important ways; the victor was rejected by the public, and won the Electoral College only thanks to foreign intervention and grotesquely inappropriate, partisan behavior on the part of domestic law enforcement. The question now is what to do with that horrifying knowledge in the months and years ahead. One could, I suppose, appeal to the president-elect to act as a healer, to conduct himself in a way that respects the majority of Americans who voted against him and the fragility of his Electoral College victory. Yeah, right. What we're actually getting are wild claims that millions of people voted illegally, false assertions of a landslide, and denigration of the intelligence agencies. Another course of action, which you'll see many in the news media taking, is to normalize the incoming administration, basically to pretend that everything is O.K. This might - might - be justified if there were any prospect of responsible, restrained behavior on the part of the next president. In reality, however, it's clear that Mr. Trump - whose personal conflicts of interest are unprecedented, and quite possibly unconstitutional - intends to move U.S. policy radically away from the preferences of most Americans, including a pronounced pro-Russian shift in foreign policy. In other words, nothing that happened on Election Day or is happening now is normal. Democratic norms have been and continue to be violated, and anyone who refuses to acknowledge this reality is, in effect, complicit in the degradation of our republic. This president will have a lot of legal authority, which must be respected. But beyond that, nothing: he doesn't deserve deference, he doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt. And when, as you know will happen, the administration begins treating criticism as unpatriotic, the answer should be: You have to be kidding. Mr. Trump is, by all indications, the Siberian candidate, installed with the help of and remarkably deferential to a hostile foreign power. And his critics are the people who lack patriotism? Will acknowledging the taint on the incoming administration do any good? Maybe it will stir the consciences of at least a few Republicans. Remember, many, though not all, of the things Mr. Trump will try to do can be blocked by just three Republican senators. Politics being what it is, moral backbones on Capitol Hill will be stiffened if there are clear signs that the public is outraged by what is happening. And there will be a chance to make that outrage felt directly in two years - not just in congressional elections, but in votes that will determine control of many state governments. Now, outrage over the tainted election past can't be the whole of opposition politics. It will also be crucial to maintain the heat over actual policies. Everything we've seen so far says that Mr. Trump is going to utterly betray the interests of the white working-class voters who were his most enthusiastic supporters, stripping them of health care and retirement security, and this betrayal should be highlighted. But we ought to be able to look both forward and back, to criticize both the way Mr. Trump gained power and the way he uses it. Personally, I'm still figuring out how to keep my anger simmering - letting it boil over won't do any good, but it shouldn't be allowed to cool. This election was an outrage, and we should never forget it. Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.

Russia's Hacks Followed Years of Paranoia Toward Hillary Clinton; The Interpreter,"Russia's unprecedented intervention in the United States election came amid more than United States-Russia tension and Donald J. Trump's praise of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. It also coincided with a growing belief, in Moscow, that Russia faced an imminent threat in Hillary Clinton's candidacy. Mrs. Clinton is viewed in Moscow as innately hostile to Russia. Widely held conspiracy theories portray her as seeking to foment unrest that will return Russia to the chaos and depression of the 1990s. Even many government technocrats view her with suspicion that at times verges on paranoia.  She referred to these views at an event on Thursday, telling donors that Mr. Putin's ""personal beef"" with her had driven Russia's intervention in the American election. Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Institute of International Relations, based in Prague, said the Kremlin was consumed by something more urgent than petty revenge: self-preservation. ""It's not just they didn't like Clinton, but they actually thought that she represented a threat,"" he said, describing Russia's actions as a matter of ""policy, not pique."" No one factor can fully explain Russia's decision to hack and pass on Democratic emails, analysts say, and intelligence agencies appear divided on assessing Russian motives. But, in Moscow, fear of Mrs. Clinton has loomed as large or larger than any warmth for Mr. Trump. Mr. Putin accused Mrs. Clinton of instigating protests against him in late 2011. ""She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,"" he said, reflecting a widespread view in Moscow that Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, had sought to topple Russia's government. Mr. Putin returned to the presidency a few months later, appearing to believe that the United States had engineered the Middle East's descent into chaos and was targeting his country to be next. He put Mrs. Clinton at the center of these plots. Mrs. Clinton is indeed more hawkish than other Democrats, including toward Russia. In 2008, while a senator, she mocked President George W. Bush's claim that he had looked into Mr. Putin's soul. ""I could have told him - he was a K.G.B. agent. By definition, he doesn't have a soul,"" Mrs. Clinton joked. The line is still remembered in Moscow. But the Kremlin's views of Mrs. Clinton go beyond defining her as hawkish. They are also layered with a pre-existing Russian belief that American democracy promotion is a ploy to unseat unfriendly governments, that the United States remains bent on Russia's destabilization or even destruction, and that there is an American hand behind nearly every Russian misfortune. These suspicions go back decades. But, since Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, popular telling has cast her as the culprit responsible for America's misdeeds and, therefore, Russia's setbacks. In the summer of 2015, when Russian hacking groups first infiltrated Democratic National Committee servers, I happened to be reporting in Moscow. The American name on everyone's lips was not Mr. Trump's, who was already praising Mr. Putin, but rather Mrs. Clinton's. Fyodor Lukyanov, a prominent Russian foreign policy commentator, told me at the time that there was a widespread view in his country's government that Mrs. Clinton, as president, would take ""a very hostile approach"" toward Russia. Consensus in Moscow, Mr. Lukyanov said, was that ""Hillary is the worst option of any president, maybe worse than any Republican."" It was conventional wisdom, he added, that Mrs. Clinton considered her husband's efforts to reform Russia in the 1990s an unfinished project, and that she would seek to finish it by encouraging grass-roots efforts that would culminate with regime change. This summer, when Russian hacking groups began releasing Democratic emails through third parties such as WikiLeaks, many Americans suspected an effort to help Mr. Trump, who had promised to realign the United States with Russia. But Mr. Galeotti, the Russian expert, said that, in all his time in Moscow, ""I didn't speak to anyone who thought a Trump presidency was possible."" Rather, conversation there followed the same polls that dominated the discussion in America, and which all projected a landslide for Mrs. Clinton. Even as Mr. Putin deemed Mr. Trump ""colorful"" and suggested they might get along, officials in Moscow ""were absolutely working from the assumption that Clinton was going to get it,"" Mr. Galeotti said. This belief may have informed Russia's actions during the campaign, which a number of analysts still suspect were aimed at weakening, rather then preventing, Mrs. Clinton's presumedly imminent presidency. But if Moscow does gain an ally in Mr. Trump, it will lose a foil in Mrs. Clinton - something that has been politically useful for Mr. Putin as his country's economy has sunk and its isolation deepened.

Putin Sees a Happy New Year; Op-Ed Contributor,"CHICAGO - These days President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia cannot hide his glee. This is unusual for a man trained to deceive and mislead, a man who is practiced in his profession. In an interview with the Russian television program ""Weekly News"" on Dec. 4, Mr. Putin said it was obvious that the West had failed to create a unipolar world and that balance was being restored. He had reasons to feel triumphant: His years of supporting anti-establishment movements in the West, mostly on the right, by hacking and leaking private information, spreading fake news and financing parties and individuals ready to do the Kremlin's bidding all seem to be paying off.  Russia's methods are hardly new. Remember, for example, ""The Protocols of the Elders of the Zion,"" a notorious forgery concocted by the czar's secret police and published in Russia in 1903. Purporting to describe a Jewish plot to dominate the world, it became a bible for anti-Semites everywhere and was widely used by the Nazis. Throughout the 20th century, disinformation and propaganda disseminated by the Communist Party's Department of Propaganda and Agitation, alongside its intelligence services, became part and parcel of the Soviet regime. During the Soviet-Finnish war in the winter of 1939, for instance, as Soviet planes bombed the Finns, the Soviet foreign minister, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, said Moscow was dropping humanitarian aid - food and water. In response to the lie, the Finns sarcastically named their own bombs - bottles filled with flammable fuel - Molotov cocktails. In post-Soviet Russia, the same cynical mendacity has become the Putin government's hallmark. On July 9, 2014, in a meeting with public leaders at the Kremlin, Mr. Putin referred to Joseph Goebbels, the notorious Nazi minister of propaganda, as ""a talented man who knew that the more incredible the lies, the quicker people believe them."" The quote, which he was using to condemn the West's supposed misrepresentation of Russian history, was in fact the best indication of Mr. Putin's own creed. Now, in addition to undermining the legitimacy of the American presidential election campaign, Russia has been a frequent source of fake news that targeted the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, during a recent referendum and muddled a Swedish debate last summer about joining NATO. Throughout Eastern Europe, Moscow has been implicated in cyberattacks and election interference from Estonia to Bulgaria. Germany, which will hold elections in September, is experiencing cyberattacks and fake news. Even more surprising than Russia's aggressive behavior has been the timid response of the West, which has let Moscow engage in cyberwarfare with impunity. President Obama said this month that during their meeting last September, he told Mr. Putin ""to cut it out."" That hardly sounds like a president concerned with a grave threat to American democracy. His warning to Mr. Putin may have forestalled even more brazen Russian attacks, but enough damage had already been done. In Italy, Mr. Renzi's campaign privately complained about Russia's interference but declined to go public. And when Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, was asked on Nov. 27 about Russian meddling in Germany's electoral campaign, she replied, ""We just have to learn to live with it."" To live with it? This is not routine cyber intelligence, which many nations practice. Russia's cyber activity seeks to confuse, destabilize and ultimately bring to power foreign governments pliant to Russia's aims. That is an attack on the values and institutions of democratic societies, and, if successful, it achieves the same result as a military invasion to install a new government. In his recent interview on Russian television, the Kremlin's chief propagandist, Dmitri Kiselev, stated it in bald, cynical terms: ""Today it is much more costly to kill one enemy soldier than during World War II, World War I or in the Middle Ages,"" adding that ""if you can persuade a person, you don't need to kill him."" The Russian military views an information war as part of its military doctrine, and Americans need to consider Russia's cyber activities as an act of war that requires a forceful and united response. President Obama's response - at least until now - has proved inadequate. Unlike the Cold War, this one has no Iron Curtain and no ideological battleground. In this new hybrid warfare, former K.G.B. men have become oligarchs, Mr. Putin refers to Western nations as ""partners,"" and the government sells stakes in state companies to Western businesses and relies on Western markets and other financial institutions. Yet behind the smoke and mirrors, Russia remains a Potemkin village that hides a police state and an expansionist empire, steeped in systemic corruption and governed by up-to-date techniques of repression and manipulation. This, too, is not new for Russia. Unhindered by public opinion, laws and opposition political parties, Russia's autocrats have historically derived strength from territorial expansion and geopolitical aggrandizement. Starting with Ivan the Terrible, the Russian empire expanded for at least five centuries - by some calculations annexing each year territory the size of Belgium - until the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991. That dramatic denouement is what Mr. Putin is desperately trying to reverse, resorting to the same tool kit used by Soviet leaders since the formative days of the Soviet state in the early 1920s. At that time a destitute and hungry Russia was recovering from revolution and civil war. Still, the Bolshevik government spared no resources when it came to propaganda and repression. Today, Mr. Putin focuses the shrinking resources of a beleaguered Russian economy on the twin agendas of restoring Russia's position among the world's powers and undermining Western institutions. For him it is a zero sum game. Moscow can easily deploy thousands of hackers and trolls to achieve maximum disruption while Western democracies awaken too slowly to the dangers. And the dangers are grave. From state-sponsored mass doping in sports to corrosive business practices, from silencing political dissent at home to supporting brutal regimes abroad, Russia's policies are rooted in deceit, graft and violence - a combination that presents an existential challenge to democracies. Mr. Putin's greatest success has been to help place in the White House a man who shares many of his values and seems happy to do his bidding. But Mr. Putin is not done yet. He seeks to promote anti-establishment candidates in next year's elections in the Netherlands, France, Italy and Germany. If this new cold war comes to an end with a Putin-Trump alliance, it will do so on Russia's terms, with Russia no more democratic and the United States becoming a little more like Russia. Next October will mark a century since the Bolsheviks violently seized power. That first totalitarian regime, in which Mr. Putin would later be trained, arguably provoked the rise of other political movements that together defined the rest of the 20th century, leading to unprecedented political violence and wars that took the lives of tens of millions. We simply cannot allow Moscow to define the direction of another century by orchestrating a parade of Western democracies on their way to becoming corrupt, autocratic societies.

BBC Websites Said to Be Target of Online Attack,"The British Broadcasting Corporation said on Thursday that its digital services had been shut down temporarily in what its news operation described as a hacking attack.  Many of the BBC's websites and popular video-on-demand services were offline for roughly three hours Thursday morning, although its television and radio stations were not affected.    While a statement posted by the BBC on Twitter said the blackout had been caused by a technical issue, unidentified people in the company were quoted on the BBC news website as saying that a ''distributed denial of service'' attack had struck the digital services.   That type of online attack is caused when a website is deliberately targeted with a high level of online visitors to create congestion, overloading the services and taking them offline.   ''The BBC website is now back up and operating normally,'' the company said in an emailed statement. ''We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced.''   It was unclear who might have carried out an attack and what its goal might have been. But the BBC is not the first news media organization to be hit by hackers.   In 2013, the New York Times website was temporarily shut down after the company's domain name registrar was the target of Syrian hackers. The Financial Times and The Washington Post have faced similar attacks.   Government-run digital services have also been disrupted by distributed denial of service attacks. These include hacking efforts against Estonia in 2007 that were said to have been backed by the Russian government.     "
"New Technologies Give Government Ample Means to Track Suspects, Study Finds","WASHINGTON --  For more than two years the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies have warned that encrypted communications are creating a ''going dark'' crisis that will keep them from tracking terrorists and kidnappers. Now, a study in which current and former intelligence officials participated concludes that the warning is wildly overblown, and that a raft of new technologies -- like television sets with microphones and web-connected cars -- are creating ample opportunities for the government to track suspects, many of them worrying.    '' 'Going dark' does not aptly describe the long-term landscape for government surveillance,'' concludes the study, to be published Monday by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.   The study argues that the phrase ignores the flood of new technologies ''being packed with sensors and wireless connectivity'' that are expected to become the subject of court orders and subpoenas, and are already the target of the National Security Agency as it places ''implants'' into networks around the world to monitor communications abroad.    The products, ranging from ''toasters to bedsheets, light bulbs, cameras, toothbrushes, door locks, cars, watches and other wearables,'' will give the government increasing opportunities to track suspects and in many cases reconstruct communications and meetings.   The study, titled, ''Don't Panic: Making Progress on the 'Going Dark' Debate,'' is among the sharpest counterpoints yet to the contentions of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and other Justice Department officials, mostly by arguing that they have defined the issue too narrowly.   Over the past year, they have repeatedly told Congress that the move by Apple to automatically encrypt data on its iPhone, and similar steps by Google and Microsoft, are choking off critical abilities to track suspects, even with a court order.   President Obama, however, concluded last fall that any effort to legislate a government ''back door'' into encrypted communications would probably create a pathway for hackers -- including those working for foreign governments like Russia, China and Iran -- to gain access as well, and create a precedent for authoritarian governments demanding similar access.   Most Republican candidates for president have demanded that technology companies create a way for investigators to unlock encrypted communications, and on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton has taken a tough line on Silicon Valley companies, urging them to join the fight against the Islamic State.   Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has led the charge on the other side. He recently told a group of White House officials seeking technology companies' voluntary help to counter the Islamic State that the government's efforts to get the keys to encrypted communications would be a boon for hackers and put legitimate business transactions, financial data and personal communications at greater risk.   The Harvard study, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, was unusual because it involved technical experts, civil libertarians and officials who are, or have been, on the forefront of counterterrorism. Larry Kramer, the former dean of Stanford Law School, who heads the foundation, noted Friday that until now ''the policy debate has been impeded by gaps in trust -- chasms, really -- between academia, civil society, the private sector and the intelligence community'' that have impeded the evolution of a ''safe, open and resilient Internet.''   Among the chief authors of the report is Matthew G. Olsen, who was a director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Mr. Obama and a general counsel of the National Security Agency.   Two current senior officials of the N.S.A. -- John DeLong, the head of the agency's Commercial Solutions Center, and Anne Neuberger, the agency's chief risk officer -- are described in the report as ''core members'' of the group, but did not sign the report because they could not act on behalf of the agency or the United States government in endorsing its conclusions, government officials said.   ''Encryption is a real problem, and the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies are right to raise it,'' Mr. Olsen said Sunday. But he noted that in their testimony officials had not described the other technological breaks that are falling their way, nor had they highlighted cases in which they were able to exploit mistakes made by suspects in applying encryption to their messages.   Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of law and computer science at Harvard who convened the group, said in an interview that the goal was ''to have a discussion among people with very different points of view'' that would move ''the state of the debate beyond its well-known bumper stickers. We managed to do that in part by thinking of a larger picture, specifically in the unexpected ways that surveillance might be attempted.''   He noted that in the current stalemate there was little discussion of the ''ever-expanding 'Internet of things,' where telemetry from teakettles, televisions and light bulbs might prove surprisingly, and worryingly, amenable to subpoena from governments around the world.''   Those technologies are already being exploited: The government frequently seeks location data from devices like cellphones and EZ Passes to track suspects.   The study notes that such opportunities are expanding rapidly. A Samsung ''smart'' television contains a microphone meant to relay back to Samsung voice instructions to the TV -- ''I want to see the last three 'Star Wars' movies'' -- and a Hello, Barbie brought out by Mattel last year records children's conversations with the doll, processes them over the Internet and sends back a response.   The history of technology shows that what is invented for convenience can soon become a target of surveillance. ''Law enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target,'' the report said.   These communications, too, may one day be encrypted. But Google's business model depends on picking out key words from emails to tailor advertisements for specific users of Gmail, the popular email service. Apple users routinely back up the contents of their phones to iCloud -- a service that is not encrypted and now is almost a routine target for investigators or intelligence agencies. So are the tracking and mapping systems for cars that rely on transmitted global positioning data.   ''I think what this report shows is that the world today is like living in a big field that is more illuminated than ever before,'' said Joseph Nye, a Harvard government professor and former head of the National Intelligence Council. ''There will be dark spots -- there always will be. But it's easy to forget that there is far more data available to governments now than ever before.''     "
U.S. Drew Up Cyberattack Plan in Case Iran Nuclear Dispute Led to Conflict,"BERLIN --  In the early years of the Obama administration, the United States developed an elaborate plan for a cyberattack on Iran in case the diplomatic effort to limit its nuclear program failed and led to a military conflict, according to a coming documentary film and interviews with military and intelligence officials involved in the effort. The plan, code-named Nitro Zeus, was devised to disable Iran's air defenses, communications systems and crucial parts of its power grid, and was shelved, at least for the foreseeable future, after the nuclear deal struck between Iran and six other nations last summer was fulfilled.    Nitro Zeus was part of an effort to assure President Obama that he had alternatives, short of a full-scale war, if Iran lashed out at the United States or its allies in the region. At its height, officials say, the planning for Nitro Zeus involved thousands of American military and intelligence personnel, spending tens of millions of dollars and placing electronic implants in Iranian computer networks to ''prepare the battlefield,'' in the parlance of the Pentagon.    The United States military develops contingency plans for all kinds of possible conflicts, such as a North Korean attack on the South, loose nuclear weapons in South Asia or uprisings in Africa or Latin America. Most sit on the shelf, and are updated every few years. But this one took on far greater urgency, in part because White House officials believed there was a good chance that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel would decide to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, and the United States would be drawn into the hostilities that followed.   While the Pentagon was making those preparations, American intelligence agencies developed a separate, far more narrowly focused cyberplan to disable the Fordo nuclear enrichment site, which Iran built deep inside a mountain near the city of Qum. The attack would have been a covert operation, which the president can authorize even in the absence of a continuing conflict.   Fordo has long been considered one of the hardest targets in Iran, buried too deep for all but the most powerful bunker-buster in the American arsenal. The proposed intelligence operation would have inserted a computer ''worm'' into the facility with the aim of frying Fordo's computer systems -- effectively delaying or destroying the ability of Iranian centrifuges to enrich uranium at the site. It was intended as a follow-up to ''Olympic Games,'' the code name of a cyberattack by the United States and Israel that destroyed 1,000 centrifuges and temporarily disrupted production at Natanz, a far larger but less protected enrichment site.   Under the terms of the nuclear agreement with Iran, two-thirds of the centrifuges inside Fordo have been removed in recent months, along with all nuclear material. The facility is banned from any nuclear-related work and is being converted to other uses, eliminating the threat that prompted the attack plan, at least for the next 15 years.   The development of the two secret programs suggest how seriously the Obama administration was concerned that its negotiations with Iran could fail. It also demonstrates the critical role cyberoperations now play in both military planning and covert intelligence operations. American generals began incorporating nuclear weapons into their war plans for protecting Europe or countering the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and in the last 15 years, they have made armed drones a central part of military efforts in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere. In the same way, cyberwarfare has become a standard element of the arsenal for what are now called ''hybrid'' conflicts.   The existence of Nitro Zeus was uncovered in the course of reporting for ''Zero Days,'' a documentary that will be first shown Wednesday at the Berlin Film Festival. Directed by Alex Gibney, who is known for other documentaries including the Oscar-winning ''Taxi to the Dark Side'' about the use of torture by American interrogators, and ''We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks.''    ''Zero Days'' describes the escalating conflict between Iran and the West in the years leading up to the agreement, the discovery of the cyberattack on the Natanz enrichment plant, and the debates inside the Pentagon over whether the United States has a workable doctrine for the use of a new form of weaponry whose ultimate effects are only vaguely understood.   Mr. Gibney and his investigative team, led by Javier Botero, interviewed current and former participants in the Iran program who revealed details of the effort to infuse Iran's computer networks with ''implants'' that could be used to monitor the country's activities and, if ordered by Mr. Obama, to attack its infrastructure. (Under rules laid out in presidential directives, some made public three years ago by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, only the president can authorize an offensive cyberattack, just as the president must approve the use of nuclear weapons.)   The New York Times conducted separate interviews to confirm the outlines of the program. The findings were described over the past two weeks to the White House, the Pentagon, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, all of which declined to comment, noting that they never discuss planning for military contingencies.   For the seven-year-old United States Cyber Command, which is still building its cyber ''special forces'' and deploying them throughout the world, the Iran project was perhaps its most challenging program yet. ''This was an enormous, and enormously complex, program,'' said one participant who requested anonymity to discuss a classified program. ''Before it was developed, the U.S. had never assembled a combined cyber and kinetic attack plan on this scale.''   Nitro Zeus had its roots in the Bush administration but took on new life in 2009 and 2010, just as Mr. Obama asked General John R. Allen, at United States Central Command, to develop a detailed military plan for Iran in case diplomacy failed. It was a time of extraordinary tension, as the Iranians accelerated their production of centrifuges and produced near-bomb-grade fuel and Western intelligence agencies feared they might be on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon. It was also a period of extraordinary tension with Israel, partly because of its presumed role in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, and partly because of evidence that Mr. Netanyahu was preparing a pre-emptive strike against Iran, despite warnings from the United States.   At the time, Mr. Obama's aides thought he did not have a credible military contingency plan. In his memoir, ''Duty,'' former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates described his concerns -- laid out in a highly restricted memorandum to the White House in January 2010 -- that America's top national security leadership had not even begun to debate what a fast reaction to Iranian aggression would look like.   Nitro Zeus quickly emerged as one possible response for Mr. Obama, a way to turn off critical elements of the Iranian infrastructure without firing a shot. While cyberoperations have long been contemplated in other war scenarios, Nitro Zeus ''took it to a new level,'' one participant said. Yet the planners warned that depending on how the conflict unfolded, there could be significant effects on civilians, particularly if the United States had to cut vast swaths of the country's electrical grid and communications networks.   While Cyber Command would have executed Nitro Zeus, the National Security Agency's Tailored Access Operations unit was responsible for penetrating adversary networks, which would have required piercing and maintaining a presence in a vast number of Iranian networks, including the country's air defenses and its transportation and command control centers.   It is a tricky business, the war planners say, because their knowledge of how networks are connected in Iran, or any other hard target, is sketchy -- and collateral damage is always hard to predict. It is easier to turn off power grids, for example, than to start them up again.   Even as the Pentagon prepared for a broad conflict, American intelligence agencies had a narrower target: how to sabotage the underground Fordo enrichment site, just as they had sabotaged Natanz at the end of the Bush administration and the beginning of the Obama administration.   That effort accelerated in 2012 and 2013, as the Iranians began to fill Fordo's deep underground cavity with more than 3,000 centrifuges. But it was set aside, after the Iranians significantly slowed their enrichment activity during the negotiation over the nuclear deal, and then dismantled part of the Fordo plant.   The program to develop a computer worm to attack Fordo appears to have been initially developed around the time that Mr. Obama and other world leaders revealed the existence of the underground facility at a conference in Pittsburgh in September 2009. It is unclear how American spies planned to get inside the underground nuclear facility -- physically or remotely -- and whether the United States or an ally like Israel might have had to use human sources inside the country to conduct the network attack.   The Snowden documents revealed a series of technologies that can be used to insert programs remotely in a system disconnected from the Internet. That was done repeatedly at Natanz, as malware was refined and refined again, with each version subtly manipulating the computer controllers for the centrifuges so that the giant, spinning machines would gyrate wildly out of control and destroy themselves. The attack on Fordo appears to have been designed to be more blunt and obvious -- a straightforward strike that would destroy the circuitry that powered the centrifuges and their controllers.   It is unclear how successful the strike would have been. While such efforts are usually tested in mock facilities, there almost certainly would have been surprises had it been used against the Fordo plant. It is also unclear the degree to which American and Israeli intelligence agencies may have collaborated on the program, especially after the recriminations in 2010 over evidence that Israel rushed ahead in producing a version of the Stuxnet worm without properly testing it, leading to its exposure.

"Cravath Discloses Breach, Saying It Was 'Limited'","Federal authorities have warned for years that big law firms are ripe targets for computer hackers because they are information-rich repositories of corporate deals and other sensitive client information.  But big law firms, as a general rule, are loath to confirm whether they have been victims of data breaches, largely out of fear of alarming clients. Breaches and potential intrusions at large law firms often go unreported and generally come to light only anecdotally -- often in news reports or discussions at legal conferences.    One big firm that has confirmed it was the victim of a ''limited breach'' of its computer network is Cravath Swaine & Moore, based in New York, which may be best known for its corporate merger advisory work.   In a statement on Wednesday, Cravath said that the breach happened last summer and that it was ''not aware that any of the information that may have been accessed has been used improperly.'' The firm has been working with federal authorities, who are investigating the matter, and an outside security consulting firm.   Cravath said it responded to the incident by bolstering its security measures. The firm's statement added that maintaining client confidences was ''sacrosanct'' at the firm.   Authorities investigating digital attacks at law firms often focus on whether the information that was taken could be used in trading on the stock market.   The breach at Cravath and the investigation were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been warning law firms about attacks by hackers since at least 2011. At that time, the bureau began to organize meetings with the managing partners of top law firms in New York and other major American cities to highlight the problems of computer security and corporate espionage emanating from countries like Russia and China.   Last year, the digital intelligence group at Citigroup published a report that warned bank employees of the threat of attacks on the networks and websites of big law firms. The report also chided large firms, saying they refused to discuss breaches and noting that most law firms are not obligated to report data breaches publicly.   The Citigroup report was published around the time that Mandiant, a division of the security consulting firm FireEye, began advising a half-dozen unidentified law firms that were victims of a breach or other attack.   Cravath would not comment on which security consultant it was working with in response to last summer's breach.   But the firm's statement is a first move toward putting a name and face on law firm breaches.     "
"No Anonymity for Plaintiffs Suing Ashley Madison Over Hack, Judge Rules","Plaintiffs suing Ashley Madison, a popular online dating service, over a computer hacking attack that stole the personal data of millions of users will have to be publicly identified to proceed with the case, a federal judge ruled.  Forty-two plaintiffs seeking to represent a class of users of the website, which markets itself to people seeking sexual affairs outside of their marriages or committed relationships, sought to pursue litigation anonymously, as John Does, ''to reduce the risk of potentially catastrophic personal and professional consequences that could befall them and their families,'' according to court papers.    Hackers gained access to the company's computer systems in July 2015 and later leaked personal information related to more than 30 million accounts.   The plaintiffs said Avid Dating Life Inc., which owns and operates the website, failed to safeguard their personal and financial information, marketed a ''full delete removal'' service that did not purge user account information from its database, and populated its accounts with fake female users to lure male customers.   The ruling, by Judge John A. Ross of the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri, noted that plaintiffs in cases involving accusations of rape, child sexual abuse and other sensitive matters have been allowed to use pseudonyms. Other court cases, though, have found that mere embarrassment was insufficient to outweigh the presumption of openness and public scrutiny in judicial proceedings.   ''Moreover, the personal and financial information plaintiffs seek to protect has already been released on the Internet and made available to the public,'' he wrote in the ruling, which was dated April 6 and was brought to light earlier this week in Ars Technica.   Avid argued that the sexual preferences and habits of the plaintiffs ''do not constitute information of the utmost intimacy'' that would require withholding their names, the judge wrote.   The judge ruled that those who want to proceed as class representatives, who have a fiduciary obligation to represent the entire class of plaintiffs and who ''generally receive an incentive award as compensation for work done on behalf of the class,'' must disclose their identities.   They could dismiss their complaints and proceed, without publicly disclosing their names, as class members if and when a class is certified. Class members will not need to be identified by name, the judge ruled.   In similar class-action lawsuits against Avid, eight plaintiffs have sued using their names and a ninth voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit.     "
Printers at German Universities Mysteriously Churn Out Anti-Semitic Fliers,"Follow Alison Smale on Twitter @asmalenyt. BERLIN -- Printers at several universities across Germany produced anti-Semitic leaflets on or before Hitler's birthday this week, after hackers appeared to break into their computer systems, according to university officials.  Universities in Hamburg, Lüneburg and Tübingen confirmed that printers connected to their computer networks had suddenly started churning out the leaflets, most of them on Wednesday, the anniversary of Hitler's birth in Braunau, Austria, in 1889.    At least six other universities in Germany reported similar episodes, according to the German news agency DPA.   The leaflet produced at the University of Hamburg carried the slogan ''Europe, awake!'' and alluded to the mass migration that brought more than one million people, many from the Middle East, to the Continent last year. ''Europe is being flooded by enemy strangers,'' it read, in part.   Without naming Hitler, the leaflet referred to ''the words of a former European führer'' who blamed the Jews for bringing non-Europeans to the Rhineland.   Christian Matheis, a spokesman for the University of Hamburg, and Karl G. Rijkhoek, a spokesman for the University of Tübingen, said their institutions had filed formal complaints with the police and the judicial authorities after learning that their computer networks appeared to have been breached.   About 190 leaflets were printed on the Tübingen campus, Mr. Rijkhoek said, but fewer than 10 were printed at the University of Lüneburg, said a spokesman, Henning Zühlsdorff.   In the United States, several colleges reported similar breaches in March, according to The Star-Ledger, a newspaper in New Jersey, which reported an episode at Princeton, and to The Washington Post, which said several universities across the country had been affected.   The leaflet that was printed out in Hamburg included the Twitter hashtag #dailystormer, a term also used on a website referred to in the leaflets in the United States, Mr. Matheis said. The term is an allusion to a Nazi publication.     "
Software for Stopping Freedom,"Software is very, very good at reducing costs -- including, it seems, the cost of suppressing political dissent. As Nicole Perlroth writes, software companies are selling with little restriction spying and hacking tools to governments interested in quashing human-rights workers, political dissidents and journalists. Though the target clients are often authoritarian states, the companies are frequently in the liberal democracies of Europe and America.     The reason (brace yourself) is money. These kinds of deals, which also include training people in using the software to spy on dissidents, can be worth five- and six-figure sums. That's a big sale for a small team of software writers. For a dictatorship, it may be less than the laundry bill on secret police uniforms.   As a result, a human-rights activist in the United Arab Emirates has been beaten, robbed and fired from his job. He was one of 1,100 people the government contracted to spy on.   The Italian company that carried out the work for the Emirates says it is no longer working with that government, but that is largely because Italy won't let it export there. Italy only found out because this team of ace hackers was hacked.   There are many other companies happy to step in and make such sales, and in many places such exports are not well known or understood.   In our highly networked world, software has become as important a tool of control as guns, but international arms merchants are far more regulated.   There are signs that is changing. Last October, the Obama administration charged two men with smuggling to Syria equipment that could be used to spy on dissidents.   The people in that case, however, appeared to be moving offshore hardware as well as software. Those physical boxes are easier to see than pure software, which could in theory be transferred to a neutral country, then sold to a dictatorship.   As more of the network is modeled in software, without specialty hardware required, the harder it may be to catch the arms merchants of the online world.     "
"Chinese Curbing Cyberattacks on U.S. Interests, Report Finds","WASHINGTON -- Nine months after President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a broad crackdown on cyberespionage aimed at curbing the theft of intellectual property, the first detailed study of Chinese hacking has found a sharp drop-off in almost daily raids on Silicon Valley firms, military contractors and other commercial targets. But the study, conducted by the iSight intelligence unit of FireEye, a company that manages large network breaches, also concluded that the drop-off began a year before Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced their accord in the White House Rose Garden. In a conclusion that is largely echoed by American intelligence officials, the study said the change is part of Mr. Xi's broad effort to bring the Chinese military, which is considered one of the main sponsors of the attacks, further under his control.    As a result, the same political forces that may be alleviating the theft of data from American companies are also responsible for Mr. Xi's stunningly swift crackdown on the Chinese media, bloggers and others who could challenge the Communist Party.    ''It's a mixed bag,'' said Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant, now part of FireEye, which first detailed the activities of a People's Liberation Army cyber-arm, called Unit 61398, that had been responsible for some of the most highly publicized thefts of American technology. ''We still see semiconductor companies and aerospace firms attacked.''   But the daily barrage of attacks has diminished, which Mr. Mandia attributed to ''public pressure'' from, among others, the Justice Department's decision to indict five members of the P.L.A. unit about a year after its activities were exposed.   Today, Unit 61398 appears to be largely out of business, its hackers dispersed to other military, private and intelligence units. Many China scholars and legal experts remain skeptical that the Chinese are deterred by American indictments, since the P.L.A. officers are unlikely to see the inside of an American courtroom. But John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said the report validated his strategy.   ''The lesson is that when you figure out who has done this kind of theft, don't fear making it public,'' he said. ''This is a slow process, but we are beginning to make people realize that even in cyberspace, laws and norms are applicable.''   Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi drew up their agreement narrowly. It covers intellectual property theft -- Chinese cybercriminals have stolen everything from designs for the F-35 fighter jet to the design of gas distribution networks -- but not ordinary espionage against government targets.   So, for example, the administration has not publicly talked about penalizing China for the theft of personal data on roughly 22 million Americans, whose security-clearance information was taken from the Office of Personnel Management. In fact, the administration has never publicly blamed China for that theft, although the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., did talk about China's role once, before he was told by the administration not to refer to any specific country.   As recently as last week, senior administration officials were in Beijing trying to flesh out the agreement between the two presidents. Participants say that among the points of discussion was how to set up a hotline through which the two countries can alert each other to malicious software they have detected in global networks, with the expectation that Chinese and American investigators would work to find its source.   Establishing such norms of behavior is far more likely to be effective than attempting to negotiate a treaty, according to outside experts who have been trying to devise the cyberequivalent of arms-control agreements.   ''Treaties are not verifiable in the cyberarena,'' said Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor known for his studies of how nations use ''soft power,'' who in recent years has turned to the problem of regulating activity in cyberspace. ''The same code can be benign or a weapon depending on the user's intent,'' he said. For example, a six-digit code that unlocks a cellphone is a protection for the user -- and a potential weapon for a hacker.   ''So instead of focusing on the weapons, you have to focus on targets,'' Mr. Nye said. ''You start by saying that you don't target something that has a clearly civilian use, like a power grid.''   Mr. Nye and Michael Chertoff, the secretary of Homeland Security during the Bush administration, who now runs a private firm that is deeply involved in cybersecurity, were among the lead authors of a report to be published on Tuesday by the Global Commission on Internet Governance that will describe those norms to the United Nations and other groups.   Just how fundamentally the Chinese are changing is a matter of debate. There is some evidence, American intelligence officials say, that while the People's Liberation Army is not stealing as much on behalf of Chinese state-owned firms, much of the hacking activity has been shifted to the intelligence agencies, which can make the case that they are stealing national security secrets, not commercial information. Often, the difference is blurry, especially when the target is, say, the design of a satellite or a ship.   Even after Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced their agreement last fall, American officials have said they have discovered malware in power grids, cellphone networks and other purely civilian targets. But it is unclear whether that malicious software is intended to collect information about users, shut the system down or both.   The FireEye study concluded that as early as 2014, around the time of the indictment of the P.L.A.'s officers and hackers, the Chinese government had already been modifying its approach to cyberoperations.   The study of 72 Chinese hacking groups showed a sharp drop-off in the volume of attacks. But as recently as March, FireEye saw efforts to obtain information on American military projects by stealing access credentials to a contractor, and there has been continual theft of personal information from health care providers. The Chinese hacking groups have also focused on non-American targets, including Russia, South Korea and Vietnam, and have sometimes aimed at targets related to the disputes over Chinese claims in the South China Sea.   The report concludes that Chinese attacks have decreased in volume, but increased in sophistication. The result is that Chinese hackers are now acting more like Russian hackers: They pick their targets more carefully, and cover their tracks.   ''We see a threat that is less voluminous but more focused, calculated, and still successful in compromising corporate networks,'' the report said.

The Face of Hacktivism,"Unlike most Hollywood attempts, the computer hacking scenes in the USA Network techno-thriller ''Mr. Robot'' are both cinematic and realistic-looking. But they aren't so easy to shoot. On the show's set in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in early July, a scene's makeshift Wi-Fi antenna kept falling over, the screen of a prop cellphone wouldn't stay lit and, in one fraught moment, a new laptop slid out of its box and crashed to the floor.    ''I hope you bought the warranty,'' the show's star, Rami Malek, clad in the signature black sweatshirt of his character, Elliot Alderson, told a producer.   Mr. Malek swore, exasperated. ''I thought I was supposed to be good at this tech stuff!''    Such moments underscore the sweat equity that goes into rendering the taut, remarkably assured world of the series, which was created by Sam Esmail and returns for its second season on Wednesday, July 13.   Arriving last summer as a grim, haunted curiosity on a network known mainly for dimpled dudes in suits, ''Mr. Robot'' went on to become one of the most acclaimed shows of 2015. Inspired by real-life movements like Anonymous and Occupy, the tale of anarchist coders waging war on corporate culture was a hacktivist inversion of Silicon Valley cliché: The ''fsociety'' hooligans of ''Mr. Robot'' sought to make the world a better place by destroying its financial foundations.   The first season won a Peabody Award, among other honors, for its sleek embrace of au courant concerns like the loss of privacy amid the tyranny of smartphones and social media. At times, the topicality reached through the screen -- among the real-world events the show uncannily, if inadvertently, anticipated were embarrassing corporate hacks (Ashley Madison) and, more tragically, televised death. (The August season finale, in which an executive shoots himself on live TV, was postponed a week after a gunman killed two Virginia broadcast journalists during an on-air report.)   Aside from Mr. Esmail, the person most responsible for whether ''Mr. Robot'' is a one-season wonder or a show with some staying power is Mr. Malek. The 35-year-old actor gave a breakout performance as Elliot, a gifted but mentally unstable hacker with social anxiety and a morphine addiction, and is the face of the show in every conceivable way, from posters to point-of-view. The audience watches the story unfold largely through Elliot's shifting, unreliable perspective. His high-beam gaze vibrating with intensity one moment and wounded vulnerability the next, Elliot physically manifests the anxious, fractured themes of ''Mr. Robot'' as explicitly as the boorish, brooding Tony Soprano did for ''The Sopranos'' or the slick but troubled Don Draper did for ''Mad Men.''   But unlike those complicated white men, Mr. Malek, who like Mr. Esmail is of Egyptian descent, embodies a time when television, through shows like ''Orange Is the New Black,'' ''Fresh Off the Boat'' and ''Transparent,'' is finally starting to reflect the diversity and multiculturalism that define American life.   On an urgently modern show, he is an urgently modern leading man, though the phrase makes him chuckle. ''Five or 10 years ago, I would have never been considered for the lead of a show,'' Mr. Malek said. ''Even going into the audition it was like: 'No way. Ultimately they're going to go with someone who looks more conventional, someone society would be more accepting of.'''   The second season of ''Mr. Robot'' brings both the usual sophomore pressures -- Can it sustain the promise of its debut? Will the praise translate into more viewers? -- and a singular narrative challenge, springing from last year's big twist.   (Warning: For anyone who hasn't watched or finished Season 1, here be spoilers.)   Mr. Robot, played by Christian Slater, was revealed to be a hallucination based on Elliot's dead father, who had owned a computer store. While that move was not unique -- the show signaled its debt to predecessors like ''Fight Club'' -- what comes next is: Mr. Robot returns as a core character for Season 2, an insistent, at times antagonistic, sidekick who is no less prominent despite his imaginary status. ''Discovering something like that is one thing,'' Mr. Malek said. ''Actually taking steps to live through and manage it is entirely another beast.''   As Mr. Slater said, ''Anybody can relate to having that other voice inside their head talking to them, telling them what they should have done.''   ''Mr. Robot'' was not a ratings giant in its first season, drawing an average of slightly more than 2.7 million viewers a week, 1.4 million of them in the coveted 18-49 age demographic; it didn't crack the Top 100 in that category for 2015. USA is aggressively marketing the new season in a bid to raise the numbers, according to Alex Sepiol, an NBCUniversal executive vice president for development. But the show's buzz and acclaim are its own rewards as the channel, in pursuit of a younger audience, continues to move away from lighter fare like ''White Collar'' and ''Royal Pains'' into moodier series.   This season the show is expanding to 12 episodes from 10. More recognizable performers, including Craig Robinson, Grace Gummer and the rapper Joey Badass, have joined the cast, and USA is adding a live after-show, ''Hacking Robot,'' that has its debut on July 13.   The premiere picks up not long after Season 1's culminating megahack, which wiped out all debt and threw the world into a financial tailspin (see accompanying article). The new season explores the fallout and fills in some of last season's blanks -- we still, for example, don't know how the cyberattack actually was handled -- as it devotes more of its focus to characters like Elliot's friend Angela (Portia Doubleday) and his sister and fellow hacker Darlene (Carly Chaikin). ''You definitely get answers to the questions from last season, but at the same time, you'll be left with just as many different questions,'' Ms. Chaikin said.   Viewers can expect gloomier visuals to signify Elliot's continuing mental disintegration, Mr. Esmail said. In a rare move for television, he is directing every episode, using a block shooting schedule -- all the scenes in a given location are shot in a chunk, despite which episode they appear in -- more common to feature filmmaking.   Mr. Esmail sees the new episodes as the start of the second act of a story he expects to last four or five seasons. ''The Mr. Robot reveal wasn't the ending; it was the setup,'' he said. The real story of the show is Elliot's journey to resolve a convulsive identity crisis and make some sort of sense of himself.   ''The idea of how he's going to reconcile this relationship with Mr. Robot -- it's the title but it's also the central conflict of the whole series,'' Mr. Esmail said.   Mr. Esmail had never worked in television before ''Mr. Robot,'' which began as a film script before he decided the complex narrative would work better as a serial. But after auditioning many ''great actors'' for Elliot, Mr. Esmail began to wonder if what he'd written was too caustic to watch at all. ''I thought it was the material and that I would have to start over -- it felt like we were getting yelled at by this guy,'' he said.   That changed when Mr. Malek infused Elliot's scorn with a warmth and vulnerability that suggested the emotional fragility that is, in effect, the foundation of the show. ''I did not know that's what he needed until Rami brought it,'' Mr. Esmail said.   While he's often nearly catatonic as Elliot, Mr. Malek in conversation is jocular and excitable, his elongated vowels carrying traces of his Southern California roots. He grew up in the San Fernando Valley, the son of Egyptian immigrants who hoped he'd become a lawyer or doctor. (His twin brother is a teacher, and his older sister is a physician.) He tried debate in high school and was terrible, he said, but a teacher saw a spark and urged him toward drama. A school performance of Charles Fuller's ''Zooman and the Sign,'' with his parents in the audience, was a turning point.   ''In that moment, I had a connection that I never had with my father before, and I realized just how powerful this kind of communication and art could be,'' he said.   After college in Indiana, he returned to Los Angeles and began auditioning while supporting himself with restaurant jobs. Bit parts in ''Gilmore Girls'' and ''Medium'' gave way to more involved work in shows like ''24'' and films including the ''Night at the Museum'' movies, a ''Twilight'' installment, the indie drama ''Short Term 12'' and Paul Thomas Anderson's ''The Master.''   His most memorable role before Elliot was as a jaded private in ''The Pacific,'' the HBO World War II mini-series produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, among others. At the AFI Awards in January, Mr. Spielberg took the actor aside to let him know that ''Tom and I are so proud of you,'' Mr. Malek recalled, incredulous, his eyes bulging at the memory. ''And I was like, come on!''   Mr. Malek knew nothing about hacker culture before ''Mr. Robot'' and remains skeptical of what he regards as the phoniness of social media -- he once posted photos of himself and other actors onto his Instagram account, only to delete them all. (It remains empty.)   Films and television tend to depict hacking haphazardly at best, and it's a point of pride for Mr. Esmail that any code that appears in ''Mr. Robot'' is at least rooted in legitimate programming language. Mr. Malek stopped asking what any of it means some time ago.   Back in Brooklyn, he ran through the scene yet again, off-camera technical advisers whispering keystrokes (''typing, typing, mousepad, click, click, click, return ... '') as he pecked at the salvaged laptop. At the same time, he interacted with a co-star and also responded to Elliot's continuing internal narration, which a writer's assistant wirelessly reads into his ear during filming. Later, he will record the voice-over and shoot the programming close-ups while being coached through the code, line by line.   There are easier TV gigs, Mr. Malek acknowledged as he walked a visitor off the soundstage, but ''these are the characters that, as an actor, you dream of playing.''   ''I don't think I've really come to grips with it,'' he said of his burgeoning stardom. ''But I'm beginning to realize that yes, something special is going on here.''     "
Now the Hack Is Focused on His Head,"This time, ''Mr. Robot'' isn't sneaking up on anyone. Last summer, this cyberdowner drama was a stealth success, arriving with little fanfare on the lightweight USA Network and walking away with a Golden Globe, a Peabody Award and widespread agreement that it was the coolest show on television. It returns for its second season on Wednesday, with the momentum of that attention and the weight of expectations. It's even added its own live after-show, the less than elegantly titled ''Hacking Robot.'' Narrated by Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek), a gifted but psychologically challenged programmer whose imaginary friend, Mr. Robot (Christian Slater), led a group of hackers intent on bringing down the banking system, the first season was a smart and entertaining 10-episode thriller with a stylish, off-center look and a distinctive tone: an ominous low drone, punctuated by periodic spasms of violence and alarm.     The season built toward the execution of a hack against the monolithic E Corp that would disrupt the world's economic system, but its central drama was the big, late-season reveal: that Mr. Robot was Elliot, and Elliot was Mr. Robot, an alternate personality he had created, modeled on his dead father. As Season 2 begins, a month after the cyberattack, we quickly learn that Mr. Robot is still around, and that Elliot has moved home, cutting himself off from the internet in an attempt to control his abrasive other self.   The 90-minute season premiere (the only episode made available to critics) mostly sets up this Elliot-Mr. Robot dynamic, and if you want to be nice, you can call it transitional. Actually, it's kind of a drag. The ambiguity that made the first season intriguing is largely gone, replaced by straightforward psychological drama that reinforces your suspicion that the show's strengths lay in the puzzle, not the psychology. So it's not promising that its creator, Sam Esmail, has said that from here, the focus will be on Elliot's identity crisis.   Other strands of the story, having to do with E Corp's response to the hack, and featuring Michael Cristofer as the company's chief executive, and Brian Stokes Mitchell as its chief technology officer, have the familiar clammy vibe. But some scenes, like an extended sequence of electronic devices going haywire in a luxury apartment, continue too long without any real payoff.   Mr. Esmail, who wrote and directed the season premiere, deserves some benefit of the doubt. He has 10 more episodes to get the conspiracy-thriller engine cranked up again, and you can see him setting up a situation in which Elliot, E Corp, the fsociety hackers and the F.B.I., among others, will fight to assert authority amid the (mild) societal chaos brought about by the hack.   That could be fun to watch. It would be more absorbing if Mr. Esmail evinced a stronger point of view about the themes of technology, control and freedom that serve as the source code for his story. The declarations of both the hackers and the bankers don't amount to much more than platitudes, and the only time Mr. Esmail really seems exercised by the subject is when he takes an occasional sarcastic swipe at social media.   Watching ''Mr. Robot'' can be a little like living in Elliot's skin: engrossed by a skillfully executed dystopian fantasy while nagged by the knowledge that it isn't everything it claims to be. That's a good plot but not an optimum viewing experience. The sooner Elliot sets aside his identity crisis and gets back to saving the world, the better.     "
Questions Loom Over a Response to Cyberattacks,"ASPEN, Colo. -- It has been an open secret throughout the Obama presidency that world powers have escalated their use of cyberpower. But the recent revelations of hacking into Democratic campaign computer systems in an apparent attempt to manipulate the 2016 election is forcing the White House to confront a new question: whether, and if so how, to retaliate. So far, the administration has stopped short of publicly accusing the Russian government of President Vladimir V. Putin of engineering the theft of research and emails from the Democratic National Committee and hacking into other campaign computer systems. However, private investigators have identified the suspects, and American intelligence agencies have told the White House that they have ''high confidence'' that the Russian government was responsible.    Less certain is who is behind the selective leaks of the material, and whether they have a clear political objective. Suspecting such meddling is different from proving it with a certainty sufficient for any American president to order a response.    Even if officials gather the proof, they may not be able to make their evidence public without tipping off Russia, or its proxies in cyberspace, about how deeply the National Security Agency has penetrated that country's networks. And designing a response that will send a clear message, without prompting escalation or undermining efforts to work with Russia in places like Syria, where Russia is simultaneously an adversary and a partner, is even harder.   The Russians tried to make it tougher still on Saturday when they declared that they had found evidence of American activity in their government systems.   It was hardly a shocking revelation; anyone who leafed through Edward J. Snowden's revelations saw evidence of daily efforts to break into Russian spy agencies, nuclear installations and leadership compounds.   But in a talk on Friday evening at the Aspen Security Forum, an annual gathering that draws many of the nation's top intelligence and military officials, John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, made clear that while spying on each other's political institutions is fair game, making data public -- in true or altered form -- to influence an election is a new level of malicious activity, far different from ordinary spy vs. spy maneuvers.   ''When it is determined who is responsible for this,'' Mr. Brennan said, choosing his words carefully to avoid any direct implication of Russia, there ''will be discussions at the highest levels of government about what the right course of action will be. Obviously interference in the U.S. election process is a very, very serious matter.''   The Russia problem is thorny, and persistent. Just four months into his presidency in 2009, President Obama and his top national security advisers received a warning from American intelligence agencies: Of all the nations targeting America's computer networks, a National Intelligence Estimate warned, Russia had the most ''robust, longstanding program that combines a patient, multidisciplinary approach to computer network operations with proven access and tradecraft.''   Mr. Obama might have been a bit distracted at the time. While setting up his new administration, he was also learning the dark arts of cyberwar, descending into the Situation Room to oversee a complex American-Israeli offensive operation to disable Iran's nuclear centrifuges. He expressed concern to his aides that the operation would help fuel the escalation of cyberattacks and counterattacks.   The concern was justified. Since then, Iran has attacked Saudi Arabia, Russia has brought down a power grid in Ukraine, the North Koreans have attacked the South. The list gets longer every month.   But deterrence has been spotty. In the Democratic National Committee case, two senior administration officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the options, ranging from countercyberattacks on the F.S.B. and the G.R.U., two competing Russian spy agencies at the center of the current hacking, to economic, travel and other sanctions aimed at suspected perpetrators.   At the event in Aspen on Saturday afternoon, Lisa O. Monaco, Mr. Obama's homeland security adviser, sidestepped specific discussion of the D.N.C. hacking but acknowledged that the administration might soon have to consider whether the United States' electoral system constitutes ''critical infrastructure,'' like the power grid or the cellphone network.   ''I think it's a serious question,'' she said, especially if there is ''coercion, destruction, manipulation of data.'' Ms. Monaco noted that whenever the United States thinks about retaliation, ''the danger of escalation and misinterpretation is such that we have to be responsible about it.'' But she also said that if an event were serious enough, ''we have to be very clear we will respond.''   The cost of doing nothing could be high. As the United States and other nations move to more electronic voting systems, the opportunities for mischief rise. Imagine, for example, a vote as close as the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, but with accusations about impossible-to-trace foreign manipulation of the ballots or the vote count, leaving Americans wondering about the validity of the outcome.   For Mr. Obama, the president who has done the most to raise alarms about the risks of cyberattacks and the most to build up the United States Cyber Command, this territory is fraught with politics, intelligence trade-offs and questions of American values.   ''I think that the administration needs to be ironclad on the evidence here to convince the American people that this is about policy, not politics,'' said Jason Healey, a scholar at Columbia University who specializes in cyberconflict between nations. ''This has got to be about defending a constitutional process, not a party.''   Last week, two California Democrats who specialize in intelligence issues, Representative Adam B. Schiff and Senator Dianne Feinstein, sent Mr. Obama a letter urging him to make public the intelligence assessments on the Democratic National Committee hacking.   Mr. Obama often says the world of cyberconflict is still ''the Wild West.'' There are no treaties, no international laws, just a patchwork set of emerging ''norms'' of what constitutes acceptable behavior.   For example, Mr. Obama has pressed President Xi Jinping of China to work with the United States and other nations to develop rules about the theft of intellectual property, and about not interfering with a nation's efforts to bring attacked systems back online. Attacking another nation's power grid in peacetime is considered out of bounds.   But every new case brings a new and imaginative way to weaponize cyberpower. Until November 2014, when North Korea hacked into the computers at Sony Pictures Entertainment in retaliation for a comedy that portrayed a C.I.A. plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, the country's leader, no one seriously considered a movie studio to be ''critical infrastructure.''   Yet the attack on Sony -- which melted down 70 percent of its computing power -- was the only case that brought the president to the White House press room to accuse another nation of launching a deliberate cyberattack, and to promise retaliation. Mr. Obama said he was driven to go public by the fact that North Korea was trying to suppress free speech and intimidate Americans with threats if they went to the theater.   It is unclear how the United States may have retaliated against the North in secret, if it even did so. But the public punishment, the announcement of some mild economic sanctions, seemed highly ineffective. They were lost in the sea of other sanctions imposed on the North since the signing of the armistice that halted, but did not end, the Korean War 63 years ago.   Yet the decision to name North Korea -- a country with which the United States does no other real business -- was an outlier.   China was never formally named in the theft of the security clearance files on more than 21 million Americans, revealing fingerprints, personal financial details and the personal data about family, friends and former lovers. To James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, that was not an ''attack,'' it was just very good espionage. Given the chance, he said last year, ''we would have done the same thing.''   Similarly, the administration decided not to call out Russia when the same intelligence agencies implicated in the D.N.C. attack were believed to be behind the siphoning of tens of thousands of unclassified emails from the systems of the State Department and the White House. There was also a more targeted cyberespionage operation, which investigators attributed to the same actors, aimed at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But again, it was considered within the bounds of spy vs. spy.   Speaking at the Aspen forum on Thursday, Mr. Clapper, while stepping around who had conducted the hacking, said that in Mr. Putin's mind, the United States had meddled in Russian politics, in Ukraine and Georgia -- all part of former Soviet territory. (Mr. Putin complained that Hillary Clinton, in 2011, helped spark protests over a Russian parliamentary election that the United States considered riddled with voter fraud.)   ''Of course they see a U.S. conspiracy behind every bush and ascribe far more impact than we're actually guilty of, but that's their mind-set,'' Mr. Clapper said. ''And so I think their approach is they believe we are trying to influence political developments in Russia, trying to effect change, and so their natural response is to retaliate and do unto us as they think we've done unto them.''   He later described Mr. Putin as ''paranoid'' and said ''he is less of a throwback to the Communist era, than to the czars.'' He added later: ''He wants to be seen as the leader of a great power, coequal with the United States.''     "
Times's Moscow Bureau Hit by Attempted Hacking,"The New York Times's Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful.  ''We are constantly monitoring our systems with the latest available intelligence and tools,'' said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times. ''We have seen no evidence that any of our internal systems, including our systems in the Moscow bureau, have been breached or compromised.''    On Tuesday, citing United States officials briefed on the matter, CNN reported that The Times, along with other news organizations it did not identify, had been the victims of computer breaches by hackers thought to be working for Russian intelligence.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the attempted attack on The Times, a government official briefed on the inquiry said, but has no investigations underway of such episodes at other news organizations. Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the F.B.I. had no comment.   Ms. Murphy said The Times had not hired outside firms to investigate the attempted intrusion, contrary to the CNN report.   Evidence that hackers had targeted The Times came to light two months after private investigators concluded that Russian hackers, apparently connected to two of the country's intelligence agencies, had broken into the networks of the Democratic National Committee.   The F.B.I.'s investigation into that episode has since widened to include breaches at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is the fund-raising arm for the House Democrats.   So far, the Obama administration has not blamed the Russian government publicly for that attack, though intelligence officials have said they have ''high confidence'' that the attack on the Democratic National Committee was the work of two Russian intelligence agencies, the F.S.B. and the G.R.U. The first is the successor to the K.G.B., and the second is the leading military intelligence unit.   Once the federal investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee is complete, senior administration officials say, President Obama will have to decide whether the evidence of Russian responsibility for the breach is strong enough to warrant an American response. If so, he would also have to determine whether that response would take the form of quiet warnings, economic sanctions or even a counterattack of some kind.     "
"Which Debate Clips Got Replayed the Most on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC","In the 24 hours after the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, the three networks replayed several of the pivotalmoments, often highlighting different clips and leaving their viewers with different impressions of those moments. Clinton's Claimon a Trade Deal    The back and forth over Mrs. Clinton's support for trade agreements came early in the debate and was considered one of Mr. Trump's strongest moments. In fact-checking segments, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC hosts and guests generally agreed with Mr. Trump's claim that Mrs. Clinton had called the Trans-Pacific Partnership accord ''the gold standard'' before she came out against it.    TRUMP You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.   CLINTON Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.   Secret, and Not Secret, Plans to Fight the Islamic State   The conservative-leaning Fox News highlighted Mr. Trump's attacks on Mrs. Clinton over her plan to fight the Islamic State. The two other networks played the clip fewer times. In one of those, CNN commentators gave a favorable review to Mr. Trump. But during at least one MSNBC program, the clip was followed by laughter at Mr. Trump's hyperbole that Mrs. Clinton had been fighting ISIS for her ''entire adult life.   TRUMP She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think Gen. Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.   CLINTON Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.   Tax Returns vs. Deleted Emails   At one point in the debate, Mr. Trump said he would release his tax returns when Mrs. Clinton released her emails. CNN and MSNBC both ran more clips on the exchange in which Mrs. Clinton alleged that Mr. Trump had not paid federal income taxes, and he said that made him ''smart.'' Fox News and CNN emphasized Mrs. Clinton's admission that she made a mistake by using a private email server.   CLINTON Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes.   CLINTON You know, I made a mistake using a private email.   Who Hacked the Democratic National Committee   Mr. Trump's comment that the hacking of the committee could have been committed by China -- or by a 400-pound person sitting on their bed -- elicited amusement on MSNBC, which spent more time than the other networks on the segment about cyberattacks. In at least one clip, a guest noted that United States intelligence officials have high confidence that Russia is behind the attacks.   TRUMP I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.? You don't know who broke into D.N.C.   Miss Universe and Trump's Restraint   CNN and MSNBC more frequently played the clip of Mrs. Clinton telling the story of a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, whom Mr. Trump had disparaged. Fox and MSNBC both discussed Trump's ''rough'' statement. Some Fox guests praised his restraint in not raising Bill Clinton's infidelities, while there was debate on MSNBC over whether or not Mr. Clinton's personal life was fair game in future debates.   CLINTON He called this woman ''Miss Piggy.''   TRUMP I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ''I can't do it. I just can't do it.''     "
Czechs Arrest Man Wanted by the F.B.I. for Hacking,"PRAGUE -- A man identified as a Russian hacker suspected of pursuing targets in the United States has been arrested in the Czech Republic, the police announced Tuesday evening. The suspect was captured in a raid at a hotel in central Prague on Oct. 5, about 12 hours after the authorities heard that he was in the country, where he drove around in a luxury car with his girlfriend, according to the police. The man did not resist arrest, but he had medical problems and was briefly hospitalized, the police said in a statement.    David Schön, a police spokesman, said on Wednesday that the arrest of the man, whose name has not been released, was not announced immediately ''for tactical reasons.''    The police statement said that ''the man was a Russian citizen suspected of hacking attacks on targets in the United States,'' and that the raid was conducted in collaboration with the F.B.I. after Interpol issued an arrest warrant for him.   The social media company LinkedIn said it believed it had been a victim in the case. The company, which acts as a virtual job network, said it had been actively involved in the F.B.I.'s case since it was hacked in 2012.   The F.B.I. said in a statement that the arrest was an example of the collaboration needed ''to successfully defeat cyber adversaries,'' but declined to provide any further details.   The arrest occurred two days before the Obama administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other institutions and prominent individuals.   But law enforcement officials in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment while the investigation was underway, said Wednesday that the suspect did not appear to be related to the hacking of the Democrats' emails or to organizations like DCLeaks or WikiLeaks.   A judge in Prague has ordered the man to remain in custody, and a court will examine whether to extradite him to the United States.   The Russian Embassy in Prague called for the man to be released.   ''We insist that the detained Russian citizen should be transferred to Russia,'' the state-run Russian news agency Tass quoted Aleksei Kolmakov, the embassy's spokesman, as saying.   Mr. Kolmakov said that the embassy had been notified about the detention, but that the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, had told the news website RBK that it did not have details about the man's identity.   Jakub Janda, who studies the Russian government and is a deputy director of the European Values Think-Tank in Prague, said that the arrest served as confirmation that ''the Czech Republic is so far considered a safe base for Russian intelligence and influence activities focused on Western targets.''   He added, ''Prague is unofficially considered to be a springboard for some Kremlin activities inside Europe, also using huge Russian diplomatic presence of approximately 140 staff.''   Mr. Janda also said that the arrest showed that ''Western governments are waking up and finally considering hostile Russian intelligence and disinformation operations to be an open and urgent threat, even at the level of the U.S. administration.''   He added, ''Open arrests of hostile individuals such as this one can serve as a deterrent element.''   The United States director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said in a statement on Oct. 7 that high-level Russian officials were trying to interfere with American elections.   ''The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,'' Mr. Clapper said. ''These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.''   The antisecrecy organizations DCLeaks and WikiLeaks have been involved with the disclosures of illegally obtained emails from the hacked accounts of prominent figures including Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, and John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Guccifer 2.0 is the assumed name of a Romanian ''lone hacker'' responsible for copying thousands of emails and other files from the Democratic committee, but experts are not certain if the hacker is a person or a front created by Russian intelligence officials.   It appears that the man arrested in Prague is not related to the hackers Mr. Clapper described.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
New Weapons Used in Attack on the Internet,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Major websites were inaccessible to people across wide swaths of the United States on Friday after a company that manages crucial parts of the internet's infrastructure said it was under attack. Users reported sporadic problems reaching several websites, including Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, Reddit, Etsy, SoundCloud and The New York Times.    The company, Dyn, whose servers monitor and reroute internet traffic, said it began experiencing what security experts called a distributed denial-of-service attack just after 7 a.m. Reports that many sites were inaccessible started on the East Coast, but spread westward in three waves as the day wore on and into the evening.   And in a troubling development, the attack appears to have relied on hundreds of thousands of internet-connected devices like cameras, baby monitors and home routers that have been infected -- without their owners' knowledge -- with software that allows hackers to command them to flood a target with overwhelming traffic.    A spokeswoman said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security were looking into the incident and all potential causes, including criminal activity and a nation-state attack.   Kyle York, Dyn's chief strategist, said his company and others that host the core parts of the internet's infrastructure were targets for a growing number of more powerful attacks.   ''The number and types of attacks, the duration of attacks and the complexity of these attacks are all on the rise,'' Mr. York said.   Security researchers have long warned that the increasing number of devices being hooked up to the internet, the so-called Internet of Things, would present an enormous security issue. And the assault on Friday, security researchers say, is only a glimpse of how those devices can be used for online attacks.   Dyn, based in Manchester, N.H., said it had fended off the assault by 9:30 a.m. But by 11:52 a.m., Dyn said it was again under attack. After fending off the second wave of attacks, Dyn said at 5 p.m. that it was again facing a flood of traffic.   A global event is affecting an upstream DNS provider. GitHub services may be intermittently available at this time. -- GitHub Status (@githubstatus) October 21, 2016   A distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, occurs when hackers flood the servers that run a target's site with internet traffic until it stumbles or collapses under the load. Such attacks are common, but there is evidence that they are becoming more powerful, more sophisticated and increasingly aimed at core internet infrastructure providers.   Going after companies like Dyn can cause far more damage than aiming at a single website.   Dyn is one of many outfits that host the Domain Name System, or DNS, which functions as a switchboard for the internet. The DNS translates user-friendly web addresses like fbi.gov into numerical addresses that allow computers to speak to one another. Without the DNS servers operated by internet service providers, the internet could not operate.   In this case, the attack was aimed at the Dyn infrastructure that supports internet connections. While the attack did not affect the websites themselves, it blocked or slowed users trying to gain access to those sites.   Anyone else having a whole lot of trouble with sites loading properly this morning? Paypal is down, Twitter was down, Netflix half loading. -- Emmy Caitlin (@emmycaitlin) October 21, 2016   Mr. York, the Dyn strategist, said in an interview during a lull in the attacks that the assaults on its servers were complex.   ''This was not your everyday DDoS attack,'' Mr. York said. ''The nature and source of the attack is still under investigation.''   Later in the day, Dave Allen, the general counsel at Dyn, said tens of millions of internet addresses, or so-called I.P. addresses, were being used to send a fire hose of internet traffic at the company's servers. He confirmed that a large portion of that traffic was coming from internet-connected devices that had been co-opted by type of malware, called Mirai.   Dale Drew, chief security officer at Level 3, an internet service provider, found evidence that roughly 10 percent of all devices co-opted by Mirai were being used to attack Dyn's servers. Just one week ago, Level 3 found that 493,000 devices had been infected with Mirai malware, nearly double the number infected last month.   Mr. Allen added that Dyn was collaborating with law enforcement and other internet service providers to deal with the attacks.   In a recent report, Verisign, a registry for many domain names that has a unique perspective into this type of attack activity, reported a 75 percent increase in such attacks from April through June of this year, compared with the same period last year.   The attacks were not only more frequent, they were bigger and more sophisticated. The typical attack more than doubled in size. What is more, the attackers were simultaneously using different methods to attack the company's servers, making them harder to stop.   The most frequent targets were businesses that provide internet infrastructure services like Dyn.   ''DNS has often been neglected in terms of its security and availability,'' Richard Meeus, vice president for technology at Nsfocus, a network security firm, wrote in an email. ''It is treated as if it will always be there in the same way that water comes out of the tap.''   Last month, Bruce Schneier, a security expert and blogger, wrote on the Lawfare blog that someone had been probing the defenses of companies that run crucial pieces of the internet.   ''These probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks designed to determine exactly how well the companies can defend themselves, and what would be required to take them down,'' Mr. Schneier wrote. ''We don't know who is doing this, but it feels like a large nation-state. China and Russia would be my first guesses.''   It is too early to determine who was behind Friday's attacks, but it is this type of attack that has election officials concerned. They are worried that an attack could keep citizens from submitting votes.   Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia allow internet voting for overseas military and civilians. Alaska allows any Alaskan citizen to do so. Barbara Simons, the co-author of the book ''Broken Ballots: Will Your Vote Count?'' and a member of the board of advisers to the Election Assistance Commission, the federal body that oversees voting technology standards, said she had been losing sleep over just this prospect.   ''A DDoS attack could certainly impact these votes and make a big difference in swing states,'' Dr. Simons said on Friday. ''This is a strong argument for why we should not allow voters to send their voted ballots over the internet.''   This month the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, and the Department of Homeland Security accused Russia of hacking the Democratic National Committee, apparently in an effort to affect the presidential election. There has been speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory attack and the potential backlash this might cause from Russia.   Gillian M. Christensen, deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency was investigating ''all potential causes'' of the attack.   Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' this month that the United States was prepared to respond to Russia's election attacks in kind. ''We're sending a message,'' Mr. Biden said. ''We have the capacity to do it.''   But technology providers in the United States could suffer blowback. As Dyn fell under recurring attacks on Friday, Mr. York, the chief strategist, said such assaults were the reason so many companies are pushing at least parts of their infrastructure to cloud computing networks, to decentralize their systems and make them harder to attack.   ''It's a total wild, wild west out there,'' Mr. York said.     "
Russian Is Indicted in Hacking of Tech Companies,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A Russian man accused of breaking into computer systems at three internet companies in 2012 has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Oakland, Calif.  Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, 29, was arrested this month while vacationing with his girlfriend in the Czech Republic on charges that he hacked into computer networks at LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring, damaged computers and conspired to traffic in stolen information.    The arrest of Mr. Nikulin provided a look at the shadowy world of Russian hackers, who appear to operate with relative impunity even as they are accused of escalating attacks on computer networks in the United States. They are accused of attacking a long list of targets, including retailers, banks, energy companies, and more recently, the Democratic National Committee.   Hackers have been able to operate in Russia with little concern about getting arrested, security experts and law enforcement executives say, so long as they do not attack targets inside Russian borders. But they risk arrest when they leave the country.   In 2014, for example, a hacker was arrested in Guam and extradited to the United States for accessing cash register systems at American retailers between 2009 and 2011. A federal jury convicted that hacker, Roman Valerevich Seleznev, of 38 counts of hacking-related charges in August. He is awaiting sentencing.   The grand jury indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, accuses Mr. Nikulin of hacking into the computer networks of the three companies, damaging the computers of LinkedIn and Formspring employees, and using their credentials for further intrusions.   He is also accused of conspiring with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic in user credentials stolen from Formspring, a social networking site. He faces three counts of computer intrusion, two counts of causing damage to a protected computer, two counts of aggravated identity theft, one count of trafficking, and one count of conspiracy.   Mr. Nikulin could face more than 30 years of prison and more than $1 million in fines.   The charges were announced on Friday by Brian J. Stretch, a lawyer at the Justice Department, and John F. Bennett, a special agent in charge with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   Mr. Nikulin, who goes by the online aliases Chinabig01, Dex.007, Valeriy.krutov3 and itBlackHat, was captured in a raid at a hotel in central Prague on Oct. 5. The arrest came 12 hours after authorities there learned he was in the country with his girlfriend and driving a luxury car, according to local police.   He did not resist arrest, but had medical problems and was briefly hospitalized, the police said in a statement. The raid was conducted in collaboration with the F.B.I. after Interpol issued an arrest warrant for him.   Mr. Nikulin's arrest came two days before the Obama administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other institutions and prominent individuals.   Federal officials, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., have said that the United States would respond to the Russian attacks in kind.   After the Czech police arrested Mr. Nikulin, the Russian Embassy in Prague called for his release.   Aleksei Kolmakov, spokesman for the embassy in Prague, was quoted by the state-run Russian news agency Tass as saying, ''We insist that the detained Russian citizen should be transferred to Russia.''   A judge in Prague ordered Mr. Nikulin to remain in custody and a court to examine whether to extradite him to the United States.     "
Daily Report: Hackers Have New Tools to Bring Down Websites,"Some people are old enough to remember when websites went down because of incompetence, not malicious intent. The good news is that the software that runs big websites has improved significantly over the years. There are now tools that can spread traffic loads among thousands of servers and other improvements, so we have come to expect that our favorite sites will stay up all the time.     The bad news? Hackers also have new tools to take those sites down. Friday morning, Dyn, a New Hampshire company that hosts critical portions of the internet's infrastructure, was hit with so much traffic that its servers were overwhelmed. The attack caused sporadic disruptions at sites like Twitter, Reddit and The New York Times.   It is too early to say who did it. But security experts are concerned about how they did it: using a vast, co-opted collection of internet-connected devices, like cameras and perhaps even baby monitors, in what is called a distributed denial-of-service attack. Experts have been warning for some time that everyday objects with internet connections, the so-called internet of things, could be used in such an attack.   It appears those warnings have largely been ignored. And it is not clear how the attacks can be prevented in the future, other than making sure that everything in your home or your car or your office that is connected to the internet has a unique password.

White House Used Hotline to Warn Russia Over Hacking Before Election,"WASHINGTON -- Over the past month, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has received two starkly different messages about hacking into American computer networks from the current and future presidents of the United States: Don't you dare, and don't worry, we're not even sure it was you. The White House confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that eight days before the presidential election, the United States ''contacted the Russian government directly regarding malicious cyberactivity'' that was ''targeting U.S. state election-related systems.'' It sent the message over a rarely used system: a hotline connecting the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in both countries, which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major cyberincidents.     The pre-election warning -- only the latest after verbal cautions by President Obama, his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence -- was reported by The Washington Post.   The warnings to Russia against further hacking into polling or registration systems, or any further effort to affect the outcome of the election, are being hailed by the Obama administration as a success in deterrence. After all, they argue, a year and a half of Russian hacking activity seemed to slow, or halt, and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on Election Day.   But more than a few experts in deterring cyberattacks take a more skeptical view. They say the Russians had already achieved their main goal: to demonstrate how they could disrupt the American electoral process with the leak of hacked emails, including from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.   Mr. Putin suffered nothing worse than a warning, they note -- no sanctions, no counter cyberstrikes, no embarrassing revelations engineered by the United States. And he now has the satisfaction of dealing with President-elect Donald J. Trump, who during the campaign praised him, promised to build a more productive relationship with Russia and maintained there was no evidence that the Russians were behind the hacking.   ''Anytime anything wrong happens they like to'' blame the Russians, Mr. Trump said in an Oct. 10 debate with Mrs. Clinton. ''She doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking.''   Mr. Trump contended that the allegations of Russian activity were intended to ''tarnish me'' for advocating a new relationship with Moscow. He frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the campaign, suggesting the hacking was a fabrication. The leaks of emails worked largely to his advantage, embarrassing Democratic leaders like Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.   Mr. Trump's larger strategic message is that the United States and Russia need to cooperate on a range of issues.   But for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of American foreign policy and gives Mr. Putin the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until Mr. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. It is also raising the question of whether the Obama White House pushed back hard enough when American intelligence agencies concluded on Oct. 7 that ''only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.''   James A. Lewis, a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, dismissed the administration's claim that it had deterred Russia's hacking.   ''It seems a little bold to claim this is a success for deterrence, since the Russians weren't deterred from doing anything,'' he said. ''Their hacking work was mostly complete. The issue now is whether they will be deterred in the future, and the guessing is they will not. Strong private warnings aren't enough to constitute deterrence.''   In fact, the Russians appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than North Korea did for its attack on Sony  Pictures Entertainment in 2014. That attack melted down about 70 percent of Sony's computers and servers at its studios, wreaking considerable damage, and embarrassed many Sony executives. It was in response to the release of a movie, ''The Interview,'' that imagined a C.I.A. plot to kill Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.   After the Sony episode, the United States issued more sanctions against North Korea and encouraged China to limit the North's internet access, all of which runs through Chinese switching centers. Many experts had expected the White House to follow a similar path with Russia.   Instead, the White House concluded that the warnings, and the unstated suggestion that the United States had the power to reach inside Russian networks and see the origin of attacks, might suffice. It is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against Russia before Mr. Obama's departure from office, but that seems less and less likely.   The Oct. 31 warning did not deal with the hacking of the Democratic National Committee or Mr. Podesta's account, which James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the Russian leadership. Instead, it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process itself, and the fear it was originating from Russian territory, though it stopped short of saying it was a state-sponsored attack.

"Putin's 'Personal Beef' Led to Hacking Attacks, Clinton Tells Supporters","Hillary Clinton said on Thursday that the hacking attacks carried out by Russia against her campaign and the Democratic National Committee were intended ''to undermine our democracy'' and were ordered by Vladimir V. Putin ''because he has a personal beef against me.''  Speaking to a group of donors in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Putin, the Russian president, had never forgiven her for the accusation she made in 2011, when she was secretary of state, that parliamentary elections his country held that year were rigged.    ''Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election,'' Mrs. Clinton said.   It is the first time Mrs. Clinton has publicly addressed the impact of the hacks since the intelligence community concluded that they were specifically aimed at harming her campaign.   ''Make no mistake, as the press is finally catching up to the facts, which we desperately tried to present to them during the last months of the campaign,'' Mrs. Clinton told the group, which collectively poured roughly $1 billion into her effort. ''This is not just an attack on me and my campaign, although that may have added fuel to it. This is an attack against our country. We are well beyond normal political concerns here. This is about the integrity of our democracy and the security of our nation.''   In her remarks, she endorsed the proposal of a bipartisan group of senators to investigate the hacking and said the inquiry should be modeled on the commission set up after the Sept. 11 attacks. ''The public deserves to know exactly what happened, and why, in order for us to prevent future attacks on our systems, including our electoral system,'' she said.   Mrs. Clinton said the hacking was one of two ''unprecedented'' events that led to her defeat. The other was the release of a letter by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, shortly before the election disclosing new questions about emails handled by her private server. The letter, she said, cost her close races in several battleground states.   ''Swing-state voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the F.B.I. letter from Director Comey,'' she said.   Mrs. Clinton first talked about the impact of Mr. Comey's letters in a conference call with donors a few days after the election. Since the election she has kept a low profile, mostly appearing on social media in photographs by passers-by who have spotted her walking her dogs near her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.

"3 Chinese Made $4 Million Hacking Lawyers, U.S. Says","Law firms that advise on mergers once had to worry about a rogue employee trading on deal tips. Now, they have to worry about hackers doing the same. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged three Chinese citizens with making more than $4 million by trading on information they got by hacking into some of the top merger-advising law firms in New York. The three men targeted at least seven New York law firms to try to obtain information about deals in the works, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday.    The men were successful in hacking two firms, stealing emails of partners who work on mergers, prosecutors said. The three then bought shares of target companies, selling them after the deals were announced, prosecutors said.    Shares of targets in most such transactions tend to trade higher when a deal is announced because they are usually purchased for more than their market price.   Hackers' ability to breach the defenses of big law firms in search of confidential information about corporate clients -- including tips about coming mergers and acquisitions -- has long been a concern of federal authorities. Most major law firms have played down the threat posed by hackers and have been reluctant to discuss breaches or even attempted breaches.   ''This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. ''You are and will be targets of cyberhacking because you have information valuable to would-be criminals.''   The law firms were not identified in the indictment or in a parallel civil complaint brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Earlier this year, one large New York firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, confirmed that it had been the victim of a ''limited breach'' of its computer network in the summer of 2015. At the time, the law firm said it was ''not aware that any of the information that may have been accessed has been used improperly.''   Cravath did not immediately respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment on Tuesday.   ''Law firms have been identified as the weakest link, and it is great to see the U.S. attorney taking an interest,'' said Daniel Garrie, a law firm security consultant.   The three men charged with insider trading and hacking are Iat Hong, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, the United States attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Mr. Hong, a resident of Macau, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas.   The indictment and the S.E.C. complaint detailed a number of major deals in which confidential information had been retrieved.   One law firm was hacked in connection with the sale of Intermune, an American drug maker, to Roche of Switzerland, and the sale of Altera, a circuit manufacturer, to Intel. In both cases, the three men entered the law firm's servers after unlawfully obtaining an employee's credentials. They then installed malware on the law firm's web server, prosecutors said, enabling them to obtain information about live deals, including the price at which they were being negotiated.   The three successfully penetrated the servers of another law firm to obtain details about the acquisition by Pitney Bowes of Borderfree, prosecutors said.   They were extraordinarily active in pursuing information. The indictment says that from March to September 2015, the three men ''attempted to cause unauthorized access to the networks and servers of the targeted law firms on more than 100,000 occasions.''   Lawyers for the three men could not immediately be located.   The three were also involved with a start-up robotics company that was developing controller chips and control system solutions. They were accused of having sought confidential information like proprietary designs from two other robotics companies.     "
Security 'Arms Race' as AppleIs Said to Harden iPhone Tech,"WASHINGTON -- Apple engineers have begun developing new security measures that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone using methods similar to those now at the center of a court fight in California, according to people close to the company and security experts. If Apple succeeds in upgrading its security -- and experts say it almost surely will -- the company will create a significant technical challenge for law enforcement agencies, even if the Obama administration wins its fight over access to data stored on an iPhone used by one of the killers in last year's San Bernardino, Calif., rampage. If the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted to get into a phone in the future, it would need a new way to do so. That would most likely prompt a new cycle of court fights and, yet again, more technical fixes by Apple.    The only way out of this scenario, experts say, is for Congress to get involved. Federal wiretapping laws require traditional phone carriers to make their data accessible to law enforcement agencies. But tech companies like Apple and Google are not covered, and they have strongly resisted legislation that would place similar requirements on them.    ''We are in for an arms race unless and until Congress decides to clarify who has what obligations in situations like this,'' said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.   Companies have always searched for software bugs and patched holes to keep their code secure from hackers. But since the revelations of government surveillance made by Edward J. Snowden, companies have been retooling their products to protect against government intrusion.   For Apple, security is also a global marketing strategy. New security measures would not only help the company in its fight with the government, but also reassure investors and customers.   ''For all of those people who want to have a voice but they're afraid, we are standing up, and we are standing up for our customers because protecting them we view as our job,'' Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said on Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.   The company first raised the prospect of a security update last week in a phone call with reporters, who asked why the company would allow firmware -- the software at the heart of the iPhone -- to be modified without requiring a user password.   One senior executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, replied that it was safe to bet that security would continue to improve. Separately, a person close to the company, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this week that Apple engineers had begun work on a solution even before the San Bernardino attack. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on what she called rumors and speculation.   Independent experts say they have held informal conversations with Apple engineers over the last week about the vulnerability. Exactly how Apple will address the issue is unclear. Security experts who have been studying Apple's phone security say it is technically possible to fix.   ''There are probably 50 different ideas we have all sent to Apple,'' said Jonathan Zdziarski, a security researcher.   Apple built its recent operating systems to protect customer information. As Mr. Cook wrote in a recent letter to customers, ''We have even put that data out of our own reach, because we believe the contents of your iPhone are none of our business.''   But there is a catch. Each iPhone has a built-in troubleshooting system that lets the company update the system software without the need for a user to enter a passcode. Apple designed that feature to make it easier to repair malfunctioning phones.   In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. wants to exploit that troubleshooting system by forcing Apple to write and install new software that strips away several security features, making it much easier for the government to hack into the phone. The phone in that case is an old model, but experts and former Apple employees say that a similar approach could also be used to alter software on newer phones. That is the vulnerability Apple is working to fix.   Apple regularly publishes security updates and gives credit to researchers who hunt for bugs in the company's software. ''Usually, bug reports come in an email saying, 'Dear Apple Security, we've discovered a flaw in your product,' '' said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union. ''This bug report has come in the form of a court order.''   The court order to which Mr. Soghoian referred was issued last week by a federal judge magistrate, and tells Apple to write and install the code sought by the F.B.I. Apple has promised to challenge that order. Its lawyers have until Friday to file its opposition in court.   In many ways, Apple's response continues a trend that has persisted in Silicon Valley since Mr. Snowden's revelations. Yahoo, for instance, left its email service unencrypted for years. After Mr. Snowden revealed the National Security Agency surveillance, the company quickly announced plans to encrypt email. Google similarly moved to fix a vulnerability that the government was using to hack into company data centers.   Apple's showdown with the Justice Department is different in one important way. Now that the government has tried to force Apple to hack its own code, security officials say, the company must view itself as the vulnerability.   ''This is the first time that Apple has been included in their own threat model,'' Mr. Zdziarski said. ''I don't think Apple ever considered becoming a compelled arm of the government.''   The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., signaled this week that he expected Apple to change its security, saying that the phone-cracking tool the government sought in the San Bernardino case was ''increasingly obsolete.'' He said that supported the government's argument that it was not seeking a skeleton key to hack into all iPhones.   Apple, though, says the case could set a precedent for forcing company engineers to write code to help the government break into any iPhone. ''The U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,'' Mr. Cook said in his letter.   The heated back-and-forth between the government and technology companies is, at least in part, a function of the Obama administration's strategy. The White House has said it will not ask Congress to pass a law requiring tech companies to give the F.B.I. a way to gain access to customer data. That has left the Justice Department to fight for access one phone at a time, in court cases that often go unnoticed.   While it is generally accepted that Silicon Valley's tech giants can outgun the government in a technical fight, the companies do face one important limitation. Security features often come at the expense of making products slower or clunkier.   Apple's brand is built around creating products that are sleek and intuitive. A security solution that defeats the F.B.I. is unworkable if it frustrates consumers. One of the impediments to encrypting all the data in Apple's iCloud servers, for instance, has been finding a way to ensure that customers can easily retrieve and recover photos and other information stored there.   ''Telling a member of the public that they're going to lose all the family photos they've ever taken because they forgot their password is a really tough sell,'' Mr. Soghoian said. ''A company wants to sell products to the public.''   Follow The New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.     "
A Hack for Dissidents: Cover the Phone's Lens,"It's the stuff of urban legend, filtered through a 21st-century nightmare: A shadowy organization surreptitiously turns on the camera and microphone of your smartphone, changing an essential and trusted device into an insidious surveillance tool.  But according to Cynthia M. Wong, a senior internet researcher at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, authoritarian governments are able to do that when they hack into phones and other devices belonging to dissidents and nongovernmental organizations.    Some potential targets fight back with a simple countermeasure: a sticker or a patch of masking tape over the camera lens. It doesn't stop the hacking, of course, but ''it's an analog way to make sure you're not being spied on'' visually, Ms. Wong said.   She said that ''in the old days, five to 10 years ago,'' only major world powers like China, Russia or the United States were able to hack into phones this way. But today, smaller countries can buy the capability from private companies.   ''A much broader range of activists have to worry about their own governments hacking into phones,'' Ms. Wong said. ''The message governments are sending is: We are watching everything you do.''   Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent dissident in the United Arab Emirates, has been getting that message for years in one way or another. Texts he received this year, ostensibly about the torture of prisoners, turned out to be the work of hackers trying to infiltrate his phone. (He still gets similar texts, even after their true nature was exposed in news reports.)   ''Nothing is too strange for me anymore,'' he said.   So he has taken to fighting fire with fire: When Mr. Mansoor was followed, he said, he took photos of his pursuers and posted them online.   In a constant game of cat and mouse, it pays to be a well-informed mouse. Ms. Wong and her colleague Adam Coogle say that the messaging services WhatsApp and Signal have strong encryption systems, and that Apple iPhones are more secure than some Android devices, though they may also be too expensive for some dissidents and organizations.   ''Some activists just don't do enough to protect themselves,'' Mr. Coogle said.   In the meantime, there's still that cheap, simple patch over the camera, a tactic that Ms. Wong admits she herself uses. ''We tend to be a paranoid bunch,'' she said.

Five Resolutions to Simplify Your Tech Life; Tech Fix,"In 2017, why not try a new kind of New Year's resolution? Instead of just hitting the gym and dropping some pounds, consider changing some personal habits to simplify the tech in your life. If you are like most people, there are things you do with tech that could use some tweaking. Strengthening your password security, for one, would benefit you tremendously in an era when hacks are rampant. For another, purging the e-junk you have accumulated over the years would help the environment and your sanity. While you're at it, start doing maintenance on your electronics to make sure they work smoothly this year. Here are my top recommendations for resolutions to abide by to make tech less frustrating in the new year.  Clean Up Your Password Hygiene P.U. - what's that smell? It's your bad password hygiene. You are probably using the same password across multiple websites for banking, shopping, social media and email. That's understandable: A person can only memorize so many passwords. But in 2016, Yahoo reminded everybody that reusing passwords is a very bad idea, after it revealed that 500 million Yahoo accounts were compromised in 2014, in addition to 1 billion accounts that were hacked in 2013. If your Yahoo account password was the same as ones you used elsewhere, those accounts were vulnerable, too. Start off 2017 by spending a few hours logging into each of your accounts and creating unique, strong passwords. To make this easier, use applications like LastPass or 1Password, which are password-managing apps that let you use one master password to unlock a vault of passwords to log in to all of your internet accounts. They also automatically generate strong passwords for you. Then add an extra layer of protection by enabling two-factor verification on your accounts whenever the option is available. When you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before logging in. Taking these two simple steps will help safeguard you from the inevitable hacks that arise this year. Maintain Your Devices After regular use, our smartphones and computers start to feel sluggish and short-lived, but a bit of maintenance can make them feel brand new. First, check the condition of your batteries. With iPhone and iPads, you can hook the devices up to a Mac and run the app coconutBattery, which reveals battery statistics. With Android devices, you can use the app Battery by MacroPinch. If your battery is on its last legs, it's time to order a new one or schedule an appointment at a repair shop to replace it. If your devices feel sluggish, freeing up some storage can also make a dramatic difference. Start by purging apps you never use anymore. Then do something about those photos you never look at: back up all your photos to the cloud using services like Google Photos and then delete them from your device to start the new year with a fresh photo roll. Show your gadgets some physical love, too. Give your screens a good wipe with a wetted cloth. If you own a desktop computer, open it up and use compressed air to blow out the dust. Do this basic maintenance every six months and your devices will run smoothly for many years. Mind Your Infrastructure We don't hesitate to buy new smartphones every two years - but that neglected, ugly Wi-Fi router tucked away in the corner of the living room may be the most important tech product to upgrade every few years. Among all tech headaches, there is nothing more annoying than a sluggish, spotty internet connection. Start off each new year by doing some checks on your internet infrastructure. If your router is more than three years old, you probably need a new one that is compatible with today's faster, smarter wireless standards. If you are relying on a router provided by your broadband provider, you should probably buy a more powerful stand-alone router. The Wirecutter, the product recommendations website owned by The New York Times, recommends TP-Link's Archer C7 as the best router for most people. (If you have less technical know-how, I recommend the Wi-Fi system from Eero, which offers a smartphone app that holds your hand through the network setup.) Be Less Wasteful Unused gadgets and power cables take up lots of space in drawers and attics. This e-waste would be better off sold or donated to someone in need, or recycled for their precious metals. During spring cleaning season, make plans to get this unwanted junk out of your life. Companies like Amazon and Gazelle offer headache-free trade-in services for selling used electronics. Just punch in the gadget you are trying to trade in, like a used iPhone or Samsung Galaxy device, and the sites offer a quote for how much money or Amazon store credit you can get in exchange for the gear. Then pack up the outdated hardware, slap on a shipping label, drop it off at a shipping center and wait for the money to roll in. There is bound to be unsellable e-junk in your pile. Fortunately, all Best Buy locations will take your used electronics and recycle them for free. Just bag the items up and drop them off at the store's customer-service counter, and the retailer will take care of the rest. Be a Smarter Shopper To get great deals on electronics, there is no need to wait until Black Friday or Cyber Monday. Carefully research high-quality, long-lasting items you want and buy them when their prices drop a significant amount. This technique can be used when online shopping for just about anything, but especially for tech products that decrease in price as they age. Web tools like Camel Camel Camel and Keepa make price tracking on Amazon.com easy. On their websites, just do a search on the name of the item, and the sites will pull up a price history. From there, you can create a tracker to alert you via email whenever a price drops to a desired amount. Many deals that emerge throughout the year are as good, or better, than the ones on Black Friday. You just have to know how to spot them. Another way to save money is to consider buying used products whenever possible. Be on the lookout for sales of used or refurbished electronics from reputable brands like Apple, GameStop, Amazon and Gazelle. Before you buy a used item, read about its condition carefully: Often, products sold as used were barely touched before they were returned by a customer, or they were restored to good-as-new condition by a refurbishing center.

Ashley Madison Faces F.T.C. Inquiry Amid Rebranding,"The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Ashley Madison, a year after the adultery-focused website was roiled by an enormous breach of its members' personal data, company executives said on Tuesday. Ashley Madison, a service that claims to facilitate extramarital affairs, has been in repair mode since last summer, when hackers exposed information attached to more than 30 million accounts and badly bruised the trust upon which its business was built. A spokesman for the commission declined to comment on the investigation on Tuesday.  Rob Segal, the chief executive of Avid Life Media, Ashley Madison's parent company, said he did not know the focus of the inquiry, but he said Avid began cooperating with government regulators last August. Since the breach, Avid has been puzzling over how to rebuild its reputation as a platform for discreet romantic encounters, while also contending with public anger that has taken shape in several lawsuits against the company by users whose data was exposed. In a statement on Monday, the company announced that it planned to pursue a ""total repositioning of all its brands."" Company executives said that they would not change the name Ashley Madison, which operates in 46 countries, but that the site would broaden in focus beyond extramarital dating. ""Our goal is to build the world's most open-minded dating community,"" James Millership, Avid's president, said in an interview on Tuesday. The website now pitches itself to everyone: ""Single, attached, looking to explore, or just curious."" That is in contrast to its old slogan: ""Life is short, have an affair."" Last August, a hacking group calling themselves Impact Team released nearly 10 gigabytes' worth of stolen data, including details on members' names, phone numbers and payment transactions. The hackers said they were upset about Ashley Madison's business practices, such as overstating how many women really used the website. According to one analysis, only 15 percent of the site's users were female. Many of the women listed on the site were believed to be fake profiles. In 2014, the F.T.C. fined a British dating company, JDI Dating, after it engaged in a similar practice of faking profiles. Leaked Ashley Madison emails also showed that the company may have hacked into a rival's website. In the wake of the disclosures, Avid's former chief executive, Noel Biderman, stepped down. In April, Mr. Segal and Mr. Millership were brought on to rehabilitate the brand. Among their first steps, Mr. Millership said on Tuesday, was the removal from the site of fembots, computer programs that were used to lure male customers to the site by impersonating women. ""That was one of the criteria that both Rob and I had before joining the company,"" he said. ""It's certainly not a business practice that either Rob or I condone."" Mr. Segal said the current male-to-female ratio on Ashley Madison is roughly 5-to-1, which he said is comparable to other dating sites. The hackers also complained that the company charged members a $19 fee to scrub their profiles from the site, but then failed to do so. Mr. Millership said Ashley Madison has since added a free option to remove data from the site that ""is confirmed does in fact work."" Reports have suggested that the Ashley Madison release of user information had devastating consequences for at least some marriages, as blackmailers threatened to tell wives and the attempted adultery of prominent people ended up in news pages. A New Orleans pastor, who was married with two children, committed suicide after his name was included in the data dump. Company executives said on Tuesday that Avid has been investing heavily in defenses to its networks since the breach and had hired security experts at Deloitte, a consultant, in September to identify flaws and help patch them up. Robert Masse, who leads Deloitte's incident response team, said that the focus of its work was not on identifying how the breach occurred, but making sure potential vulnerabilities were addressed. The team has focused on adding new safeguards against phishing attacks, which use malicious emails to steal data, and instituting 24/7 monitoring of the company's infrastructure, he said. Company executives said on Tuesday that despite the harsh publicity, Ashley Madison has been growing and now has more than 45 million members. Mr. Millership said the company was on course to post about $80 million in revenue this year, down about a quarter from its 2015 revenue. Avid, based in Toronto, also operates Cougar Life, a website that claims to pair older women with younger men, and Established Men, which offers to facilitate relationships between women and wealthy men.

Apple's Strong Stand on Encryption,"It is understandable that federal investigators want to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. And it's understandable that the government would turn to Apple for help. But Apple is doing the right thing in challenging the federal court ruling requiring that it comply.  In an order issued on Tuesday, Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym says Apple must create new software that would bypass security features on the iPhone used by the terrorist, Syed Rizwan Farook. That would allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to unlock the device and retrieve the pictures, messages and other data on it. Her ruling was based on the All Writs Act of 1789, which is used to require people or businesses not involved in a case to execute court orders. Another federal magistrate judge in New York is considering a similar request to unlock an iPhone in a narcotics case.     Law enforcement agencies have a legitimate need for evidence, which is all the more pressing in terrorism cases. But the Constitution and the nation's laws limit how investigators and prosecutors can collect evidence. In a 1977 case involving the New York Telephone Company, the Supreme Court said the government could not compel a third party that is not involved in a crime to assist law enforcement if doing so would place ''unreasonable burdens'' on it. Judge Pym's order requiring Apple to create software to subvert the security features of an iPhone places just such a burden on the company.   Apple has already given the F.B.I. data from the phone that was backed up and stored on its iCloud service; the last backup was made about a month before the attacks. But the company's chief executive, Timothy Cook, has said that requiring it to create software to bypass a feature that causes the phone to erase its data if 10 incorrect passwords are entered would set a dangerous precedent and could undermine the security of its devices. The Department of Justice has argued that the software would be used on that phone only and notes that Apple has previously helped law enforcement unlock phones. The company changed how it encrypts phones after the surveillance revelations by Edward Snowden.   But writing new code would have an effect beyond unlocking one phone. If Apple is required to help the F.B.I. in this case, courts could require it to use this software in future investigations or order it to create new software to fit new needs. It is also theoretically possible that hackers could steal the software from the company's servers.-   There are certainly other ways for law enforcement agencies to collect evidence. They already have the power to get data stored on online services like iCloud and Google's Gmail through search warrants. And they can get records of phone calls and text messages from companies like Verizon and AT&T. A recent study published by Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society concluded that the proliferation of Internet-connected sensors, cameras and other devices provides the government ever-expanding opportunities to collect information about people.   Even if the government prevails in forcing Apple to help, that will hardly be the end of the story. Experts widely believe that technology companies will eventually build devices that cannot be unlocked by company engineers and programmers without the permission of users. Newer smartphones already have much stronger security features than the iPhone 5c Mr. Farook used.   Some officials have proposed that phone and computer makers be  required to maintain access or a ''back door'' to encrypted data on electronic devices. In October, the Obama administration said it would not seek such legislation, but the next president could have a different position.   Congress would do great harm by requiring such back doors. Criminals and domestic and foreign intelligence agencies could exploit such features to conduct mass surveillance and steal national and trade secrets. There's a very good chance that such a law, intended to ease the job of law enforcement, would make private citizens, businesses and the government itself far less secure.

Defense Secretary Says He's Not in Favor of a Data 'Back Door',"SAN FRANCISCO -- Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter assured an audience of computer security experts Wednesday that he was not in favor of a ''back door'' that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption. Speaking at the annual RSA Conference, Secretary Carter sought common ground with companies worried by Apple's fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone.     ''Just to cut to the chase, I'm not a believer in back doors or a single technical approach,'' Secretary Carter said to loud applause during a panel discussion at the conference. ''I don't think it's realistic. I don't think that's technically accurate.''   Apple is resisting a court order that would require it to create software to break the password mechanism in an iPhone used by one of the assailants in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.   The F.B.I. argues that it is not asking for any sort of permanent back door and is merely asking for help in circumventing a single phone's password protection. People in the tech industry worry, however, that the request for help in the San Bernardino case is merely a prelude and point to a number of other pending cases in which law enforcement authorities would like Apple's assistance.   The software Apple is being asked to create could be considered a back door because it could provide special access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible thanks to passwords or encryption.   Secretary Carter's comments, though short on specifics, highlight the challenges various government agencies will face as they seek cooperation from Silicon Valley as the court fight between Apple and F.B.I. continues.   Also on Wednesday, Secretary Carter said Alphabet's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, would head a new Defense Innovation Board to help connect tech companies and entrepreneurs with various Pentagon initiatives. And he announced a Hack the Pentagon initiative, which would reward hackers who find and turn over vulnerabilities in the Pentagon's computer systems.   ''I don't think we ought to let one case drive a single solution,'' Secretary Carter said, referring to the F.B.I.-Apple dispute. ''We have to innovate our way to a sensible result. And we need to do that because you can easily think of alternatives. One is a law written by people who don't have the technical expertise, one written in anger or grief, and that's not likely to work.''   Many at the conference have compared the F.B.I's software request -- some are even calling it ''GovtOS,'' short for government operating system -- to asking journalists to write a false article, or turn over a source, on national security grounds.   Dan Kaminsky, a well-known security researcher, likened the government's approach to persecuting firefighters during a firestorm. The point being, he wrote in an article on Wired.com, that at a time when data breaches happen regularly, the F.B.I. is trying to force Apple to weaken the security of its phones instead of advocating stronger security.   Secretary Carter echoed the need for stronger security but avoided taking a side in the F.B.I.-Apple dispute. ''The problems of data security are many,'' he said. ''There isn't going to be one answer. There are lots of different parts to this.''   If Silicon Valley and Washington cannot find some alternative solution through innovation, Secretary Carter added, the most likely result would be a poorly written law, ''or a solution written by China or Russia.''   ''And you know what their view of data access and security is,'' he said.     "
"For Apple, Potential Flaw May Be a Wake-Up Call","Timothy D. Cook has found himself in a strange position. It looks like someone knows about an important flaw in Apple's flagship product, and won't tell its chief executive what it is.  That could be because Apple doesn't pay outside hackers who find exploitable flaws in Apple software. Paying so-called ''bug hunters'' has become the norm at many tech companies, and the United States government does it too.    In fact, that is probably how it attracted a third party that claims to have a method for cracking the encryption on an iPhone. The government was getting ready to take Apple to court to make Apple decrypt the phone used by the San Bernardino gunman, but late on Monday the Justice Department said an outside party had demonstrated a way to get around Apple's protections.   That announcement appears to have at least stalled what many saw as a seminal case on privacy, encryption and the rights of the state in the age of computer communications.   And it may serve as an wake-up call to Apple about how it safeguards its products.   As Nicole Perlroth writes, Google has paid over $6 million to outside hackers who have alerted it to software bugs in its products that could be exploited by malicious outsiders. Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter, among others, also have such programs. Unique among the giants, Apple appears to stand alone, claiming it sees no benefit in paying people to point out your flaws.   One reason may be Apple's iconic reputation for making a safer, better-built computer. Indeed, for many years Apple computers had far fewer attacks than machines running Microsoft Windows, but experts said this had as much to do with the relative attraction of trying to find flaws in Windows, which had much more of the market. If you did find a flaw, there were more computers to exploit.   Now that Apple has a huge market presence, a robust underground market in selling knowledge of flaws in Apple software has sprung up. Apparently, flaws in the Safari browser are worth $100,000, and knowledge of iPhone issues can command 10 times as much.   That may become a new market that Mr. Cook will want to attack, dominate -- and shut down.     "
­Computer Breach Could Have Exposed Trauma Victims to Further Anguish,"Email: dwyer@nytimes.comTwitter: @jimdwyernyt Havoc sneaks in so often, we shrug. Data breaches, for instance. Hackers break into bank computers or Home Depot terminals to steal credit card numbers, dates of birth, addresses, Social Security numbers. These are soulless numbers that make up a public identity, but not a person's actual self.    Here, though, is a breach with a difference.    For one week in late April and early May, a hacker (or hackers) got into servers that held information provided by 22,000 people for 11 mental health studies being done at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.   These were not patients being treated at the institute, but subjects of its research.   They included, among others, schoolchildren directly exposed to the events of Sept. 11; Puerto Rican youth; severely emotional disturbed young people in Westchester County and their caretakers; people in the Bronx suffering from post-traumatic stress who have family in the criminal justice system; students at three schools in Queens and four others in Washington Heights, Manhattan, whose mental health needs were being assessed.   It was a hack with different fingers, infiltrating two servers operated by the State of New York and plucking out information of varying calibers. For about 9,000 people, it captured the kind of data that is sold to identity thieves, like names, addresses and so forth.   But also stored in the servers was what people had to say about trauma, and how they were tossed about by the many storms of human existence -- or weathered them. This is useful and powerful information for researchers.   Also, possibly, to criminals.   ''Medical records are among the most valuable forms of personal information in the market, and are therefore frequently stolen and heavily trafficked,'' Eben Moglen, a law professor at Columbia and a technologist, said.   In this case, the information stored in the servers was coded and was not the equivalent of medical records, Dr. David H. Strauss, the director of research at the institute, said.   ''The data wasn't readily identifiable -- there wasn't a medical record, or chart notes,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''All the research data was coded.''   That is, when people were asked questions, the answers were recorded as numbers keyed to an answer code. The people were also given code numbers. Their identities and codes were held on a second server. Institute officials hope and believe that the hackers were not able to reverse-engineer the identities and codes to link up people with their answers.   ''The health information itself was coded,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''It would be meaningless to the attackers.''   Perhaps. What would have made the data far more difficult to read than simple coding would be encryption, a digital lockbox that is very hard to pick. It thwarts hackers the same way a house safe can stymie burglars: They can break in but cannot get away with the valuables. The state contends that encryption is not practical for active research, though it is used in many fast-paced businesses.   The state learned of the breach from federal authorities. Dr. Strauss said that by the time he had heard about it, a state forensic group had isolated the two servers. ''A lot of work went on over the course of the next two months to identify the extent of the cyberattack, and the ways in which the data was held,'' Dr. Strauss said. The institute notified subjects for whom it had contact information.   Every year, the employees of the institute, which is affiliated with Columbia University's Department of Psychiatry, get privacy training. This episode made what had been theoretical very concrete, Dr. Strauss said.   ''To say that we take it seriously is an understatement,'' Dr. Strauss said, noting that the institute relies on people to voluntarily share information.   For about 13,000 subjects, only birthdays and demographic information were collected. Why so much about the other 9,000? They were going to be followed over a period of years, Dr. Strauss said.   The institute is determined to make its data storage more secure, he said.   Who did it, and why?   So far, if answers exist, the state has not made them public.   This seems to be a different, rawer breach than most. But perhaps it is just a criminalized version of what many of us voluntarily submit to in daily commerce or by using social media. Our appetites and anxieties trail behind us, digital breadcrumbs collected by the platforms as the hidden fees we pay for what look like free services.   ''Both the platform companies and we ourselves become active agents in the creation of conditions which are then exploited by criminals,'' Dr. Moglen said. ''But our refusal to take our own and others' privacy seriously -- even when we have Hippocratic or legal duties to avoid doing harm -- enables the criminality.''     "
A New Way to Report College Sexual Assault,"For college students, reporting a sexual assault to school authorities can be intimidating, confusing and painful. Now some students have another option: reporting the crime online. Callisto, a website launched last year, allows students to make a time-stamped report of a sexual assault. They can then submit the report to school officials or save it for possible submission in the future. Students can also tell Callisto to submit their reports only if another student names the same perpetrator. If survivors wait to report their assaults, they're less likely to be believed, said Jessica Ladd, the founder of the nonprofit that created Callisto. But they may not want to go through the process of reporting to school officials immediately after a traumatic event. Documentation recorded at the time of the assault may bolster their case if they decide to make a formal report later on.  Callisto is available at Pomona College and the University of San Francisco, and hopes to add several more schools this year. In addition to its reporting function, it provides schools with aggregate data describing students' use of the service. While it's too early to discern trends from Callisto's data, Daren Mooko, the Title IX coordinator at Pomona College, said it's been helpful to learn what kinds of information and resources students are seeking through the app. Over the long term, data on sexual assault could help schools develop prevention programs. Another service, Lighthouse, allows students to report assaults, anonymously if they choose, to school officials via a website. The service has drawn criticism for launching without the cooperation of colleges and universities. Luke Roopra, the C.E.O. of the company that created Lighthouse, said the site doesn't need schools' cooperation to be effective. But it's not clear how schools will handle reports coming from a service they haven't approved. Collecting sexual assault reports online introduces some new concerns. Hackers could try to get access to the data, exposing the identities of both survivors and alleged perpetrators. Encryption and other security practices can reduce that risk but not completely eliminate it, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland who studies privacy. Both Callisto and Lighthouse encrypt their data. Technological tools won't change a culture that's often hostile to people who report assault. ""The reason why we don't trust survivors in the first place is that we're conditioned to not believe their testimonies,"" said Salamishah Tillet, co-founder of A Long Walk Home, a nonprofit dedicated to fighting violence against women. An online service might give survivors more control over the reporting process, but ""I don't think it necessarily gets at the core issue."" But for students, an online tool could make a difficult process a little easier. Ellen Cocanougher, a 2016 graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, says students there have to navigate a sometimes overwhelming array of websites and meetings to report their assaults and get help. The co-founder of her school's chapter of the assault prevention group Not On My Campus, she said ""an easy app or website that makes it less intimidating and more accessible"" would be a big improvement. And online services give students a way to report without talking to a person, which may feel safer. As Emily May, co-founder of the anti-harassment group Hollaback! and a member of Callisto's advisory board, put it, ""When you engage with technology, typically you know it's not going to shame you.""  "
F.B.I. Clash With Apple Loosed a Torrent of Hacking Methods for an iPhone,"SAN FRANCISCO -- For weeks, the United States government has said that the only way to open an iPhone used by a gunman in a mass shooting was to get Apple's help, a position that set off a clash between the technology giant and law enforcement. But remarks by a federal prosecutor in a court conference call on Monday and a letter from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., published on Wednesday indicated a recent flurry of activity behind the scenes between law enforcement and other parties that have suggested methods to break into the phone.     Mr. Comey, in a letter to The Wall Street Journal, wrote that the case between Apple and law enforcement over opening the iPhone has stimulated people worldwide to try to get into the device.   And in a court transcript of a conference call on Monday with Apple's lawyers and Sheri N. Pym, the federal magistrate judge presiding over the case, a Justice Department attorney, Tracy Wilkinson, said, ''There have been a lot of people who have reached out to us during this litigation with proposed alternate methods.''   The comments offer a window into the action that law enforcement agents have seen in the five weeks since the case first erupted with a court order demanding that Apple help unlock the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year. While the government's court filings have painted a picture of agents who had run through all possibilities in opening the device, it appears that since the case became public, they have been presented with more options than publicly indicated.   Those options were partly the result of how atypical this case has become. The unusual prominence of the fight between Apple and the government -- it brought the sometimes abstract debate over privacy and security mainstream -- generated the cascade of behind-the-scenes approaches by third parties to law enforcement over potential ways to open the iPhone.   ''The F.B.I. and D.O.J. often pursue these kinds of cases under seal, and the public doesn't know about them at all,'' said Andrew Crocker, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization. Mr. Crocker said the ''public nature'' of this case allowed more people to be involved.   On Monday, the Justice Department said a third party  had offered a potential solution for breaking into the iPhone without wiping the data from the device. That led to a postponement of a court hearing in the matter and a reduction of hostilities between Apple and the government.   It is unclear if the third-party method will succeed in opening the device; the government said it would present a status report on any progress by April 5. If law enforcement cannot open the phone with help from the third party, the Justice Department may still ask the court to decide whether or not to require Apple to help investigators break into the gadget.   The Justice Department declined to comment. The agency is not legally obligated to reveal that it has been fielding more potential solutions for opening the phone.   Apple said it declined to speculate on the F.B.I.'s methods and actions. The Silicon Valley company has previously expressed doubts that the government could find no way to break into its iPhone, even as it constantly updates its security protocols.   ''Given the past exploits that have bypassed the lock screen and the present-day reality of innumerable security firms, malicious actors, cybercriminals and potential adversaries of the United States constantly seeking vulnerabilities,'' it seems improbable for the government to conclude that the only way into the phone was for Apple to write new code and weaken its security, Erik Neuenschwander, the company's manager of user privacy said in a recent court filing.   The F.B.I. has tried many ways to get into the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, such as exploiting a previous bug that allowed unsigned code to be loaded and run on the device, Stacey Perino, an electronics engineer with the F.B.I. has said in a court filing in the case.   The F.B.I. also tried tools made by the agency and a mobile forensics company, Cellebrite, which let older iPhones load and run code that could crack a device passcode, Ms. Perino wrote. Cellebrite describes itself on its website as a subsidiary of Sun Corporation, a publicly traded Japanese company; it has done work for a number of government agencies.   Yet none of those tools worked, Ms. Perino wrote in the court document that was filed March 10.   Christopher M. Allen, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the agency could not comment on the identity of the outside party.   Mr. Crocker of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said having to run through additional viable options had slowed government efforts to compel Apple to weaken its security functions.   ''In having to consider these third-party solutions, I think the D.O.J. has been given a small taste of its own medicine,'' Mr. Crocker said.     "
Judge Restores WhatsApp in Brazil,"RIO DE JANEIRO -- A judge lifted the nationwide suspension of WhatsApp in Brazil on Tuesday, allowing the popular messaging service owned by Facebook to get up and running again.  The ruling, from Judge Ricardo Múcio Santana de Abreu Lima, overturned a lower court order that had led to WhatsApp being blocked on Monday afternoon. The suspension was supposed to last 72 hours.    Judge Múcio is one of 13 judges on the higher court in the northeastern state of Sergipe, where WhatsApp has become embroiled in an organized crime and drug trafficking case. Authorities are seeking information for the case from the messaging service, but WhatsApp has not complied with requests for data, leading to the court order on Monday.   The restoration of service is not a full-blown victory for WhatsApp. Judge Múcio's ruling was on process rather than the merits of the original case, a court spokesman said. The court provided no additional information on the reasons for revoking the WhatsApp suspension.   WhatsApp's chief executive, Jan Koum, said the service continued to protect its users' privacy. ''We have no intention of compromising people's security and we hope those impacted by this decision join us in making their voices heard in support of an open and secure Internet,'' Mr. Koum wrote in a Facebook post.   WhatsApp has faced other legal difficulties in Brazil because of the case in Sergipe. The same case led to the March arrest of a Facebook executive, Diego Dzodan. Mr. Dzodan was released after one night in custody.   Many Brazilians posted on the Facebook page of Judge Marcel Maia Montalvão, who had ordered WhatsApp's suspension, to express their frustration about the service's brief shutdown.   One wrote, ''Don't joke around with these kinds of things Senhor Judge,'' while another wrote that the judge was ''the type of person who thinks that WhatsApp is only for chitchat and does not understand how much this affects small businesses, universities and self-employed workers.''   Internet privacy experts said they were concerned about the precedent that lower court judges like Judge Montalvão were setting with their shutdowns of a messaging service, especially as Brazil's Congress may soon pass laws that would weaken digital privacy.   ''I am concerned that more of these orders may be issued,'' said Javier Pallero, a lawyer and policy analyst with the New York-based digital privacy group Access Now.   Brazil's Internet bill of rightsdoes not allow the blocking or suspension of entire sites, services or apps in the infrastructure layer of the Internet, said Ronaldo Lemos, an author of the legislation and head of the Institute of Technology and Society in Rio de Janeiro.

Messaging App Is Latest Front in Tech Debate,"WASHINGTON --  While the Justice Department wages a public fight with Apple over access to a locked iPhone, government officials are privately debating how to resolve a prolonged standoff with another technology company, WhatsApp, over access to its popular instant messaging application, officials and others involved in the case said. No decision has been made, but a court fight with WhatsApp, the world's largest mobile messaging service, would open a new front in the Obama administration's dispute with Silicon Valley over encryption, security and privacy.    WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, allows customers to send messages and make phone calls over the Internet. In the last year, the company has been adding encryption to those conversations, making it impossible for the Justice Department to read or eavesdrop, even with a judge's wiretap order.    As recently as this past week, officials said, the Justice Department was discussing how to proceed in a continuing criminal investigation in which a federal judge had approved a wiretap, but investigators were stymied by WhatsApp's encryption.   The Justice Department and WhatsApp declined to comment. The government officials and others who discussed the dispute did so on condition of anonymity because the wiretap order and all the information associated with it were under seal. The nature of the case was not clear, except that officials said it was not a terrorism investigation. The location of the investigation was also unclear.   To understand the battle lines, consider this imperfect analogy from the predigital world: If the Apple dispute is akin to whether the F.B.I. can unlock your front door and search your house, the issue with WhatsApp is whether it can listen to your phone calls. In the era of encryption, neither question has a clear answer.   Some investigators view the WhatsApp issue as even more significant than the one over locked phones because it goes to the heart of the future of wiretapping. They say the Justice Department should ask a judge to force WhatsApp to help the government get information that has been encrypted. Others are reluctant to escalate the dispute, particularly with senators saying they will soon introduce legislation to help the government get data in a format it can read.   Whether the WhatsApp dispute ends in a court fight that sets precedents, many law enforcement officials and security experts say that such a case may be inevitable because the nation's wiretapping laws were last updated a generation ago, when people communicated by landline telephones that were easy to tap.   ''The F.B.I. and the Justice Department are just choosing the exact circumstance to pick the fight that looks the best for them,'' said Peter Eckersley, the chief computer scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit group that focuses on digital rights. ''They're waiting for the case that makes the demand look reasonable.''   A senior law enforcement official disputed the notion that the government was angling for the perfect case, and said that litigation was not inevitable.   This is not the first time that the government's wiretaps have been thwarted by encryption. And WhatsApp is not the only company to clash with the government over the issue. But with a billion users and a particularly strong international customer base, it is by far the largest.   Last year, a dispute with Apple over encrypted iMessages in an investigation of guns and drugs, for instance, nearly led to a court showdown in Maryland. In that case, as in others, the company helped the government where it was able to, and the Justice Department backed down.   Jan Koum, WhatsApp's founder, who was born in Ukraine, has talked about his family members' fears that the government was eavesdropping on their phone calls. In the company's early years, WhatsApp had the ability to read messages as they passed through its servers. That meant it could comply with government wiretap orders.   But in late 2014, the company said that it would begin adding sophisticated encoding, known as end-to-end encryption, to its systems. Only the intended recipients would be able to read the messages.   ''WhatsApp cannot provide information we do not have,'' the company said this month when Brazilian police arrested a Facebook executive after the company failed to turn over information about a customer who was the subject of a drug trafficking investigation.   The iPhone case, which revolves around whether Apple can be forced to help the F.B.I. unlock a phone used by one of the killers in last year's San Bernardino, Calif., massacre, has received worldwide attention for the precedent it might set. But to many in law enforcement, disputes like the one with WhatsApp are of far greater concern.   For more than a half-century, the Justice Department has relied on wiretaps as a fundamental crime-fighting tool. To some in law enforcement, if companies like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram can design unbreakable encryption, then the future of wiretapping is in doubt.   ''You're getting useless data,'' said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who now represents law enforcement agencies that filed briefs supporting the Justice Department in its fight with Apple. ''The only way to make this not gibberish is if the company helps.''   ''As we know from intercepted prisoner wiretaps,'' he added, ''criminals think that advanced encryption is great.''   Businesses, customers and the United States government also rely on strong encryption to help protect information from hackers, identity thieves and foreign cyberattacks. That is why, in 2013, a White House report said the government should ''not in any way subvert, undermine, weaken, or make vulnerable generally available commercial encryption.''   In a twist, the government helped develop the technology behind WhatsApp's encryption. To promote civil rights in countries with repressive governments, the Open Technology Fund, which promotes open societies by supporting technology that allows people to communicate without the fear of surveillance, provided $2.2 million to help develop Open Whisper Systems, the encryption backbone behind WhatsApp.   Because of such support for encryption, Obama administration officials disagree over how far they should push companies to accommodate the requests of law enforcement. Senior leaders at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. have held out hope that Congress will settle the matter by updating the wiretap laws to address new technology. But the White House has declined to push for such legislation. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said on Friday that he was skeptical ''of Congress's ability to handle such a complicated policy area.''   James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, told Congress this month that strong encryption was ''vital'' and acknowledged that ''there are undoubtedly international implications'' for the United States to try to break encryption, especially for wiretaps, as in the WhatsApp case. But he has called for technology companies and the government to find a middle ground that allows for strong encryption but accommodates law enforcement efforts. President Obama echoed those remarks on Friday, saying technology executives who were ''absolutist'' on the issue were wrong.   Those who support digital privacy fear that if the Justice Department succeeds in forcing Apple to help break into the iPhone in the San Bernardino case, the government's next move will be to force companies like WhatsApp to rewrite their software to remove encryption from the accounts of certain customers. ''That would be like going to nuclear war with Silicon Valley,'' said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union.   That view is one reason government officials have been hesitant to rush to court in the WhatsApp case and others like it. The legal and policy implications are great. While no immediate resolution is in sight, more and more companies offer encryption. And technology analysts say that WhatsApp's yearlong effort to add encryption to all one billion of its customer accounts is nearly complete.     "
Tech Faces Encryption as an Issue in Europe,"ROME -- Silicon Valley's battle over encryption is heading to Europe. In the United States, the F.B.I.'s demands that Apple help ''unlock'' an iPhone used by a mass killer in California opened a heated debate on privacy. After recent attacks on the Continent, like the bombings in Brussels last week and the wave of violence in Paris last November, governments across the European Union are increasingly pushing for greater access to people's digital lives.    This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.   The battle has pitted Europe's fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to people's digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.    The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the region's tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.   This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.   ''Fundamental rights are just that, fundamental,'' said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. ''Of course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.''   That pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.   In Britain, lawmakers are completing legislation that could force tech companies to bypass encryption protections in the name of national security. The law -- called a ''snooper's charter'' by opponents -- may compel companies to aid the country's law enforcement agencies by hacking people's smartphones and computers, among other powers.   And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the country's investigators.   Amendments to the French law -- itself a response to the attacks in November -- may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by France's left-wing government.   But politicians and industry executives say Apple's fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies' efforts to protect users' messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.   ''When we're able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies,'' said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.   ''Sure, this could have repercussions internationally,'' he added. ''But there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.''   Europe's attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.   Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including France's prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britain's home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.   And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apple's executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on people's phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.   Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies' encryption technology in the name of national security.   Germany, which has some of the world's toughest privacy rules, has balked at the proposals Britain and France are considering, while the Dutch government published an open letter this year expressly stating its opposition to back doors in encryption services provided by the likes of Apple.   Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would ''also make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.''   As pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain -- a top international market for most American tech companies -- where expanded powers for the country's intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.   Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the country's intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.   Ms. May, Britain's home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the country's security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm people's privacy concerns.   But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where ''reasonably practicable'' to gain access to digital communications.   The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies' services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apple's iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebook's WhatsApp Internet messenger.   But in a series of appeals to the British Parliament, several American tech giants, including Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, have complained that the proposals could force them to create backdoor access for the country's spies, or face falling afoul of the new national security rules.   ''A key left under the doormat would not just be there for the good guys,'' Apple wrote in its recent statement to British lawmakers. ''The bad guys would find it, too.''   Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments -- either in Europe or farther afield -- followed Britain's lead by passing similar legislation.   ''If these encryption plans go through, then who's to stop France or other countries' asking for the same thing?'' said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge who wrote a paper with other experts last year that criticized the American and British governments' plans to weaken encryption. ''When you give one country backdoor access, where do you stop?''     "
"Apple to Testify Again, and VW Due Date Nears","This is what to expect from the week ahead: Earnings to reflect how tech giants are coping.    For fans of tech stocks, this week is a cornucopia of earnings information. IBM kicks things off on Monday, followed by Intel and Yahoo on Tuesday, Google and Microsoft on Thursday and other companies throughout the week. That is a pretty diverse bunch of giants, but they share a common theme: How are they coping? IBM has suffered multiple tough quarters as people move from its high-priced services, while Intel is hoping its cloud computing data centers will make up for missing the smartphone boom. Google is starting to play catch-up in cloud services against Amazon. Microsoft, another cloud provider, has to move its old software businesses to the new computing system. Yahoo, which lost out to Google and others, is coping with something else entirely: On Monday, bids to buy all or part of the company are due. Quentin Hardy    Stanley and Goldman to declare quarter figures.    The last of the big banks will report their first-quarter earnings this week, with Morgan Stanley announcing its results on Monday and Goldman Sachs Tuesday. Both banks have set low expectations, in line with the lackluster profits and revenues that the other big banks declared last week. The other banks reported particularly weak results in their Wall Street divisions. That does not bode well for Morgan Stanley and Goldman, given that they are the most Wall Street-focused firms in the industry. Analysts will seek more information about the cost cuts that Morgan Stanley announced last quarter. Similar cuts may be in store at Goldman. Nathaniel Popper   Low rates and more jobs to impact housing data.   On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on new housing starts in March. After a 5.2 percent jump in February, the biggest monthly increase since September, construction growth is expected to have moderated but still rise slightly for the month. Buoyed by low-interest rates and steady jobs growth, the real estate market has been fairly strong, which is helping the economy even as other sectors like manufacturing soften. Nelson D. Schwartz   Apple and F.B.I. to testify before House panels.   A battle over encryption is heading again to Capitol Hill as Apple and F.B.I. officials appear before House members to defend their positions. In a hearing on Tuesday before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Apple's general counsel, Bruce Sewell, and the F.B.I.'s executive assistant director for science and technology, Amy Hess, will testify on separate panels. The issue has pitted the technology sector against law enforcement in a broader debate over privacy and security. The F.B.I. has pushed for access to encrypted data in terrorist and other criminal investigations. Apple has fought back, saying some of the F.B.I.'s demands to decrypt technology would weaken its products' security and infringe on users' privacy. The company's court battle with the F.B.I. over a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack was recently resolved, but the two parties continue to fight over the unlocking of an iPhone used in a New York drug case. Cecilia Kang   Latest earnings to determine future of UnitedHealth.   UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurers, will be reporting its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Last year's profits suffered because the company said it had lost hundreds of millions of dollars selling individual policies under the federal health care law. UnitedHealth's chief executive said the company would leave the exchange if it could not make money. Investors will be watching for signs that the company has turned the business around -- or has plans to make good on its promise to exit the exchange. Reed Abelson   European Central Bank to defend stimulus clauses.   The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday in Frankfurt, but is not expected to make any changes to policy. At its last meeting in March, the bank's Governing Council announced a battery of stimulus measures aimed at raising inflation, which is near zero, back to the official target of below 2 percent. Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, is expected to argue on Thursday that the measures, which include paying banks to make loans, will be enough to avert a downward spiral of consumer prices that could be disastrous for growth and jobs. Jack Ewing   S.U.V. and truck sales to boost G.M. earnings.   General Motors on Thursday will report first-quarter earnings that are expected to improve, primarily because of continued strong sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in its core North American market. Its performance in international divisions is expected to be uneven, with modest gains forecast in Europe and possibly weaker results in China. On Friday, G.M., the nation's largest automaker, will release compensation figures for 2015 for its senior executives, including Mary T. Barra, its chief executive and chairwoman. Bill Vlasic   Due date nears for Volkswagen's diesel plan.   Volkswagen faces a Thursday court deadline to present a plan to fix nearly 600,000 diesel cars in the United States that are polluting more than allowed. Some lawyers in the case were optimistic there would be a broad agreement to compensate Volkswagen owners and settle enforcement actions brought by state and federal governments. Other lawyers were more cautious, saying the settlement talks remained difficult. Last month Judge Charles R. Breyer for the Federal District Court in San Francisco said he would hold a trial this summer if Volkswagen is not able to reach a settlement. Jack Ewing   E.U. nations to attempt bailout deal with Greece.   Eurozone and European Union finance ministers will hold two days of meetings in Amsterdam starting on Friday. The bloc's 19 eurozone ministers are expected to seek an agreement with Greece on reforms in exchange for more bailout aid so that Greece can pay back debt that matures in July. Among the numerous issues that have held up agreement is the push by the International Monetary Fund to ease the repayment burden on Greece as a condition for helping to finance last year's 86 billion euro bailout, the nation's third in five years. The bloc's 28 finance ministers are also scheduled to discuss proposals requiring companies to disclose more data about their offshore arrangements. The proposals were announced in the wake of the Panama Papers, which exposed ways the rich and powerful use tax havens. James Kanter   Volkswagen to disclose update on emissions inquiry.   Volkswagen's supervisory board may disclose Friday some of the findings of an internal investigation on who was responsible for programming 11 million diesel cars, mostly in Europe and the United States, to evade emissions limits. The investigation is being conducted by the law firm Jones Day on behalf of the supervisory board. The damage to Volkswagen's reputation has been elevated by the company's failure, seven months after the fraud came to light, to explain the circumstances behind it. Jack Ewing   G.E.'s quarterly results to reflect its steady moves.   The big moves for General Electric are in the rearview mirror. Its post-financial crisis campaign of returning to its industrial roots and shedding much of its once-bloated finance arm is complete. On Friday, when G.E. reports its quarterly results, analysts will scout for signs of health in the industrial economy. Expect a mixed picture, with strong sales of jet engines and power generators strong and weak oil field equipment sales. Even if G.E. does well, the stock price may not respond. Its price-earnings ratio is high, Wall Street figures. Big moves stir excitement in a way steady execution does not. Steve Lohr     "
Keeping Your Files Safe in the Sky,"Q. Just how secure is Dropbox for online file storage? A. The overall safety of the files parked in a cloud storage service depends on a number of things, including the security of your username and password for logging into the service. The cloud server's own protections and your connection to the server are also factors.     Many users of the Dropbox file-storage service got prompted to change their passwords last month after it was revealed that a 2012 security breach had resulted in 68 million Dropbox users having their account login information stolen. If you are a Dropbox user and did not get a message from the company to change your password, do so anyway. For more safety, turn on two-step verification in your Dropbox account settings, too.   The Dropbox site has other security measures in place. Your files on the company's servers are encrypted with the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (A.E.S.), which is an algorithm developed by the United States government for use with secure and classified data. To protect data transfers between your computer and Dropbox servers, the company uses Secure Sockets Layer (also known as S.S.L.) and Transport Layer Security (T.L.S.) technology to create an encrypted connection between the two of you.   Of course, if your Dropbox password is compromised, a thief can get to your stored files through the front door, so stay vigilant about your account security. As with other online merchants and services, use strong passwords to protect your account and change them regularly.   Other cloud storage sites have varying degrees of built-in security. For example, Apple's iCloud service uses at least 128-bit A.E.S. encryption for data in transit and stored on its servers. Microsoft and Google both have information about data protection on their sites, although business customers tend to have more safety measures in place. While free services may not have as many security tools, you can also lock up your files on your own with cloud-encryption programs like Boxcryptor or Viivo, which have free versions for personal use -- so even if your account is compromised, the thief cannot easily open the files.

"5 Years and $7 Later, U.S. Returns a Seized Hip-Hop Blog Site","In the early hours of Thanksgiving Day in 2010, all the music at OnSmash.com, a popular hip-hop blog, disappeared. In place of its usual feed of videos, song links and industry gossip, the site displayed a seizure notice from the federal government, a result of a raid of dozens of websites suspected of trafficking in counterfeit goods and pirated content. The site stayed that way for nearly five years. But a few weeks ago, after lobbying the government for its return and paying a $7 fee, Kevin Hofman -- a rank-and-file record label employee who ran OnSmash, first as a hobby and later as a full-time job -- finally got it back, with little explanation and without ever being formally charged with any wrongdoing.     What happened was just one confusing chapter in the long history of conflict between the entertainment industry and the Internet.   At its peak, OnSmash was part of a network of blogs on the leading edge of online music promotion, stirring up fans with fresh material that, Mr. Hofman said, was more often than not supplied directly by artists and record labels hungry for the exposure. The site's popularity and influence earned it laudatory notice in Vibe magazine and approval from rap stars like Kanye West and Rick Ross.   ''There was never a plan to undermine the music business,'' Mr. Hofman, 40, said in a recent interview at a diner in Midtown Manhattan. ''The music business was something that I was always either an employee of or actively trying to support. That's why the whole seizure was so devastating to me.''   The government contended that OnSmash and a handful of other sites were circulating unauthorized material at the expense of the major record labels. An affidavit by a federal agent, released as part of a seizure warrant for the site's web domains, specified numerous ''pirated'' songs found on the sites. As part of the investigation, the agent had confirmed with the Recording Industry Association of America, the labels' trade group, that the songs were used without permission.   Yet that characterization was quickly disputed, and the takedowns -- handled by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit of the Department of Homeland Security -- became the focus of a wider debate over the policing of the Internet.   The seizures, which also claimed the hip-hop sites Dajaz1.com and RapGodFathers.com, came shortly after the music industry abandoned its unpopular strategy of suing individual listeners over piracy, which remains a concern in the industry over the effect on sales. Soon came the large-scale lobbying wars over the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect I.P. Act -- two failed bills in Congress that pitted Hollywood against Silicon Valley -- as well as the continuing prosecution of Kim Dotcom and the file-sharing site Megaupload.   ''The Internet is still locked in a battle royal with Hollywood and its allies,'' said Peter Eckersley, chief computer scientist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group that is supported by technology companies and often squares off against the entertainment business over copyright issues.   In the face of all this, the fate of a handful of music blogs largely faded into the background. But for Mr. Hofman and others, the episode has had lasting consequences. After OnSmash was seized, Mr. Hofman started FreeOnSmash.com as a replacement, but its traffic and advertising revenue were a fraction of what he had once had. Even worse, Mr. Hofman said, was the ''black cloud'' of suspicion that surrounded him in the industry.   ''When I went to album release parties,'' he said, ''people looked at me like they had seen a ghost.'' Corporate sponsorship of live events, once an important part of the site's business, also dried up, he added.   Suing for the return of OnSmash would have been expensive and risky, so Mr. Hofman pursued an ''offer in compromise'' with the government -- submitting a petition for the site's return, and paying what the government determined to be its appraised value: $7.   In March 2012, Craig Trainor, Mr. Hofman's lawyer, submitted a 66-page memorandum of law outlining their case. Rather than a rogue site that hurt music labels, Mr. Trainor argued, OnSmash was ''an indispensable forum for hip-hop fans, a marketing vehicle for record labels and artists, and a generator of protected speech.'' He also noted that Dajaz1.com had been returned to its owner after about a year.   The OnSmash case dragged on for another three and a half years until October, when -- with a five-year statute of limitations on the seizure looming -- the government notified Mr. Trainor that OnSmash would be returned. Paperwork with his web host took another month or so, Mr. Hofman said, and he finally got the site back in November.   When asked about the return of OnSmash and another site, Torrent-Finder.com, which was seized in the 2010 raid and also returned to its operator this fall, Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that after working with the Justice Department, ''it was determined there was not enough evidence to seize the websites.''   Jonathan Lamy, a spokesman for the recording industry association, said he welcomed the return of the sites, as long as they played by the rules. ''If the managers of some of these sites now seek to have the domain name returned because they wish to become legitimate operators, that's a success,'' he said. In recent months, the music industry has successfully shut down unlicensed sites like Aurous, Sharebeast and RockDizMusic.   Mr. Hofman, whose day job is managing digital accounts for musicians, has already restarted OnSmash, but he said he was aware of the challenges he would face. The site has lost most of its momentum, and blogs -- once at the forefront of online music promotion -- have largely been superseded by social media. He noted one advantage: By embedding links from sites like SoundCloud and YouTube, where artists and labels post songs directly, there is no more gray area concerning the source of the music.   ''The plan now,'' Mr. Hofman said, ''is to do my best to pick up the pieces.''     "
Nuclear Facilities in 20 Countries May Be Easy Targets for Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON --  Twenty nations with significant atomic stockpiles or nuclear power plants have no government regulations requiring minimal protection of those facilities against cyberattacks, according to a study by the Nuclear Threat Initiative. The findings build on growing concerns that a cyberattack could be the easiest and most effective way to take over a nuclear power plant and sabotage it, or to disable defenses that are used to protect nuclear material from theft. The countries on the list include Argentina, China, Egypt, Israel, Mexico and North Korea.    The survey, by one of the nation's leading nuclear nonproliferation watchdogs, was based on a nation-by-nation review of basic, publicly available data, and some of the countries may claim they have classified protections in place.    But the list is damning. The group looked, for example, at whether any cyberprotections are required by law or regulation at nuclear facilities, and whether cyberattacks are included in the assessments of potential threats to the security of those installations. One question asked whether there were mandated drills and tests to assess responses to a cyberassault, rather than just a physical attack on the facilities.   ''Twenty countries failed on all the indicators,'' said Page Stoutland, one of the authors of the report. Because of the secrecy surrounding military nuclear facilities, it was impossible to determine the levels of cyberprotection used to protect nuclear weapons in the nine countries known to possess them.   The report also concludes that President Obama's global initiative to sweep up loose nuclear material, which will be the subject of his third and final nuclear security summit meeting this March, has slowed substantially.   ''There was great progress for six or so years,'' said Sam Nunn, a former senator who spearheaded efforts to dismantle nuclear weaponry in the former Soviet republics after the fall of the Berlin Wall and who went on to become a founder of the Nuclear Threat Initiative. ''But it has slowed down. It's hard to keep this subject on the front burner.''   Mr. Nunn, 77, who left the Senate in 1997, blamed the increasing tensions with Russia for some of the slow progress. ''When things are strained between the two big nuclear powers, which have 90 percent of the weapons and materials, it makes it harder'' for other states to make the case for reducing their own stockpiles, he said in an interview.   Mr. Nunn is best known for the Nunn-Lugar Act -- sponsored with Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who took Mr. Obama on tours through the former Soviet Union -- which dismantled many of the weapons and nuclear facilities in former Soviet states.   Mr. Obama was an early adherent of Mr. Nunn's advocacy for comprehensive programs to reduce the amount of nuclear material in the world, and by any measure his six-year effort to prevent nuclear terrorism has made major progress. Each summit meeting has forced countries to make progress on locking down or eliminating materials.   The Nuclear Threat Initiative, which publishes an annual index of nuclear security around the world, notes that a dozen countries have eliminated all weapons-usable nuclear materials since the summit meetings began. Many more have greatly improved the security surrounding lightly guarded materials, which are stored every place from hospitals to research reactors on university campuses.   But at the very moment that the black market in nuclear materials remains active, the report found that 24 nations still had more than 2.2 pounds of weapons-usable nuclear material, ''much of it still too vulnerable to theft,'' and many have just begun to think about their vulnerability to cyberthreats that could enable an attacker to sabotage a site without breaking through fences or risk setting off perimeter alarms.   The most famous cyberattack on a nuclear facility was done by the United States and Israel: the effort to destroy and disable nuclear centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant in Iran. That program, code-named Olympic Games, used a worm that was later named Stuxnet to knock the centrifuges out of operation. It did not release radioactive material into the atmosphere, but it was a vivid demonstration of the vulnerability of nuclear facilities to cyberattack. Iran had completely isolated the Natanz facility from the Internet, but the originators of the program found ways to insert it.   The lesson of Stuxnet, however, has apparently been lost on many nations that have yet to develop requirements that nuclear facilities have cyberprotections in place before they can operate.   ''Too many states require virtually no effective security measures at nuclear facilities to address the threat posed by hackers,'' the study, in which the Economist Intelligence Unit also participated, concluded. Of the two dozen nations with weapons-usable material, nine got the maximum score for cyberindicators, and seven got a score of zero.   In 23 nations that possessed no weapons-usable materials, but had nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities that contain fuel that could be converted to weapons use, 13 got a zero score.   More than 80 percent of all nuclear stockpiles are classified as military material, meaning they are largely used in weapons programs, and all of those are outside international security review, including the guidelines issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency for the protection of civilian nuclear stocks.     "
Hackers' Night at the Museum,"Kaleigh Clary, a computer science graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, drove down to offer a day of free work for the American Museum of Natural History. Why?    ''Dinosaurs, man,'' Ms. Clary said.   Computer programmers, it appears, like dinosaurs, a lot.   She was one of almost 150 people who gathered for the museum's ''Hack the Dinos'' challenge in November to create software tools to help dinosaur scientists.    Like many fields of science, paleontology is now awash in data. Paleontologists no longer just look at and describe fossils. They also put the bones in CT scanners, generating gigabytes of images and data. That opens up new research like reconstructing the size and shapes of the brains of dinosaurs and comparing them with those of modern birds, which descended from dinosaurs.   That analysis can be excruciatingly laborious. For each X-ray slice of the skull, a scientist typically has to trace the outline of the interior space. (The edge between rock and fossil is not always obvious.)   Hackathons have become a popular way of enlisting enthusiastic programmers to produce software in bursts of a few hours to a few days. The museum put out a challenge looking for help ''as a way to volunteer,'' said Christina Wallace, one of the hackathon organizers. ''It's a pro bono challenge.''   Winners received one-year memberships to the museum and three-dimensional printed busts of Theodore Roosevelt. ''More importantly, they'll get bragging rights for the next 12 months,'' Ms. Wallace said.   ''Hack the Dinos'' was the museum's second hackathon. A year earlier, the challenge was ''Hack the Universe,'' to crunch through astronomy data.   The museum's paleontologists brainstormed for months about digital tools that they wished existed.   Automating skull analysis was one item on the wish list. Others included modernizing the venerable field notebook to the age of smartphones and converting cladograms -- the family trees that show the evolutionary relationships among species -- to digital formats. (Nowadays, paleontologists produce digital files that are easily shared and compared, but there are many more from earlier years that exist only on paper.)   The paleontologists also hoped to ease the workload of Carl Mehling, the museum staff member who replies when someone sends in a photograph with the question, ''Is this a fossil?''   ''This is doing good,'' said one of the participants, Peter Lenz, who works at the Dstillery, a New York company that takes a data science approach to marketing and branding. ''You're doing it because you like dinosaurs.''   The programmers, graphic designers and data scientists met on a Friday night to divide into teams and quiz paleontologists about the problems and data. They began hacking the next afternoon.   After the museum closed, some teams spread out among the quiet, empty dinosaur halls. ''I really just wanted to stay overnight in the museum,'' said Jessie Contour, who is working on a master of fine arts degree at Parsons School of Design.   At 11:30 p.m., there was a dance party, although most participants remained sitting at their laptops. ''Now if anyone gets deep vein thrombosis, it's not my fault,'' Ms. Wallace joked.   Later, museum volunteers set out cots for participants.   ''There was a mouse that kept me company all night,'' said Gabriela Gutierrez, another participant. ''Thank god for the cots.''   In the morning, Ms. Wallace walked around blasting Taylor Swift music from a phone to wake everyone for a few more hours of work.   ''I would be ashamed at the state of the code,'' Mr. Lenz said. ''But for 22 hours without sleep, it's really great.''   On Sunday afternoon, the teams presented what they had produced.   Ms. Contour was a member of a team that created a smartphone app, Foss'l, to help Mr. Mehling. ''We wanted to combine the experience of being able to submit your fossils to poor Carl with a learning experience,'' she said.   She described it as ''Tinder for fossils,'' referring to the popular dating app, tapping the wisdom of the masses in a gamelike app.   Jack Tseng, a postdoctoral paleontological researcher at the museum who was a judge, said he was impressed by all of the efforts, but in particular ''Sapling Detector,'' which converted the paper evolutionary trees to electronic format. Although not as flashy as some of the others, ''that's something I would use right away,'' he said. ''It solves the problem we were trying to solve.''     "
"Beware of Hackers, Not Assassins","Mark Galeotti is a professor at the New York University School of Professional Studies' Center for Global Affairs. Moscow -- A BRITISH inquiry announced this week that Alexander V. Litvinenko, a Russian security officer turned defector who died in a London hospital of polonium poisoning in 2006, was ''probably'' murdered on the instructions of President Vladimir V. Putin. That's little surprise. For more than eight years the world has suspected that the Kremlin was behind the assassination. (Just as surely, Mr. Putin has denied his responsibility. His spokesman Dmitri Peskov denounced the inquiry as a ''quasi investigation'' and an expression of the ''elegant British sense of humor.'') In the years since Mr. Litvinenko's dramatic death by radioactive poison, Russia's government has engaged in an array of brazen acts: cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007, the invasion of Georgia in 2008 and covert operations to annex Crimea and destabilize Ukraine in 2014.     So was Mr. Litvinenko's assassination the start of a new era of dirty tricks?   It may have seemed like a good idea at the time and probably in the immediate aftermath; the Russian government viewed it as a success that deterred others in the rich Russian émigré community of ''Londongrad'' from opposition activities. But the political price Moscow paid was considerable; it solidified the image of Mr. Putin's Russia as a rogue state.   Mr. Putin might like to act as if Russia is a world unto itself. It's not. Modern Russia is thoroughly integrated into global markets and institutions. It seeks foreign investors and partners abroad. Moscow's elites vacation in Italy, bank in London and send their children to American universities. They can't afford the repercussions of transnational assassination plots.   That's why, since Mr. Litvinenko's murder, the Russian security forces have moved on to a rather different tradecraft. ''Wet work'' -- the Russian spy slang for murder -- isn't entirely a thing of the past, of course. A number of Chechens in Turkey believed to be supporting rebels inside Russia have discovered that. But even in those cases, there was none of the theatricality of a polonium poisoning.   Mr. Litvinenko's killing, after all, was primarily about silencing critics and scaring opponents rather than eliminating one man. Moscow has realized that in the age of the Internet and 24-hour news cycles, there are safer ways of doing the same thing.   These days, if there is assassination to be done in the West, it is of character. The F.S.B. (the successor to the K.G.B.) and the other security services have moved into the world of information operations, and Russian media and public affairs specialists now rank alongside spies and assassins as weapons of the state. Glossy foreign-language media outlets, serried ranks of paid Internet trolls and hackers and mysteriously well-funded political fringe groups do the Kremlin's bidding.   That's not necessarily a reason to celebrate. While it's true that no one dies from a hacked website, this campaign to dismay, divide and distract the West may be more destructive than any one assassination.   One of Moscow's aims is deepening divisions among its rivals. As in the Cold War, the crucial battleground is in Europe. The Kremlin knows that it will win if the European Union breaks apart or becomes unmanageable -- or if Europeans become disillusioned with the NATO alliance. To this end, Moscow eagerly supports extremist parties, divisive groups and separatist movements across the Continent. France's ''Euroskeptic'' National Front party, for example, has received Russian money.   Meanwhile, the F.S.B. reportedly recruits and directs hackers to set off cyberattacks when it wants to punish or silence Russia's rivals. When the European Parliament and Commission began to criticize Moscow's takeover of Crimea in April 2014, for example, its systems were hit by networks of computers running a Russian-designed program called BlackEnergy. At the end of 2015, the same malware hit Ukraine's energy companies, leaving some 700,000 homes without power. It is not just foreigners who are targets. On the day of Russia's 2011 parliamentary election, coordinated cyberattacks crashed the websites of much of the country's liberal media outlets. Internet trolls have reportedly been paid to smear the opposition leader Alexei A. Navalny. The moral seems clear: Mess with Moscow and bad things will happen.   The problem is that liberal countries with open economies, democratic politics and a legal presumption of innocence are far less able to resist these offensives. Money and misinformation move equally fast in the modern world. Proving that an extremist political group or a glib lobbyist is backed by Moscow is often impossible. Indeed, part of the genius of this new model of subversion is that it often can be done in plain sight, coyly wrapping itself in the mantle of free speech.   After Mr. Litvinenko's murder, Britain expelled Russian diplomats, limited visas for Russian officials and stopped intelligence sharing and police cooperation. After a hacking attack on American banks in 2014 that the F.B.I. and other agencies suspect was orchestrated by Moscow to punish the United States for placing sanctions on Russia, Washington did nothing but call for investigations and encourage financial institutions to take cybersecurity more seriously.   This is the new world of covert war. There are no bodies and no smoking guns, no polonium trails and no easy answers.

"Bank Tellers, With Low Pay and High Access, Pose a Rising Security Risk","Bank robbers used to burst into banks brandishing guns and bearing notes demanding cash to the teller behind the window. Today, the thieves may be on the other side of the counter. As concerns over identity theft and foreign cyberattacks rise, customers are largely in the dark about a growing threat just around the corner: bank tellers and managers with instant access not only to their critical personal information, but also to their cash.    Though much of the focus on bank fraud has been on sophisticated hackers, it is the more prosaic figure of the teller behind the window who should worry depositors, according to prosecutors, government officials and security experts.   Tellers and those who oversaw them once played a sober, respected role in towns small and large, carefully counting out bills and peering at signatures. But A.T.M.s, direct deposits and electronic banking have diminished tellers' importance, to the point that their work is now low paid  and, prosecutors say, occasionally criminal.    Rich and elderly bank customers are particularly at risk, prosecutors say, when tellers and other retail-branch employees tap into accounts to wire funds without authorization, make fake debit cards to withdraw money from A.T.M.s and sell off personal information to other criminals. Accounts with high balances and those with direct deposits of government funds, like Social Security payments, are especially coveted.   ''It's a rampant problem,'' said Brenda Fischer, chief of the Cybercrime and Identity Theft Bureau for the Manhattan district attorney's office. The Manhattan prosecutor's office estimates it brings at least one case against a teller per month.   Last year, a teller in White Plains was sentenced for her role in an identity theft ring that pilfered $850,000 from bank accounts. Wiretaps revealed that the defendants spoke in code about potential bank targets, referring to TD Bank as ''touchdown'' and JPMorgan Chase as ''Yase.'' A former teller at a Capital One branch in Maryland was sentenced in 2014 for gaining access to seven accounts and passing customer information to a co-conspirator who drew checks on the accounts.   Across the country last year, cases included a former Pennsylvania teller sentenced for withdrawing money from accounts; a former Manhattan teller sentenced for using information to receive tax refunds that he routed to himself; a former Connecticut teller who took cellphone photos of account information, and used that to cash fraudulent checks; and a former Virginia credit-union teller who took out loans from the union in customers' names. The money she stole ultimately led to the credit union's collapse.   Other lower-level employees who work at bank branches may have too much access to customer information, prosecutors say: In December, prosecutors in Brooklyn obtained indictments against  two bankers  who worked at retail locations of JPMorgan Chase in the borough, saying they withdrew roughly $400,000 from accounts through fake A.T.M. cards and in-person withdrawals.   Bringing charges against tellers and low-level managers can be challenging, prosecutors say, because of banks' lax security controls and gaps in regulation.   One Chicago-area teller jumped from Washington Mutual to LaSalle Bank to Fifth Third before he was caught, withdrawing over $2 million along with his co-conspirators. The crew rerouted customers' addresses to mailboxes they controlled, created driver's licenses in customers' names to open credit cards, and even created fake businesses so they could buy credit-card terminals -- then approve the fake charges they had rung up.   Despite the sums at stake, executing the crimes can be easy, prosecutors say. Many of the tools that criminals need, like a card printer, are just a mouse click away, available for purchase for a couple of hundred dollars on the Internet. And videos that detail the mechanics of the scams circulate online in a kind of underworld collection of do-it-yourself segments.   Tellers and employees at retail branches, who can gain access to a customer's information with a few taps of a keyboard, are at the centers of the schemes. Last year, for instance, Peter Persaud, an employee at a Chase branch in Brooklyn, sold customer information to an informer for $2,500 per customer, according to federal prosecutors.   Mr. Persaud has pleaded not guilty; the case is continuing.   In other cases, the tellers are just the conduit. Thieves are bribing them to hand over personal data that thieves use to drain money from accounts and make debit cards, checks and credit cards in customers' names.   Tellers, who are paid modest salaries, can be particularly vulnerable to bribes, security experts say. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual income for tellers in 2014 was $25,760, a salary that prosecutors say does not match the high-risk nature of their jobs.   One thief, for instance, offered tellers an array of perks, including jaunts on private planes, limousine rides, manicures and one-on-one meetings with famous athletes, in exchange for customer information, according to a 2011 indictment from prosecutors in Charlotte, N.C. Four years later, the same man ran into trouble again when federal prosecutors indicted him over accusations that he used confidential information from Wells Fargo customers to withdraw roughly $100,000 from accounts.   Despite their importance, tellers and many low-level bank employees are not subjected to rigorous background checks.   Under laws passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, banks are required to thoroughly vet their customers and closely monitor accounts to detect any suspicious activity. The same level of scrutiny does not always apply to the tellers, according to prosecutors. Sometimes, little more than a basic criminal-background check is performed,   Many banks simply close a fraud investigation once a teller resigns, allowing the former employee to move on to another bank, security experts say.   To keep their illicit activities undetected, the tellers, prosecutors say, often keep unauthorized withdrawals below $10,000, the threshold that sets off another layer of review under banking laws. Especially in accounts with large balances, the thefts can go unnoticed for years.   State laws intended to prevent identity theft have not kept pace with the sophistication and scale of the crimes, a lag that can hamstring prosecutors.   Under New York law, for example, prosecutors cannot bring charges against criminals for the total amount of money stolen from multiple banks, which would result in more serious charges and sentences. Instead, they are required to treat each bank as an individual victim.   More than money is at stake. Personal identification information -- Social Security numbers and addresses -- can be trafficked on the black market, where thieves sell vast collections of data to the highest bidders.   ''All of your personal information is suddenly in the wild,'' Ms. Fischer said.   Controls at banks have sorely lagged, security consultants say.   Kevin Streff, managing partner at Secure Banking Solutions, a security consulting firm, said the sluggish controls came, in part, from banks' outdated view that tellers handled only low-risk transactions. ''The banks are still too trusting of the individuals they employ,'' Mr. Streff said, adding that banks tend to err on the side of giving tellers too much access.   Doug Johnson, senior vice president for payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association, said that banks, recognizing the thefts can cause ''substantial reputational risk and strain relationships with customers, are committed to guarding against these attacks by sharing information about problematic tellers and instituting more monitoring of accounts.'' Mr. Johnson said some banks were restricting the amount of information tellers could get into.   This summer, New York's attorney general sent a letter to some of the biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, urging them to reduce tellers' access to crucial customer information. New tellers usually had ''unlimited access to financial institution customers' account data,'' the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, wrote.   Despite the warnings, progress has been slow. ''There is a reluctance to provide real oversight, rigor or even security training because it costs time and money,'' Mr. Streff said.   For now, banks generally address the issue by reimbursing customers for any losses.   Even when banks put in controls, employees may find ways around them. In a January 2015 conversation recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Peter Persaud, the Chase employee at a Brooklyn branch, discussed his methods. If Chase questioned the withdrawals, his name might surface as they looked at who had reviewed the accounts, he said, so he would ''see if I can get somebody else that could look up'' names, too. Two weeks later, he said that he had to be careful about whose accounts he reviewed: ''I got to have a reason to be in that account,'' he said, adding an expletive.   Mr. Persaud was suspended from Chase in February 2015, he told the informer, adding, ''I can't get nothing while I'm suspended.'' However, in March, Mr. Persaud called the informer again. He said he had been reinstated and would sell the information in four Chase accounts for roughly $16,000.     "
"In Bangladesh, Official Quits After Theft of $81 Million","A spreading scandal over the mysterious electronic theft of $81 million from Bangladesh's official account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York prompted the governor of that country's central bank to resign Tuesday, and three of his subordinates were fired. They were the first political casualties since the theft came to light this month, when news reports from the Philippines said unidentified hackers using official electronic bank messaging technology had diverted the money in early February. Most or all of the stolen money, one of the biggest electronic heists in history, is thought to have been transferred to accounts in the Philippines.     The Bangladesh central bank governor, Atiur Rahman, a widely respected economist, appeared to be caught by surprise, having learned of the theft only from Philippines news reports about a money-laundering investigation there. Last week he threatened to sue the New York Fed, a critical global financial gateway that holds the deposits of many foreign central banks.   The New York Fed said in a statement last Wednesday that the transfer of the money had been ''fully authenticated'' by an international financial messaging system, known as Swift, suggesting that there may have been a security breach in Bangladesh. The Fed statement said its systems had not been compromised.   With pressure intensifying to explain how such a theft could have happened, Mr. Rahman submitted his resignation on Tuesday, and Bangladesh news agencies said it was accepted by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.   The news agencies also said the Finance Ministry had dismissed two deputy central bank governors and the Bank and Financial Institutions division secretary, who were all accused of having kept the theft a secret from their superiors.   Mr. Rahman, who had held the central bank post for seven years, said in Dhaka that he had been conflicted about the decision to resign. He also said he had informed foreign law enforcement authorities and had brought in cybercrime specialists to help investigate.   ''Such cyberattacks are happening across the world,'' Mr. Rahman said, according to news accounts from Bangladesh. ''We are new in facing such attacks. We lack experience.''   A spokeswoman for FireEye, a computer security company in Milpitas, Calif., confirmed on Tuesday that its forensics division Mandiant was helping to investigate the Bangladesh theft.   Reuters, quoting unidentified banking officials, reported on March 10 that the hackers appeared to have been intent on transferring nearly $1 billion out of Bangladesh's account, with nearly three dozen messaging requests. They succeeded with four requests, totaling $81 million, to move money to the Philippines, before a fifth attempt, for $20 million to be sent to Sri Lanka, was stopped because the hackers misspelled the recipient's name as the Shalika Fandation instead of the Shalika Foundation.   The banking officials also were quoted as saying they were suspicious because of the unusually high number of transfer requests, so they alerted the Bangladeshis.   Why a month elapsed before the news came to light remains unclear, as are the prospects for recovering any of the money.   While incomes and living standards have improved, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the region. A 2014 study by Oxford University, using data on the percentage of the population considered destitute, ranked Bangladesh as the third-most impoverished in South Asia, after Afghanistan and India.   The resignation and firings in Bangladesh came as testimony in a Philippines Senate panel hearing about the money-laundering investigation suggested that most of the purloined Bangladesh funds had been delivered, in dollars and Philippine pesos, to three Philippines casino operators. An anti-money-laundering law in the Philippines does not apply to the gambling industry.   The senator leading the hearing, Teofisto Guingona III, said the loophole abets money laundering, an important ingredient in the crime that victimized Bangladesh's central bank.   ''The funds can easily be traced until the casinos,'' the senator said, according to the Philippines News Agency account of the hearing. ''Once it is in the casino, it seems it was a dark cave, it was just one big cave, a black hole which we cannot trace anymore.''     "
A Spymaster Who Put Faith in Cyberattacks,"A bit more than three years after Meir Dagan was forced to end his long tenure as director of Israel's intelligence service, the Mossad, he showed up at a discussion of the Middle East filled with contempt for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who he feared was on the cusp of bombing Iran's nuclear facilities. ''There is no one to stop him anymore,'' Mr. Dagan told me at Harvard University in spring 2014.    Mr. Dagan had long argued that by pushing him and other intelligence and military leaders out of office, Mr. Netanyahu was seeking to silence those who argued that there were better ways to deter Iran from getting the bomb than attacking the country's facilities.    At best, Mr. Dagan said at Harvard, an Israeli bombing run would provide an illusory solution, temporarily flattening those facilities, only to have them return, this time deep underground. The result, the spymaster and former soldier argued, would be disastrous for the state of Israel.   Mr. Dagan, who died on Thursday after struggling for several years with a liver transplant that never quite succeeded, could hardly be accused of being soft on Israel's enemies. He ranked among the most brutal warriors of the modern Middle East. He famously kept a photograph of his grandfather, kneeling on the ground before his Nazi captors moments before he was killed. Mr. Dagan would show it to visitors, a personal ''never again'' memento that seemed to explain the ease with which he organized the elimination of Israel's enemies.   Short, bald and built like a fireplug, Mr. Dagan was unquestionably capable of enormous brutality: During his military career, he led squads that killed Palestinian militants. Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister who had been his mentor and commander, once said, ''Dagan's specialty is separating an Arab from his head.''   Later, many suspected Mr. Dagan's hand in the killing of Iranian scientists, who would be driving to work in Tehran traffic only to have a motorcyclist pull up and attach a ''sticky bomb'' to their car door before speeding off. Eventually, the succession of such killings became so obvious that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, felt compelled to condemn them in public. Mr. Dagan never discussed those missions.   It was Mr. Dagan who managed Israel's side of perhaps the most sophisticated piece of sabotage the United States and Israel have ever jointly attempted: the yearslong cyberattacks meant to destroy Iran's nuclear centrifuges.   Mr. Dagan was no computer hacker, but he appreciated technology that made it enormously difficult for the Iranians to figure out the origin of the attack. To his mind, the operation -- elaborately planned with two American presidents -- showed how Israel should defend itself in the future: not with open demonstrations of military might that invited retaliation, escalation and condemnation; not with assassinations and occupations; but with subtlety and indirection.   At a cocktail reception during another conference, Mr. Dagan sought me out to criticize a lengthy account I had written, in The New York Times and in a book, about the cyberattacks. I was surprised to discover that he was not worried about the revelation of a highly classified intelligence operation, only that Israel -- and more specifically the Mossad -- had not been given enough credit.   ''You missed a major part of the story,'' he said, arguing that the Americans had received far too much credit for an operation that he believed the Mossad and Unit 8200, the famed military intelligence group, made possible.   If Mr. Dagan wanted to tell Israel's side of the story, I suggested, I would certainly write more about it.   He squinted at me, then laughed. ''I am an old man,'' he said, ''and I am sick. I don't want to spend my last days in jail.''   Mr. Dagan was always careful. He offered no operational details. In our handful of conversations over the years, he sprinkled phrases like ''if we did it'' into many sentences, so that he could explain his underlying logic without violating his oath to maintain the secrecy around the Mossad's covert operations.   But in retrospect, in his war with Mr. Netanyahu, which escalated through the prime minister's re-election a year ago, Mr. Dagan appeared to have two main objectives.   The most likely was restoring his own reputation after an embarrassing failure of basic tradecraft when Mossad agents were caught on tape entering and leaving a hotel in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, during the 2010 killing of a senior official in the Islamist Palestinian group Hamas. The success of the cyberattacks in slowing Iran's program could be critical to his legacy, but that did him no good if the world thought they were Washington's work.   But Mr. Dagan may have had another reason, more political and only slightly less self-interested. It was part of his effort at restraining Mr. Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, the other leading advocate of an Israeli bombing campaign against Iran's nuclear facilities. Mr. Dagan, like many American officials, believed that at least some public revelation about the cyberattacks would show there was a more elegant, less provocative way to set back the nuclear program, making it more difficult for Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak to scramble the fighter jets.   When he left office in 2011, Mr. Dagan told the Israeli Parliament that ''technological difficulties'' would delay Iran from building a bomb until at least 2015. (It turned out that was the year that, over Mr. Netanyahu's strenuous objections, Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States reached an agreement that, on paper at least, prevents the Iranians from making the fuel needed for a bomb for 10 or 15 more years.)   But that was not the message Mr. Netanyahu wanted broadcast. So in the last years of his life, Mr. Dagan engaged in open battle with the government he had once served. As he accelerated his critique of the military-attack option, his diplomatic passport was pulled. Mr. Barak, the former prime minister turned defense minister, told Israel Radio that Mr. Dagan was harming ''Israel's ability to deter'' the Iranians.   Mr. Dagan, though, argued that Iran was a deeply divided political entity, and an open conflict with Israel would only help unify its feuding parties. ''Go directly against the regime itself,'' he told me once, explaining his strategy. ''There is real division there.''   It is impossible to say what role the public campaign by Mr. Dagan and other former Israeli security leaders against a military strike played in Mr. Netanyahu's decision not to pull the trigger.   But there is no doubt that by the time he was buried last week, Mr. Dagan had won his argument, at least for a while. The Iran nuclear agreement had silenced the calls for military attack; after the Iranians shipped 98 percent of their fuel out of the country, it could hardly be justified. And in the past two months, as Mr. Dagan lay dying, some Israeli leaders began to concede that Mr. Obama's approach bought them more time than any military strike ever could.     "
Why Hackers Might Help F.B.I. and Not Apple,"SAN FRANCISCO -- After a third party went to the F.B.I. with claims of being able to unlock an iPhone, many in the security industry said they were not surprised that the third party did not go to Apple. For all the steps Apple has taken to encrypt customers' communications and its rhetoric around customer privacy, security experts said the company was still doing less than many competitors to seal up its systems from hackers. And when hackers do find flaws in Apple's code, they have little incentive to turn them over to the company for fixing.    Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Mozilla and many other tech companies all pay outside hackers who turn over bugs in their products and systems. Uber began a new bug bounty program on Tuesday. Google has paid outside hackers more than $6 million since it announced a bug bounty program in 2010, and the company last week doubled its top reward to $100,000 for anyone who can break into its Chromebook.   Apple, which has had relatively strong security over the years, has been open about how security is a never-ending cat-and-mouse game and how it is unwilling to engage in a financial arms race to pay for code exploits.    The company has yet to give hackers anything more than a gold star. When hackers do turn over serious flaws in its products, they may see their name listed on the company's website -- but that is it. That is a far cry from what hackers can expect if they sell an Apple flaw on the thriving underground market where a growing number of companies and government agencies are willing to pay hackers handsomely.   The disclosure by the United States government on Monday that an unknown third party had approached it -- and not Apple -- to help open a controversial iPhone only highlights how the giant company approaches bug-hunting efforts and security differently from the rest of the tech industry.   But security experts, especially those with a stake in such bug programs, said Apple could now be doing more, especially in this day and age where the conventions of finding bugs and fixing them have changed.   Just this week, researchers at Johns Hopkins University uncovered a flaw that would allow attackers to decrypt the contents of photos and videos attached in Apple's iMessage program. The researchers turned that flaw over to Apple for patching.   ''Especially with the stakes being as high as they are, if Apple wants to continue to compete in the modern world, they have to modernize their approach,'' said Katie Moussouris, a chief policy officer at HackerOne, which companies like Yahoo, Dropbox and now Uber pay to manage their bug bounty programs.   The identity of the third party that approached the F.B.I. with the possible way to unlock the iPhone -- which was used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year -- remained unknown on Tuesday. The emergence of the third party halted, at least temporarily, a contentious case between Apple and the United States government over whether the company should weaken the security of its iPhone to help law enforcement.   The Justice Department has declined to name the third-party person or organization, or to describe the proposed method for breaking into the device. The third party may not have approached Apple for many reasons.   In the past, Microsoft's systems were a more frequent target for malicious-minded hackers, largely because of the prevalence of its products. But as Microsoft began to embrace the hacking community, its security improved.   As Apple's desktops and mobile phones have gained more market share, and as customers began to entrust more and more of their personal data to their iPhones, Apple products have become far more valuable marks for criminals and spies.   An Apple spokeswoman referred to an editorial by Craig Federighi, the company's senior vice president for software engineering, in which he wrote, ''Security is an endless race -- one that you can lead but never decisively win.''   ''Our team must work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminal attackers who seek to pry into personal information,'' Mr. Federighi said. ''Despite our best efforts, nothing is 100 percent secure.''   Apple has long been less visible in the security community compared with other tech companies. The company has shied away from bug bounty programs and instead relied on large testing programs and the work of its security team to spot vulnerabilities, partly because it is disinclined to keep up with a financial arms race of paying for bugs, according to three former and current employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about security matters.   Apple has said it will fight to know more about the flaw in the software or hardware that the third party has presented to law enforcement. A senior executive said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday that if the government found the method did not work and tried to force Apple to help break into the phone, Apple would have questions about what was tried, in order to keep its products as secure as possible.   If the third-party method does work, the government may dismiss a court order demanding that Apple weaken its security, but keep the process it used to break into the phone under seal. In that case, Apple would have no way of knowing how the government broke into its software or hardware.   Exploits in Apple's code have become increasingly coveted over time, especially as its mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with an underground ecosystem of brokers and contractors willing to pay top dollar for them.   Flaws in Apple's mobile devices can typically fetch $1 million. Last September, a boutique firm in Washington, called Zerodium, which sells flaws to governments and corporations, announced a $1 million bounty for anyone who would turn over an exploit in Apple's iOS 9 mobile operating system -- the same operating system used to power the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. By November, Zerodium said a team of undisclosed hackers had successfully claimed the bounty.   Chaouki Bekrar, the founder of Zerodium, said his company was not the outside party referred to in the government's court filing on Monday. But Mr. Bekrar added that even if Zerodium had helped the F.B.I., he would not disclose it.   ''For every Zerodium, there are a thousand other organizations like Zerodium that are far less vocal about doing what they do and will pay researchers who find this stuff to keep it a secret,'' said Casey Ellis, the founder of BugCrowd, a company in San Franciso that helps vendors manage bug bounty programs.   The heated battle between the United States government and Apple over breaking into the iPhone used by the San Bernardino gunman may have inadvertently catalyzed the underground market for Apple code flaws. With the F.B.I. pushing Apple to help unlock the device with a court order and publicizing that it has been unable to get into the iPhone, hackers realized there was a blank check for them if they could accomplish it, said Jon Oberheide, the chief technology officer of Duo Security, a cloud security company.   Some security researchers said no bounty Apple could offer now would match the reward they could expect from the underground market. Apple has waited so long that the black market for its flaws has become extremely lucrative, perhaps making any bug bounty program the company would create seem late to the game.   ''Apple can embrace security researchers, or try to facilitate programs that will secure its operating system, but it's never going to be able to compete with what is going on behind the scenes in the black market,'' said Jay Kaplan, a former N.S.A. analyst and co-founder of Synack, a company that deploys hackers to weed out vulnerabilities in clients' systems. ''It's just not going to happen.''     "
Family Sees a TV Talent Scout Where the Israeli Authorities See a Jihadist Spy,"JERUSALEM --  The young man was on his way out of Gaza on an innocent-seeming mission: to scout potential contestants for his embryonic ''Palestinians Got Talent'' television show and meet the show's West Bank staff in Ramallah. He had an Israeli permit for the journey. But the Israeli authorities say the would-be impresario -- Majd Oweida, 22 -- had been doing something sinister: spying for Iranian-backed extremists.     They arrested Mr. Oweida at the Erez checkpoint last month, and on Wednesday they charged him in an Israeli court with, among other things, hacking into computers at Israel's international airport and intercepting transmissions from the country's military drones.   The charge sheet says he was recruited by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group about five years ago. He soon became the group's cyber expert, the Israeli authorities said, and developed software that allowed Islamic Jihad to monitor road traffic and the movement of security forces in Israel; to view video images from Israeli air force drones in real time as they flew over Gaza; and to track flights in and out of Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv and see lists of the passengers on board.   According to Israel's Shin Bet security agency, Mr. Oweida has confessed to developing the hacking programs and showing his Islamic Jihad handler how to use them.   Dawood Shehab, a spokesman for Islamic Jihad in Gaza, said the group knew nothing about Mr. Oweida or anybody else mentioned in the case.   ''I believe there is exaggeration about his arrest,'' Mr. Shehab said on Wednesday in a telephone interview. ''All I can say is that Israel always uses cheap techniques and ways to use our young men and pressure them and create frustration among Gazans.''    Shin Bet, he added, ''wants to prove to their people that they can do something, and the victim is usually our young people.''   Mr. Oweida's brother, Amjad Oweida, 23, the executive director of ''Palestinians Got Talent,'' said his family was shocked by the charges and denied that Majd, the show's general supervisor, had ties to Islamic Jihad or any other Palestinian faction.   ''He is just a talented young man who can use and work on computers in a brilliant way,'' Amjad Oweida said of his younger brother. ''He cannot hack or do cyberattacks.'' He added: ''Majd did not work for Islamic Jihad or any other political party. He used to work for Palestine's Talent Club to help talented people leave Gaza for TV programs outside.''   According to the charge sheet, Mr. Oweida met his Islamic Jihad handler, Ismail Dahdouh, by chance sometime in 2011 at Mr. Oweida's father's electrical appliance store, and told Mr. Dahdouh that he was looking for work. The charge sheet said Islamic Jihad started Mr. Oweida off as a sound engineer and host at a radio station affiliated with the group's student union, and was soon asking him to develop hacking programs as well.   The first cybertarget, the charge sheet said, was a computer system that keeps track of movement on Israel's roads; hacking that system allowed Islamic Jihad to spot where in Israel the rockets fired from Gaza had landed. About a year later it was the drones.   The authorities said Mr. Oweida told Mr. Dahdouh that he needed a frequency reader, a satellite dish with an Amos Satellite lens and a laptop computer for the project. Mr. Dahdouh obtained the equipment from the United States and smuggled it into Gaza through tunnels from Egypt, according to the court documents. Israel said that the frequency reader stopped being able to penetrate the drone systems' transmissions sometime in 2014.   The authorities say Mr. Oweida is suspected of having broken into the airport system in part by stealing the identity of an American man who had access to the data. Mr. Oweida is also accused of hacking into the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza to obtain the Palestinian population registry for Islamic Jihad's use.   Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, said on Wednesday that it had no information about the case.   Mr. Oweida was traveling with a group of other young Gazans working for the talent show when he arrived at the Erez checkpoint on Feb. 23. Two Israeli soldiers arrived and took him into custody.

"A Dam, Small and Unsung, Is Caught Up in an International Hacking Case","RYE BROOK, N.Y. -- The United States has many colossal dams, hydroelectric power generators like Hoover and Grand Coulee so monumental in scale and purpose that they have been celebrated in song by Woody Guthrie and others. The Bowman Avenue Dam in this low-key suburban village in Westchester County is not one of those. Its opening is about the width of a modest living room, and the 20-foot-tall dam itself essentially keeps a babbling creek, the Blind Brook, from flooding basements and ground floors in houses downstream.    Yet, according to the authorities, it was the computer-guided controls of this dam that seven Iranian computer hackers chose to penetrate on behalf of that country's Revolutionary Guards Corps, as part of a plot that also breached or paralyzed 46 of the nation's largest financial institutions and blocked hundreds of thousands of customers from accessing their bank accounts online. The cyberattacks were disclosed in an indictment that Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced on Thursday.    ''It's ridiculous how little that dam is, how insignificant in the grand scheme of things,'' said Paul Rosenberg, the village's mayor. ''We're not talking about something vital to the infrastructure of the country.''   The mayor, despite being puzzled by Rye Brook's role in the alleged plot, had several theories about why the village's sluice-gate dam had been singled out. One was that the Iranian hackers had confused the structure with another named Bowman -- the Arthur R. Bowman Dam on the Crooked River in Oregon, which is 245 feet tall and 800 feet long, and is used to irrigate a large swath of local farms.   Mayor Rosenberg also speculated that the hackers had gone after the Rye Brook dam in a dry run for a more disruptive invasion of, say, a major hydroelectric generator or some other grand and indispensable element of the nation's power grid.   Any attempt to remotely manipulate the Bowman Avenue dam would have failed because it was under repair and offline at the time that the authorities say the Iranians were trying to take it over. American investigators were nevertheless disturbed because the attempt indicated that hackers could take control of computer-operated infrastructure.   Despite being unsung, the dam -- which is less than 15 miles north of the Bronx and is in a thicket of brush and boulders near Interstate 287, a shopping center, a local middle school and hundreds of homes -- has a history dating to the early 1900s. In those pre-refrigeration days, what is now the Upper Pond was used to produce ice; there was a quarry, since closed, on what is now the Lower Pond.   In 1941, according to a 2008 engineering study, the dam collapsed and was rebuilt on the brook's ledge rocks as a reinforced concrete dam with a fixed timber door. While the door kept the waters of the Blind Brook at bay and flowing gently toward Long Island Sound, it did not prevent high water from spilling over the dam during major storms like Hurricane Agnes in June 1972 and Hurricane Eloise in September 1975. Homes, yards and streets were sometimes badly damaged.   On April 15, 2007, a once-in-a-century nor'easter pummeled the Westchester County seaboard with eight inches of rain in a 24-hour period. Low-lying portions of towns like Mamaroneck and Rye were particularly hard hit. Indian Village, a Rye neighborhood with more than 200 residents where the streets are named for Indian tribes and 3,000- to 5,500-square-foot homes sell for over $1 million, was severely damaged, Mr. Rosenberg said.   The 2008 study, by the Charles H. Sells Inc. engineering firm in Briarcliff Manor, showed that Indian Village had filed 113 of the 273 claims for insurance losses in the City of Rye caused by the storm. (The city is a separate municipality from the town of Rye, which includes two villages, Rye Brook and Port Chester.) Officials of Rye Brook and the City of Rye, which owns the dam, decided after conducting flood-mitigation studies to build a sluice gate that could be raised or lowered depending on the volume of water flowing.   Costing $2 million and containing an orifice 15-feet wide by 2.5-feet high, the sluice gate began operation in 2013. Its computer program processes a complicated array of data sent by sensors in the brook that measure, among other things, water levels and temperature, and then adjusts flow rates accordingly. It was that computer program, which Mr. Rosenberg said was accessible through a cellular modem, that had been penetrated. The indictment identified the key Iranian involved in the breach as Hamid Firoozi, 34, employed by two Iranian companies sponsored by the Revolutionary Guards.   Mr. Rosenberg said he and other local officials learned of the intrusion in 2013 but were asked not to discuss it.   ''They tried to get into it,'' Mr. Rosenberg said of the hackers, ''but they did not activate the sluice gate.'' Still, he said, ''we have to be cognizant of what infrastructure gets hooked up to the Internet.''     "
Hacker Says He Printed Racist Fliers at Colleges Across Country,"PRINCETON, N.J. -- A well-known computer hacker who goes by the name of ''Weev'' said he was behind a wave of anti-Semitic, racist fliers that appeared on printers at more than a dozen college campuses last week. Covered in swastikas, the fliers, which seemed to appear spontaneously on printers, including those at Princeton University, mentioned ''the struggle for global white supremacy.''     Weev is the alias of Andrew Auernheimer, who in 2010 was part of a group of hackers that discovered a security loophole on AT&T's servers and gained access to the data of 114,000 customers. Mr. Auernheimer was initially convicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.   Mr. Auernheimer said in an interview on Monday that he sent the fliers to every publicly accessible printer in North America. He said he did not specifically target college campuses.   The fliers directed readers to The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. Mr. Auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing spree. ''My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners.''   The debate comes at a time of heightened awareness about speech on campus. Black student movements at many campuses broke out this school year, protesting what students saw as the continuing legacies of racism. Last week, the University of California became the first public university system to adopt an official stance condemning anti-Semitism on their campuses.   After the fliers appeared on Princeton University printers, the administration promised to try to ''block any further messages.''   Some leaders of the black protests here said they saw a discrepancy between the university's response to the fliers and what they saw as racism against black students in the past.   Almost a year ago, after Urban Congo, a student percussion group, performed on campus in loin cloths, which many on campus found offensive, the university's president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, sent an email to the student body that affirmed the school's commitment to free speech.   He reiterated that on a trip to India last week, when he told the Indian Express, ''We think it's very important for people be able to say what it is they want to say even if it's offensive to the government or offensive to some of the other people on campus.''   Asanni York, a member of the Black Justice League, an activist group that led a sit-in in November that called for the removal of President Woodrow Wilson's name from the campus because of his racist positions, said the university's response to the fliers differed from past stances. ''When it was happening to black students, it was a matter of free speech,'' he said. ''Now that it's happening to white, Jewish students, it's something else. There seems to be no conflation of hate speech and free speech now.''   A Princeton spokeswoman, Min Pullan, said the fliers were not a question of free speech. ''External messages infiltrating our campus is a completely different matter. They are not two things that can be compared,'' Ms. Pullan said.   In addition to Princeton, the messages appeared at the University of California, Berkeley; Smith College; Brown University; the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Mount Holyoke College, among other places.   Many university printers allow printing from outside their computer networks. Mr. Auernheimer said he did not hack into the printers, but activated them using remote access.   In response to the fliers, universities have notified the police and begun to conduct investigations, but it was unclear if Mr. Auernheimer broke any laws. DePaul University in Chicago, for instance, has turned off remote printing.   On Monday morning, anti-gay and transgender fliers appeared on printers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Mr. Auernheimer said he was not involved with them.     "
Keeping Tabs on Terrorists,"Q. What types of clients do you work for, and what is your role? A. We're a threat intelligence firm that works for government agencies and corporations concerned with terrorism and cybercrime. I spend my day on the deep and dark web, hidden areas that users can't find on a regular web search, and where visitors tend to obscure their identities.     What are you looking for? Can you be more specific?   I mostly monitor jihadists, who are increasingly engaging in hacking and cybercrime. In addition, a client may ask us to follow a certain person in the terrorist community. I also monitor propaganda released by terrorist groups.   What is your background?   I have a bachelor's from the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, with a concentration in conflict and security. I minored in religion, focused mostly on Islam and studied Arabic. Then I received a master's in global affairs, with a concentration in transnational security from New York University. I interned at Interpol and the Afghan Embassy in Washington, and at Flashpoint.   How did you get interested in this field?   I grew up in the tristate area and was about 11 when the 9/11 attacks occurred. They really affected me.   What kind of information do you provide?   I supply information about threats as they develop, new tactics terrorists are planning and targets they're discussing. We've also uncovered people's personal information that terrorists may have stolen. If I believe that the information might mean that someone is in physical danger, we notify the client. If the information points to financial fraud, I work with the cybercrime unit here.   Does what you learn about make you anxious?   I'm human, so of course it makes me a little anxious. But there are tools available to monitor terrorists, which makes me feel safer. There's a lot going on behind the scenes in the intelligence community that people don't know about. It's a collective effort. Knowing that we're able to disrupt terrorist plans almost balances out any anxiety I might feel.   Vocations asks people about their jobs.

Pakistan Digs Through a Software Company's Empire of Empty Promises,"In the year since Pakistani investigators raided Axact, a Karachi-based software company accused of raking in hundreds of millions of dollars with a vast Internet degree scam, Pakistani and American investigators have been busy dismantling its operations. Fourteen Axact employees, including the chief executive, await trial on charges of fraud, extortion and money laundering. Bank accounts in Pakistan and the United States have been frozen. Investigators have uncovered a tangled web of corporate entities -- dozens of shell companies and associates, from Caribbean tax havens to others in Delaware, Dubai and Singapore -- used to funnel illicit earnings back to Pakistan.    New details suggest that Axact's fraud empire, already considered one of the biggest Internet scams on record, is bigger than initially imagined. Over the past decade, Axact took money from at least 215,000 people in 197 countries -- one-third of them from the United States. Sales agents wielded threats and false promises and impersonated government officials, earning the company at least $89 million in its final year of operation.    Those findings stem from financial and customer records, company registrations, sworn testimony, communications between Pakistani and American officials, and hundreds of hours of taped phone conversations filed in court. The records have been made available to The New York Times in the months since a Times article detailing the company's scheme prompted police raids and the collapse not just of Axact, but also of the company's new national news channel, Bol.   The case against Axact, which at first seemed a rare instance in which tycoons with powerful connections were being held to criminal account, has increasingly appeared in recent months to be in jeopardy.   The leading prosecutor quit with little explanation, hinting that he had come under political pressure to soft-pedal the case. A trial date for the company's executives has not been set, and several judges have dropped out of the case. Some media analysts, noting that Axact's jailed chief executive, Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh, has publicly boasted of his work for the Pakistani military, speculate that his powerful connections may yet work in his favor.   ''There's been a huge amount of speculation and analysis and deep-throated conspiracy theories,'' said Hasan Zaidi, a filmmaker and media analyst based in Karachi.   ''Initially, there was a lot of surprise that Axact's operations were being tackled so quickly, particularly given the view that it was being backed by the boys,'' he added, using a common euphemism for the military's Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency. ''But now the interest has died down, and I don't think it will ever be solved -- even through a court case.''   Axact had been in business for nearly 10 years at the time of the arrests in May, and the company and its founder appeared ever more eager to step into the public spotlight, seemingly unconcerned about the risk. Most prominently, Axact was preparing to introduce Bol, a television network with 2,200 employees that had started test transmissions in the days before the police raids.   Comparing himself to Microsoft's Bill Gates, Mr. Shaikh had touted Axact as Pakistan's leading software exporter. He laid out an ambitious plan to provide education for millions of Pakistani children, and he wreathed himself in patriotism: In the corner of his office, near a passage leading to a bedroom and a private swimming pool, the eagle-crested Axact company flag stood alongside a furled Pakistani standard.   Once the police investigation began, Mr. Shaikh instructed subordinates to burn company documents at a vacant lot and to destroy computer drives, some of which were later cast into the sea, another executive testified to the police.   But Mr. Shaikh could not prevent the seizure of a vast trove of data, some recovered from computer disks as they were being deleted, that led investigators to conclude that Axact's main business was providing fake degrees.   The police found more than one million blank educational certificates and evidence of 300 fictitious educational websites, many with American-sounding names like Columbiana and Brooklyn Park, that sold fake degrees to hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Some knowingly bought effortless degrees to pad résumés or to help in immigration, and a handful have been publicly embarrassed.   Last month, Myanmar's new finance and planning minister, U Kyaw Win, admitted that his doctorate came from Axact's Brooklyn Park University. ''Now I am ashamed to call myself a Ph.D.,'' he said.   Many other customers, investigators quickly realized, had fallen victim to an elaborate and aggressive fraud, going to Axact-run websites for a legitimate online education only to be intimidated into making ever larger payments.   Hundreds of hours of taped phone conversations, extracted from Axact servers and cited by prosecutors, showed sales agents impersonating American lawyers or State Department officials in an effort to collect more money from customers, mostly in the Middle East.   In one recording from 2014, Riaz Ahmed Shaikh, a Pakistani living in Abu Dhabi, pleaded for respite from ''Jacob'' -- a man who he believed was calling from the legal office of a university in California but was in fact an Axact sales agent in Karachi, according to police records.   ''Please, please, Mr. Jacob,'' said Mr. Shaikh, who said he had already paid $150,000 to Axact. ''I have sold all of my assets to pay this last amount. I am not eating well. I am not sleeping well.''   ''Look, you're not paying that much,'' the sales agent cajoled, before holding out a threat of possible police action. ''Just another $10,000.''   Axact executives took extraordinary measures to disguise their links to fraud. In a lawsuit in the United States, in which former customers of the online Belford High School were seeking damages, Axact officials persuaded an attendant in the company's cafeteria to pose as the founder of the school, a police report said.   The worker, Salem Kureshi, conducted a webcam video deposition in 2011 for the American court. In it, he merely moved his lips while, off camera, an Axact official voiced a set of evasive answers for the American lawyers, Mr. Kureshi told the police.   After the police raided Axact last year, Mr. Kureshi added, executives paid him $250 to go into hiding in his hometown, 700 miles from Karachi.   In Pakistan, the plight of Axact's victims has been largely overshadowed by the media furor surrounding the Bol network, which had hired some of the country's most prominent journalists before it closed. With their salaries suddenly cut off, many employees took to the streets to protest, saying Axact was the victim of a conspiracy by rival news organizations.   Shoaib Ahmed Shaikh insists that he earned his wealth through legitimate software exports. He has hired Shaukat Hayat, a lawyer whose client list includes Pervez Musharraf, the former Pakistan president, to defend him.   In a telephone interview, Mr. Hayat said the case against Mr. Shaikh and his fellow executives had been cooked up by the news media. ''They have not committed any illegal action,'' he said.   Mr. Shaikh also faces scrutiny from American investigators. In a letter to the Pakistani authorities in February, United States officials said the F.B.I. had identified Axact as a ''diploma mill'' that operated a ''worldwide web of shell companies and associates.'' Three of the main shell companies, registered in Delaware, were found to have been owned by Mr. Shaikh or his associates, the letter said.   Other company documents point to shell holdings in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Dubai and Panama. In several instances, Mr. Shaikh appears to have used a pseudonym, Ryan Jones, to sign company documents. He became a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, a small Caribbean island that sells passports to rich investors.   In the Belford case, lawyers have obtained a court order freezing three American bank accounts containing $675,000. In a sworn statement, Mr. Shaikh admitted ownership of some of those accounts.   His sister, Uzma Shaheen, who lives in Chicago, has been called to testify. Documents filed in court show that Ms. Shaheen transferred more than $37 million from American bank accounts to Axact in Pakistan in recent years.   Still, much of Axact's global network remains undisrupted. It controls 32 other bank accounts -- in the United States, Ireland, Dubai, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, and Singapore -- that are thought to contain millions of dollars, according to prosecution documents.   And in Pakistan, the case has run into quicksand. Two judges have recused themselves without explanation; so has Zahid Jamil, an ambitious prosecutor who built much of the case against Axact but quit abruptly in February, citing unspecified circumstances ''that make it impossible for me to proceed further.''   Contacted by phone, Mr. Jamil declined to comment.   Nighat Dad of the Digital Rights Foundation, an Internet advocacy group in Pakistan, said the Axact case showed that good laws also needed political will if they were to succeed.   ''If the evidence is so clear, and there is so much of it, then why is the case against Axact taking so long?'' she asked. ''Something must be happening behind closed doors.''     "
Journalist Gets 2 Years for Assistance to Hackers,"A California journalist was sentenced on Wednesday to two years in federal prison for helping to hack the website of The Los Angeles Times in 2010. The journalist, Matthew Keys, who was a deputy social media editor at Thomson Reuters at the time, was convicted in October of providing the hacking group Anonymous with a user name and password to log in to computers owned by the Tribune Company, parent company of The Times.     A federal indictment said that Mr. Keys, 29, had encouraged the hackers, with whom he worked in December 2010, to log in to a Tribune server ''to make unauthorized changes to websites'' and ''to damage computer systems'' owned by the company.   The hackers changed the Times headline ''Pressure Builds in House to Pass Tax-Cut Package'' to ''Pressure Builds in House to Elect CHIPPY 1337,'' a reference to another hacking group.   Mr. Keys previously was a web producer at KTXL Fox 40, a Sacramento television station owned by Tribune. Federal prosecutors in Sacramento said that Mr. Keys, of Vacaville, Calif., was a disgruntled worker striking back at his former employer.   According to court documents, Mr. Keys changed the access credentials of Fox 40 employees, interfering with their ability to access company servers, and obtained email addresses for Fox 40 viewers, to whom he sent disparaging emails about the company.   The charges had shocked social media circles where Mr. Keys was considered a wunderkind of new media. He was named one of Time's 140 best Twitter feeds. The indictment also sparked protests against the 1984 law under which he was charged, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.   In an essay posted on Medium on Wednesday, Mr. Keys wrote that ''the past three years have been exceptionally challenging -- for me personally and for my professional career as a journalist.''   He added: ''I am innocent, and I did not ask for this fight. Nonetheless, I hope that our combined efforts help bring about positive change to rules and regulations that govern our online conduct.''   He also posted his reaction to the sentence on Twitter:   2 years. We plan on filing a motion to stay the sentence. -- Matthew Keys (@MatthewKeysLive) April 13, 2016   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Netflix Grabs Three Peabody Awards,"New comedies, a German spy series, a hacker thriller and an unsparing African war drama were among the television honorees in the 75th Peabody Awards. The awards, recognizing the best in electronic media, are bestowed annually by the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. The works below won awards in the entertainment and children's programming category on Friday.  Netflix won three Peabodys, including for ''Beasts of No Nation,'' a movie about child soldiers in Africa; ''Master of None,'' Aziz Ansari's comedy about self-obsessed young adults in New York; and ''Marvel's Jessica Jones,'' a moody superhero crime drama starring Krysten Ritter.    ''Black-ish,'' the ABC sitcom with a socially conscious edge, was also among the winners. Other honored comedies included ''Unreal,'' Lifetime's reality-TV satire that, like ''Master of None,'' won for its inaugural season; and ''Transparent,'' the acclaimed Amazon series about a gender-transitioning paterfamilias.   ''Mr. Robot,'' a twisty USA Network drama about hacker culture and corporate misbehavior, and ''Deutschland 83,'' a period German espionage thriller, also won Peabodys for their first seasons. Other drama winners included ''The Leftovers,'' the metaspiritual HBO series; and ''Wolf Hall,'' the PBS period mini-series based on Hilary Mantel's Booker Prize-winning novel.   Rounding out the TV winners was ''Katie Morag,'' the BBC adaptation of Mairi Hedderwick's popular children's books.   Winners of news, radio/podcast, web and public service Peabodys, announced earlier this week, included ''This American Life,'' NPR News and ''Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel.'' Awards for documentary and education works will be announced April 26.    This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.              "
Hackers and Tensions Return for a Final Run,"''Person of Interest'' has no superheroes, no zombies, no ninjas, no direwolves. But as much as any show on television, it makes the high-low connection that's at the heart of genre and comic-book storytelling.  The obvious appeal of this CBS series, which returns for an abbreviated fifth and final season on Tuesday, is pulpy and visceral. Its central cast includes three wisecracking assassins with good looks and hearts of gold, and the spiraling, frantic story lines allow them and their adversaries to run up prodigious body counts. (Secondary characters on ''Person of Interest'' almost always come with expiration dates.)    But the show's premise, combining fear of sentient computers with fear of unfettered post-9/11 government surveillance, has been sufficiently sturdy and coherent to provide ballast for the comic-book action. It makes you think, or think you're thinking, while you enjoy the gunplay and slightly dopey humor, and it makes you care more than you expect to about the fates of the show's heroic, heavily outnumbered band of hackers, black-ops agents and cops.   In the new season the series pushes that conceptual framework hard. Finch (Michael Emerson), the owlish genius who created the crime-predicting artificial intelligence program called the Machine, wonders whether it's time to pull the plug: Is the existence of a program that could exterminate us ''an existential risk the world can't afford''? (Two programs, actually, given that the Machine's main antagonist since Season 3 has been another artificial intelligence, named Samaritan.) The answer, as fans of Finch will immediately predict, lies in the Machine's close connection to its benevolent maker.   At the end of Season 4 (a full year ago), the writers killed off or sidelined most of the adversaries of Finch's group, leaving the corporate-backed Samaritan and its shadowy minders as the only significant enemy. In the early going of Season 5 (four episodes were available to critics) the show spins its wheels a little.   One of the clever things the show's creator, Jonathan Nolan, did was to encapsulate the creative tension between self-contained, crime-solving episodes (a CBS hallmark) and a long-range conspiracy story by having the Machine spit out ''numbers'' that led the heroes to individual, weekly cases. With 13 episodes to go, the producers appear to be leery both of spending time on cases and of setting up their climactic showdown too soon, and the plots have a neither-here-nor-there quality. In the fourth week, however, the reintroduction of some favorite characters begins to bring the story into focus.   The most crucial element of the show's success remains the same: Mr. Emerson's tremendously appealing, oddly moving performance as Finch, the programming genius who is uncomfortable in every situation but always rises to the occasion. As the new season opens Mr. Emerson has to play a number of very emotional scenes with a computer monitor, carrying on passionate conversations with the blinking cursor. Not one moment of this will tempt you to laugh (in fact, you might have to blink back a tear), and that's a bit of magic as impressive as any string of computer code.     "
Man Accused of Breaching Stars' Emails Pleads Guilty,"A Bahamian man pleaded guilty on Monday to charges that he had hacked into the email accounts of celebrities and others and gained access to a trove of unreleased movie and television scripts, which he then tried to sell for thousands of dollars.  The defendant, Alonzo Knowles, 24, was arrested in December after he flew to New York and tried to sell the scripts to an undercover agent, who was posing as a potential buyer and had handed him $80,000 in cash, according to a criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.    Mr. Knowles also gave the agent the Social Security numbers of three professional athletes and a movie actress, for which Mr. Knowles had agreed to be paid in the future, the complaint said.   His arrest drew attention because it followed a widely publicized breach in which hackers stole confidential information from Sony Pictures Entertainment and released it online, about a year before.   Mr. Knowles, in a conversation with the undercover agent, described a process he called ''social engineering,'' which involved doing ''research on a target,'' according to the complaint, which was signed by Michael MacDonald, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security.   Mr. Knowles said that it was difficult to go after ''a high profile celebrity,'' so he would begin by going after friends found in photographs with them. He would then hack the friends' accounts to find the celebrities' telephone numbers and other personal information.   ''It boils down to the weakest link in the chain,'' a former official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Austin P. Berglas, told The New York Times in December, after the charges were announced.   At one point, the complaint said, Mr. Knowles showed the undercover agent a list of names, with phone numbers or email addresses of about 130 celebrities.   Mr. Knowles, in court, apologized to the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, and acknowledged that he knew his actions had been wrong and illegal.   He pleaded guilty to both of the counts charged in a federal indictment against him: criminal copyright infringement and identity theft.   He could face a total of 10 years in prison when he is sentenced on Aug. 25. The federal sentencing guidelines, which are only advisory, suggested a sentence of 27 to 33 months, according to the plea agreement in the case.   The plea includes a provision under which Mr. Knowles will forfeit, among other things, all copies of 25 unpublished television and movie scripts, as well as unpublished music, the plea agreement said.   Mr. Knowles's lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, declined to comment after the hearing.   The plea comes two months after a prosecutor, Kristy J. Greenberg, told Judge Engelmayer in court that the investigation had turned up potential new victims of Mr. Knowles's scheme, and evidence of how he had been using the information he was stealing.   In one case, she told the judge, there was evidence that Mr. Knowles had made credit card purchases ''using financial information of new victims that we hadn't known about.''     "
"As 'Sextortion' Proliferates, Victims Find Precarious Place in Legal System","WASHINGTON -- Ever since law enforcement started seeing cases in the early 2000s, the crime known as sextortion has proliferated on the Internet, altering the lives of thousands and ensnaring victims from college campuses to military bases. On Wednesday, the Brookings Institution will release two studies billed as the first in-depth reviews of sextortion -- in which someone uses nude photographs of someone to demand ever more sexually explicit content or other goods -- and its precarious place in a legal system that acknowledges its existence but has yet to write it into law.    ''It's about the security environment in a world in which anyone can attack anyone from anywhere,'' said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings, an author of the studies. ''When we're thinking about that, we're usually thinking about drone strikes or cyberattacks, which has all these same elements. We're not usually thinking of sexual violence.''    Prosecutors say sextortion is increasingly common, with as many as 6,500 victims. It can involve hacking into victims' computers to steal sexual images or even commandeer a webcam, then using the files to extort the targets.   More often, perpetrators use social media to coax one photograph from a victim, then use that to demand a continual supply. A State Department employee at the American Embassy in London was sentenced to more than four years in prison after threatening to put sexually explicit images of women onlinee.   Law enforcement agencies acknowledge the proliferation of sextortion, but it does not exist as a separate offense in federal or state law, nor does any government agency maintain data on it. No academic literature is available to educate the public or provide resources for victims. It is remote and anonymous. It involves high-level computer intelligence, and it gives sexual predators access to thousands of new potential victims, researchers say. And, Mr. Wittes said, it has not been addressed appropriately.   He said one of the most alarming things about such cases was the ability of perpetrators to scale up their assaults.   ''It used to be that you couldn't walk into a place and sexually assault a large number of people,'' he said. With a computer, he said, ''you can.''   Brookings, for example, found at least 1,397 victims in only 78 cases. In one case, prosecutors identified ''at least eight possible minor victims'' of a California man who had posed as a teenage girl on social media to trick real teenage girls into sending him explicit photographs. In another, the government refers to ''more than 100'' possible victims of one perpetrator.   Yet because sextortion is not a crime, its perpetrators are often prosecuted under a piecemeal slate of state and federal charges, such as stalking, extortion and computer fraud. According to Brookings, 71 percent of the cases involved only underage victims, and virtually all adult victims were female.   Mr. Wittes said adult cases presented another problem. Cases with child victims do not have prosecutorial impediments because child pornography laws are so strict. But once the victim turns 18, much of that protection vanishes.   ''Advocacy groups generally don't focus on the adult women,'' Mr. Wittes said. ''To me, that's the big blank spot in the whole discussion.''   According to Mary Anne Franks of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, victims are especially unprotected when a crime does not involve physical interaction.   ''Once you become a woman,'' she said, everything is fair game.   The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative has been instrumental in getting non-consensual pornography, also known as revenge porn, laws passed in 31 states. But she said she was hesitant to join Mr. Wittes in a call for legislation to specifically address sextortion, an offense she said was too narrow and could diminish the plight of other victims.   Instead, she advocates legislation that would make the wholesale distribution of nonconsensual explicit images illegal, regardless of how they are obtained.   ''We don't need to reinvent the wheel here,'' she said.   Mr. Wittes put the biggest onus on the manufacturers of webcams, which could make covers for lenses that a hacker could not get around. He also said people needed to better protect themselves with stronger passwords and two-step authentication systems that send access codes to smartphones or other devices.   ''You don't think of teenagers as attractive cybersecurity targets, or for that matter young women,'' he said. ''We have this mental assumption that things are different online, like the same incentives wouldn't apply. But trust me, they do.''

"Everybody Loves a Hero, Especially Fraudsters","EMAIL: haggler@nytimes.com or tweet to @TheHagglerNYT. Keep it family-friendly and under 250 words, include your hometown and go easy on the caps-lock key. Letters may be edited for clarity and length. The Haggler doesn't spend a lot of time on Facebook. As a fictional construct, he has no friends, no family, no life and thus nothing to share. Also, the whole enterprise seems frivolous. You want him to ''like'' your vacation photos? Please. He seeks consumer justice. It's full-time work. That said, the Haggler has found Facebook useful when trying to contact people for this column. Recently, however, he learned that it would be wise to approach the social network with a touch of skepticism.     Q. My son, William Swenson, has an odd and recurring problem: People keep creating fake Facebook accounts in his name. Why this happens is a mystery to us both, though it is worth noting that William is a public figure. In 2013, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for service to his country in Afghanistan.   Normally, I use Facebook's ''report'' feature, and the page is taken down. But recently I found a fake William Swenson Facebook account that I have reported to the company more than eight times. Each time, I hear back that the company believes that the account ''doesn't violate our Community Standards.'' In the feedback feature I have posted text messages stating that the account contains numerous factual errors. It doesn't help.   I've read a lot on the internet saying that it is nearly impossible to get the attention of anyone at Facebook. Would you care to give it a try?   CARL SWENSON, SEATTLE   A. So this is a weird one.   There are a lot of Facebook scams out there, as you, dear reader, may already know. Most commonly, a fraudster copies a Facebook account and then ''friends'' his or her contacts. You accept, thinking your friend has pressed a reset button of some sort. Then the messages start, which quickly become a request for cash. Hopefully you unfriend, and life goes on.   That is not what happened to William Swenson. He has never had a Facebook account.   It also seems unlikely that the fake accounts were built to embed ads that would then make pay-per-click fortunes. A member of Facebook's spam team told the Haggler that it would take a huge number of clicks to generate meaningful sums. And once a ''William Swenson'' site started raking it in, the company's filters would flag the account and shut it down.   Perplexed, the Haggler contacted Doug Pierce, one of the smartest people to trudge through the fetid bog that is the internet underworld, and the founder of Cogney, a search engine optimization company in Hong Kong. He had two words to share: romance scam. The scam has its own warning site -- ''dedicated to fighting Nigerian and Russian romance scammers'' is its motto. The rip-off is a variation of the old advance-fee hustle, in which a con artist persuades a mark, via email, to send money, and then more money, for an investment scheme that will purportedly pay off in the future.   The romance version has the swindler contacting the victim through a dating site, pretending to fall in love, then asking the mark for money. The popularity, if that is the right word, of this flimflam is not known, but rummage around romancescam.com, which has page after page of examples and advice, and you get the sense that it is widespread. A fake Facebook account would help ''prove'' that the faux Romeo is real, with photographic evidence.   And this is perhaps what makes Mr. Swenson such an appealing figure to impersonate. He's a real live hero, who displayed uncommon courage during a harrowing firefight with the Taliban in 2009. He's also good looking.   This con man theory seemed speculative until the Haggler found photographs of Mr. Swenson on a part of romancescam.com where people combating this fraud trade notes. ''Pictures stolen from former U.S. Army Captain Swenson,'' it says near the top. Below that a contributor to the site states that he or she nabbed the images from someone with the Skype name ''william awenson7.'' As it happens, there is currently a Facebook account for someone named William Awenson that is studded with photos of Mr. Swenson. (The misspelling might explain why nobody, including the Swensons, had noticed this account before.)   On the same romancescam.com page, you can read a come-on by a person engaged in this act of seduction. ''I'm a loving caring tender man and I always respect my woman,'' wrote an ersatz wooer, beside photos of Mr. Swenson, in a snippet culled from a site called DateHookup. ''I'm here looking for good honest kind woman.''   Irresistible, huh?   All that was left for the Haggler was a question for Facebook. The company deleted the resilient fake account that Carl Swenson had complained about as soon as the Haggler wrote to Facebook's media relations office. That's nice. But why did the company tell the elder Swenson, over and over, that the account met its community standards?   ''As our team processes millions of reports each week, we occasionally make a mistake,'' a Facebook spokeswoman wrote in an email. ''That is what happened in this case.''   The team is vastly outnumbered by the complaints it is supposed to assess, and the result is human error. It can happen. And apparently it has already happened again. On Wednesday, the Haggler showed Carl Swenson the ''William Awenson'' Facebook account. He promptly used the ''report'' feature to request deletion of this blatant fake. You'd think that by now the guy has some credibility. Nope. He soon received a familiar note from Facebook, which stated that the account met its community standards.   Listen, Facebook. You're now worth more than $300 billion. How about throwing a few bucks at your fraud-prevention team? Maybe adding more humans will cut down on the errors.     "
Would You Let Your Child Have One of These?,"NOT long ago, many parents wondered at what age they should give their child full access to the car keys. Nowadays, parents face a trickier question: At what age should a child own a smartphone? The smartphone, after all, is the key to unfettered access to the internet and the many benefits and dangers that come with it. But unlike driving a car, which is legal in some states starting at the age of 16, there is no legal guideline for a parent to determine when a child may be ready for a smartphone.    The topic is being increasingly debated as children get smartphones at an ever younger age. On average, children are getting their first smartphones around age 10, according to the research firm Influence Central, down from age 12 in 2012. For some children, smartphone ownership starts even sooner -- including second graders as young as 7, according to internet safety experts.   ''I think that age is going to trend even younger, because parents are getting tired of handing their smartphones to their kids,'' said Stacy DeBroff, chief executive of Influence Central.    The downward age creep is meeting resistance. James P. Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization that reviews content and products for families, has a strict rule for his family: His children get a smartphone only when they start high school -- after they have learned restraint and the value of face-to-face communication.   But Mr. Steyer added that other parents might decide that their children are ready sooner. ''No two kids are the same, and there's no magic number,'' he said. ''A kid's age is not as important as his or her own responsibility or maturity level.''   So how do you determine the right time? To come up with some guidelines, I interviewed internet safety experts and combed through studies on smartphone use among children. I also asked for parents' advice on regulating smartphone use and keeping children safe.   The takeaway will not please smartphone makers: The longer you wait to give your children a smartphone, the better. Some experts said 12 was the ideal age, while others said 14. All agreed later was safer because smartphones can be addictive distractions that detract from schoolwork while exposing children to issues like online bullies, child predators or sexting.   ''The longer you keep Pandora's box shut, the better off you are,'' said Jesse Weinberger, an internet safety speaker based in Ohio who gives presentations to parents, schools and law enforcement officials. ''There's no connection to the dark side without the device.''   The Research   Let's start with some of the data. Ms. Weinberger, who wrote the smartphone and internet safety book ''The Boogeyman Exists: And He's in Your Child's Back Pocket,'' said she had surveyed 70,000 children in the last 18 months and found that, on average, sexting began in the fifth grade, pornography consumption began when children turned 8, and pornography addiction began around age 11.   In a separate study published this year, Common Sense Media polled 1,240 parents and children and found 50 percent of the children admitted that they were addicted to their smartphones. It also found that 66 percent of parents felt their children used mobile devices too much, and 52 percent of children agreed. About 36 percent of parents said they argued with their children daily about device use.   There is also biology to consider. The prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that controls impulse, finishes developing in the mid-20s. In other words, parents should not be surprised if younger children with smartphones lack impulse control.    Pros and Cons   Smartphones undoubtedly bring benefits. With the devices, children gain access to powerful apps, including education tools for studying, chat apps for connecting with friends and the wealth of information on the web.   But they also are one step closer to distracting games, sexting apps and social media apps where online bullies are on the prowl. Even older children are not immune: Last year, at least 100 students at a Colorado high school were embroiled in a scandal that involved trading naked pictures of themselves on their mobile devices.   In the end, such cons may outweigh the pros, Ms. Weinberger said. If you hold off giving smartphones to children, many still have access to technology tools through devices like computers and tablets, she added. The main difference with a smartphone is that it is with a child everywhere, including outside of parental supervision.   Teaching Responsibility   Ultimately, parents will determine when their child truly needs a smartphone. When that time comes, there are approaches for testing the waters before handing one to the child.   One popular option is to start the child off with dumbed-down mobile devices, like feature phones that can only send text messages or place phone calls, and to assess whether they can use those devices responsibly.   Lynn Muscat, a parent in San Francisco, said she had considered buying a ''dumb phone'' for her 10-year-old son to keep in touch while he was at summer camp. She ended up buying the LG GizmoGadget, a Verizon smartwatch that has calling and texting capabilities and a locked-down list of contacts so that her son could interact only with people she had approved.   Ms. Muscat said she did not consider buying her child a smartphone partly because she felt the device would make him a target for muggers. She also was not appreciative of how smartphones had affected other children around him.   ''It drives me nuts when I see his friends on it all the time -- it seems very antisocial,'' Ms. Muscat said. She said she planned to use the smartwatch to teach the responsibilities of using a mobile device safely before her son eventually earns the privilege of carrying a smartphone.   When you decide that it's time to bestow a smartphone on your child, there are ways to set limits. To help parents enforce rules consistently, Ms. Weinberger has published a family contract listing the rules of smartphone use, which includes promises never to take nude selfies and never to try to meet strangers from the internet in real life. Parents state what the consequences are for breaking the rules, and the child must sign the contract before receiving a smartphone.   Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media said he set other limits, like no smartphones at the dinner table and no phones in the classroom. If his children break the rules, he takes their phones away.   Parental Controls   There are some phone settings that can help keep children safe when they do get smartphones.   For iPhones, Apple offers a switchboard full of features that parents can enable or disable, including the ability to restrict the Safari browser from gaining access to adult content and the ability to prevent apps from using cellular data. The iPhone's parental controls live inside the Settings app in a menu labeled Restrictions.   Android phones lack similar built-in parental control settings, though there are many apps in the Google Play app store that let parents add restrictions. Ms. Weinberger highlighted the app Qustodio, which lets parents monitor their children's text messages, disable apps at certain times of day or even shut off a smartphone remotely. While that can be an aggressive approach to restricting a child's smartphone, Ms. Weinberger said her job as a parent was not to make her children like her.   ''My only job as a parent is to prepare you for the day you leave,'' she said. ''If that's the case, I have to keep you safe, and you're not going to like some of the things I say -- and that's O.K.''     "
"In Hacking, Russia Is Accused of Playing in American Politics","WASHINGTON -- An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election? Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered.    But the release on Friday of some 20,000 stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders, has intensified discussion of the role of Russian intelligence agencies in disrupting the 2016 campaign.   The emails, released first by a supposed hacker and later by WikiLeaks, exposed the degree to which the Democratic apparatus favored Hillary Clinton over her primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and triggered the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the party chairwoman, on the eve of the convention's first day.    Proving the source of a cyberattack is notoriously difficult. But researchers have concluded that the national committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies, which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyberoperations at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year. And metadata from the released emails suggests that the documents passed through Russian computers. Though a hacker claimed responsibility for giving the emails to WikiLeaks, the same agencies are the prime suspects. Whether the thefts were ordered by Mr. Putin, or just carried out by apparatchiks who thought they might please him, is anyone's guess.   On Sunday morning, the issue erupted, as Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, argued on ABC's ''This Week'' that the emails were leaked ''by the Russians for the purpose of helping Donald Trump'' citing ''experts'' but offering no other evidence. Mr. Mook also suggested that the Russians might have good reason to support Mr. Trump: The Republican nominee indicated in an interview with The New York Times last week that he might not back NATO nations if they came under attack from Russia -- unless he was first convinced that the countries had made sufficient contributions to the Atlantic alliance.   It was a remarkable moment: Even at the height of the Cold War, it was hard to find a presidential campaign willing to charge that its rival was essentially secretly doing the bidding of a key American adversary. But the accusation is emerging as a theme of Mrs. Clinton's campaign, as part of an attempt to portray Mr. Trump not only as an isolationist, but also as one who would go soft on confronting Russia as it threatens nations that have shown too much independence from Moscow or, in the case of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, joined NATO.   Mr. Trump has also said he would like to ''get along with Russia'' if he is elected, and complimented Mr. Putin, saying he is more of a leader than President Obama. Mr. Putin has in turn praised Mr. Trump. But Trump campaign officials on Sunday strongly rejected any connections between their candidate and efforts to undermine the Democrats.   ''Are there any ties between Mr. Trump, you or your campaign and Putin and his regime?'' George Stephanopoulos, of ''This Week,'' asked Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's campaign chairman.   ''No, there are not,'' Mr. Manafort shot back. ''That's absurd. And, you know, there's no basis to it.''   One of Mr. Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., was more definitive, charging the Clinton camp with a smear campaign. ''I can't think of bigger lies,'' he said on CNN. The younger Mr. Trump mockingly suggested that Mr. Mook's ''house cat at home once said this is what happened with the Russians.''   It may take months, or years, to figure out the motives of those who stole the emails, and more important, whether they were being commanded by Russian authorities, and specifically by Mr. Putin. But the theft from the national committee would be among the most important state-sponsored hacks yet of an American organization, rivaled only by the attacks on the Office of Personnel Management by state-sponsored Chinese hackers, and the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which Mr. Obama blamed on North Korea. There, too, embarrassing emails were released, but they had no political significance. The WikiLeaks release, however, has more of a tinge of Russian-style information war, in which the intent of the revelations is to alter political events. Exactly how, though, is a bit of a mystery, apart from embarrassing Democrats and further alienating Mr. Sanders's supporters from Mrs. Clinton.   Evidence so far suggests that the attack was the work of at least two separate agencies, each apparently working without the knowledge that the other was inside the Democrats' computers. It is unclear how WikiLeaks obtained the email trove. But the presumption is that the intelligence agencies turned it over, either directly or through an intermediary. Moreover, the timing of the release, between the end of the Republican convention and the beginning of the Democratic one, seems too well planned to be coincidental.   Mr. Trump himself leapt on the news after the WikiLeaks release on Saturday. In a Twitter message he wrote: ''Leaked emails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED.''   The experts cited by Mr. Mook include CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that was brought into the Democratic National Committee when officials there suspected they had been hacked.   In mid-June the company announced that the intruders appeared to include a group it had previously identified by the name ''Cozy Bear'' or ''APT 29'' and been inside the committee's servers for a year. A second group, ''Fancy Bear,'' also called ''APT 28,'' came into the system in April. It appears to be operated by the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service, according to federal investigators and private cybersecurity firms. The first group is particularly well known to the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence unit, the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies. It was identified by federal investigators as the likely culprit behind years of intrusions into the State Department and White House unclassified computer system.   Russian intelligence agencies went to great lengths to cover their tracks, investigators found, including meticulously deleting logs, and changing the time stamps of the stolen files.   Officials at several other firms that have examined the code for the malware used against the Democratic National Committee and the metadata of the stolen documents found evidence that the documents had been accessed by multiple computers, some with Russian language settings. Moscow has outsourced politically motivated hacking to outside groups in the past. A crippling attack on Estonia in 2007, for example, was attributed to the pro-Kremlin Nashi youth organization. Intelligence officials and security researchers believe this outsourcing is done, in part, to preserve a measure of plausible deniability.   Intrusions for intelligence collection are hardly unusual, and the United States often does the same, stealing emails and other secrets from intelligence services and even political parties. But the release to WikiLeaks adds another strange element, because it suggests that the intelligence findings are being ''weaponized'' -- used to influence the election in some way. The story has another level of intrigue involving Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's campaign chairman. Working through his lobbying firm, Mr. Manafort was one of several American advisers to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the Russian-backed leader of Ukraine until he was forced out of office two years ago. Mr. Yanukovych was a key Putin ally who is now in exile in Russia.   In April, asked on Fox News about his relationship with Mr. Yanukovych, Mr. Manafort said he was simply trying to help the Ukrainians build a democracy that could align more closely with the United States and its allies.

"Russia, Suspected in Hacking, Has Uneasy History With Hillary Clinton","PHILADELPHIA -- Follow along with our coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Donald J. Trump's apparent endorsement on Wednesday of Russian cyberspying against Hillary Clinton has pulled President Vladimir V. Putin fully into the American political fray. But Mr. Putin's relationship with Mrs. Clinton has been tense at least since 2011, when, as secretary of state, she accused him of rigging an election and he accused her of meddling in Russian politics.    Mr. Putin -- who was then the prime minister, plotting his return to the presidency -- said her words were a ''signal'' to protesters, encouraging them to take to the streets, which they did in large numbers. Her remarks also annoyed the White House, which at that time still clung to the hope that President Obama's policy of ''resetting'' relations with Russia could be salvaged.   That episode, late in Mrs. Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, is important to understanding why Mr. Putin's government could have a motive for hacking into the Democratic National Committee's computers and leaking emails to damage her electoral prospects against Mr. Trump.    But it also speaks to the hard-line stance toward Russia and Mr. Putin that Mrs. Clinton staked out in the Obama administration. At the same time that she was condemning Russia over its elections, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was planning to travel to Moscow to meet Mr. Putin; her harsh words complicated his diplomacy.   Above all, the bitter exchange attests to a combustible relationship between two ambitious, self-confident leaders, both unafraid to exercise power -- one a former K.G.B. officer who emerged from the shadows; the other a famous female politician who spent decades on the public stage.   ''In our administration, Secretary Clinton always had a tougher line toward Putin and the Russians than other senior administration officials,'' said Michael A. McFaul, an adviser on Russia who served as United States ambassador to Moscow. ''It was Putin's strong belief that we, with Clinton in the lead, were trying to meddle with his regime.''   It was one of several instances where Mrs. Clinton was more hawkish than her boss -- differences the White House and the Clinton campaign have so far played down but which may loom larger in the general election. Certainly, Mrs. Clinton has been open in saying she would push back harder than Mr. Obama has against Mr. Putin's aggression in Ukraine and Syria.   Mrs. Clinton's first meeting with Mr. Putin as secretary of state set the stage for a stormy relationship. When she went to see him in his dacha outside Moscow on March 19, 2010, he kept her waiting in front of a ceramic mantelpiece, facing a forest of cameras and boom microphones.   Mr. Putin finally turned up for what was billed as a brief photo opportunity, only to lecture her in front of the reporters about how the United States needed to lift sanctions against American companies doing business in Iran. And when Mrs. Clinton started to defend the Obama administration's policy, he promptly ordered the news media out of the room.   Mrs. Clinton laughed off the episode, telling reporters what has become an oft-repeated story about their relationship. ''Prime Minister Putin,'' she recalled asking him amid his harangue about trade policy, ''tell me about what you're doing to save the tigers in Siberia.''   Eyes brightening, Mr. Putin motioned her to his private office downstairs, where he showed her a map of Russia. Pointing to various regions, he delivered a fervent lecture about endangered tigers and polar bears. He asked her whether Bill Clinton would go on a bear-tagging expedition with him in Siberia. If Bill was not available, he said, maybe Hillary would go?   Diplomats traveling with her were impressed. ''It's like he sizes somebody up and sees them as a worthy adversary or counterpart,'' said William J. Burns, a former ambassador to Moscow who served as Mrs. Clinton's deputy at the State Department. ''I've seen him with other people who he didn't see that way, and he'd be much more dismissive and snarky.''   In retrospect, though, the meeting planted the seeds for future tensions. Eight months later, Mrs. Clinton canceled her attendance at a meeting he organized in St. Petersburg to save the tigers. Her excuse was that she had to stay in Washington to lobby the Senate to ratify a new arms reduction treaty.   A year later, Mrs. Clinton was traveling in Lithuania when reports of ballot tampering and other fraud emerged after parliamentary elections in Russia. ''The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,'' she said in a statement, drafted by her spokeswoman, Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat and Soviet expert known for her sharp-edged views about Russia.   ''Putin was livid that she had spoken out,'' Mr. McFaul said.   High-ranking Russian officials even called the White House to ask whether she was speaking for the United States. That created a tempest in the West Wing, since Mr. McFaul had signed off on Mrs. Clinton's statement. Although the president was also skeptical of Mr. Putin's intentions, he, too, had hoped to keep the reset policy alive a little longer.   There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had any regrets. Shortly before she left the State Department, she asked her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, to draft a three-and-a-half-page exit memo from her to Mr. Obama, warning him that the reset policy was dead, that relations with Russia would deteriorate under Mr. Putin and that the United States needed to push back hard.   Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said they were confident she would pursue such a strategy as president. Mr. Trump's latest comments -- in which he said he hoped Russia would find and expose thousands of emails that Mrs. Clinton did not hand over to the State Department -- only highlighted the chasm between their positions, according to these aides.   ''What Trump said today is reckless and demonstrates he is unfit for the Oval Office,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, a former top State Department official and foreign-policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton. He said that he was confident that Mrs. Clinton would strongly defend the interests of the United States and its allies against any aggression by Mr. Putin.   By 2014, after Russia had annexed Crimea and sent its tanks and troops to menace Ukraine, Mrs. Clinton's exit memo to the president looked prescient. Speaking at a Democratic fund-raiser in California in March 2014, she likened Mr. Putin's behavior to Hitler's conquest of the Sudetenland in 1938.   When Mr. Putin was asked about that comparison by a French television station three months later, he replied: ''It's better not to argue with women. Ms. Clinton had never been too graceful in her statements.''

Hacking of Democrats' Emails Raises Worrisome Question of What's Next,"Follow Amanda Taub on Twitter @amandataub . If Russia was indeed behind last week's leak of stolen data from the Democratic National Committee, we may be seeing one of the most sordid tools of its domestic politics deployed as a hostile weapon in foreign policy. There is a Russian word for this practice: ''kompromat.'' A portmanteau of the Russian words for ''compromising'' and ''material,'' it refers to the timeworn tradition of obtaining information and using it to smear or influence public officials. Unscrupulous Russian politicians have been doing it for decades; there are kompromat websites (which, unsurprisingly, are often blocked or harassed).    The way it works is simple. First, Kremlin insiders or other powerful individuals buy, steal or manufacture incriminating information about an opponent, an enemy, or any other person who poses a threat to powerful interests. Then, they publish it, destroying the target's reputation in order to settle public scores or manipulate public events.   If American officials and analysts are correct in their assessment that Russia was behind this spring's hack of the Democratic National Committee's computer servers, it seems that kompromat is being translated to the international stage.    The United States has had plenty of experience with hackers, government and otherwise, but the D.N.C. hack is something new. Rather than using the information seized for intelligence purposes, the hackers selected damaging excerpts from the cache of stolen data, and then leaked them at a pivotal moment in the presidential election.   And analysts are worried that such activity could soon become a routine element of geopolitics.   ''This is not just about the United States, it is not just about Trump or Clinton, or just about American democracy,'' said Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies at King's College London. ''If they consider this a success, they may conclude that, 'Of course, we can do this elsewhere. We can do this again. We can probably also find things, kompromat, on the next president.' ''   Risks with leaks   The history of kompromat in Russia shows how damaging this practice can be to democracy and the rule of law.   A 2008 article in Wired, for instance, detailed how the Kremlin leaked footage of a well-known broadcaster at an orgy to a website, apparently in order to relieve the Russian government of a prominent news media critic. In another case, leaked surveillance video showed a prosecutor investigating high-level official corruption frolicking in bed with two young prostitutes. (The investigation eventually died.)   The term may be Russian, but kompromat is not limited to the country's borders. Chinese officials and businessmen, for instance, have long been rumored to spy on their personal and professional rivals, searching for information that could be used to discredit them.   For instance, Bo Xilai, a senior party official who was jailed for corruption in 2013, reportedly wiretapped a call by China's president at the time, Hu Jintao, as part of a widespread surveillance operation that gathered information on party leaders and other powerful individuals, to aid in Mr. Bo's political ambitions.   Last week's leak of data stolen from the Democratic National Committee fits that pattern, only now it is playing out in a new arena -- in an attack by one state against the political system of another.   A future of hacking   To be sure, history offers numerous examples of countries, including the United States, meddling in one another's elections. But although the aims may not be new, these technological methods and their potential consequences are.   The D.N.C. leak shows that kompromat need not reveal anything illegal to be damaging: The party's chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to step down after party officials were shown to have taken sides during the primaries. This sets a precedent in which virtually anyone who uses email or social media could be vulnerable to any state or private group with a grudge and access to hackers.   The Chinese and Russians are used to these tactics to settle political and business rivalries. The D.N.C. hack, in exporting kompromat abroad, has established a precedent that may tempt other hackers foreign and domestic, state-sponsored and private.   Because technology makes hacks easier to start than to counter, the risk is difficult to overcome. And anyone with money or expertise can undertake a hack, particularly against nonstate targets that have weaker security systems, and often with little risk of being caught because the attack can be denied.   ''In counterintelligence before, there was a kind of granularity of targeting individuals,'' said Adam Segal, who studies cybersecurity at the Council on Foreign Relations and is the author of ''The Hacked World Order.'' ''And now with digital technology, you can do that with a scope and scale you couldn't have done before.''   In the past, he pointed out, someone who wanted to obtain lurid details of an adversary's sex life would have had to set up a ''honey trap'' operation and then photograph the target in flagrante. ''But now if you break into someone's email,'' Mr. Segal noted, ''you can find a message that 'so-and-so is an idiot,' or their porn history'' -- private, personal information that could be tremendously embarrassing or discrediting if released.   In that climate, everyone who has something to lose, has enemies, or is a public figure is susceptible to this kind of reputational destruction. The higher a person climbs, the greater the risk becomes -- and the greater temptation to a rival.   How to respond   More attacks may already be on the way. Last year, the federal Office of Personnel Management announced that hackers had breached its computers and stolen vast quantities of data gathered for security clearances and background checks.   Mr. Segal said that the stolen data included information on government employees' sex lives, relationships, finances, contacts with foreign governments and other private details.   The data, which goes back to 1985, was gathered so that American counterintelligence officers could assess employees' vulnerability to blackmail. But that well-intentioned project may have ended up conveniently cataloging their most vulnerable points for the hackers.   And on Friday, federal law enforcement officials revealed that computer systems used by the Clinton campaign had also been hacked in an attack that appeared to have come from Russia's intelligence services.   Government offices and political organizations are hardly the only targets.   In 2014, North Korea hacked Sony Pictures in retaliation for its release of the film ''The Interview,'' a comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. The released emails included information on salaries, Amazon receipts for a network executive's personal-grooming products, and plenty of embarrassing and offensive conversations. It damaged reputations and careers.   Analysts said hacking is likely to expand in the realm of foreign policy by giving states a new, low-risk method to tweak one another or to meddle in one another's internal affairs. State-sponsored hacks meant to weaponize information are relatively inexpensive and difficult to defend against, making them a tempting tool.   But it is precisely their appeal that gives these tactics the potential to make the international arena more volatile. It is hard to determine responsibility, which creates a risk that states will punish the wrong culprit -- or respond too harshly, forcing an unintended cycle of escalation.   Because there are no established norms for what is and is not tolerated in such attacks, or for how a targeted state is expected to respond, even the prospect of this kind of hacking creates dangerous uncertainty.   This practice is beyond the reach or enforcement of most laws, and outside the scope of the norms that limit states' interference in one another's affairs. And because effective defense is so difficult, it is hard to predict what the limits -- or the consequences -- of that might be.     "
Russian Spies Said to Hack Clinton's Bid,"WASHINGTON -- Computer systems used by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign were hacked in an attack that appears to have come from Russia's intelligence services, a federal law enforcement official said on Friday. The apparent breach, coming after the disclosure last month that the Democratic National Committee's computer system had been compromised, escalates an international episode in which Clinton campaign officials have suggested that Russia might be trying to sway the outcome of the election.    Mrs. Clinton's campaign said in a statement that intruders had gained access to an analytics program used by the campaign and maintained by the national committee, but it said that it did not believe that the campaign's own internal computer systems had been compromised.    The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm for House Democrats, also said on Friday that its systems had been hacked. Together, the databases of the national committee and the House organization contain some of the party's most sensitive communications and voter and financial data.   Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the congressional committee, said that after it discovered the breach, ''we immediately took action and engaged with CrowdStrike, a leading forensic investigator, to assist us in addressing this incident.''   The attack on the congressional committee's system appears to have come from an entity known as ''Fancy Bear,'' which is connected to the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service, according to an official involved in the forensic investigation.   The same arm of Russia's intelligence operation was also implicated in the attack on the national committee, in which it gained access to opposition research on Republicans, including the party's presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump.   ''It's the same adversary,'' the official involved in the forensic investigation said. ''These are sophisticated actors.''   The F.B.I. said on Friday that it was examining reports of ''cyberintrusions involving multiple political entities'' but did not identify the targets of the attacks.   The Clinton campaign used the program that was hacked to analyze voter data, but it did not contain voters' Social Security numbers or credit card information, a campaign aide said. The campaign said it was confident, based on a review by outside experts, that getting into the program would not have allowed the hackers to gain access to the campaign's internal emails, voice mail messages or other data.   The reports of attacks against Democratic Party organizations began in mid-June, when the Democratic National Committee said its computer systems had been breached by two groups of Russian hackers working for competing government intelligence agencies. After that breach, WikiLeaks last week released some 20,000 committee emails, many of them embarrassing to Democratic officials, which led Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, to resign as the group's leader.   WikiLeaks' founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he hopes to harm Mrs. Clinton's chances of winning the presidency, opposing her candidacy on both policy and personal grounds. He has said that he has more material about the presidential campaign that he could release, which has raised the specter of more embarrassing disclosures just as Democrats try to capitalize on the momentum coming out of their convention this week.   American intelligence agencies have told the White House they have ''high confidence'' that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee. But it is unclear whether the break-in was fairly routine espionage or part of an effort to manipulate the election.   The attacks on the Clinton campaign and the Democratic congressional committee were first reported by Reuters.   It is unclear whether the reported breaches at the national committee, the Clinton campaign and the congressional committee were part of a single coordinated attack or a series of attacks aimed at the Democrats, said the law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   In a statement, the F.B.I. said that it ''is aware of media reporting on cyberintrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters.''   Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement that ''an analytics data program maintained by the D.N.C., and used by our campaign and a number of other entities, was accessed as part of the D.N.C. hack.''   ''Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cybersecurity experts,'' he added. ''To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised.''   The hacks have added another unexpected wrinkle to the presidential campaign, with Mr. Trump asking Russia this week to ''find'' some 30,000 deleted emails from Mrs. Clinton's days as secretary of state. (That statement, made well after the cyberattacks on the Democratic organizations, was called borderline treasonous by some Democrats, and Mr. Trump later said that he was being sarcastic.)   Clinton campaign officials have suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia could be trying to tilt the election to Mr. Trump, who has expressed admiration for the Russian leader. But the campaign officials acknowledge that they have no evidence. The Trump campaign has dismissed the accusations about Russia as a deliberate distraction.   The C.I.A. director, John O. Brennan, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, declined to comment on the specific allegations but said that ''obviously, interference in the U.S. election process is a very, very serious matter, and I think certainly this government would treat it with great seriousness.''

Wider Damage Seen in Hack of Democrats,"WASHINGTON -- A Russian cyberattack that targeted Democratic politicians was bigger than it first appeared and breached the private email accounts of more than 100 party officials and groups, officials with knowledge of the case said Wednesday. The widening scope of the attack has prompted the F.B.I. to broaden its investigation, and agents have begun notifying a long list of Democratic officials that the Russians may have breached their personal accounts.    The main targets appear to have been the personal email accounts of Hillary Clinton's campaign officials and party operatives, along with a number of party organizations.    Officials have acknowledged that the Russian hackers gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is the fund-raising arm for House Democrats, and to the Democratic National Committee, including a D.N.C. voter analytics program used by Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign.   But the hack now appears to have extended well beyond those groups, and organizations like the Democratic Governors' Association may also have been affected, according to Democrats involved in the investigation.   Democrats say they are bracing for the possibility that another batch of damaging or embarrassing internal material could become public before the November presidential election.   The attack has already proved politically damaging. On the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last month, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as D.N.C. chairwoman after WikiLeaks released a trove of hacked internal emails showing party officials eager for Mrs. Clinton to win the nomination over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.   American intelligence agencies have said they have ''high confidence'' that the attack was the work of Russian intelligence agencies. It has injected a heavy dose of international intrigue into an already chaotic presidential campaign as Democrats have alleged that the Russians are trying to help tilt the election toward the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump.   Mr. Trump stunned Democrats and Republicans when he said last month that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. Clinton's email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, although he said later that he was being sarcastic.   Intelligence and law enforcement officials, however, are taking the issue seriously.   F.B.I. officials briefed staff members of House and Senate Intelligence Committees last week on the investigation into the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee. Briefings for other congressional committees are expected in the coming days.   Much of the briefing to the committee staff focused on the fact that American intelligence agencies have virtually no doubt that the Russian government was behind the theft, according to one staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss elements of the confidential briefing.   The extension of the hack's scope beyond the D.N.C. and the House Democratic committee added a troubling new element to the case, the staff member said.   American authorities remain uncertain whether the electronic break-in to the committee's computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage or as part of an effort to manipulate the presidential election.   Russian motives are still an open question, said a federal law enforcement official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.   There is no evidence so far that the theft penetrated the emails of lawmakers or staff members who serve on the Intelligence Committees, two staff members said.   The F.B.I. says it has no direct evidence that Mrs. Clinton's private email server was hacked by the Russians or anyone else. But in June, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that intruders had tried, and that any successful intruders were probably far too skilled to leave evidence of their intrusion behind. Law enforcement officials said he had the Russians in mind.   Mrs. Clinton's aides were concerned about the possibility of an outside breach after a hacker calling himself ''Guccifer'' got into the email account in 2013 of Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime confidante of Mrs. Clinton's who often emailed her on her private server, according to new documents released Wednesday.   Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer and adviser for Mrs. Clinton, said she discussed the 2013 hack with the technician who ran Mrs. Clinton's private server and considered ''whether this event might affect Secretary Clinton's email,'' according to a written account Ms. Mills provided to Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group that is suing the State Department.   So far, it does not appear that the Russian hackers sought or gained access to any computer systems used by Mr. Trump, who is known to avoid email, officials said.   Since news of the D.N.C. hack broke in June, a number of Democratic organizations have been scrubbing their files to determine what internal information might have been compromised. They have also been shoring up their cybersecurity defenses to guard against another attack.   An official with the D.N.C., speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committee took the threat very seriously, but would not comment on specific security steps taken.   WikiLeaks, the group that put out the D.N.C. emails publicly last month, interjected itself into the hacking case again this week when it offered a $20,000 reward for information on the shooting death last month of a former D.N.C. staff member, Seth Rich, outside his Washington home. His killing fueled speculation on the internet that he was somehow tied to the hacked emails, but the police have not given any credence to that speculation.   The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he would like to hurt Mrs. Clinton's bid for the White House, opposing her candidacy on policy and personal grounds. He has hinted that he has more material about the presidential campaign that he could release.

Prison Emails Show a Hacker's Bold Plans,"When Alonzo Knowles pleaded guilty in May to hacking into the email accounts of celebrities and athletes, gaining access to unreleased movie and television scripts and trying to sell them for thousands of dollars, he apologized in court, saying he knew what he had done was wrong. But this week federal prosecutors revealed that they had also been reading emails -- Mr. Knowles's. And they say the emails that the Bahamian man sent from jail since his arrest in December portray him as anything but a repentant hacker.     In messages to several women, the government said, Mr. Knowles, 24, seemed to be fixated on gaining notoriety and becoming rich after leaving prison, writing casually that he planned to publish a book and disclose the secrets of the people whose accounts he hacked.   ''When i get out im gon shake up hollywood for real!'' Mr. Knowles wrote in one email.   In another, he bragged about his planned book.   ''Im name dropping everyone involved and what i know,'' he wrote, ''and im including pictures of paperwork that aint public.''   He said he would charge $35 a copy and would hack into people's Twitter accounts to promote it.   ''This gonna be the most talked about thing on tv,'' he wrote, adding, ''Eat a steak for me tomorrow.''   Mr. Knowles's case drew attention after his arrest because it followed the widely publicized hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and also because it showed how hackers could obtain confidential information from celebrities by targeting the accounts of their friends. Mr. Knowles, in a conversation with an undercover agent, called this process ''social engineering.''   He then hacked the friends' accounts to obtain the celebrities' phone numbers and other information, he told the agent, who was posing as a potential buyer of the unreleased scripts, according to a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. It says Mr. Knowles showed the agent a list of names, with phone numbers or email addresses of about 130 celebrities.   Mr. Knowles was arrested after he came to New York and tried to sell the unreleased scripts to the agent, who handed him $80,000 in cash, according to the complaint. He also gave the agent the Social Security numbers of a movie actress and three professional athletes, the complaint says. He pleaded guilty to charges of identity theft and criminal copyright infringement. He is to be sentenced next month.   In a memo filed on Thursday, the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, asked the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer, to impose a substantial sentence, in excess of the 27 to 33 months suggested under federal guidelines. ''It is clear,'' a prosecutor, Kristy J. Greenberg, wrote, ''that Knowles has learned absolutely nothing from this case.''   Mr. Knowles, in his own letter to the judge, filed in mid-August, said he felt the ''upmost regret and remorse'' for his actions. His lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, also writing to the judge in mid-August, asked that his client, who is being detained at a federal facility in Brooklyn, be sentenced to the roughly eight months he has served since his arrest.   Mr. Kaminsky, who could not be reached for comment on Friday, said in his letter that Mr. Knowles had used his time in jail ''to reflect on his offense, make use of the limited educational opportunities available and plan for the future.''   But prosecutors wrote that Mr. Knowles's emails showed ''that he is anxious to get out of jail so that he can go right back to making money by exploiting celebrities.'' The government memo included copies of some of the emails, with redactions. It shows that they were sent on a Bureau of Prisons email system that inmates may use after they consent to having their messages monitored.   Prosecutors also told the judge that Mr. Knowles had refused to turn over a computer that ''clearly contains valuable information about celebrities from which Knowles believes he can profit handsomely.''   ''I wanna co-operate and give these people my computer,'' Mr. Knowles noted in another email, ''but i think its worth risking the extra year not doing it'' -- apparently an acknowledgment that his refusal might produce a stiffer sentence.   ''These people dont want me to be a millionaire,'' Mr. Knowles wrote. ''They want me be a loser and not be able to afford women like you lol.''   As for his planned book, he said in a different email, he was not trying to ''expose people.'' Rather, he wrote, ''its just to make money.''   ''Everyone loves gossip,'' he added. ''I cant wait to get out i already know how the cover is gonna look.''     "
Russian Bid to Affect U.S. Voting Is Suggested,"The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, asked the F.B.I. on Monday to investigate evidence suggesting that Russia may try to manipulate voting results in November. In a letter to the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., Mr. Reid wrote that the threat of Russian interference ''is more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results.'' Recent classified briefings from senior intelligence officials, Mr. Reid said in an interview, have left him fearful that President Vladimir V. Putin's ''goal is tampering with this election.''    News reports on Monday said the F.B.I. warned state election officials several weeks ago that foreign hackers had exported voter registration data from computer systems in at least one state, and had pierced the systems of a second one.    The bureau did not name the states, but Yahoo News, which first reported the confidential F.B.I. warning, said they were Arizona and Illinois. Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona's secretary of state, said the F.B.I. had told state officials that Russians were behind the Arizona attack.   After the F.B.I. warning, Arizona took its voter registration database offline from June 28 to July 8 to allow for a forensic exam of its systems, Mr. Roberts said.   The F.B.I., in its notice to states, said the voter information had been ''exfiltrated,'' which means that it was shipped out of the state systems to another computer. But it does not mean that the data itself was tampered with.   It is unclear whether the hackers intended to affect the election or pursued the data for other purposes, like gaining personal identifying information about voters. The F.B.I. warning referred to ''targeting activity'' against state boards of elections, but did not discuss the intent of the hackers.   ''That incident was only a small part of what disturbed me,'' Mr. Reid said on Monday.   In his letter to the F.B.I., he offered no specifics about how Russian hackers could manipulate election data, an effort made harder by the varying vote-tallying procedures in each state.   But the prospect of election tampering has been discussed since the revelation that two Russian intelligence agencies, the F.S.B. and the G.R.U., were believed to be responsible for the hacking of the networks of the Democratic National Committee.   Emails published by a hacker who called himself Guccifer 2.0 -- believed to be an alias for Russian hackers linked to the intelligence agencies -- revealed that the committee had denigrated the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.   The disclosures led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committee's chairwoman.   Mr. Reid's accusation that Russia is seeking not only to influence the election with propaganda but also to tamper with the vote counting goes significantly beyond anything the Obama administration has said in public.   While intelligence agencies have told the White House that they have ''high confidence'' that Russian intelligence services were behind the hacking of the Democratic committee, the administration has not leveled any accusations against Mr. Putin's government. Asked about that in the interview, Mr. Reid said he was free to say things the president was not.   But Mr. Reid argued that the connections between some of Donald J. Trump's former and current advisers and the Russian leadership should, by itself, prompt an investigation. He referred indirectly in his letter to a speech given in Russia by one Trump adviser, Carter Page, a consultant and investor in the energy giant Gazprom, who criticized American sanctions policy toward Russia.   ''Trump and his people keep saying the election is rigged,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Why is he saying that? Because people are telling him the election can be messed with.'' Mr. Trump's advisers say they are concerned that unnamed elites could rig the election for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.   Mr. Reid argued that if Russia concentrated on ''less than six'' swing states, it could alter results and undermine confidence in the electoral system. That would pose challenges, given that most states have paper backups, but he noted that hackers could keep people from voting by tampering with the rolls of eligible voters.     "
Tim Kaine Compares Donald Trump's Comments on Russian Hacking to Watergate Scandal,"Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia on Sunday compared Donald J. Trump's encouragement of Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails to the Watergate scandal, which led to President Richard M. Nixon's resignation. Mr. Kaine, Mrs. Clinton's running mate, made the remarks on ABC's ''This Week'' while he was being questioned about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, an issue that has dogged her throughout her campaign.    Mr. Kaine used the moment to attack Mr. Trump's refusal to release his income tax returns and to attack his comments this summer that Russia should make public anything they might have stolen from Mrs. Clinton's emails, remarks he made in the wake of the disclosure that hackers had accessed emails from the Democratic National Committee.    ''He has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyberhacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyberattack on the D.N.C. was likely done by Russia,'' Mr. Kaine said of Mr. Trump on Sunday.   ''A president was impeached and had to resign over an attack on the D.N.C. during a presidential election in 1972,'' Mr. Kaine added, referring to the Watergate scandal. ''This is serious business. So contrast the Hillary situation, where the F.B.I. said there's no need for legal proceedings, with an attack that is being encouraged by Donald Trump on the D.N.C. by Russia, similar to what led to resignation of a president 30 years ago.''   During a news conference in July, Mr. Trump said he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. Clinton's email.   ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,'' Mr. Trump said at the time. ''I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.''   Mr. Kaine wasn't the only candidate to invoke Mr. Nixon's name in an attack. In a taped interview with NBC's ''Meet the Press'' that aired Sunday, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump's running mate, called Mrs. Clinton ''the most dishonest candidate for president of the United States since Richard Nixon.''   Yet Mr. Pence also opened the door for more criticism of Mr. Trump by vowing to release his own income tax returns within the next week.   Mr. Trump has refused to release his own returns, but Mr. Pence said his running mate would eventually disclose them as well, although he did not say when that might happen. Last week The Washington Post revealed that Mr. Trump had to pay a $2,500 penalty to the I.R.S. because his charitable foundation had made an improper political donation.   On CNN's ''State of the Union,'' Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has become one of Mr. Trump's closest advisers, suggested that Mr. Trump had backed away in his speech on Wednesday from his proposal to carry out mass deportations of people who are in the country illegally.   Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump's speech ''leaves a very big opening for what will happen with the people who remain here in the United States after the criminals are removed and after the border is secure.''   ''Donald Trump, as he expressed in one of his interviews recently, would find it very, very difficult to throw out a family that's been here for, you know, 15 years and they have three children, two of whom are citizens,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''That is not the kind of America he wants.''

Pelosi Urges Ryan to Bar Republicans From Using Hacked Material,"WASHINGTON -- Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, sent a letter on Tuesday to Speaker Paul D. Ryan urging him to bar Republicans from using hacked documents in the campaign, arguing that ''defending our democracy is more important than any advantage or disadvantage in this election.'' Ms. Pelosi, calling the hack into Democratic servers, apparently by Russians, ''an unprecedented assault on the sanctity of our democratic process,'' said Mr. Ryan should not condone either party using materials originating from the cybercrime.     ''Democrats and Republicans must present a united front in the face of Russia's attempts to tamper with the will of the American people,'' Ms. Pelosi wrote.   Government officials have concluded that two Russian intelligence agencies, the F.S.B. and the G.R.U., are responsible for the hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the House Democratic campaign arm. Emails and other internal documents have been published by a hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0, who is believed to be tied to the Russian intelligence agencies.   Mr. Ryan's aides referred questions about Ms. Pelosi's request to the House Republican campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee. A spokeswoman for the committee did not rule out using hacked content, but disclaimed responsibility for the one instance it had happened thus far.   ''Neither the N.R.C.C.'s chairman, Greg Walden, nor the speaker have control over what our independent expenditure unit does, which the D.C.C.C. chairman, Ben Ray Lujan, as well as Leader Pelosi are well aware of,'' said the spokeswoman, Katie Martin, referring to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.   To date, the only hacked documents to surface have come from the internal servers of Democratic committees, an indication that only one of America's two major political parties is being targeted. Already, the hacks revealed that the Democratic National Committee favored Hillary Clinton and discussed ways to undermine Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in its presidential primary, disclosures that led to the resignation of the party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz.   While alarmed at what is being exposed, Democrats also sense an opportunity to use the cybercrime to link Republicans to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. It is a task that has been made easier by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, who has frequently praised Mr. Putin, called to improve relations with Moscow and urged Mr. Putin's government to hack into Mrs. Clinton's emails.   On Monday night, Mrs. Clinton told reporters that Russia's intrusion represented ''a threat from an adversarial foreign power,'' and cited ''credible reports about Russian interference in our elections.''   And last week, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, went even further, sending a letter to the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, urging him to investigate Russian interference that ''may include the intent to falsify official election results.''   By asking Mr. Ryan to effectively declare hacked documents politically off limits, Ms. Pelosi is attempting to force him to choose between being seen as abetting the cybercrime of a hostile power and leaving potentially fruitful material unused. House Republicans have already seized on one of the hacked documents, releasing a digital ad last month that cited a House Democratic memo posted by Guccifer 2.0 that outlined the potential vulnerabilities of a Democratic candidate in Florida.   The posting of House Democratic documents relating to the Florida races was apparently meant to correspond to the state's primaries last week. While no Republican leaders have pledged not to use hacked materials, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, recently said that the hack was ''not right'' and that he was ''not on board with whatever they did to steal this information.''   For his part, Mr. Putin has denied that his government was responsible for the hacking but has made no effort to conceal his pleasure about the disclosures.   ''Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?'' Mr. Putin said in a Bloomberg News interview last week. ''The important thing is the content that was given to the public.''     "
Vengeful Russian Hackers Leak Medical Files of Top U.S. Athletes,"Russian hackers -- possibly the same group that compromised the Democratic National Committee's computer servers -- have made top American athletes their latest target. Joining an intercontinental dispute over sports doping, the hackers penetrated the World Anti-Doping Agency's athlete database and publicly revealed private medical information about three of the United States' most famous athletes: Serena Williams, Venus Williams and Simone Biles.    The hackers published documents this week showing that Ms. Biles, who won four gold medals in gymnastics at the Rio Olympics last month, and the Williams sisters received medical exemptions to use banned drugs.    The antidoping agency confirmed the authenticity of the documents in a statement Tuesday, attributing the hack to Fancy Bear, a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics specialists have tied to breaches against government agencies, nonprofit organizations and corporations. That group is believed to be associated with G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence agency suspected of involvement in the recent theft of emails and documents from the D.N.C.   ''These criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global antidoping community to re-establish trust in Russia,'' WADA's director general, Olivier Niggli, said Tuesday, referring to revelations of elaborate government-ordered doping by Russia that prompted more than 100 of the country's athletes to be barred from the Rio Games.   The hackers wrote on their website that the United States had ''played well but not fair'' in Rio de Janeiro, and the medical documents were hailed in Russia on Tuesday as evidence of both widespread doping among American athletes and the double standards of global antidoping regulators.   Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, said that the Kremlin was not involved in the hacks. ''It's simply ruled out,'' Mr. Peskov said.   Russia has gone to to great lengths to maintain plausible deniability in matters of espionage. The Kremlin often delegates high-profile political attacks to third parties, such as in the case of a 2007 attack on Estonia, according to one classified American intelligence estimate.   On their website, the hackers claimed to be both members of Anonymous, the global hacking collective, and Fancy Bear, which typically works in extreme stealth and takes great measures to cover its tracks. Those two groups have not been aligned before.   Revenge, apparently, motivated the WADA hacks. In May, The New York Times reported the account of Russia's longtime antidoping lab chief, who said the country had run a doping program and staged an elaborate cheating scheme at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. A subsequent report commissioned by WADA confirmed that account.   The United States Anti-Doping Agency said that the American athletes in question had sought the requisite approvals to take typically prohibited substances, and that none of the positive drug tests constituted a violation.   The drugs mentioned in the documents are commonly prescribed medications that treat ailments including pain and allergies. The Times is not identifying the drugs for privacy reasons.   Ms. Biles acknowledged on Tuesday that she was prescribed medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. ''Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing that I'm afraid to let people know,'' she wrote on Twitter.   Athletes with particular medical conditions may apply for special permission to take banned substances, requiring a doctor's diagnosis and the approval of sports authorities. The WADA list of prohibited drugs -- including a range of substances, from cannabis to attention-deficit disorder drugs to anabolic steroids -- is updated each year.   In 2016, meldonium -- a heart medication that improves blood flow -- was added to that list, resulting in infractions for several Russian athletes, including the tennis star Maria Sharapova. (Ms. Sharapova, who said she was unaware the drug had been banned, was barred from competition for two years. She appealed that decision at an arbitration hearing in New York this month, and awaits a verdict in October.)   The records published by the hackers showed that at the Rio Games, Ms. Biles tested positive for a prohibited substance used to treat A.D.H.D. that she had received permission to take.   U.S.A. Gymnastics officials said Ms. Biles's drug use had been approved. ''Simone has filed the proper paperwork,'' said Steve Penny, the organization's president. ''Simone and everyone at U.S.A. Gymnastics believe in the importance of a level playing field for all athletes.''   The International Tennis Federation confirmed on Tuesday that it, too, had approved exceptions for Serena and Venus Williams to take banned substances in recent years.   ''In each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication,'' said Travis T. Tygart, Usada's president. ''It's unthinkable that in the Olympic movement, hackers would illegally obtain confidential medical information in an attempt to smear athletes to make it look as if they have done something wrong.''   WADA said its management system was infiltrated through the so-called ''spearphishing'' of email accounts, in which attackers send tailored emails to authorized users to convince them to click on malicious links or attachments that give attackers a toehold onto their machines. The agency said the attackers used that unauthorized access to gain entry through an International Olympic Committee account that was set up for the Rio Games.   Law enforcement authorities determined that the attacks originated in Russia, WADA said.   This week's hack came in the wake of revelations about the hacking of the WADA account of the Russian whistle-blower Yuliya Stepanova, a middle-distance runner who fled the country and is now living in an undisclosed location in the United States. That account contained her whereabouts.   Ms. Stepanova said last month that she feared for her safety, and that she and her husband -- a former employee of Russia's antidoping agency who has also spoken publicly about the country's systematic doping -- had moved to a new address as a result.   The hackers said Tuesday that they planned to release the medical records of additional athletes from around the world in coming days.   ''This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' a statement posted to the Fancy Bears site said. ''Today's sport is truly contaminated while the world is unaware of the large number of American doping athletes.''     "
Thai Court Finds British Labor Activist Guilty of Defamation,"Follow Mike Ives on Twitter @mikeives . HONG KONG -- A Thai court on Tuesday found a British labor activist guilty of defamation and computer crimes, a verdict that some experts and rights advocates predicted would harm efforts to protect migrant workers in Southeast Asia. The activist, Andy Hall, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined about $4,300 in connection with his work on a 2013 report by a Finnish advocacy group that accused Natural Fruit, based in Thailand, of violating its workers' rights.    But the court suspended the sentence for two years. That means Mr. Hall is effectively on probation and will go free if he commits no crimes during that time, said Sonja Vartiala, executive director of the advocacy group, Finnwatch.    Human rights advocates said Tuesday that the case would impede efforts to investigate corporate supply chains in Thailand. Rights groups and Western governments have accused Thailand of failing to prevent widespread abuses of migrant workers, including forced labor.   ''Any company around the world that is concerned about human or labor rights abuses in their supply chain will have to take a real hard look at whether they want to source anything from Thailand going forward,'' Brad Adams, the Asia director for the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, in New York, said in a statement released after the verdict was handed down.   Laurent Meillan, the acting regional representative for the United Nations Human Rights Office for Southeast Asia, called the ruling ''very disturbing.''   ''Instead of prosecuting Mr. Hall, it would have been more appropriate to conduct an independent and thorough investigation into the serious allegations raised in the Finnwatch report,'' Mr. Meillan said in a statement.   Mr. Hall had interviewed migrants who worked at a Natural Fruit pineapple factory for the Finnwatch report, ''Cheap Has a High Price.'' The report said that 700 of the 800 workers at the plant, in southern Thailand, were from Myanmar, and that all of those interviewed were paid less than the minimum wage at the time, which was about $6.90 a day.   Among other reported abuses, the report said that the family of a worker who died from electric shock had received at most 10 percent of the financial compensation required by law. It also said the company had confiscated workers' passports and forced them to pay deposits to get them back for trips home.   The defamation charge against Mr. Hall was based on an interview he had given to Al Jazeera in connection with the report's findings. The computer crimes charge stemmed from claims that he had uploaded confidential communications to Finnwatch's website, which the organization has denied.   Mr. Hall, 36, who has mostly lived in Thailand since 2005, said he planned to appeal the verdict. He said he had expected to be acquitted of all charges because his advocacy work benefited Thai society and migrant workers.   ''I respect the decision of the court, but I'm very disappointed in it,'' he said by telephone after leaving the courthouse in Bangkok.   He later wrote on Twitter that the court had returned his passport, which was confiscated after his indictment. Ms. Vartiala of Finnwatch said Mr. Hall planned to travel to Finland on Thursday.   The British Foreign Office said in an emailed statement that Britain ''supports the right of human rights defenders to raise concerns about human rights violations without fear of reprisals or legal action to prevent public participation.'' It said it would raise Mr. Hall's case with Thailand and offer him support if needed.   Kachin Komneeyawanich, the vice president for Natural Fruit, said Tuesday that he was happy with the verdict, saying that the report had caused ''colossal'' damage to the company's profits and reputation. ''We are fighting for our honor,'' Mr. Kachin said by telephone. ''We thank the court and the justice system for having mercy on us.''   Natural Fruit has filed two civil claims against Mr. Hall seeking damages of about $11.5 million, according to Finnwatch.   Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of international political economy at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said in an email that the ruling ''sends signals to companies in labor-intensive industries that the law is on their side when it comes to labor repression.''   Professor Thitinan also said that the decision appeared to undermine Thailand's efforts to improve its score in a closely watched annual report by the American State Department that assesses countries' efforts to combat human trafficking. The 2016 report, released in June, had placed Thailand in the second lowest tier, up from the lowest.   An advocacy group in Australia, the Walk Free Foundation, estimated this year that about 425,500 people in Thailand, or 0.63 percent of the population, live in ''conditions of modern slavery,'' many of them commercial fishers, domestic workers and prostitutes.

"Email Hack Details Movements of Clinton, Biden and Michelle Obama","WASHINGTON -- Hackers on Thursday posted hundreds of emails from a young Democratic operative that contained documents detailing the minute-by-minute schedules and precise movements of the vice president, the first lady and Hillary Clinton during recent campaign fund-raisers and official political events. The emails included names and cellphone numbers of numerous Secret Service agents, spreadsheets with the names and Social Security numbers of campaign donors, and PowerPoint presentations showing step-by-step directions for where officials like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should walk when they arrived at events.    The hackers who posted the emails also distributed what they claimed was a scanned image of the information page from Michelle Obama's passport, though the authenticity of the image could not be verified.   The emails were stolen from the personal Gmail account of the Democratic operative, Ian Mellul. They reveal how widely White House officials, Clinton campaign operatives and Secret Service agents have exchanged detailed and sensitive information with people using personal email accounts.    There is no indication that Mr. Mellul, 22, who was in effect working as a freelancer when the White House or the Clinton campaign needed help, did anything wrong, and government officials declined to talk about the use of the private account.   About a year and a half's worth of emails from Mr. Mellul's account were posted late Wednesday by the website DCLeaks.com, which earlier this month released a batch of emails from the personal account of Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, in which he voiced his scorn for Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and his personal peeves with Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic opponent.   The newly released emails do not provide specific security details, but they do reveal the types of movements that top political officials make at such events. If emails were hacked before an event, that could present a more serious security issue.   One document instructed Mr. Biden to walk up four steps at a loading dock in Cleveland before climbing 26 steps to a holding room. Another used blue arrows to show the route Mrs. Clinton should walk through a donor's house in Houston. Both documents included close-up pictures of the event locations.   Mr. Mellul, who volunteered to work as an advance staff member for the White House and the Clinton campaign as he finished his undergraduate education at George Washington University in Washington, declined to comment. ''I've got to hang up,'' he said Thursday when reached on his cellphone.   Cathy L. Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, said the agency was ''aware of the alleged email hacking of a White House staffer.   ''Obviously the Secret Service is concerned any time unauthorized information that might pertain to one of the individuals we protect, or our operations, is allegedly disclosed,'' she added.   An F.B.I. spokesman said the bureau was looking into the hacking. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said that officials took ''any reports about a cyberbreach seriously'' and that the episode was ''something we are taking a close look at.''   DCLeaks.com is a relatively new website that has posted documents taken from the accounts of prominent figures like Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the former commander of NATO forces in Europe, and George Soros, a wealthy backer of liberal causes. On the site, its creators describe themselves as American ''hacktivists'' who aim to ''publish a large amount of emails from top-ranking officials and their influence agents all over the world.''   Mr. Mellul hardly fits either description. His low-level job ranks just above that of an intern.   The emails from his account document the often mundane process that White House or campaign staff members go through to prepare for an event, including setting up stages, organizing photo lines, arranging for lecterns and coordinating with the Secret Service about getting clearances for all of the people the politician will encounter along the way.   One email contained a spreadsheet with the names and Social Security numbers of almost 100 people scheduled to attend a Houston fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton. In another exchange, a Secret Service agent discussed how many official ''pins'' would be provided for hotel staff members to have access to an event. After Mr. Mellul said the hotel had requested 50 Secret Service pins, the agent wrote, ''Yikes.''   Several of the emails contain what is referred to as a ''movement document'' or a ''site diagram'' involving the vice president, the first lady or Mrs. Clinton. Those emails were often sent to a large number of people, including Mr. Mellul. In other cases, Mr. Mellul emailed copies of the documents to other campaign or government officials, including Secret Service officials.   ''Good morning all,'' Mr. Mellul wrote on May 20, the day of a Hillary for America fund-raiser. ''Please find the attached site diagram for Houston's H.F.A. finance event this evening. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Ian.''   The emails begin in February 2015, when Mr. Mellul was in the honors program and studying political science. In the messages, Mr. Mellul comes across as a conscientious and courteous young man whose friends would email him for help with their school essays and résumés.   After high school, he jumped into the intern circuit that feeds into entry-level jobs in Washington. In 2014, he received a coveted internship at the White House and later parlayed the connections he had made as an intern into low-level freelance work for the White House.   His tryout, it appears, was helping Mrs. Obama's team at a lunch for congressional spouses on April 15, 2015.   In an email two days before the event, Lindsay Drewel, a Washington public relations executive, wrote to Anthony R. Bernal, the deputy chief of staff for Jill Biden, the vice president's wife, that if Mr. Mellul ''can survive that crazy event (which we know he will) he'll be ready to go! Haha.''   After the event, Mr. Mellul even included a Secret Service agent in his round of emails thanking those with whom he had worked. And the day after the lunch, the first lady's office reached out again to see if he could help with an event in Virginia.   Mr. Mellul was excited, and in an email to a friend later that day, he noted that he had been told ''it takes a few good trips/events before they really trust you.''   On April 20, 2015, five days after his first job with Mrs. Obama's team at the congressional lunch, Mr. Mellul described himself as ''on the advance team'' for the first lady in an email to his professor saying he might miss class because of an event.

Let's Get Putin's Attention,"You may have missed this story, so I am repeating it as a public service: MOSCOW, Special to The New York Times, Oct. 1 -- A previously unheard-of group called Hackers for a Free Russia released a treasure trove of financial records online today indicating that President Vladimir Putin owns some $30 billion in property, hotels and factories across Russia and Europe, all disguised by front organizations and accounting charades.     The documents, which appear to be authentic, include detailed financial records and emails between Mr. Putin's Kremlin office and a number of his Russian cronies and Swiss banks. They constitute the largest hack ever of Mr. Putin. Russian censors are scrambling to shut down Twitter inside the country and keep the emails out of Russian-language media.     At a news conference in Washington, C.I.A. Director John Brennan was asked if U.S. intelligence services had any hand in the cyberleak of what is being called ''The Putin Files.'' With a slight grin, Mr. Brennan said: ''The U.S. government would never intervene in Russian politics, just as President Putin would never intervene in an American election. That would be wrong.'' As Mr. Brennan left the podium, though, he burst out laughing.   No, you didn't miss this story. I made it up. But isn't it time there was such a story? Isn't it time we gave Putin a dose of his own medicine -- not for juvenile playground reasons and not to instigate a conflict but precisely to prevent one -- to back Putin off from what is increasingly rogue behavior violating basic civilized norms and increasingly vital U.S. interests.   Putin ''is at war with us, but we are not at war with him -- both the U.S. and Germany are desperately trying to cling to a decent relationship,'' remarked Josef Joffe, editor of Die Zeit, a weekly German newspaper and a leading strategic thinker in Europe. No one should want to start a shooting war between great powers ''in the shadow of nuclear weapons,'' Joffe told me.   But we also cannot just keep turning the other cheek. Putin's behavior in Syria and Ukraine has entered the realm of war crimes, and his cyberattacks on the American political system threaten to undermine the legitimacy of our next election.   Just read the papers. Last week a Dutch-led investigation adduced irrefutable video evidence that Putin's government not only trucked in the missile system used to shoot down a Malaysia Airlines plane flying over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 civilians onboard, but also returned it to Russia the same night and then engaged in an elaborate cover-up.   On Sept. 19, what U.S. intelligence officials say was almost certainly a Russian Su-24 warplane bombed a U.N. convoy in Syria carrying relief supplies for civilians. The Red Cross said at least 20 people were killed. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called the bombing ''savage and apparently deliberate.''   For a long time, Putin's excesses were just a tragedy for the Russian people and for many people in Ukraine and Syria, so President Obama could plausibly argue that the right response was economic sanctions and troop buildups in Eastern Europe. But in the last nine months, something has changed.   Putin's relentless efforts to crush both the democratic and Islamist opposition to President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; his rejection of any real power-sharing solution there; and his joining with Assad in mercilessly bombing civilians in Aleppo are not only horrific in and of themselves, but they also keep pushing more refugees into the European Union. This is fostering an anti-immigrant backlash in Europe that is spawning right-wing nationalist parties and fracturing the E.U.   Meanwhile, Russia's hacking of America's Democratic Party -- and signs that Russian or other cyberwarriors have tried to break into American state voter registration systems -- suggests that Putin or other cyberdisrupters are trying to undermine the legitimacy of our next national election.   Together, these actions pose a threat to the two pillars of global democracy and open markets -- America and the E.U. -- more than anything coming from ISIS or Al Qaeda.   ''The Soviet Union was a revolutionary state that sought a wholesale change in the international order,'' observed Robert Litwak, director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and author of ''Deterring Nuclear Terrorism.'' Putin is ostensibly not seeking a revolution of the international order, Litwak added, but Putin's departure from standard great-power competition -- encouraging a flood of refugees and attacking the legitimacy of our political system -- ''is leading to shifts in global politics that could have revolutionary consequences, even if Putin is not motivated by revolutionary ideology.''   Obama believed that a combination of pressure and engagement would moderate Putin's behavior. That is the right approach, in theory, but it's now clear that we have underestimated the pressure needed to produce effective engagement, and we're going to have to step it up. This is not just about the politics of Syria and Ukraine anymore. It's now also about America, Europe, basic civilized norms and the integrity of our democratic institutions.

Surplus of Half-Truths as Clinton and Trump Debate a Second Time,"The second presidential debate, held Sunday night in St. Louis, was every bit the cage match as the first, as both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump repeatedly attacked each other on their pasts and other subjects. A look at where they stuck close to facts and where they distorted them: Mr. Trump said he had never kissed or touched women without consent.     SEVERAL WOMEN DISAGREE Temple Taggart has said that Mr. Trump gave her an unwelcome kiss on the mouth when she was a 21-year-old Miss Utah. Jill Harth has claimed that Mr. Trump groped her when she did business with him. And Ivana Trump, Mr. Trump's first wife, alleged in a deposition in their divorce that Mr. Trump raped her, an accusation she has since backed down from. MEGAN TWOHEY   Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump supported the Iraq war before it began.   THERE IS EVIDENCE Mrs. Clinton rejected Mr. Trump's contention that he opposed the war in Iraq before it began, saying that his assertion had been ''debunked.'' Mr. Trump, though, continued to say that he was against the war.   But Mrs. Clinton's assertion was correct: Audio unearthed by BuzzFeed revealed Mr. Trump, speaking in an interview with Howard Stern, voiced his support during the lead-up to the war. STEVE EDER   Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton deleted 33,000 emails from her private server after she got a subpoena.   TRUE ENOUGH Mrs. Clinton's aides did indeed delete about 33,000 emails from her private server, emails that she said were personal in nature. The F.B.I., however, indicated that many of the deleted emails may in fact have been related to her work at the State Department.   Days after The New York Times disclosed Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email system, the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, asked that her emails be preserved and it subpoenaed those related to the attacks.   But about three weeks later, an unidentified computer specialist realized that he had not destroyed an archive of emails that was supposed to have been deleted a year earlier, according to the F.B.I. report. The specialist then used a program to delete an unknown number of emails, the F.B.I. said.   Mrs. Clinton told F.B.I. investigators that she was unaware that the aide had deleted the emails. The F.B.I. did not find evidence to contradict that assertion. ERIC LICHTBLAU   Mrs. Clinton said there was no evidence her email has been hacked by a foreign power.   NONE YET, BUT... Hillary Clinton is literally correct -- so far, there is no evidence that any foreign power, including Russia, got into the email server she kept at her Chappaqua, N.Y., home. But as the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, has pointed out, the best hackers frequently leave no fingerprints.   It took more than a year to uncover the Chinese hacking of the Office of Personnel Management, and nearly a year for the Democratic National Committee to find out about the hacking now attributed by American intelligence agencies to the Russian government. It seems hard to believe the Russians would not have followed emails from the State Department -- a system they had penetrated -- back to Mrs. Clinton's servers. DAVID E. SANGER   Mr. Trump said that Obamacare is leading to ''astronomical'' insurance rate increases.   A BIT OF HYPERBOLE Mr. Trump is right that many Obamacare customers will see big increases next year that will be much higher than they have been the last two years. But the numbers he cited -- increases of more than 60 percent -- are not typical. Charles Gaba, a blogger who analyzes insurance filings, calculates that the average requested increase is around 25 percent.   Most Americans get their insurance through work, Medicare or Medicaid. For those people, average premium increases are flat or modest by historical standards. MARGOT SANGER-KATZ   Mr. Trump said that last year, the United States had a trade deficit of $800 billion.   NOT THAT HIGH The United States trade deficit last year was about $500 billion. That's about as large as it has ever been. Yet Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited the larger figure of $800 billion throughout the course of his campaign. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM   Mr. Trump said Bill Clinton was impeached, lost his law license and paid an $850,000 fine to Paula Jones.   MOSTLY ACCURATE As any student of American history knows, Mr. Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice related to questions about his extramarital affairs. The ensuing trial in the Senate resulted in him keeping his job.   Mr. Clinton had his Arkansas law license suspended for five years. He paid an $850,000 settlement -- not a fine -- in Ms. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, without admitting wrongdoing. IAN TRONTZ   Mr. Trump accused Mrs. Clinton of laughing about getting a man acquitted of raping a 12-year-old girl.   NOT FUNNY Kathy Shelton was 12 in Arkansas in 1975 when Hillary Rodham, then 27, was appointed by a court to defend a man accused of raping her. Much later, Ms. Shelton accused Mrs. Clinton of getting her rapist off and even laughing about the case.   The prosecution's case was problematic, and Mrs. Clinton's client pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. In the mid-1980s, Mrs. Clinton was interviewed at length about the case by a reporter. In the interview, she said with a laugh that after her client passed a lie-detector test, it destroyed her faith in polygraphs. She did not laugh in the recorded interview about winning the man's acquittal.

Mr. Trump's Weird World,"For most of this campaign, Donald Trump's admiration for Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and his willingness to act as a Kremlin apologist on issues ranging from Syria to the computer hacking of individuals and political parties have been sources of bafflement and dismay. Mr. Trump's alarming performance at Sunday night's debate deepened these concerns. Mr. Trump again denied that the Russians were doing anything to manipulate the presidential election despite powerful evidence to the contrary. And he again laid bare his cockamamie and uninformed view of the bloody civil war in Syria and his refusal to acknowledge Russia's role in making it worse.     Mr. Trump has no foreign policy experience. He has, however, received two briefings from American intelligence agencies that should have alerted him to the challenges facing the next president but apparently have not. All of which raises unsettling questions about whether the Republican nominee for the most powerful job in the world is Mr. Putin's poodle, stubbornly naïve, totally clueless or, as some have ominously suggested, protecting undisclosed business interests in Russia.   Though allegations about Russian interference in the election have circulated for some time, the Obama administration on Friday formally accused Russia of stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other institutions. When Hillary Clinton raised this, Mr. Trump came to Russia's defense: ''Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia.''   ''To profess not to know at this point is willful misrepresentation,'' one senior United States official told NBC News. Presidents can choose to disregard an intelligence finding, but at this point, why would Mr. Trump feel he has better information or analytical ability than a ''high confidence'' conclusion by the country's intelligence professionals? Why would he not want to acknowledge a threat and address it?   It is similarly unacceptable that Mr. Trump refuses to accept Russia's role in backing Syria's brutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad, and to condemn the bombings that have killed thousands of civilians in Aleppo and elsewhere. Instead, he ignored the civil war and effectively praised not just Russia but also Mr. Assad and Iran for ''killing ISIS,'' the Islamic State. Russia, Iran and the Assad forces are, in fact, largely focused on destroying the Syrian rebels opposed to Mr. Assad.   Various dark theories are circulating among experts about why Mr. Trump is so enamored of Mr. Putin, a dictator who has crushed dissent at home and is fixated on expanding his influence abroad. One theory, denied by Mr. Trump and impossible to confirm or rule out because he refuses to release his taxes, is that he has business interests in Russia that he wants to protect or develop in the future.   Mrs. Clinton has charged that Mr. Putin is trying to throw the election to her opponent because she is too tough on the Kremlin. Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, told The Times: ''I'm sure Putin is trying -- and more successfully than many think -- to manipulate both the process and one of the candidates. He realizes that Trump will trample American democracy and damage if not destroy America as a pillar of stability and major force able to contain him.''   In the end, it may not matter whether Mr. Trump is being manipulated by Mr. Putin or naïvely accepting Mr. Putin's twisted views. What does matter is that with each new bizarre utterance he provides further proof of his inability to evaluate credible information and, more broadly, his lack of fitness to further his country's best interests.

Putin Proposes a Distinct Category for Athletes Given Drug Exemptions,"President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia waded into the nuances of antidoping protocols in sports on Tuesday, criticizing the practice of allowing athletes to use prohibited drugs for legitimate medical reasons. He claimed that athletes given such waivers had an unfair advantage. ''We could soon face all records and victories going only to people who are ill with, let's say, chronic illnesses,'' Mr. Putin said, later advocating that all drug exceptions be made public and suggesting that athletes using banned drugs be segregated in competition.     The special permissions granted to athletes to use banned substances -- known as therapeutic use exemptions -- came under scrutiny this fall after Russian hackers obtained the private medical records of Olympians and made them public.   The files, which Mr. Putin did not explicitly mention, showed that top athletes like Simone Biles and Rafael Nadal had been cleared to use prohibited drugs for specific periods of time. The waivers extended from items like one-time-use EpiPens for severe allergies to long prescriptions for attention-deficit-disorder drugs.   Global sports authorities said the people in question had secured proper clearance and had done nothing wrong.   To date, the hackers -- who identified themselves as Fancy Bear, a Russian cyberespionage group that forensics specialists have tied to breaches against government agencies, nonprofit organizations and corporations -- have published the files of more than 100 athletes of over two dozen nationalities.   Roughly a quarter of them are American, prompting the hackers to write that the United States had ''disgraced its name by tainted victories'' in the 2016 Summer Olympics. One Russian athlete, the boxer Misha Aloyan, was included among the dozens of individuals.   The Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova, currently suspended from international competition for a drug violation, recently said of the published records that a higher number of exemptions had been granted to athletes from certain countries.   A majority of the records published by Fancy Bear relate to American, British and Canadian athletes. The sample published, however, is not necessarily representative.   The World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, reached by telephone on Tuesday, said it did not yet have a response to Mr. Putin, who suggested that athletes certified to use banned substances ''be put in a special category, or their achievements, points, seconds and honors can be considered in a special way.''   The International Olympic Committee and WADA -- which manages the prohibited list and decides on therapeutic exemptions, together with each sport's officials -- have defended both the granted exceptions and the antidoping system's protection of athletes' medical privacy.   Last week, WADA called the exemption program ''a rigorous and necessary part of elite sport,'' calling the hacks ''a cheap shot at innocent athletes whose personal data has been exposed.'' Sports officials contend that it would be inappropriate to make drug exemptions public because some of them might reveal conditions that athletes do not want the public to know about, like depression or reproductive problems.   On Saturday in Switzerland, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., called on WADA to strengthen its data privacy in the wake of the ''unacceptable hacking,'' which law enforcement authorities are investigating.   WADA said last month that the breach had occurred as a result of a so-called spear-phishing scheme that used an I.O.C. account to access WADA's athlete database.   Speaking Tuesday in Russia, Mr. Putin did not refer to the Fancy Bear hacks, and last month, the Kremlin denied any government involvement.   Investigations into government-sponsored doping in Russia are continuing, including an inquiry by a Canadian lawyer who in July produced a detailed report concluding that for years, Russia's top athletes had taken a three-drug cocktail of liquor and prohibited anabolic steroids.   At least seven Russian Olympians, so far, have lost medals from the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics after recent retests of urine samples revealed they had violated antidoping rules. Within hours of Mr. Putin's comments, the Olympic committee announced that it would strip Tatyana Lysenko of Russia, a hammer thrower, of the gold medal she won at the London Games in 2012.   Russia's sports minister has called doping a black spot on the country, and Mr. Putin recently established an antidoping commission focused on reform.     "
Agency Reassures U.S. Athletes After New Hack,"The United States Anti-Doping Agency is seeking to reassure American athletes that their private medical information is safe after Russian hackers gained access to the email account of one of the agency's officials. The same cyberespionage group that stole private medical information from the World Anti-Doping Agency's athlete database last summer more recently compromised the email account belonging to the science director of the American agency. The agency believes the breach occurred in early September in Rio de Janeiro, at the start of the Paralympic Games.    The federal authorities have assessed the extent of the damage and are investigating the attack, the United States agency said.    Travis Tygart, chief executive of Usada, called the attacks ''deplorable'' on Friday, adding: ''Our athletes here in the U.S. get it, and they see these cyberattacks for exactly what they are: A blatant attempt to baselessly smear the reputations of clean athletes and to distract from the state-supported doping system that corrupted the Sochi Games.''   The hackers, calling themselves Fancy Bear -- a group believed to be associated with the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence agency suspected of involvement in the recent cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee -- published files this month relating to American athletes whom the sports authorities had granted waivers to take prohibited drugs.   Such waivers, known as therapeutic use exemptions, have been central to the recent Fancy Bear hacks. When the group began publishing athlete files in mid-September, it argued that the exemptions -- granted by top sports authorities and approved by WADA and the International Olympic Committee -- constituted sanctioned doping and delivered an unfair advantage.   Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, expressed that view this week, suggesting that athletes with drug exemptions should compete in special, segregated categories. The Russian government has denied ties to the Fancy Bear attack.   More than 25 American athletes -- including high-profile Olympians like Simone Biles and Serena and Venus Williams -- were affected by the hackers' first several rounds of disclosures, staggered over several weeks.   Ms. Biles, 19, subsequently said that she had received a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder years earlier, adding that she was not ashamed of her disorder or by the disclosure of her sensitive medical information.   Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of nothing that I'm afraid to let people know. -- Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) September 13, 2016   Also affected were more than 100 athletes from 26 other countries -- including one from Russia -- who had permission to take a range of medications to treat conditions like allergies, asthma and attention disorders.   But with the latest batch of files, published Oct. 7 and drawing on the American antidoping agency's emails, the hackers focused squarely on the United States, citing ''more than 200 American athletes who have permission to take banned drugs'' whose names and waivers they had gained access to via a spreadsheet stored on email.   (The United States files, first reported on by Forbes, were taken down for roughly five days, during which the Fancy Bear site was down.)   The email breach affected one individual's account, the United States antidoping agency said this week; that account belonged to Matthew Fedoruk, the organization's science director.   Dr. Fedoruk was working at the oceanside hotel where the International Paralympic Committee was headquartered, in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood of Rio. His account was thought to have been compromised through the Wi-Fi network he was using there.   The organization was not aware of the breach until Fancy Bear announced it roughly a month later.   The American agency said this week that its email servers had not been compromised and that the breach had affected Mr. Fedoruk's account alone. The agency said it had determined that Fancy Bear made failed attempts through different channels to gain access to other files, including the agency's financial records.   Russia was barred from participating in the Paralympics after revelations of government-sponsored doping and coordinated cover-ups that relied on help from Russia's Federal Security Service.   In recent days, Mr. Tygart sent a video message to all American athletes whose information had been made public. He said he had spoken with dozens of athletes and their parents by phone.   Mr. Tygart called on global sports leaders to condemn the hacks. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, has called the breaches ''unacceptable'' while suggesting that responsibility lies with WADA, which ought to ''significantly improve its information security standards to comply with the international data privacy regulations and to prevent data leakage of critical information.''   The Fancy Bear hackers have threatened to continue to release information, suggesting last Friday that Dr. Fedoruk's emails were only the start of the correspondence they had obtained.   As investigations into elaborate government-ordered cheating by Russia at the last Winter Olympics continue, ''some leaders in Olympic sport have taken the bait and are talking more about this,'' Mr. Tygart said of the hacks, ''than about imposing meaningful consequences on a state-run doping program and how to ensure that it never happens again.''     "
Former Joint Chiefs General Admits He Lied to F.B.I. in Inquiry Over Leaks,"WASHINGTON -- James E. Cartwright, a retired Marine Corps general who as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff served as a key member of President Obama's national security team, agreed to plead guilty on Monday to lying to the F.B.I. about his discussions with reporters about Iran's nuclear program. General Cartwright entered the guilty plea before Judge Richard J. Leon of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia. As part of the deal, prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that under sentencing guidelines, the punishment could range from a $500 fine to six months in prison. However, the government reserved the right to argue for a higher sentence, and the judge is not bound by the guidelines. Judge Leon set a sentencing hearing for Jan. 17.    During the half-hour hearing, General Cartwright spoke stoically and in a calm voice, answering ''Yes, sir'' to a series of questions posed by the judge to make sure he understood what he was doing.    He did not speak to reporters afterward, but in a statement said that he was not the original source of the information.   ''It was wrong for me to mislead the F.B.I. on Nov. 2, 2012, and I accept full responsibility for this,'' General Cartwright said. ''I knew I was not the source of the story and I didn't want to be blamed for the leak. My only goal in talking to the reporters was to protect American interests and lives; I love my country and continue to this day to do everything I can to defend it.''   His lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, said in a statement that his client had spoken to journalists after they had already reported their stories and that his motive was to prevent publication of information that might have harmed national security. The investigation focused on leaks to reporters for The New York Times and Newsweek.   For General Cartwright, who was known as ''Obama's favorite general'' before his retirement in 2011, the plea amounts to a stunning fall. It also adds a new twist to a surge of leak-related criminal cases in the Obama era.   The case grew out of a period of political furor over leaks in the summer of 2012, when numerous books and articles appeared about Mr. Obama's national security record during his first term.   Republicans in Congress accused the White House of deliberately leaking government secrets, endangering national security to make Mr. Obama look tough in an election year.   The administration denied that charge, and the attorney general at the time, Eric H. Holder Jr., appointed two United States attorneys to look into two specific disclosures, one of which was the cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program.   NBC News reported in 2013 that the Iran cyberattack investigation was focused on General Cartwright.   The cyberattack was Operation Olympic Games, a joint United States-Israeli effort to sabotage Iranian nuclear centrifuges with a computer virus sometimes called Stuxnet. A description of it was contained in ''Confront and Conceal,'' a book by David E. Sanger, a New York Times reporter, that was also adapted as an article published by The Times.   ''In researching his book 'Confront and Conceal' and his stories for The New York Times, David E. Sanger relied on multiple sources in Washington, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity,'' The Times said in a statement on Monday.   ''As in the past, neither The Times nor Mr. Sanger will discuss whether a particular person was a source or the sourcing of particular information that was published, beyond what has been disclosed in our stories and in the book,'' the statement continued. ''Reporting like this serves a vital public interest: explaining how the United States is using a powerful new technology against its adversaries and the concern that it raises about how similar weapons can be used against the U.S. We will continue to pursue that reporting vigorously.   ''We are disappointed that the Justice Department has gone forward with the leak investigation that led to today's guilty plea by General Cartwright,'' it added. ''These investigations send a chilling message to all government employees that they should not speak to reporters. The inevitable result is that the American public is deprived of information that it needs to know.''   Prosecutors also accused General Cartwright of lying about his conversations with another reporter, Daniel Klaidman, then of Newsweek. They said that the general had falsely told investigators that he had never discussed an unnamed country with Mr. Klaidman, but that he had sent an email to that reporter that ''confirmed certain classified information relating'' to that country in February 2012.   Mr. Klaidman wrote an article in February 2012 about the Obama administration's policy toward disrupting the Iranian nuclear program, including a section about a conversation between General Cartwright and Mr. Obama in early 2009 about various covert sabotage efforts. The list included cyberwarfare programs to damage centrifuges. He declined to comment on Monday.   It was reported by Foreign Policy in the fall of 2013 that General Cartwright had been stripped of his security clearance. But with no official word from the Justice Department since then, it had seemed that the case was being handled administratively rather than criminally.   On Monday morning, however, federal prosecutors filed criminal information against General Cartwright stating that on Nov. 2, 2012, investigators showed him ''a list of quotes and quotations from David Sanger's book, a number of which contained classified information,'' but that he falsely told investigators that ''he was not the source of any of the quotes and statements'' and that ''he did not provide or confirm classified information to David Sanger.''   General Cartwright's guilty plea -- not for leaking, but for lying to agents pursuing an investigation into an apparent leak -- was reminiscent of the case prosecutors brought during the George W. Bush administration against I. Lewis Libby, a former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Libby was charged with lying about his conversations with journalists to investigators looking into the disclosure of a C.I.A. official's identity, but was not charged over the leak itself.   Before General Cartwright's plea, the Obama administration had already brought criminal charges in more than twice as many cases involving leaks of government secrets to the news media as were brought under all previous presidents combined. They included eight officials it charged under the Espionage Act, although in some cases that charge was dropped.   In a ninth leak-related case in the Obama era, the government struck a deal with David H. Petraeus, a prominent retired general who served as director of the C.I.A. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified information related to accusations that he let his biographer read notebooks containing national security secrets, although she did not publish any of them.   Mr. Petraeus also admitted to lying to the F.B.I., but he was not charged with that offense under his plea deal. He paid a fine and was sentenced to two years of probation.

Email Outlines Clinton's Potential No. 2s,"Hillary Clinton could have shared the Democratic presidential ticket with Bill Gates -- or with his wife, Melinda. She could have named Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as her running mate. Or she could have chosen to reward a loyal friend and fund-raiser by making Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia her No. 2.  All four were among the potential vice-presidential candidates Mrs. Clinton's top campaign aides included in a first pass through their screening process, which turns out to have been well underway even before she amassed the delegates she needed to capture the nomination.    On March 17, just after Mrs. Clinton had defeated Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in a string of primary contests, including those in Florida and Illinois, her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, sent her a note of congratulations.   ''Ok, I can breathe again!'' he wrote in a hacked email released by WikiLeaks on Tuesday. ''Congrats on a fabulous night. I am feeling like it's possible to get back to the longer term again.''   Mr. Podesta updated Mrs. Clinton on the preparations for vetting potential running mates, including ''nondisclosure agreements with anyone we involve in the process,'' then rattled off a not-so-short list of vice-presidential prospects he and other aides had agreed to include in what he called a ''first cut.''   ''I have organized names in rough food groups,'' Mr. Podesta wrote.   It was a balanced diet, indeed: Clustered below were the Latinos, women, white male politicians -- including Mrs. Clinton's eventual pick, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia -- African-Americans, military men, business executives and philanthropists.   Thirty-ninth and last on the list, and in a category all by himself, was Mr. Sanders.   The email, obtained by hackers who illegally breached Mr. Podesta's account, appears to have kicked into gear a closely guarded vetting process that stretched on for months.   At the time, it was not yet assured that Donald J. Trump would lock up the Republican nomination, and Mrs. Clinton's aides included running mates who could bolster the Democratic ticket should she find herself in a general election against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas or even Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.   Mr. Podesta's list included many elected officials who were later reported to have been vetted, including the Obama administration cabinet secretaries Julián Castro, Tom Perez and Tom Vilsack, and Senators Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet.   But other potential running mates -- including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook; Muhtar Kent, the Turkish-American chief executive of Coca-Cola; and Howard Schultz, the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks -- would have been highly unconventional.   In the end, of course, Mr. Trump settled on Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana as his running mate, and Mrs. Clinton faced little pressure to respond by demonstrating unpredictability or boldness with her own choice.

The Age of Email Is Nearing an End,"Every four years, pundits race to anoint this or that newfangled tech trend as the next disruptive force to forever alter the mechanics of American democracy. The 2016 campaign has already been called the Snapchat election, the Periscope election, the Meerkat election, the Twitter election, the Facebook election and the meme election. (If there were a vomit emoji, I'd insert one here. And then we'd have the emoji election.) Yet for months this bizarre campaign has been defined less by cutting-edge technology than by one of the most established: email. It's 2016, and we're blessed with an embarrassment of ways to securely and conveniently communicate with one another. But all anyone can talk about is Hillary Clinton's damn emails.    This column is not about the real or imagined scandals exposed by caches of Mrs. Clinton's and her campaign staff's messages, which, thanks to the State Department, Russian hackers, Judicial Watch and WikiLeaks now regularly spill into public view.    Instead, let's examine a more basic mystery buried in the emails: Why were all these people discussing so much over email in the first place? Haven't they heard of phone calls? Face-to-face meetings in dimly lit Washington parking garage? Anyplace else where their conversations weren't constantly being recorded, archived and rendered searchable for decades to come?   The answer, of course, is that email is as tempting as it is inescapable, for Mrs. Clinton as well as for the rest of us. More than 50 years after its birth, email exerts an uncanny hold on all of our internal affairs.   But everything must meet its maker, and for email, that time is nigh.   The sudden exposure of the Clinton campaign email cache is perhaps the ultimate evidence that we've all overcommitted to email -- we've put too much in it, expected too much from it, and now, finally, we're seeing the spectacular signs of its impending destruction.   Email is simply not up to the rigors of modern political and business life. It lulls us into a sense of unguarded security that it never delivers. It entices us to spill our darkest secrets, and then makes those secrets available to any halfway decent hacker. There are several alternatives that could take its place, without the same pitfalls, and the Clinton cache shows why we would be wise to adopt one of them.   Let's pour one out for email, which has had quite a run. Then let's move on to something else, and dance on email's grave.   The latest Clinton emails come from the hacked Gmail account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman. I emailed the campaign to ask about the breach and email security practices, but I got no response. (Maybe they've shied away from email?) The campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the messages, which speaks to one of the shortcomings of email: It can easily be forged, so there's no good way for anyone reading those messages to confirm that they really are the Clinton campaign's.   But if you assume the messages are authentic, you quickly discover even more shortcomings of email. What's most striking about the Podesta cache is how central email has been to the campaign's operations. In 2016, presidential campaigns, like all large enterprises, are far-flung operations. Lots of people in lots of different places are trying to plan things together. To the extent there's any centrality to the organization, it's in email communication.   You can see why this can be handy. Having a single place to discuss everything makes teams more efficient. In the Clinton campaign, email is used as a way to convey news, to set out tactics and strategy, to theorize, to push back, to gossip. It's used in place of phone calls and face-to-face meetings; it's used as an instant messenger, a daily calendar and a collaborative whiteboard.   ''It suggests that they hadn't had their sense of security punctured yet,'' said Adam Segal, an expert on cybersecurity at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of ''The Hacked World Order.'' ''Once you have had that breached, you don't go back to that world where you write down sensitive things in email. If you have something sensitive to say, you're going to use the phone or walk down the hallway.''   One thread from the spring of 2015 is instructive, suggesting both email's advantages and its enormous flaws. Over the course of three days, a half dozen senior members of the campaign used email to discuss a sensitive topic: Should the campaign allow people who lobby on behalf of foreign governments, known as registered foreign agents, to raise donations on its behalf? Experts on the issue went over the legal and political ramifications, and various members weighed in on two ideas -- take no money from foreign agents, or take some money on a case-by-case basis, depending on the foreign government the agent represented. (Canada would be O.K.; North Korea would not.)   By the second day of discussions, the thread was getting long and going nowhere, so Robby Mook, the campaign manager, proposed a quick phone call to hash out the idea. He almost apologized for suggesting a call, which he worried was too grown-up, ''too processy.''   The phone call apparently happened. But in the Clinton campaign, even a phone call needed to be documented in email. So after the call, another staff member reported on the decision made during the call: to bar any donations from foreign agents.   But it didn't end there. Marc E. Elias, the campaign's general counsel, then chimed in to say that he hadn't been on the call but that he opposed the ban on foreign donations, which he said would feel arbitrary.   That set off another round of discussions, sparking annoyance among some people on the thread. Finally, Mr. Mook wrote in to say that thanks to Mr. Elias, he had changed his mind, and was now leaning toward taking money from foreign agents. ''Are you guys O.K. with that?'' he asked.   That prompted the kicker from Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign's communications director: ''Take the money!!'' she wrote from her iPhone.   In the days following WikiLeaks' publication, this thread became a campaign issue. Donald J. Trump even drew attention to Ms. Palmieri's line at a rally this week.   But it didn't have to be so. If they had been using some other system to communicate, they would most likely have avoided this trouble.   A more modern communication system, something like Slack or HipChat, could still be hacked, but would have allowed for a central administrator to set an archiving policy. After a few days or weeks, this sort of conversation would have been erased. That's less practical for email, which by its very nature is decentralized. Once you send an email, your thread resides on every device that every recipient ever downloaded it on.   Better still, an app like Signal, which encrypts its messages (and which the campaign is now reported to be using), would have made cracking the messages more difficult in the first place.   But there's something even more pernicious than weak security here. The deeper problem with email is that it has never quite settled on a social mode. An email can be as formal as a legal letter or as tossed off as drive-by insult. This invites confusion. For instance, in context, Ms. Palmieri's ''Take the money!!'' doesn't sound so bad -- it looks like a quick, half-cheeky way to end an overlong discussion. If it were said on a phone call or an instant message, ''Take the money'' would have sounded like an entirely normal way to end the conversation.   But email comes with no expectations. Because everything else in the thread sounds serious, Ms. Palmieri's ending line can easily be colored as more sinister.   Finally, it's worth noting how much time and how many emails -- more than a dozen -- it took the group to arrive at its decisions. Email sometimes tricks us into feeling efficient, but it rarely is. Because it's asynchronous, and because there are no limits on space and time, it often leads to endless, pointless ruminations. If they had ditched email and just held a 15-minute meeting, members of the campaign could have hashed out the foreign-agent decision more quickly in private.   In other words, limits often help. Get on the phone, make a decision, ditch your inbox. The world will be better off for it.     "
Private Security Group Says Russia Was Behind Hack of Clinton Campaign Chairman,"SAN FRANCISCO -- At the start of 2014, President Obama assigned his trusted counselor, John D. Podesta, to lead a review of the digital revolution, its potential and its perils. When Mr. Podesta presented his findings five months later, he called the internet's onslaught of big data ''a historic driver of progress.'' But two short years later, as chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Mr. Podesta would also become one of the internet's most notable victims. On Thursday, private security researchers said they had concluded that Mr. Podesta was hacked by Russia's foreign intelligence service, the GRU, after it tricked him into clicking on a fake Google login page last March, inadvertently handing over his digital credentials.     For months, the hackers mined Mr. Podesta's inbox for his most sensitive and potentially embarrassing correspondence, much of which has been posted on the WikiLeaks website. Additions to the collection on Thursday included three short email exchanges between Mr. Podesta and Mr. Obama himself in the days leading up to his election in 2008.   Mr. Podesta's emails were first published by WikiLeaks earlier this month. The release came just days after James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security publicly blamed Russian officials for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee, in what they described as an effort to influence the American presidential election.   To date, no government officials have offered evidence that the same Russian hackers behind the D.N.C. cyberattacks were also behind the hack of Mr. Podesta's emails, but an investigation by the private security researchers determined that they were the same.   Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, an Atlanta-based security firm, had been tracking the Russian intelligence group for more than a year. In June, they reported that they had uncovered a critical tool in the Russian spy campaign. SecureWorks researchers found that the Russian hackers were using a popular link shortening service, called Bitly, to shorten malicious links they used to send targets fake Google login pages to bait them into submitting their email credentials.   The hackers made a critical error by leaving some of their Bitly accounts public, making it possible for SecureWorks to trace 9,000 of their links to nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts targeted between October 2015 and May 2016 with fake Google login pages and security alerts designed to trick users into turning over their passwords.   Among the list of targets were more than 100 email addresses associated with Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, including Mr. Podesta's. By June, 20 staff members for the campaign had clicked on the short links sent by Russian spies. In June, SecureWorks disclosed that among those whose email accounts had been targeted were staff members who advised Mrs. Clinton on policy and managed her travel, communications and campaign finances.   Two security researchers who have been tracking the GRU's spearphishing campaign confirmed Thursday that Mr. Podesta was among those who had inadvertently turned over his Google email password. The fact that Mr. Podesta was among those breached by the GRU was first disclosed Thursday by Esquire and the Motherboard blog, which published the link Russian spies used against Mr. Podesta.   ''The new public data confirming the Russians are behind the hack of John Podesta's email is a big deal,'' Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton's senior policy adviser, said Thursday. ''There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks.''   The new release of Mr. Podesta's email exchange with Mr. Obama from 2008 made clear that Mr. Obama's team was confident he would win.   In one of the emails, Mr. Podesta wrote Mr. Obama a lengthy memo in the evening on Election Day recommending that he not accept an invitation from President George W. Bush to attend an emergency meeting of the Group of 20 leaders.   ''Attendance alongside President Bush will create an extremely awkward situation,'' the memo said. ''If you attempt to dissociate yourself from his positions, you will be subject to criticism for projecting a divided United States to the rest of the world. But if you adopt a more reserved posture, you will be associated not only with his policies, but also with his very tenuous global standing.''   The White House did not respond to questions about the email.

A Reality TV Campaign Gets a Dose of Reality,"You sure have to hand it to the Russians. They understand the power of free-flowing information, how it can upend government and politics.    It's why they don't let information flow too freely in their own country. And it's why, if United States intelligence assessments are correct, they have worked so hard to send it roaring through ours.   There is a certain kind of brilliance to the way the Russians are said to have hacked the email accounts of senior Democratic officials and gifted the contents to their BFFs at WikiLeaks.   The Russians seem to be using the United States' free press -- a great symbol of our democracy -- against it while setting up an impossible choice for American newsrooms: Run with the stolen and in many cases unverified correspondence and potentially assist an audacious Russian attempt to disrupt a presidential election, or decline to print it and betray their mission to combat the great political fog machine.    Declining to cover the emails would play into accusations that the media is censoring news that would be helpful to Donald J. Trump. In that case, the Russians get a nice consolation prize: fodder for their disingenuous argument that if any system is ''rigged,'' it's the United States', so judge not lest you be judged. Khrushchev would be proud.   But the whole thing seems to be backfiring. In this, the year of the leak, the hackers are contributing to a phenomenon -- raw transparency -- that should make democracy stronger.   Taken together, this year's big breaches -- nefarious and otherwise -- are bringing a dose of reality to this reality television campaign, exposing what the candidates or their aides say and do when they think no one is looking.   And they have pulled back the curtain on the political-celebrity mythmaking that the American media too often abets.   Exhibit A is a 2006 People magazine article about Donald and Melania Trump. ''During their first year of marriage, Donald and Melania Trump reveled in being a twosome,'' People said as it took note of their first anniversary and Melania's pregnancy.   Depends on your definition of ''revel.''   As we know, a reporter on the piece, Natasha Stoynoff, now claims that Mr. Trump forced his tongue down her throat and proposed having an affair -- while she was reporting on the Trumps' love story. And we know about her allegations, which Mr. Trump denies, only because of the leaked ''Access Hollywood'' tape where he boasted about kissing women uninvited and grabbing their privates.   Ms. Stoynoff said that she went ahead with the original piece about the Trump marriage in People because she was ashamed and feared retaliation.   Jess Cagle, People's editor in chief, told me that if higher-ups had known the truth at the time, the article would have been spiked or ''been about his abusive behavior toward women rather than his alleged domestic bliss.''   The important message, he said, was that ''if a staffer is abused in any way'' he or she will have ''the full support of senior management.'' And presumably times have changed enough that a writer would not feel obliged to write an article at odds with his or her own experience.   But the entertainment press is not alone in occasionally conveying false or incomplete narratives. The political press can do it too, if often led by the invisible hands of operatives whose job it is to stage-manage reality.   The latest warning sign comes from a tricky source, the conservative activist-journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas Action, which specializes in goading opponents into discussing illegal or unethical schemes while secretly recording them.   In a video Mr. O'Keefe released last week, a Democratic operative, Scott Foval, brags about sending troublemakers to Mr. Trump's rallies, to provoke Trump supporters into attacking them.   Mr. O'Keefe has a history of selectively editing his videos to create misleading or false impressions. As The New York Times and The Washington Post have noted, it is unclear whether Mr. Foval accomplished what he boasted about. But the party strategist Mr. Foval was working for, Robert Creamer, fired him and then ceased his own work for the Democratic National Committee. (He disputed Mr. Foval's claims of inciting violence.)   Mr. Foval's words alone should be enough to remind reporters that there are people who are paid to distort the picture they present. If he did succeed in his plans, and drew headlines that depicted Mr. Trump's supporters as attacking protesters without provocation, he got one over on the news media as much as he did on Mr. Trump.   Which brings me back to the Russians. Is that what they are doing, playing the media for their own purposes?   On Thursday, a private internet security firm, Dell SecureWorks, said the Russian hackers that the United States officially blamed for breaking into Democratic Party accounts over the summer were involved in the latest WikiLeaks email dump, which came from the account of a senior Clinton adviser, John Podesta. The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, has declined to disclose the source of the emails.   Saying the Russians have ''weaponized'' WikiLeaks, the Clinton campaign will not readily verify the authenticity of the emails, though it has not issued blanket denials, either. Brian Fallon, the campaign spokesman, told me he had been warning reporters against taking the emails at face value and reminding them not to lose sight of their provenance.   Then there is the fact that they are from Mr. Podesta's private account.   All of it has made reporting on the emails incredibly fraught. Even Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, who helped bring to light Edward J. Snowden's leaks, has expressed qualms about poring over personal emails (along with skepticism of Russia's suspected role in stealing them).   ''Even people who are in powerful positions and wield influence continue to retain the right to privacy, and there should never be any publishing of personal matters or things that aren't directly in the public interest,'' he said in a discussion about the emails with the author Naomi Klein.   But Mr. Greenwald said there was too much of a public interest at stake to ignore emails that ''shed light on the person highly likely to be the next president of the United States.''   Most of the mainstream news media has taken the same position.   As Susan Glasser, the Politico editor, told me, it's not every day that you get a ''real-time look'' at the decision-making of a major presidential campaign.   And it's not as if there is much of a choice, anyway, she said, given that ''we can't unknow things that are in the public space.''   That is, the emails are out there. It is the job of the mainstream press to use reporting to determine their validity and significance, and put their contents in their proper context. That's especially important when misleading, partisan interpretations can bounce around the internet at the speed of Twitter, which serves Russia most of all.   The emails have shown cynical approaches by Hillary Clinton and her team to fund-raising; a penchant for secrecy; a coziness with reporters that is too often the case with both parties in Washington; and a calculated approach to environmental issues, free trade and banking that is already causing trouble on her left flank, as Politico reported.   They have not brought a major scandal to the surface, at least not yet, and even won praise from some supporters like The Post's editorial page, which said they showed Mrs. Clinton's ''sound policy instincts.'' They've certainly not blown up the system, as might happen in a more closed, undemocratic form of government.   If repressive foreign governments want to make a regular thing of hacking into United States leaders' email to undermine the country, and domestic politicians like Mr. Trump want to keep embracing that kind of ''help,'' then the news media may have to rethink how to handle it.   But so far, the hacks have only proved that the United States system knows how to process reality and can handle the truth, which should encourage our leaders to offer more of it.   So for that much, I guess, thanks, Vladimir Putin. Now, ready to share your emails?     "
"'We Need to Clean This Up,' Clinton Aide Frets in Newly Public Email","In a March 2015 interview, President Obama said that he had learned about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state ''the same time everybody else learned it, through news reports.'' But that assertion concerned aides of Mrs. Clinton, who knew that the president himself had received emails from the private address, according to a hacked email made public on Tuesday by WikiLeaks.     ''We need to clean this up -- he has emails from her -- they do not say state.gov,'' Cheryl D. Mills, a top aide, wrote to John D. Podesta, another senior adviser, on March 7, 2015.   Two days later, Mr. Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest,  tried to clarify the president's remarks, saying that he had, in fact, exchanged emails with Mrs. Clinton through her private account. But Mr. Earnest suggested that the president had no idea the emails could be a problem because he had relied on Mrs. Clinton to make sure that using a private account did not break any laws.   ''The point that the president was making is not that he didn't know Secretary Clinton's email address -- he did -- but he was not aware of the details of how that email address and server had been set up, or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act,'' Mr. Earnest said on March 9.   For Mrs. Clinton, the private email account to conduct State Department business has been a constant source of criticism during her presidential campaign, prompting a series of explanations and apologies from her and her aides, and even an F.B.I. investigation.   The email exchange made public on Tuesday highlighted how the issue was quickly viewed with deep concern not only for Mrs. Clinton, but also for her political ally and former boss, the president.   The release also followed months of Republican arguments that the Obama administration had coordinated with the Clinton campaign to limit the damage from the emails, up to and including the Justice Department's decision this summer not to prosecute her.   Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, declined to comment on Ms. Mills's email to Mr. Podesta, just as the campaign has declined to discuss any of the tens of thousands of internal campaign-related emails that have been released by WikiLeaks over the last month. The emails were hacked from the account of Mr. Podesta, who is now the campaign's chairman, and the campaign has blamed the Russian government for breaking into his account in an attempt to help Donald J. Trump defeat Mrs. Clinton on Nov. 8.   The president's spokesman said Tuesday that Mr. Obama's original comment that he had not known about the private email server was accurate.   ''I recognize that some of the president's critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state, but they've failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny,'' Mr. Earnest said.   Mrs. Clinton's use of a private, nongovernmental email server to conduct State Department business raised concerns about whether she had exposed classified information to hacking. The F.B.I. concluded that while she had been ''extremely careless,'' ultimately she had committed no crime.   Besides the implication that the Clinton team had worked to protect Mr. Obama, the messages about Mrs. Clinton's private email server, like others recently released by WikiLeaks, revealed the kind of stagecraft and damage control that go on behind the scenes of a modern political campaign.   They showed how Clinton advisers immediately grappled with the issue, anticipating that her opponents would try to exploit to reinforce a perception that she was untrustworthy.   Neera Tanden, another adviser, traded several messages with Mr. Podesta on March 2, 2015, the day The New York Times first reported Mrs. Clinton's use of the private email address.   Ms. Tanden predicted that Jeb Bush, who was viewed at the time as the potential Republican front-runner, would ''go to town'' on the issue because his own emails as Florida governor were public.   Ms. Tanden also lamented the timing of the revelation and blamed Ms. Mills, a close Clinton confidante who had worked with her at the State Department, calling it a ''Cheryl special.'' She suggested that Ms. Mills and other members of Mrs. Clinton's inner circle who knew about the private emails had probably hoped to keep them secret.   ''Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago? So crazy,'' Ms. Tanden wrote. ''Unbelievable,'' Mr. Podesta responded.   Ms. Tanden wrote back: ''i guess I know the answer. they wanted to get away with it.''   Another exchange between Mr. Podesta and Ms. Mills released last week appeared to show them discussing whether Mrs. Clinton's private emails to and from Mr. Obama could be withheld from the public under the law.   ''Think we should hold emails to and from POTUS,'' Mr. Podesta wrote on March 4, 2015, using the acronym for the president of the United States. ''We could get them to ask for that.''   The State Department has said that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama had exchanged at least 18 emails on her private server, and in January officials there said those messages would be shielded from release, citing the longstanding practice of delaying the release of presidential communications until after the president has left office.   This month, the F.B.I. released a series of records from its investigation, which revealed that Mr. Obama had used a pseudonym to communicate by email, including with Mrs. Clinton and others. The F.B.I. records did not reveal the pseudonym.

Ukrainian Hackers Release Emails Tying Russia to Uprising,"MOSCOW -- A group of Ukrainian hackers has released what it says are the emails of a senior Kremlin official that show a direct Russian role in creating and directing the rebel uprising in eastern Ukraine in 2014. The group claimed to have hacked the account of Vladislav Y. Surkov, for years President Vladimir V. Putin's chief domestic political adviser and now the top official overseeing Russia's Ukraine policy.    The group released what it says are thousands of letters to and from Mr. Surkov's office email account, adding a fat dossier to this year's vast spill of emails around the world and showing high-level Kremlin meddling in Ukraine.    While the authenticity of the documents has yet to be fully established, several of the people who corresponded with Mr. Surkov confirmed that the messages of theirs released by the hackers were the ones they sent.   In a telephone interview, Yevgeny A. Chichvarkin, a Russian entrepreneur living in exile in London, confirmed the authenticity of his emails to Mr. Surkov's aides. ''Yes, this is my original text,'' he said.   The Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, analyzed the emails and determined they were genuine, based partly on the routing information.   The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, flatly denied that emails had been leaked, saying somebody ''must have had to sweat quite a lot'' to forge so many messages.   Mr. Peskov also said that Mr. Surkov does not use email. And, in fact, only aides to Mr. Surkov answered the correspondence, leaving the extent of his personal involvement unclear.   While Russia's hand in Ukraine has hardly been a secret, the emails, if genuine, provide fine-grained detail of Mr. Surkov's office in setting up separatist enclaves in Ukraine's east.   They also shed light on the workaday activity of a propaganda shop, including a rare example of a draft text apparently edited in Mr. Surkov's office that can be compared with a final version.   The Ukrainian group, calling itself CyberHunta -- a mocking reference to the Russian assessment that the Kiev government is a fascist junta -- released 2,337 emails from the address prm_surkova@gov.ru, many from 2014 as the eastern Ukrainian separatists established their mini-states.   The correspondence included the spreadsheet of a budget to set up a small newspaper in Donetsk, the capital of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic.   One email alerted Mr. Surkov's office to rebel casualties in June 2014 that included a paratrooper from Pskov, a town in northern Russia. At the time, there was considerable political sensitivity over the deaths of Russian soldiers in Ukraine.   In another letter, lists of candidates for separatist government positions arrived in Mr. Surkov's inbox before their appointments.   Mr. Surkov, a former advertising executive, is widely seen as an architect of Mr. Putin's domestic political framework and the post-Communist ideology of ''sovereign democracy,'' a term he coined. In 2013, he told an audience in London, ''I am the author, or one of the authors, of the new Russian political system.''   Mr. Surkov apparently received in his email inbox a letter from a Moscow magazine editor with a draft of an ''open letter from residents of the Donbas,'' ostensibly written by local people in Donetsk to describe the horrors of war.   While it is unclear if Mr. Surkov edited it personally, the changes that appear in the published letter suggest a deft eye for trimming and sharpening a text.   ''Ukrainian soldiers and Donbas militiamen are dying,'' the original read. ''Few of them want to risk their lives and kill, most realize this is a fratricidal war.''   The punchier ''Ukrainian soldiers and Donbas militiamen are dying. Most realize this is a fratricidal war,'' wound up in the final version.   In another edit, the original -- ''Our testimony in your eyes should be weightier than the assertions of specialized propagandists'' -- became the subtly improved, ''Our testimony in your eyes outweighs the assertions of specialized propagandists.''   The Obama administration has accused the Kremlin of hacking into the computers of the Democratic National Committee and various Democratic officials and institutions in an effort to discredit the American political system. In recent weeks, there have been reports of high-level meetings at the White House to discuss ways to punish Moscow, including sanctions and covert action against Russian targets.     "
Leaks Lay Bare a Longtime Clinton Adviser's Unflinching Straight Talk,"In one note, Neera Tanden groused that whoever had let Hillary Clinton use a private email address for her State Department correspondence should be ''drawn and quartered.'' In another, she called for Mrs. Clinton to stop stalling on whether she opposed the Keystone pipeline, worrying that ''dodging another issue'' would hurt her in the Democratic primaries.    And when Mrs. Clinton's team dallied over whether to publicly criticize David Brock, a longtime ally, for demanding Senator Bernie Sanders's medical records, Ms. Tanden was blunt.   ''Hillary. God,'' Ms. Tanden wrote. ''Her instincts are suboptimal.''    Ms. Tanden, 46, a longtime policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, is well known on Twitter and cable news for her peppery defenses of Mrs. Clinton and her sarcastic takedowns of Mrs. Clinton's perceived adversaries.   But her private communications with some of Mrs. Clinton's campaign aides, stolen from campaign chairman John D. Podesta and published over the last month by the activist group WikiLeaks, have revealed another side. In a sphere encrusted with suck-ups, soothers, and self-puffery, Ms. Tanden has emerged as a loyal but insistent straight-talker and acute assessor of Mrs. Clinton's stubbornness and weaknesses.   ''What the emails show is somebody who is passionately invested in Hillary Clinton giving the best possible candid advice she can to advance her electoral prospects,'' said Howard Wolfson, a former Clinton aide and a close friend of Ms. Tanden's. He added, ''And giving it privately.''   The Clinton campaign declined to comment on the emails, instead saying that the hack was a product of the Russian government's meddling in the election to benefit Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee.   But as dozens of her stolen messages have gone public, Ms. Tanden's private and profanity-laced commentary has made her something of a cult hero for an unlikely group: Trump supporters. On a Reddit page called ''The_Donald,'' where Trump backers dissect the hacked email releases and post their findings, Ms. Tanden has garnered a slew of unwanted praise. One Trump fan called for a Neera Tanden fan club. Another dubbed her ''NoFilterNeera.''   Most of the stolen emails were exchanges between her and Mr. Podesta, her former boss at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank that Ms. Tanden now leads. Mr. Podesta is a longtime friend, and Ms. Tanden's tone is often that of a colleague grousing in the break room.   In the exchanges, Ms. Tanden can be fiercely protective of Mrs. Clinton. When Jennifer Palmieri, communications director of the Clinton campaign,  wrote a sharply worded letter  raising concerns about coverage of Mrs. Clinton in The New York Times, Ms. Tanden cheered. The letter ''is great,'' she wrote to Mr. Podesta -- adding a sentence laced with profanities directed at the newspaper.   But she could also be direct about other members of Clintonworld and the candidate herself.   When news media reports began identifying potential members of Mrs. Clinton's campaign team last year, Ms. Tanden warned of griping among Democrats about racial and gender balance among Mrs. Clinton's staff picks. ''I'm not the diversity police but there is grumbling on the 4 white boys running next presidential cycle,'' she wrote in January 2015. ''So I recommend rolling out some people who look like the rest of America soon!''   In May 2015, New York City's mayor, Bill de Blasio, emailed Ms. Tanden and Mr. Podesta to let them know that he was scheduled to appear on the MSNBC show ''Morning Joe'' and would likely offer his opinion of Mrs. Clinton's policy vision.   ''I find him a bit insufferable,'' Ms. Tanden wrote to Mr. Podesta. (The mayor was frozen out over the ensuing months and denied a prime speaking slot at the Democratic convention this summer.)   Ms. Tanden's internal critiques may have damaged her relationships with other members of the concentric Clinton circles, and in the immutable fashion of Washington, she seems more likely to be punished than rewarded for her honesty. Asked about the WikiLeaks releases, Ms. Tanden said in an email that while she would not authenticate any of the messages, their leaking had been ''a profoundly painful experience.''   ''Having been a bit beaten up in the media over the last month myself, I have even greater appreciation for someone who has weathered it for 20 years,'' Ms. Tanden said of Mrs. Clinton, calling her a ''role model.'' She added, ''My personal efforts have been to help her be successful.''   Philip J. Crowley, a former Clinton aide at the State Department who resigned in 2011 after publicly criticizing the Department of Defense for its treatment of a soldier accused of classified leaks, said he believed Ms. Tanden would still be welcome in Mrs. Clinton's inner sanctum.   ''Will there have to be some conversations and a couple of beers and a mea culpa afterwards?'' Mr. Crowley said. ''Sure there will. But those who are experienced in the ways of Washington know how to work this.''   Some of Ms. Tanden's sharpest internal criticisms concerned Mrs. Clinton's private email account, which prompted a federal investigation that is plaguing Mrs. Clinton anew. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had uncovered a new trove of emails after seizing an electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton.   When Ms. Tanden first saw news reports about the private account in March 2015, she exchanged a series of emails with Mr. Podesta bemoaning how they had gotten into such a situation in the first place. She singled out other aides, including Cheryl D. Mills, a longtime senior adviser, for not recognizing the danger sooner.   ''This is a cheryl special,'' Ms. Tanden wrote. ''Know you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heel. Or kryptonite. she just can't say no.''   As the controversy wore on, Ms. Tanden griped about the White House ''crapping'' on Mrs. Clinton, and insisted that Mrs. Clinton ought to make a public statement right away. She noted that Mrs. Clinton, after years of enduring attacks and scandals she regarded as trumped-up, had a tendency to be stubborn about acknowledging error.   ''She always sees herself bending to their will when she hands over information, etc.,'' she wrote in August 2015. ''But the way she has to bend here is in the remorse. Not the 'if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do it.' A real feeling of -- this decision I made created a mess and I'm sorry I did that.''   In early September, Mrs. Clinton gave a series of interviews in which she apologized for the email issue. Mrs. Tanden joked that after one of the interviews, she ''was able to breathe again.''   Ms. Tanden was alert to the potential threat posed by Mr. Sanders's outsider campaign. She cautioned Mr. Podesta that aggressively going after Mr. Sanders could backfire.   ''Just game out what that does to Hillary,'' she wrote in August 2015. ''When we went after Obama, she got killed for it. Reaffirmed all her negatives, strengthened him. We had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that, but it was.''   If Ms. Tanden seemed particularly on guard, perhaps it was because she knew what a failed Clinton campaign looked like -- and how painful it could be.   During Mrs. Clinton's 2008 presidential run, Ms. Tanden wrote to Mr. Podesta about her malaise as it ended.   ''I am really profoundly sad today. I thought I was over it,'' she wrote. ''But here I am sad. She's not conceding tonight. ... And not anytime soon, either.''     "
Did Comey Abuse His Power?,"Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007. THE F.B.I. is currently investigating the hacking of Americans' computers by foreign governments. Russia is a prime suspect. Imagine a possible connection between a candidate for president in the United States and the Russian computer hacking. Imagine the candidate has business dealings in Russia, and has publicly encouraged the Russians to hack the email of his opponent. It would not be surprising for the F.B.I. to include this candidate and his campaign staff in its confidential investigation of Russian computer hacking.    But it would be highly improper, and an abuse of power, for the F.B.I. to conduct such an investigation in the public eye, particularly on the eve of the election. It would be an abuse of power for the director of the F.B.I., absent compelling circumstances, to notify members of Congress that the candidate was under investigation. It would be an abuse of power if F.B.I. agents went so far as to obtain a search warrant and raid the candidate's office tower, hauling out boxes of documents and computers in front of television cameras.    The F.B.I.'s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an election.   Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an election. That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election. The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment.   That is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the Office of Government Ethics. I spent much of my career working on government and lawyers' ethics, including as the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush. I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week.   (For the sake of full disclosure, in this election I have supported Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Hillary Clinton for president, in that order.)   On Friday, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent members of Congress a letter about developments in the agency's investigation of Mrs. Clinton's emails, an investigation which supposedly was closed months ago. This letter, which was quickly posted on the internet, made highly unusual public statements about an F.B.I. investigation concerning a candidate in the election. The letter was sent in violation of a longstanding Justice Department policy of not discussing specifics about pending investigations with others, including members of Congress. According to some news reports, the letter was sent before the F.B.I. had even obtained the search warrant that it needed to look at the newly discovered emails. And it was sent days before the election, when many Americans are already voting.   Violations of the Hatch Act and of government ethics rules on misuse of official positions are not permissible in any circumstances, including in the case of an executive branch official acting under pressure from politically motivated members of Congress. Violations are of even greater concern when the agency is the F.B.I.   It is not clear whether Mr. Comey personally wanted to influence the outcome of the election, although his letter -- which cast suspicion on Mrs. Clinton without revealing specifics -- was concerning. Also concerning is the fact that Mr. Comey already made unusual public statements expressing his opinion about Mrs. Clinton's actions, calling her handling of classified information ''extremely careless,'' when he announced this summer that the F.B.I. was concluding its investigation of her email without filing any charges.   But an official doesn't need to have a specific intent -- or desire -- to influence an election to be in violation of the Hatch Act or government ethics rules. The rules are violated if it is obvious that the official's actions could influence the election, there is no other good reason for taking those actions, and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously do want to influence the election.   Absent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it, a public communication about a pending F.B.I. investigation involving a candidate that is made on the eve of an election is thus very likely to be a violation of the Hatch Act and a misuse of an official position. Serious questions also arise under lawyers' professional conduct rules that require prosecutors to avoid excessive publicity and unnecessary statements that could cause public condemnation even of people who have been accused of a crime, not to mention people like Mrs. Clinton, who have never been charged with a crime.   This is no trivial matter. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power. Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future.

Yahoo's Breach Gives Verizon Leverage in Deal Talks,"Yahoo is providing more wiggle room for Verizon Communications. The struggling internet company waited until the day after the election to reveal that a hacker claimed in July to have certain user data. July is when it agreed to a $4.8 billion sale to the telecommunications giant Verizon. The latest assault on Yahoo's reputation gives Verizon extra firepower to snag a better deal.     Yahoo, led by Marissa Mayer, said in a regulatory filing late Wednesday that it had investigated the data thief's claims and found it could not substantiate them. The time frame, though, only raises questions.   Yahoo agreed to sell its advertising and search units to Verizon on July 25. At the time, the company noted that there were no material adverse effects on its businesses, although certain language in the merger agreement addresses security breaches and unauthorized access and gives Verizon a degree of protection.   Then in September, Yahoo dropped a bombshell by admitting that certain information was stolen from at least 500 million user accounts in 2014. That prompted Marni M. Walden, Verizon's president of innovation and new business, to emphasize that the company would ''protect our shareholders and our investors, so we're not going to jump off a cliff blindly.''   Now, it turns out that Yahoo discovered the huge breach after it started an investigation to delve into the previously undisclosed July allegation.   Yahoo stands by its statement that the breach of 500 million accounts has not had a material effect on its business. That said, the company has ''subsequently incurred expenses'' related to the hacking and it expects to incur ''investigatory, legal, and other expenses'' associated with it in the foreseeable future, the filing points out without providing a figure.   Both sides are already negotiating to try to determine how much this has hurt Yahoo's value, never mind its ever-dwindling reputation. The revelation on Wednesday should give Verizon an additional cudgel at the negotiating table.   Jennifer Saba is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

Hacker Who Broke Into Celebrities' Email Accounts Gets 5 Years in Prison,"A Bahamian man who hacked into the email accounts of celebrities and athletes and later wrote in a jailhouse email that after his release he would ''shake up hollywood for real!'' was sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday. The sentence was roughly double the number of years suggested under federal sentencing guidelines.     The man, Alonzo Knowles, 24, had used his illicit access to the celebrity accounts to obtain unreleased movie and television scripts and personal information, which he then tried to sell for thousands of dollars, prosecutors said. Mr. Knowles had also stolen unreleased music, financial documents, and nude and intimate images and videos, the government said.   Kristy J. Greenberg, a prosecutor, said in Federal District Court in Manhattan that Mr. Knowles's motivation had been greed. ''He had a singular focus on becoming rich and famous,'' she said, ''by disseminating personal information of celebrities and exploiting them.''   Several victims had submitted statements to the judge. Naturi Naughton, an actress in the Starz drama ''Power,'' said in a video statement that Mr. Knowles had hacked her personal emails and stolen six scripts of the show, and then ''tried to extort me, the producer, 50 Cent and my showrunner.''   ''I have never felt more violated and out of control in my entire life,'' Ms. Naughton said.   Judge Paul A. Engelmayer of Federal District Court called Mr. Knowles's crimes ''deeply troubling,'' and told him that he had chosen to use ''your gifts, your know-how, for dark and lawless ends.''   When Mr. Knowles pleaded guilty in federal court in May, he apologized, saying he knew what he had done was wrong. But he then wrote in emails sent from jail that he planned to write a book and reveal the secrets of the victims whose accounts he had broken into, the government said.   ''Im name dropping everyone involved and what I know,'' Mr. Knowles wrote, ''and im including pictures of paperwork that aint public.''   He wrote that he would charge $35 a copy, would hack into Twitter accounts to promote his book and that his goal was to make money. ''Everyone loves gossip,'' he wrote. ''I cant wait to get out i already know how the cover is gonna look.''   The emails, which prosecutors cited in a sentencing memorandum to Judge Engelmayer, had been sent on a Bureau of Prisons email system that prisoners may use after they give consent to the monitoring of their messages.   The judge said that Mr. Knowles's jailhouse messages were ''devoid of any remorse,'' and showed that if he were released from prison any time soon, he ''would be a clear and present danger to commit the very same crime again.''   ''Unavoidably, Mr. Knowles,'' Judge Engelmayer said, ''the public has a significant interest in your being behind bars in federal prison where you have no access to the internet and no practical ability to do such harm.''   Mr. Knowles, who had pleaded guilty to charges of identity theft and criminal copyright infringement, read a brief statement, apologizing to the court and his victims. ''What I did was wrong,'' he said. ''I could have ruined people's lives.''   His lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, had asked for a sentence of 14 months. Mr. Knowles had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years; the federal sentencing guidelines, which are not binding on a judge, had suggested 27 to 33 months, his plea agreement shows.   Mr. Knowles was arrested last December after he flew to New York to meet with a man who was posing as a potential buyer of the scripts he had stolen. The man was actually an undercover agent.   The case drew attention in part because it followed the widely publicized hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014. The Knowles case also showed how a hacker could obtain confidential information from victims by targeting the accounts of their friends and associates, a process Mr. Knowles called ''social engineering.''   ''In the wee hours of the night, when his victims were likely asleep, Knowles trolled his victims' private email accounts, obtaining their most personal communications,'' the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, had said in its sentencing memorandum.

Russian Hackers and the Election,"To the Editor: I could not even finish reading ''Hacking the Democrats'' (front page, Dec. 14) without stopping to contact members of Congress to demand any legal means possible to delay those who ''won'' from taking office before more is known about an election that was clearly influenced by Russian hacking.     This was a direct attack on United States elections and our democracy itself. Where is the outrage? President Obama and four senators requesting an investigation is not enough!   A candidate who publicly invited the Russians to hack into his opponent's emails has been elected to the highest position in the nation. Our president-elect, along with members of his campaign team and proposed cabinet, have business relationships with Russia.   Is there not enough evidence for something more to be done? Is there nothing that will prompt our current elected officials, members of the Electoral College and the media to demand more immediate action before these newly elected officials take office?   This is a crisis and way beyond partisan politics. It threatens our national security, and history will not be kind to those who did nothing. How many times have we wrung our hands over our collective inaction when we all knew something more should have been done? Don't make this another one!   To The Times, please keep up your reporting. To readers, write to your elected officials. Demand action now.   MARIE LELLIS   Brooklyn   To the Editor:   Congratulations for your courageous report on the Russian hacking of our political system. To say that I am astounded does not begin to express my feelings about what happened.   Does it surprise me that the Russians engaged in hacking to try to tilt the election in favor of Donald Trump? No. What amazes me was the weakness of the United States response to what was happening over an extended period.   To me, the worst of all was President Obama's inaction. As a strong supporter of the president, I am astounded that he did not address the American people to tell them what was happening. The reasons given in your article as to why this was not done are lame beyond belief.   I wonder whether the American people will become outraged enough to demand an accounting of what happened and why, and its probable impact on the presidential and congressional races.   STEPHEN GREENBERG   Wellfleet, Mass.   To the Editor:   In a world where an increasing number of people seem inclined to dismiss facts, deny hard evidence, embrace alternative versions of truth and shamelessly fabricate outright lies, it is heartening to read this meticulously researched article that reveals how and why these cyberattacks occurred and how they were detected.   Sadly, many will not read this account. Others, including loyalists in Donald Trump's entourage, may launch a barrage of disdainful tweets and emails in an attempt to cast doubt on its revelations. Some will respond with hate mail.   Hopefully, there will be those who will voice their appreciation for your effort and courage in publishing the disturbing results of this investigation, which clearly points to determined Russian attempts to control the political process, both here and abroad.

"In Hacked D.N.C. Emails, a Glimpse of How Big Money Works","Last October, a leading Democratic donor named Shefali Razdan Duggal emailed a sweetly worded but insistent list of demands to a staff member at the Democratic National Committee. Ms. Duggal wanted a reminder of how much she had raised for President Obama and the Democrats (the answer: $679,650) and whether it qualified her for the premium package of hotel rooms and V.I.P. invitations at the party's convention in Philadelphia. She asked whether she could have an extra ticket to Vice President Joseph R. Biden's holiday party, so she could bring her children. But most on her mind, it seemed, was getting access to an exclusive November gathering at the White House. ""Not assuming I am invited...just mentioning/asking, if in case, I am invited :),"" wrote Ms. Duggal, who was appointed by Mr. Obama to oversee the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and is married to a San Francisco financial executive. ""Might you have an intel?""  Ms. Duggal's note was among 19,000 internal Democratic Party emails released on Friday by WikiLeaks, setting off a frenzy on the eve of the party's quadrennial nominating convention and forcing the resignation of the party chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Some of the emails revealed internal discussion by committee officials - obligated under party rules to remain neutral in the presidential primary - about how to discredit Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, enraging some of his supporters. But the leaked cache also included thousands of emails exchanged by Democratic officials and party fund-raisers, revealing in rarely seen detail the elaborate, ingratiating and often bluntly transactional exchanges necessary to harvest hundreds of millions of dollars from the party's wealthy donor class. The emails capture a world where seating charts are arranged with dollar totals in mind, where a White House celebration of gay pride is a thinly disguised occasion for rewarding wealthy donors and where physical proximity to the president is the most precious of currencies. In a statement, Amy Dacey, the chief executive of the Democratic committee, said the party had ""engaged a record number of people in the political process"" and ""adhered to the highest of standards."" The emails reflect the struggles of midlevel staff members in a demanding environment, seeking to bring in money at a steady clip while balancing demands from donors and party officials. Some messages suggest efforts by donors to gain access to prominent Democratic officials on behalf of clients. In May, Lester Coney, an executive at a Chicago-based financial services firm, emailed a party finance staff member seeking a contact with ""clout within the administration."" Mr. Coney appeared to be referring to Gov. Mark Dayton, the governor of Minnesota. ""I have a very importance client/friend needed access with someone within the administration,"" Mr. Coney wrote. ""So I promise him I would investigate."" The staff member appeared worried about the request, writing ""No idea what to tell him here,"" to the party's national finance director, Jordan Kaplan, an Obama campaign veteran with deep ties to Midwestern donors. ""I told him to call rt,"" Mr. Kaplan replied, referring to R.T. Rybak, a Democratic committee vice-chairman and former mayor of Minneapolis. Mr. Rybak, in response to questions from The New York Times on Sunday, said he never heard from Mr. Coney. ""I have no idea what this person wanted but the request was never made to me,"" Mr. Rybak wrote in an email. ""If it had been, I would not have made such a call."" Mr. Coney told The Times that he did not end up speaking to anyone in Minnesota about the query, which he said had been routine. He said he had sought the contact for a friend's client, whom he declined to name. The leaked emails span the period from January 2015 to late May of this year, during which Mr. Obama was the party's chief fund-raising draw but the Democratic National Committee was beginning to raise money jointly with the party's presumed future nominee, Mrs. Clinton. Many revolve around donors' efforts to qualify for top packages at the convention that begins Monday in Philadelphia. Donors who raise $1.25 million for the party - or who give $467,000 - are entitled to priority booking in a top hotel, nightly access to V.I.P. lounges and an ""exclusive roundtable and campaign briefing with high-level Democratic officials,"" according to a promotional brochure obtained by The Times. For some donors, Mr. Obama's personal presence was most important. In an exchange in May, committee finance staff members debated how to preserve a $350,000 fund-raiser to be hosted by Carol Goldberg, an artist, and her husband, Hank Goldberg, a real estate executive. The Goldbergs had been eager to host Mr. Obama at their home, in Chevy Chase, Md. But after White House officials concluded that the extra drive was not a good use of Mr. Obama's time, aides discussed proposing to the family that they could instead host with other donors an event at the Jefferson Hotel, a luxury establishment near the White House. Another staff member, given the task of letting the Goldbergs down, knew they would be disappointed. ""I think the excitement of hosting at home was a big factor,"" he wrote. The Goldbergs pulled out of the fund-raiser. In some cases, the party offered donors the chance to join ""roundtables"" - meetings for major givers disguised as high-minded discussions of national economic and social policy, where wealthy givers are treated as savants and sages. ""Wonderful event yesterday,"" Robert Pietrzak, a New York lawyer and top Obama fund-raiser, wrote to a committee fund-raiser after he participated in an event with Mr. Obama in May. ""A lot of foreign policy, starting with my question on China. The President was in great form."" As is common in national politics, Democratic staff members kept detailed track of every dollar contributed by targeted donors, aiming to get each of the wealthiest givers to ""max out,"" or contribute the maximum legal amount to each party account. The biggest national donors were the subject of entire dossiers, as fund-raisers tried to gauge their interests, annoyances and passions. ""Jon has an off and on again relationship with the DNC. He does not like DWS and feels we don't invite him to enough things,"" read one memo, about Jon Stryker, a prominent gay donor and heir to a medical supply fortune, referring to the committee's chairwoman, Ms. Wasserman Schultz. Few details of fund-raising events were too small to escape notice. Reviewing one seating chart, staff members debated whether to seat Philip Munger, the son of the Berkshire Hathaway billionaire Charles Munger Sr., next to Mr. Obama at a May round table. Mr. Munger was the largest donor to Mr. Obama's political group, Organizing for Action, and a huge potential source of money for the committee. The alternative was Sreedhar Potarazu, a Maryland ophthalmologist whose family members were already major Democratic donors, and who appears to have alienated some within the committee for his persistence. In his push to meet with Mr. Obama, Mr. Potarazu had apparently shared with party officials the story of his battle with cancer, a tactic that some of them viewed as crass. ""The Potarazu family has written $332,250 to us since '13. Munger has written $100,600 (and that's only if you reach back to 2008),"" wrote a committee official in charge of mid-Atlantic fund-raising. ""I don't understand why we'd be rewarding someone for giving to OFA over us. I also don't understand why everyone seems to hate Sreedhar so much."" Mr. Kaplan was firm. ""Phil Munger is one of the largest democratic donors in the country,"" he said. ""He is looking to give his money in new places and I would like that to be to us."" Though some of the leaked emails are highly critical of Mr. Sanders, others show the party's fund-raisers seeking to avoid any appearance that Mr. Obama was favoring Mrs. Clinton. When the party invited John A. Braun, a Virginia-based defense contractor, to what was billed as a discussion with Mr. Obama on economic issues in May, Mr. Braun informed the Democratic committee that he had already written a large check to the party through a fund-raiser held jointly with Mrs. Clinton. ""Could I try to strike a deal with him and push for $20k or $15k so he feels like he's getting a discount for his past support?"" a staff member wrote to Mr. Kaplan. ""I'll pitch him on doing a second max out to get the main line package. I just don't know him and am worried about striking out if he won't do the full."" Party officials ultimately concluded that Mr. Braun would first have to give or raise additional money for the party, to avoid the appearance that Mr. Obama's events were helping raise money for Mrs. Clinton. As they looked to maximize opportunities to bring in money, the party's fund-raisers also grappled with delicate personal considerations among the Obama family, who were unenthusiastic about the demands of wooing donors. There was, however, one potential way to interest Mr. Obama in donor maintenance. In May, Mr. Kaplan emailed each of his regional fund-raising directors with a request: Send the names of donors who would be good golf partners for the president. Mr. Obama, it seemed, was looking to hit the links on his upcoming trips. ""Laugh as you may at this because I did - but if you had to pick people from your regions to play golf with POTUS, who would they be?"" Mr. Kaplan wrote.

Julian Assange Releases More Emails and Defends WikiLeaks' Mission,"Julian Assange operates from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where his internet connection was recently cut off. But that has not stopped him from being one of the most significant and unusual players in the 2016 election campaign in the United States. His WikiLeaks platform has released tens of thousands of hacked emails from inside Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee, making Mr. Assange a reviled figure among supporters of the Democratic nominee and a hero to backers of Donald J. Trump.  On Tuesday morning, Mr. Assange weighed in one last time as Americans headed to the polls, releasing a statement that offered an explanation for making the leaks public, an assertion of impartiality and a defense of the WikiLeaks mission. ""The real victor is the U.S. public, which is better informed as a result of our work,"" Mr. Assange wrote, adding that his organization publishes information as quickly as possible and ""as fast as the public can absorb it."" ""This is not due to a personal desire to influence the outcome of the election,"" he said. Four years ago, Mr. Assange sought and was granted asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London while he was being pursued in a Swedish rape investigation, which he said was a cover for a United States effort to extradite him for publishing a trove of National Security Agency documents. Ecuadorean officials have not sought to evict him, but last month said that his internet access was disabled out of fear that the country was being drawn into Mr. Assange's efforts to interfere with ""electoral processes."" Mr. Assange's operation did not fold, but continued to publish daily releases of emails stolen from the accounts of John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. Clinton's campaign. WikiLeaks published another installment on Tuesday, bringing the total number of messages made public to more than 58,000. The Clinton campaign has declined to authenticate or comment on the emails, saying that the hack, which American intelligence officials believe originated in Russia, waspart of the Russian government's efforts to meddle in the election to benefit Mr. Trump. The emails, at times, have been embarrassing to the Clintons and their closest aides, revealing confidential and candid details about the inner workings of the campaign and the Clinton Foundation. It has also shined a light on the Clintons' private work, including lucrative speeches for banks like Goldman Sachs. While Mr. Assange has made no secret of his dislike for Mrs. Clinton, he said in his Tuesday statement that WikiLeaks published the emails because it had the material and, ""It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election."" The lack of leaks pertaining to Mr. Trump, Mr. Assange said, resulted from the fact that his organization was not in possession of Mr. Trump's information. ""We cannot publish what we do not have,"" he wrote. He went on to criticize The New York Times for withholding ""evidence of illegal mass surveillance of the U.S. population for a year until after the 2004 election,"" which he said denied vital information to voters about George W. Bush. Mr. Assange, though, has faced similar criticism, with the suggestion that the leaks of emails from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were timed to inflict maximum damage or blunt negative stories about Mr. Trump. A first batch of Democratic National Committee emails - which led to renewed anger about the party's treatment of Bernie Sanders's campaign - were released on the eve of the party's summer convention. In the final month of the campaign, WikiLeaks unloaded the emails of Mr. Podesta, which cover a period of several years ending in the spring of 2016. The first portion of those emails were published the same day that a recording surfaced where Mr. Trump was caught on a hot microphone making lewd statements.

Why Russia's Cyberattack Wasn't Stopped; The Run-Up,"WASHINGTON - It was utterly avoidable. In retrospect, anyway. The most brazen, disruptive and manipulative attack on the American electoral system since Watergate - a vast cyberattack by Russia, aimed squarely at Democrats in 2016 - hinged on a series of human errors and institutional misjudgments. In the latest episode of ""The Run-Up,"" we explore how Russia hacked the election, why a foreign power would take such a drastic step and why everyone seemed to react so underwhelmingly to the historic intrusion - from the main target of the attack, the Democratic National Committee, to most powerful Democrat in the country, President Obama.  I traveled to Washington to speak with two of my colleagues, Eric Lipton and David Sanger, who co-wrote a stunning story about out how the hack unfolded, moment by moment, stealing and publishing thousands of pages of embarrassing internal documents from the D.N.C. and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. We may never know if Russia's digital offensive, which spared Donald J. Trump and his Republican allies, cost Mrs. Clinton the election. But we do know how much it hurt candidates in campaigns for Congress. I spoke with a victim of the cyberattack, Annette Taddeo, who believes the embarrassing documents released by Russian hackers were a deciding factor in her defeat this year. ""I don't think we are as shocked as we should be and as angry as we should be,"" Ms. Taddeo tells me. ""This is very alarming to our democracy and everything we stand for."" How do I listen?

Russian Meddling and Europe's Elections; Editorial,"While revelations aboutRussian involvement in the American presidential election rock the United States, there are ominous signs that Russia is spreading propaganda and engaging in cyberattacks in Europe in advance of several national elections next year.  In 2017, Germany, France and the Netherlands will hold elections. It is also possible that Italy will move elections scheduled for 2018 forward in the wake of the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi after voters rejected a referendum on constitutional reforms this month. Candidates who are right-wing populists and friendly toward Russia are gaining ground across Europe, thanks, in part, to Russian interference along the lines of what Moscow was accused of doing in the United States. Russia's goals in Europe appear to be to elect foreign leaders who are sympathetic to Russian expansionism, to weaken NATO and to fan anti-European Union forces. In France, Marine Le Pen's National Front party benefited in 2014 from an $11.7 million Kremlin loan to help finance its campaigns. And the winner of the center-right Les Républicains party's recent primary elections, François Fillon, has called for lifting sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and its war in Ukraine, and for workingwith Russia to curb immigration and prevent terrorism. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders's populist Party for Freedom has surged, witha Donald Trump look-alike ""Make the Netherlands Great Again"" campaign, which is anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim. Mr. Wilders is calling for an exit from the European Union. Matteo Salvini of Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League opposes sanctions on Russia and boasts of his trips to Moscow. Germany is a prime target of interference: Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is running for re-election, has stood strong on defending liberal values, the unity of Europe and sanctions against Russia. Germany's intelligence agency has concluded that Russia was very likely behind the hacking of the Parliament's computer network in 2015, and suspicion is high that it is also behind an attack last month that cut internet and telephone service for 900,000 Germans. There is strong evidence that Russia played a role in the defeat of the Italian referendum, as well as in the Brexit vote in June and a Dutch referendum in April in which voters rejected a treaty to strengthen ties between the European Union and Ukraine. The best way to ensure that Russia doesn't replicate these successes in elections next year is to expose its tactics before voters head to the polls. As Chancellor Merkel put it: ""Cyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. We must inform people a lot on this point."" The future of Western democracies may depend on the success of Ms. Merkel's approach, and on how vigorously other liberal European leaders follow her lead.  "
Feuds! Favors! Name-Calling! But What About Those Russians?,"It's a pretty sensational story, this flood of leaked emails that brought down the chairwoman of the Democratic Party. They contained the kind of salacious details a Washington reporter could salivate over for weeks, and probably will - feuds, favor-trading, name-calling between politicians and donors and the media. For reporters it was a blessed piece of news for a political convention, typically rather scripted affairs.   Only the most important part of the story got pushed to a secondary role: Who were the hackers who leaked the information, what was their ultimate motive and what are they planning next? The answers to these questions will have implications long after this convention and long after either a President Clinton or a President Trump is living in the White House. Two reporters, David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth, have come the closest at The Times to looking into these issues, first in a piece Monday on the potential involvement of President Vladimir Putin of Russia in trying to help Donald Trump win the election. A good piece, played prominently on the website and on A1, but its focus tilted mostly to politics. Today came the story I'd been looking for. Also by Sanger, it said that the F.B.I. has expanded its investigation of the hacked emails and is now trying to determine if people and groups associated with Hillary Clinton were attacked. And he says administration officials are raising the possibility that Russia may be using modern-day espionage to influence an American election. It's hard to think of subjects more important than this. If you missed this story, you could be forgiven. It made the home page - but only as a small element at the bottom of the political package before disappearing altogether.* In print, the story appeared at the bottom of A14. Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor of The Times, said that he viewed this line of coverage as important, but that it was competing for attention during a very newsy period. He also noted that the first story on Putin and Trump got prominent play. ""We have lots of reporting assets on this,"" he said. That's good to hear - and I hope that continues to be true.  The most sensational details of these attacks, whether at the D.N.C. or at Sony, always seem to get the boldest headlines, while the often murky back story - the how and the why - fades to the background.   But if we agree on the danger of our foreign adversaries breaking into government, corporate and private computers in the United States, then what better time to draw public concern to this than when a high-profile attack is in the news?  *After I asked editors here about it, a small headline pointing to the story returned to the home page.

What It's Like to Fight Online Hate,"Brittan Heller has a hard job. The Anti-Defamation League's first director of technology and society, she'll be working with tech companies to combat online harassment. The magnitude of her task became clear as soon as the A.D.L. announced her hire, when she was deluged with anti-Semitic and sexist attacks. In a recent interview, Ms. Heller talked about what companies can do to stop online abuse and how her personal experiences have informed her, and offered advice for others dealing with harassment online.  How did the Anti-Defamation League decide they needed to hire someone to work with tech companies against harassment?   People wanted a focus on tech and combating online hate for years, but recently there's been an increase in online hate. A good personal example of this is that they put out a press release announcing my position and they made an announcement on Twitter as well. Within minutes of A.D.L. announcing this position, I opened up my Twitter feed and I found hateful symbols, I found echoes and swastikas and green frogs and people discussing my death. Within hours it became enhanced with statements of Holocaust denial, and within days it's become ad hominem attacks based on Jewish stereotypes and misogyny. At this point it's not surprising anymore that this occurs, but the speed of it, and the ferocity of it - that I think is shocking. There were two events that people at A.D.L. really took notice of. There was Julia Ioffe's piece about Melania Trump, that resulted in an online and offline campaign of hatred directed against her, and there was a coordinated campaign by white supremacist groups which resulted in death threats and really severe online abuse. Additionally, Jonathan Weisman of The New York Times tweeted a piece about the election and he got similar threats and online abuse. A.D.L. was very concerned that this kind of toxic environment would prompt self-censorship by journalists and really impact public discourse long after the election.  How much is the Trump campaign to blame for the recent rise in online harassment?   A.D.L. is a nonprofit organization, therefore we do not support any particular political party and we do not endorse or reject candidates for office. That said, A.D.L.'s work encompasses fighting bigotry of all kinds, and we encourage all candidates to call out hate. We've been on record engaging with members of the Trump campaign, trying to encourage them to emphasize that hate has no place in the public sphere.  What are social networks already doing to fight harassment? What could they be doing better?   A.D.L. is actually an inaugural member of the Twitter Trust and Safety Council which looks at issues of cyber hate. A.D.L. issued best practices that were supposed to counter online hate in 2014 and they were endorsed by Facebook and Google and Microsoft and Twitter. I've seen an increased emphasis on companies developing technology that helps to identify greater percentages of problematic content proactively, but I think the problem there is the mind-boggling volume. It's not really realistic to assume that a filter or artificial intelligence would be able to review and eliminate hate in real time. I think there's a few things the companies can do when they're faced with this onslaught. First they need to communicate outrage. They have a corporate voice, and they can use this to say that cyber hate is really contrary to their vision of connecting all people. They can ensure that their terms of service and their community guidelines are clear, and more than this they can really improve enforcement and do it transparently. They can offer simplified and user-friendly mechanisms for flagging this content. Going beyond companies, people in Silicon Valley and beyond can promote counter-speech initiatives, grassroots responses or having public persons who are willing to speak out and be a voice for tolerance.  You experienced online harassment in law school. How did your personal experience shape your thinking on this issue?  It was instrumental in making me realize that this issue should be a priority. The reason I went to law school is that I wanted to focus on accountability for crimes that targeted people based on their race or their ethnicity or their gender. When I became a victim of cyber harassment, I really felt what it was like to be targeted online for my gender and my race and my ethnicity, and more than that I felt how terrifying it can feel to be threatened and how powerless this type of abuse can make you feel, especially when it's coming from anonymous sources.  What advice would you give to people who are going through online harassment?  First, I'd say you're not alone. Part of the power that the harassers have is they like to make people feel isolated, and sometimes part of the ongoing harm of these kind of crimes is that you feel like there's no meaningful way for you to fight back, there's no way for you to adequately speak out against what's happening to you. I would not let the harassment take your voice away. You can talk to family, teachers and friends about what you're experiencing and what you've seen. You can be a support for other people experiencing the same thing, and you can call out people who are trying to incite hate online. Also, educate yourself. Look at the terms of service or community guidelines for the type of platforms and social media that you're using, and find out what kind of site that company wants to run. Most say that they don't wish to host hateful content.  This interview has been condensed and edited.   "
Symantec Takes a $500 Million Investment and Will Return Cash to Stockholders,"SAN FRANCISCO --  Fresh off finally completing the sale of a major division to a private equity firm, Symantec is moving forward -- with the help of another big financial investor. Symantec announced Thursday that it had taken a $500 million investment from the investment firm Silver Lake Partners, as the company moves to focus on its core security software and services.    The company also disclosed that it would use both the proceeds from the Silver Lake investment and the cash that it received from selling its Veritas data storage unit for $7.4 billion to return money to shareholders. That will include both share buybacks and a special dividend of $4 a share.    Bringing in Silver Lake, which will gain a seat on Symantec's board, is meant to help support the company as it focuses on its historical strength in security offerings. That effort will include both building out its software and services products and trimming some $400 million in costs.   The investment -- known as a private investment in public equity, or PIPE -- is the latest by Silver Lake, one of the most prominent technology-focused investment firms. Silver Lake has struck similar deals with Avago, a chip maker that recently merged with Broadcom, and with Motorola Solutions.   ''It's a significant capital investment for us,'' Michael A. Brown, Symantec's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''We welcome all interested shareholders, but especially ones who bring in additional expertise.''   Under the terms of the deal, Silver Lake will buy $500 million worth of convertible debt that carries a 2.5 percent coupon and can be exchanged for equity at $21 a share. That is about 10 percent higher than Symantec's stock price as of late Thursday afternoon.   In after-hours trading, shares of Symantec surged.   Ken Hao, the Silver Lake managing partner who led the investment, is also joining Symantec's board.   Both Symantec and Silver Lake have known each other for some time, with the private equity firm having approached Symantec over the years with offers to become partners.   As Symantec moved to sell its Veritas unit to focus on security -- the division was eventually sold to the Carlyle Group -- Silver Lake raised the possibility of a PIPE. A deal came about after several weeks of talks, according to Mr. Brown.   ''Symantec has become now a pure-play security software and services company,'' Mr. Hao said in an interview. ''This is one of the most important markets in the world. We have an opportunity to partner with management and the board and participate in the transformation of the company.''   Such an investment, at least to Symantec, validates the company's belief that it is a leader in security, a field that has only grown in prominence as hackers escalate their attacks.   ''We have the largest footprint and scale of any vendor,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We have more information about the threat landscape than anyone else in the industry.''   Silver Lake's history of PIPEs shows that the firm has used such deals to support deal-making by the companies in which it has invested. The firm supported Avago as it gobbled up other chip makers, culminating in the company's $37 billion deal for Broadcom last spring.   The firm considers future acquisitions as a possibility for Symantec, according to people briefed on the firm's thinking.   But at least for now, Symantec is focused on both returning money to its shareholders and on trimming costs.   ''We do not view ourselves as a roll-up opportunity,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We're interested in being a lot more focused.''     "
How the Government Classifies Information,"The government protects information deemed critical to national security using a classification system that ranks the importance of the information based on how much damage could be caused if it was leaked.  The classification level can change based on the information's current relevance. When questions arise, the government is supposed to err on the side of a lower level. But critics have accused the government of widespread overclassification of information.    Top Secret   The highest level of classification   This classification level contains some of the government's most important secrets.   A leak of information at this level is expected to cause ''exceptionally grave damage'' to national security, according to an executive order from 2009.   Within the ''top secret'' classification, there are designations that further restrict access to information, such as ''sensitive compartmented information'' (the designation of most of the National Security Agency documents released by Edward J. Snowden) and ''special access program.''   Secret   The second highest level of classification   A leak of information at this level is expected to cause ''serious damage'' to national security. A vast majority of the information that Pvt. Chelsea Manning made public through WikiLeaks is classified ''secret'' or below.   Confidential   The lowest classification level   Information at this level, according to the 2009 executive order, ''could be expected to cause damage'' to national security if released without authorization.   Unclassified   Not legally classified   Some unclassified information is still considered sensitive by government agencies and can be specially marked. Among the categorizations are ''for official use only,'' ''sensitive but unclassified'' and ''law enforcement sensitive.''     "
Line in the Sand Over iPhones Was Over a Year in the Making,"WASHINGTON -- Time and again after the introduction of the iPhone nearly a decade ago, the Justice Department asked Apple for help opening a locked phone. And nearly without fail, the company agreed. Then last fall, the company changed its mind. In a routine drug case in a Brooklyn federal court, prosecutors sought a court order demanding that Apple unlock a methamphetamine dealer's iPhone 5S running old, easy-to-unlock software. The company acknowledged that it could open the phone, as it had before. But this time, it pushed back.    ''We're being forced to become an agent of law enforcement,'' the company's lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, protested in court.   That stance foreshadowed this week's showdown between the Obama administration and Apple over the locked iPhone belonging to one of the suspects in the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage. By the time of Mr. Zwillinger's statement, Apple and the government had been at odds for more than a year, since the debut of Apple's new encrypted operating system, iOS 8, in late 2014.    The new technology repeatedly stymied investigators -- the New York authorities said on Thursday that they had been locked out of 175 iPhones in cases they were pursuing. But both sides held out hope for a compromise that would avoid the type of confrontation that occurred this week when a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to comply with the Justice Department's request.   With last October's court filing, the confrontation became all but inevitable. The company left no doubt that it would fight any effort to crack its new, encrypted phones. The only real question was what crime the government would use to press its case.   Apple's stance that day in Brooklyn caught the Justice Department off guard. Despite the issue with iOS 8, the company had continued to cooperate. In the first half of 2015 alone, the company provided data in response to more than 3,000 law enforcement requests, Apple said. And company lawyers gave prosecutors no indication that the drug case against Jun Feng would be any different.   Mr. Feng, 45, claimed to have forgotten his passcode, making his cooperation a moot point even if he were willing to extend it, according to a government filing. Unlike the phone in the San Bernardino case, Mr. Feng's ran iOS 7, an older version of Apple's operating system that does not automatically encrypt its data. The Justice Department figured it would have the information from Mr. Feng's phone within a day.   Mr. Zwillinger said the drug case would be Apple's line in the sand. ''Customer data is under siege from a variety of different directions,'' he said. ''Never has the privacy and security of customer data been as important as it is now.''   It was a delicate period for the Obama administration, which was focused on finding a way to break into the new encrypted iPhones. The F.B.I., in particular, was lobbying hard to win support for that idea in the face of skepticism from Silicon Valley, Congress and the public.   Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, described data privacy as a human rights issue. Backed by leading technologists, Mr. Cook argued that if the company designed a way to defeat encryption for the United States government, that tool would be exploited by hackers or foreign governments like China.   Under the attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., the Justice Department was sympathetic to that point of view, even in the face of an aggressive campaign from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. Mr. Holder favored meeting with technology executives in the hope of finding common ground, current and former Justice Department officials said.   Others in the department strongly disagreed. National security and criminal prosecutors argued that, with the introduction of the encrypted iOS 8, Apple (along with Google, which had started its own encrypted Android phone software) had made thumbing its nose at the government a business strategy. The only hope, these prosecutors argued, was a court fight or an act of Congress requiring companies to provide the government unencrypted data.   Local law enforcement officials, too, were sounding alarms. ''This has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West in technology,'' Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference Thursday, echoing complaints he and others have made for many months. ''Apple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.''   When the attorney general Loretta E. Lynch and her deputy, Sally Q. Yates, took office last year, the F.B.I. and its law enforcement allies found more receptive ears. Ms. Yates, in particular, took up the issue, giving speeches and testifying before Congress alongside Mr. Comey.   Despite the campaign, the White House showed no appetite for legislation. And Apple showed no signs of budging. In a few instances, the two sides appeared bound for a court fight, only to resolve it at the last moment. Last summer, Apple refused to give the Justice Department real-time access to iMessages -- the company's proprietary text messages -- in a gun case. The matter nearly escalated, but Apple eventually turned over some messages that had been backed up to the company's iCloud servers. It was not all that the government wanted, but authorities viewed it as a sign of cooperation.   Such compromises forestalled a major court showdown, but increased the frustration at the Justice Department. Several current and former career prosecutors involved in the issue said they viewed it as hypocritical that Apple encouraged its customers to save its data to iCloud -- which it would turn over to the government -- but regarded the cellphone as sacrosanct.   Then came the Feng case. By refusing to help, the Justice Department thought Apple was sending a clear signal. If it would no longer cooperate with requests to help unlock old phones, there was little chance it would give in and build a way to unlock the new encrypted phones running iOS 8.   ''Forcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,'' Mr. Zwillinger said.   By that time, 90 percent of Apple devices were running iOS 8 or newer versions. The F.B.I. warned that it was only a matter of time before its agents were locked out of a phone in a case with lives at stake.   The San Bernardino attacks, which killed 14 people, presented the F.B.I. with a seemingly perfect test case. One of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, was killed by the police and left behind a locked, encrypted iPhone 5c. The F.B.I. has not been able to unlock it.   Mr. Farook's phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep and Apple says it cannot break the encryption without the password. The F.B.I. wants to write a program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.   But Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.'s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.   The authorities are still interested in more than just Mr. Farook's phone. On Thursday, a team of F.B.I. agents raided the Southern California home of his brother, Syed Raheel Farook, and carted off boxes of belongings. The authorities would not say what they were searching for.   But there is no telling what is on Mr. Farook's phone -- maybe clues to accomplices or his inspiration, maybe nothing -- but nobody in the government questioned the need for obtaining access to that data. From a public relations standpoint, Apple had been on the side of privacy advocates and civil libertarians. This case put the company on the side of a terrorist.   ''They need to figure that out now before there is that bigger body count. So this is as good a test case as any to have that fight,'' said Ron Hosko, who until 2014 led the F.B.I.'s criminal division. ''Crack that thing for me now, Tim Cook, because it's only going to get worse.''   This week, the Justice Department got its wish when Apple was ordered to override its defenses, even if it meant building a tool that did not exist.   Law enforcement officials cheered the ruling, though they acknowledged that the fight was not over. Apple promised to appeal. In New York, William Bratton, the police commissioner, held up a phone that he said was used by an associate of a man who shot and wounded two police officers in the Bronx recently.   ''Despite having a court order, we cannot access this iPhone,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''Just one example, a very significant example in which two of my officers were shot, that impeding that case going forward is our inability to get into this device.''   The case in Brooklyn continues, even though Mr. Feng has already pleaded guilty. While the Justice Department sees the San Bernardino incident as its ideal test case, Apple is hoping for a legal win in Brooklyn.   Judge James Orenstein has given the company reason to be hopeful. In the past, he has been skeptical of the way the government uses an 18th-century law -- the All Writs Act -- that the Justice Department is now claiming gives it the authority to force Apple to unlock the phones. He once even described the Justice Department's use of it as a ''Hail Mary play.''   But he has yet to rule.

Giving Watchdogs Access to Government Records,"To the Editor: ''Let Inspectors General Do Their Job'' (editorial, March 9) correctly noted that the Justice Department supports giving its inspector general access to the information he needs to do his work. To ensure that the inspector general gets this information as quickly as possible, the department has implemented procedures to expedite his access to department records and has proposed legislation to permanently erase questions about such access.     But we strongly object to how the editorial characterized both current law and the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion on inspector general access. Contrary to the editorial's suggestion, the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion did not ''defend'' an ''obstructive'' action or policy. It provided a reasoned legal analysis of the department's obligations to guard information lawfully obtained from wiretapped phone conversations, grand jury investigations and private credit reports.   Furthermore, current laws protecting such information do not just prevent it ''from being disclosed publicly,'' as the editorial states. They prevent it from being disclosed at all, even inside government, except to the limited categories of individuals identified in those laws -- none of which expressly include inspectors general. It is these tight limits on disclosure, combined with the failure to expressly provide for inspector general access, that created the difficult legal question the Office of Legal Counsel considered.   The opinion concluded that nothing in the laws at issue prohibits the inspector general from obtaining protected information when investigating the department's law enforcement operations. And we are not aware of any instance in which the inspector general has not received the information he sought because of the restrictions in those laws.   PETER J. KADZIK   Assistant Attorney General   for Legislative Affairs   Washington   To the Editor:   The revelation that inspectors general have been stymied in doing their jobs comes, unfortunately, as no surprise, given this administration's avidity in pursuing the persecution and prosecution of whistle-blowers.   For an administration that initially announced itself as being committed to behaving as the most transparent of any in history, its self-protective performance demonstrates President Obama's naïveté regarding permissible secrecy within the federal government. The public's dismay at this reneged promise calls for an on-the-record interview with the president or a question at a news conference to hear his explanation for this failure.   After all, the legislation to create inspectors general and to protect whistle-blowers is the public's last resort for holding the government accountable for its misdeeds.

Employee of the Panama Papers Law Firm Is Arrested in Switzerland,"GENEVA -- An employee of the law firm at the center of the leaks of the Panama Papers, which have revealed offshore wealth held in secretive accounts worldwide, has been arrested here on charges of data theft, one of the employee's lawyers, Romain Jordan, said on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear what connection, if any, the person might have had with the Panama Papers, a trove of 11.5 million documents from a Panama-based law firm, Mossack Fonseca. A consortium of news organizations began publishing findings from the documents -- some dating to the 1970s -- in April, and the disclosures have prompted investigations of politicians and other prominent figures around the world.     On Wednesday, the Swiss newspaper Le Temps reported that an information technology employee in the Geneva office of Mossack Fonseca had been arrested on suspicion of stealing confidential information. Computer equipment was seized as part of the inquiry, Le Temps reported.   Asked about the report, a spokesman for Claudio Mascotto, the chief prosecutor in Geneva, declined to comment. The spokesman said only that the office had opened a criminal investigation based on a complaint filed by Mossack Fonseca. The employee's name was not made public, and the lawyer did not give his client's name or provide any detail about him.   Le Temps quoted a lawyer for Mossack Fonseca, Thierry Ulmann, as saying: ''What we know is that the data were removed from his computer in Geneva and that this I.T. worker had full access privileges.''   The law firm filed a complaint against the worker for illegal removal of data and for violating the confidentiality of the law firm, Mr. Ulmann told Le Temps.   Mr. Ulmann could not be reached for comment on Wednesday evening.   Mr. Jordan, reached by phone, confirmed that his client had been charged with data theft but said only, ''I can confirm that my client is denying all the charges made against him.''   The Panama Papers leaks originated with an anonymous source who approached the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Daunted by the volume of data involved, the newspaper turned for help to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a nonprofit group in Washington that has coordinated several global projects on financial data leaks.   The New York Times, which was not initially part of the consortium but now has access to the documents, reported this month that Mossack Fonseca had at least 2,400 clients over the past decade who were based in the United States, and that it had set up at least 2,800 companies on their behalf in the British Virgin Islands, Panama, the Seychelles and other jurisdictions that help individuals or corporations to hide wealth.   In a statement last month, under the pseudonym John Doe, the source offered to come forward if offered immunity from prosecution.   Bastian Obermayer, an investigative reporter at Süddeutsche Zeitung who received the original leak on the Panama Papers, said on Wednesday that the man arrested in Geneva was not his source who leaked the documents, but left open the possibility that there might be more than one person behind the leaks.   In a phone interview, Mr. Obermayer said of the man arrested in Geneva, ''We can say that it is not the person that we have been in contact with,'' a statement he also made on Twitter.   It remains possible, Mr. Obermayer said, that the arrested man might have been involved in procuring the information -- and that several people might have been involved in securing the information that was ultimately released.   But Mr. Obermayer emphasized that this was speculation. He said that he only had contact with a single source and that he was confident that that source had not been arrested.   ''There is still a theoretical possibility that John Doe is many persons, and one of them might be this person,'' Mr. Obermayer said.   Marina Walker Guevara, the deputy director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, said on Wednesday that she could not comment on the arrest in Geneva.     "
Equity Firm Continues a Shopping Spree,"Follow Michael J. de la Merced on Twitter @m_delamerced. SAN FRANCISCO -- In an ever-crowded field of investors pouring money into the technology industry, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts was among the first. And with a nearly $2 billion deal, the investment giant will extend its multibillion-dollar flurry of activity from the past year.  On Tuesday, K.K.R. announced its acquisition of Optiv Security, a provider of cybersecurity services, adding to a list of deals over the past five months that include the purchase of the cloud-based software company Epicor and the call-center software maker Calabrio.    Though the American private equity firm has had a technology investment practice for decades -- George R. Roberts, a co-founder, has long been based in Menlo Park, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley -- the firm has been building its presence in that sector in recent years.   It is in the process of closing its first fund dedicated to so-called growth investments -- in large and more developed tech start-ups -- after having earlier removed such deals from its balance sheet. (Those investments included stakes in the speakers maker Sonos and the daily fantasy site FanDuel.)   K.K.R. has also continued to strike leveraged buyouts for the likes of Epicor. And it is increasingly investing in publicly traded companies, serving as a management-friendly investor.   ''We're trying to be on offense,'' Herald Chen, a co-head of K.K.R.'s tech practice, said in a telephone interview.   Over all, Mr. Chen said, K.K.R. is looking for companies seeking international growth, so that it can assist them in finding and financing acquisitions of their own.   Even as the field of investors in tech firms has grown more crowded -- from traditional venture capital firms and leveraged-buyout specialists to more unusual entrants, like the Japanese tech giant SoftBank -- Mr. Chen said his company had not experienced difficulty finding new investments.   K.K.R.'s deal for Optiv would see it take over a company that operates in a sector of enormous growth after a series of high-profile security breaches at corporations and government agencies.   Optiv was formed in 2015 with the merger of two cybersecurity providers, Accuvant and FishNet Security. The resulting company originally sold cybersecurity software, but it has since broadened its offerings to provide security consulting services.   Optiv, which had $947.3 million in revenue in 2015, filed confidentially for an initial public offering last year and revealed the plans last month. But Mr. Chen said K.K.R. had been approached by Optiv's bankers early last month about the possibility of buying the company.   ''We walked away thinking that this was a very, very interesting platform,'' Mr. Chen said. ''They were selling cybersecurity software and technology and platforms, but because they're in the middle of selling all of those systems, they see all of the potential threats.''   The company is owned by a group of investors that includes the Blackstone Group, which would keep a minority stake in the business.   The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.     "
China's Tough Cybersecurity May Get Tougher,"HONG KONG -- It has been a tough year in China for America's technology companies. Uber sold off its operations there. Beijing ordered some of Apple's services shuttered. And Microsoft faced a new inquiry.    Now, in the final days of 2016, China's internet regulator suggested the coming year may be even trickier. A report by the regulator on Tuesday suggested it would formalize a cybersecurity review system on tech products in the country.   That could mean another problematic step for foreign tech firms in what has already become a tough market. The report did not offer details about what the government checks would look for, but the language was similar to that described in an article in The New York Times in May about foreign companies quietly submitting to security checks targeting encryption and data storage.    Over the course of 2016 and part of 2015, a number of major foreign technology companies were subject to secretive Chinese security reviews. During the checks, Chinese officials would ask employees of the companies to answer questions about products in person. The reviews are run by a committee of engineers and experts with ties to the country's military and security agencies.   The checks have already raised alarms among American tech companies, and if formalized, they could create a new standoff between China and the United States over internet policy.   The report, the first of its kind released by the regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, is part of a broader effort to streamline cybersecurity management in the country. More broadly, it outlined other details of efforts to enhance already unprecedented internet controls in China. For example, the report also doubles down on a cybersecurity law passed last month that raised concerns among human rights groups and foreign companies.   Beijing has struggled to balance its goal of fostering innovation with its desire to keep control over a communication medium it believes could be destabilizing. While it includes boilerplate references to opening up, the report makes clear that the government will continue to err on the side of control for now.   In a section subtitled ''Peace,'' the report said that Beijing would work to get ahead of a global cybersecurity arms race threatening international peace. In another part, the regulator said that China would use military means if necessary to protect its internet sovereignty. China has said in the past that the internet represents a new realm, akin to space, in which it must assert its rulership rights.   The new report is the clearest signal yet of the government's intent to crystallize those checks into a formal policy.   The document includes a long list of economic sectors that could be deemed sensitive, which could mean that they would eventually be required to use only computing equipment approved by regulators. The sectors include energy, finance, traffic, education, research, industry, water management, manufacturing and health care, as well as communications systems and the internet.   To some degree, bringing the checks into the open would be welcome. Some people who were aware of the security checks on encryption and data storage complained that they were vaguely defined and treated as a secret. For foreign companies, that left open the possibility that the checks could be used to extract trade secrets or to find weaknesses in products for state hackers.   Still, if China were to be more public about the checks, it could lead to copycat policies from other countries, analysts have said.   Drafts of proposed Chinese laws are typically released to domestic and foreign companies for comment. In this case, the reviews were carried out without formal legislative process, meaning that companies had little room to push back.     "
Social Security Retreats From Cellphone-Based Online Security,"Never mind -- at least, for now. That's what the Social Security Administration told those with online ''mySocialSecurity'' accounts, two weeks after announcing that they would be required to have cellphones to receive security code texts in order to log on to the accounts.    Social Security recipients can use the online accounts to manage their benefits, such as selecting a bank account for automatic deposit. Workers who don't yet receive benefits can use the accounts to obtain estimates of future benefits and to check their earnings statements to make sure the estimates are based on correct information.    After an outcry from older Americans, as well as a letter from two United States senators, the agency backed off the cellphone-based code requirement.   ''Our aggressive implementation inconvenienced or restricted access to some of our account holders,'' said a statement emailed by an agency spokesman, Mark Hinkle. ''We are listening to the public's concerns and are responding by temporarily rolling back this mandate.''   The change means users can log on to their online ''mySocialSecurity'' accounts as before, with just a username and password. If they want, they can choose the text option as added security feature, as has been the case since the accounts were first offered in 2012.   The agency made text codes mandatory on July 30, saying it was doing so to comply with an executive order requiring federal agencies to upgrade their online security. The codes served as a type of multifactor authentication, in which information beyond a user name and password is used to help protect sensitive personal information online. Many banks and online services offer text verification.   But many people, especially older ones, complained that the requirement was unreasonable; fewer older Americans use cellphones, and some said they found texting difficult. In addition, technical glitches hampered access to the site, even for users with texting capability.   On Aug. 12, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, chairwoman of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, and Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, the ranking minority member, wrote to the Social Security Administration to express concern. While they understood the rationale for the change, they said, methods for stronger fraud protection ''must be considered relative to the needs and circumstances of the target population.''   ''The new policy puts a high burden on American seniors, many of whom may not own a cellphone,'' they wrote.   On Aug. 13, the Social Security Administration removed the texting requirement and said it planned to introduce alternative authentication options, in addition to texting, within the next six months.   ''We regret any inconvenience individuals may have experienced,'' the administration's statement said.   Here are some questions and answers about Social Security benefits:   Should I use the optional text-code feature?   The Social Security Administration's website ''highly'' recommends that users who have a text-capable cellphone sign up for the text-verification option. Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, says other methods of multifactor authentication -- like smartphone apps that create one-time codes -- offer superior protection, but that the text option at least provides some benefit. ''Certainly, set it up,'' he said. ''A little extra security is better than no extra security.''   What if I don't want to manage my Social Security benefits online?   Even if you don't expect to be a regular user of a mySocialSecurity account, there may be a benefit to establishing one. Creating an account can help prevent someone from fraudulently creating one with stolen information, because the system allows creation of just one account per Social Security number, says  Brian Krebs, a security blogger.   So if you already have an account, a criminal who obtained personal information, like your Social Security number, couldn't create one to try to steal your benefit payments.   The Social Security Administration offers similar advice.   Can I block all electronic access to my Social Security data?   Yes. The Social Security Administration website notes that victims of identity theft or those who have suffered domestic violence may want to block electronic access to their Social Security record by following steps on the website.   Doing so prevents anyone -- including you -- from gaining access to your record, both online and through the agency's automated telephone system.     "
Disconnecting From a Virtual Private Network,"Q. I installed a virtual private network program on my iPhone to use for protection when public Wi-Fi was the only connection option around, but now I can't turn it off. In the iPhone's connection settings, I keep flipping the VPN button to Off, but it turns itself back on. What do I do?  A. Virtual private network apps (like Cloak, TunnelBear and VyprVPN) create a secure, encrypted connection over public wireless networks. They do this so you can surf with less worry about someone with malicious intent intercepting your data; some apps can also hide your phone's physical location and make it appear as if you are in a different country. As a protective measure, your VPN app may be set to start up and connect automatically each time you use the Internet.    If you open the iPhone's Settings icon and find that the VPN button near the options for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Cellular stubbornly refuses to switch off, scroll down a bit and tap General. On the General settings screen, flick your way down until you get to the VPN setting. Select it to go to the next screen, which should contain the settings for the personal VPN app you are using. Tap the app name or ''i'' icon to see information about the app. If you see a Connect on Demand or other button indicating that the app will connect automatically, turn off the setting there.   Depending on the VPN app you are using, you may also find configuration controls and settings within the app itself, and its developer's site should have support information. When the VPN has been successfully disabled, the small VPN icon at the top of the iPhone's status bar should not be visible when you are using a network connection.

China's Internet Speed Ranks 91st in the World,"Follow Edward Wong on Twitter @comradewong. BEIJING -- Anyone who spends any time online in China knows surfing the internet is like wading through quicksand. That is especially true when browsing websites not hosted on a Chinese server. This week, an online report published in China Daily, a state-run, English-language newspaper, said that China, the world's second-largest economy, ranked an abysmal 91st in the world in internet speed, with the average broadband connection scored at a mere 9.46 megabits per second, or Mbps. There are nearly 200 countries in the world.    The report ranked the top five countries in internet speed as South Korea, Sweden, Norway, Japan and the Netherlands. The average broadband speed in South Korea was reported as 26.7 Mbps. In Sweden, it was 19.1 Mbps.    The data was part of a broader report that was aimed at boasting of China's internet connectivity, under the title ''Evolution of the Internet in China.'' The report listed as its sources the China Internet Network Information Center, an agency under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; the website of People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper; the Broadband Development Alliance, a research group; and Akamai Technologies, a content delivery network and cloud services provider based in Cambridge, Mass.   The report promoted the fact that China now has 688 million people online, about half the population; that it added 40 million new internet users in 2015; and that 90 percent of users can get online via their mobile phones.   It also said 358 million people now make financial transactions using online payment tools.   The statistics showing China's poor internet speed were relegated to the bottom of the page.   Many foreign websites -- including The New York Times, Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube -- are blocked by the Great Firewall, the system of internet censorship in China. People who want to visit those sites must use software that provides a virtual private network, or VPN, which allows the user to go through a foreign server to get to the websites. That slows down internet use even more. VPNs are also less reliable than ever in China, constantly dropping out.   Key footnote: it only gets that high if you accessing government websites https://t.co/2NRXcSkhGl -- Christopher Balding (@BaldingsWorld) June 2, 2016   In April, the man credited with developing the Great Firewall, Fang Binxing, had to use a VPN to try to enter South Korean websites during a presentation he was giving at his alma mater, the Harbin Institute of Technology. The VPN kept dropping out, forcing him to ad-lib some of his presentation.   Many people in China do not watch videos hosted on non-Chinese servers because the videos download or stream too slowly.   During politically sensitive periods, internet speed becomes molasseslike, especially in Beijing. This happens every spring around the time of the annual legislative conclave here.   During mass protests and violence, China can shut down access to the wider internet in entire regions, forcing users to rely on a very limited intranet. This was enacted for one year in Xinjiang, in the west, after ethnic violence erupted there in 2009.   There is also extremely limited internet access in some Chinese-ruled Tibetan areas where Tibetans have self-immolated to protest government policies.   Last October, a report on internet freedom by Freedom House, a prominent American pro-democracy group, ranked China last among 65 nations, behind Iran, Cuba and Myanmar. (North Korea was not part of the report.) China has been steadily falling in the rankings in the annual report. In 2014, it ranked third to last, ahead of Iran and Syria.   The report said that ''over the past year, the renewed emphasis on information control led to acts of unconcealed aggression against internet freedom.''     "
French Company Building Indian Submarines Suffers Major Data Leak,"Follow David Jolly on Twitter @davjolly. Detailed plans for stealth submarines built by a French military manufacturer for the Indian navy have been leaked, raising concerns over the company's digital security just months after it signed a multibillion dollar deal to build submarines for Australia. Officials in France and India were scrambling on Wednesday to assess the damage from the leak, with both countries opening investigations. It appears to be the latest example of a company's critical internal information falling into the wrong hands, and it comes with the Indian navy scheduled to put the first of the submarines into service later this year.     In all, 22,400 pages detailing ''the entire secret combat capability'' of six Scorpène-class diesel-electric submarines being built for the Indian navy were leaked to The Australian, the newspaper reported on Wednesday, without identifying its source.   The publication said the leak from the French manufacturer DCNS included technical manuals and other sensitive information, including details of the submarines' secret stealth technology, torpedo-launching systems and its many intelligence-gathering systems.   The data was reportedly taken from France in 2011 by a former French Navy officer, and it then made its way to a company in Southeast Asia, but it was unclear how widely the leaked data had been shared.   DCNS, a naval contractor that is majority owned by the French government, is building the submarines with a local partner in a Mumbai shipyard. It has already sold some versions of the submarine to Malaysia and Chile, and Brazil is to take delivery of several more in the coming years.   ''It looks like a case of hacking,'' Manohar Parrikar, the Indian defense minister, told reporters outside an event in New Delhi. The report is being investigated by military officials, his ministry said in a statement, adding that the source of the leak appeared to be ''from overseas and not in India.''   The impact of the lost data, and particularly whether it would affect the Indian naval fleet's capabilities, was not immediately clear.   ''It's troubling. It is a challenge, but we don't have to assume that the adversary has everything,'' Robbin F. Laird, a military and security analyst, said.   That the plans date to 2011 meant the data would be of limited use to India's opponents, he said. ''You could have grabbed the answers to the exam for five years ago, but the exam has changed since then.''   The DCNS leak seems to be the latest example of companies falling victim to corporate espionage, both to those trying to sell the data as well as to state actors.   In 2014, the United States Justice Department indicted five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and charged them with hacking into the networks of Westinghouse Electric, United States Steel and other companies.   Repercussions of the leak could extend to Australia. In April, the country's government chose DCNS for its biggest ever defense procurement deal.   That $38 billion program will see the French company help to design and build Australia's new Shortfin Barracuda submarines. DCNS and its French partners beat out intense competition from military manufacturers in Germany and Japan for the contract.   Christopher Pyne, the Australian defense industry minister, said the leak ''has no bearing'' on his country's submarine program.   DCNS said in a statement that it was aware of the reported leak, and added that it was being ''thoroughly investigated by the proper French national authorities for defense security.'' The French Defense Ministry did not immediately reply to requests for comment.   The Asia-Pacific region is on track to overtake Europe as the world's second-largest submarine market, after the United States, according to Sravan Kumar Gorantala, an analyst at Strategic Defense Intelligence. It will expand to $11 billion in value by 2025, as China takes an increasingly assertive stance over island claims in the South China Sea, as well as naval expansion by India, Australia and South Korea.

Protecting Your Twitter Account,"Q. How do Twitter accounts get hacked and how can I protect mine if I see tweets that I didn't write? A. Twitter accounts can get hacked and hijacked in many of the same ways that other computer-based accounts become compromised. Intruders can crack weak, easily guessed passwords by hand or with software. You may unknowingly supply your password to a phishing message or site -- or to someone else on an unsecure network. If you use the same password for multiple accounts, someone could gain access to your Twitter account after cracking your password elsewhere. Malicious software like a keylogger could be on your computer and sending personal information back to someone else.     Because third-party programs like news and photo-sharing apps have the ability to post to your Twitter account after you authorize them, some of those apps can also be a security risk. For example, if you authorize an app with weak security of its own to use your Twitter account to post jokes or headlines -- and that other app gets hacked -- your Twitter account may get compromised as well.   If you have been using Twitter for a while and are not sure what apps can post to your account, you may want to visit your settings page and review them. To do so, log into your Twitter account on the web, click your profile photo at the top of the page and choose Settings from the menu. On the left side of the Settings page, click Apps to see what other programs and services can post to your account. If you see one you no longer use or want to dump, click the Revoke Access button to sever the connection.   While you are on your Twitter Settings page, you can also turn on login verification, which requires a numeric code (typically sent to your mobile phone) as well as a password to log into your account. If you suspect your account has been hacked, visit Twitter's support site for support and a list of account security tips.

Facebook Chief Sides With Apple Against F.B.I. Over Terrorist's iPhone,"BARCELONA, Spain -- Mark Zuckerberg on Monday threw his support behind Apple in its bitter battle with the United States government over attempts to gain access to information protected by the company's sophisticated encryption technology.  Speaking at the Mobile World Congress, an annual tech and telecommunications conference here, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook would play its part in the fight against global terrorism, but that weakening the digital security of technology companies was a bad idea.    A federal magistrate judge, at the Justice Department's request, recently ordered Apple to bypass security functions on the phone of a gunman in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. But the company has refused to comply with that order, fearful that it could be forced to create a so-called back door to its encryption technology that could be misused by government agencies.   ''I don't think building back doors is the way to go, so we're pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,'' said Mr. Zuckerberg, in reference to Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook.   Mr. Zuckerberg's comments mirror previous statements that Facebook and other global tech companies have made in support of Apple's standoff with the government.   While these companies have said they would comply, when legally obliged to, with handing over information on their users, they say they believe that creating technological back doors to their digital systems can lead to potential abuse by governments worldwide.   For Facebook, which has almost 1.6 billion global users, the encryption debate is only one of the growing number of policy hurdles that the company needs to overcome as it expands its global presence.   In India, one of the company's largest markets, the country's national regulators this month banned free mobile data programs that favor some Internet services over others. Facebook had introduced Free Basics, which offered people no-fee access to a text-only mobile version of the company's social network, as well as to certain news, health, job and other services.   Speaking on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company wanted to offer Internet connectivity to the developing world that did not have digital access and that Facebook would look for ways to continue doing that in India and beyond.   ''It's disappointing to the mission that we're trying to do,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said about the recent decision in India that outlawed Free Basics. ''What works in one country may not work in another.''   Despite his attempts to downplay the setback, the recent decision by Indian regulators has put Facebook and its 31-year-old chief executive in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality.   Internet giants like Facebook and Google can expect more scrutiny around the world as they continue to expand, said Pierre Louette, a deputy chief executive of Orange, the former French telecommunications monopoly. When confronted with this scrutiny, he added, tech companies may look to build bridges with traditional telecom operators that have faced similar regulatory challenges for decades.   ''They need more friends than before,'' said Mr. Louette, in reference to global tech companies.     "
An Industry Lines Up Behind Apple,"Dozens of tech companies and organizations on Thursday are expected to file legal briefs in support of Apple's privacy position. The support will appear like a united front against the government, which is trying to get Apple to help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in the terrorist attack last year in San Bernardino, Calif.  As Nick Wingfield and Mike Isaac report, the support, in many cases, took a little time in coming and involved some hand-wringing. Still, the final decision to support Apple, they write, shows that many in Silicon Valley believe that it could have profound implications on the trustworthiness of their products.    That could be part of the reason that Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter sought some middle ground in the debate on Wednesday. In a speech at a digital security conference in San Francisco, he said he was not in favor of a ''back door'' that would give the government access to data that is protected by encryption.   Of course, the software Apple is being asked to create is considered by some to be considered a back door because it could provide special access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible because of passwords or encryption. Still, the tone coming from some government officials seems to be changing somewhat. Maybe that united front is already working.     "
"After You Strengthen Your Passwords, Here's How to Store Them","THE recent revelation that the account information of at least 500 million Yahoo users was stolen in 2014 was a big reminder that we all need to be smarter about our digital security. That includes our smartphones, which are increasingly the repositories for all sorts of information about our digital lives. Turning our smartphones into personal data fortresses requires the use of strong passwords -- and never using the same password for different services. Fortunately, there are plenty of apps that can help you remember all those passwords.     Dashlane, which is free to download for iOS and Android devices, is an excellent secure password system. The app, which is essentially a digital strongbox for all your online keys, has just one master password to remember. After you enter that password (which should be very strong), you have access to all your other passwords inside the app.   This means people can move beyond using easy-to-remember passwords like ''123456'' and use longer, more complex passwords that are more difficult for hackers to crack. To help, Dashlane has a password generator that users can customize, for instance by varying the length of passwords or specifying whether they should include nonletter symbols.   Dashlane can automatically update passwords, a feature that is compatible with many websites including IFTTT and Kickstarter. You can also create your own passwords, and Dashlane will analyze how hacker-resistant they are and flag any passwords that have already been used elsewhere.   Dashlane has a built-in browser that is designed to be secure, so people can shop or bank online with fewer worries about having their information compromised. It also allows users to securely share passwords with others -- a useful feature for anyone with shared accounts.   An upgraded version, which costs $40 a year, provides extras like cloud-based backup of your password information and secure sharing of passwords between different devices.   If Dashlane's price and more businesslike look do not suit you, try Keeper, free for iOS and Android. Like Dashlane, Keeper is a secure password vault with an automatic password generator and other features.   But Keeper also has a more graphics-rich interface, which includes useful popover hints and tips when you start using the app. And it lets you file your passwords in folders to help separate personal and work accounts. The folders can also hold other information, such as bank account numbers, that you do not want to be accessible outside the app.   As an additional layer of security, Keeper has an Apple Watch and Android Wear connection that lets you log in via your smartwatch. The idea is that if someone steals your phone, they probably will not have your watch too.   Keeper lacks Dashlane's automatic password update feature, and some of Keeper's more powerful features, such as cloud-based backup and cross-device password syncing, require upgrades that cost $10 and up.   Of course there are also a few well-established favorite apps in this category. The best known is 1Password. The app has a wide range of features apart from storing passwords, including storing credit card information and autofilling payment fields on online shopping sites. This app promises strong encryption to protect data even if you lose your smartphone, and it has an Apple Watch app so you can see password information on your wrist.   I'm not a fan of this app's interface because I find it easy to lose my place in its menus. But 1Password is powerful and has free versions for Android and iOS. An upgraded version, with access to all its features, costs $10.   LastPass, a popular app for iOS and Android, is also worth trying. It acts as a secure vault for information like credit card numbers, and its jaunty interface makes the business of managing passwords seem less drab.   If you're an Android user, have a look at KeePassDroid, too. This password manager is free and based on open-source architecture. It features strong encryption and its plain but functional interface make it seem less fussy than some of its competitors.   Quick Calls   Guntai is a stunning new minimalist game for iOS that places you in control of a flock of birds traveling across difficult terrain. The app's beautiful graphics, combined with its simple gameplay, may remind you of console games like Flower. It is hard but seems easy at first, and keeps you coming back for more fun. It costs $4.   The popular social networking app Meetup, which encourages users to meet in person and join activities, has been redesigned. It makes recommendations based on your interests and emphasizes gatherings that people nearby are already planning. It is free for iOS and Android.     "
Apple Updates iOS to Patch a Security Hole Used to Spy on Dissidents,"SAN FRANCISCO -- One of the world's most evasive digital arms dealers is believed to have been taking advantage of three security vulnerabilities in popular Apple products in its efforts to spy on dissidents and journalists. Investigators discovered that a company called the NSO Group, an Israeli outfit that sells software that invisibly tracks a target's mobile phone, was responsible for the intrusions. The NSO Group's software can read text messages and emails and track calls and contacts. It can even record sounds, collect passwords and trace the whereabouts of the phone user.    In response, Apple on Thursday released a patched version of its mobile software, iOS 9.3.5. Users can get the patch through a normal software update.    Apple fixed the holes 10 days after a tip from two researchers, Bill Marczak and John Scott Railton, at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and Lookout, a San Francisco mobile security company.   ''We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,'' said Fred Sainz, a company spokesman.   In interviews and manuals, the NSO Group's executives have long boasted that their spyware worked like a ''ghost,'' tracking the moves and keystrokes of its targets, without leaving a trace. But until this month, it was not clear how exactly the group was monitoring its targets, or who exactly it was monitoring.   A clearer picture began to emerge on Aug. 10, when Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, who has been tracked by surveillance software several times, began receiving suspicious text messages. The messages purported to contain information about the torture of U.A.E. citizens.   Mr. Mansoor passed the messages to researchers at the Citizen Lab, who confirmed they were an attempt to track him through his iPhone.   This latest effort was far more sophisticated than what was found aimed at his devices before. The researchers found it was connecting to 200 servers, several of them registered to the NSO Group. Strewn throughout the spyware code were references to Pegasus, the name of an NSO Group spyware product.   Citizen Lab brought in Lookout to help examine the code. Together, they discovered that the spyware relied on three previously unknown iOS vulnerabilities -- called ''zero days'' because Apple didn't know about them and had zero days to patch them.   In many cases, the NSO Group had designed its tools to impersonate those of the Red Cross, Facebook, Federal Express, CNN, Al Jazeera, Google and even the Pokemon Company to gain the trust of its targets, according to the researchers.   ''NSO Group was very professional, and very effective in staying silent,'' said Mike Murray, a vice president at Lookout.   In recent years, zero day flaws have been traded among hackers, brokers, companies like the NSO Group, and spy agencies and law enforcement networks eager for ways to break into devices.   Flaws in Apple's iOS software are sold at a premium. Last year, a similar zero-day exploit in Apple's iOS software was sold to Zerodium, a Washington buyer and seller of zero-days, for $1 million.   Earlier this year, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced that his agency had paid hackers who found a way for the F.B.I. to crack into an iPhone used by one of the shooters in last year's mass killings in San Bernardino, Calif. Neither the hackers nor the F.B.I. have told Apple how this was accomplished.   Apple's software update patches the NSO Group's exploits, but it is unclear whether the company has patched the vulnerabilities used by the F.B.I. to crack into its iPhone. Apple recently began a ''bug bounty'' program to pay hackers who report vulnerabilities in its systems.   Among the other NSO targets, besides Mr. Mansoor, were Rafael Cabrera, a Mexican journalist, who broke a story on conflicts of interest among Mexico's ruling family. In several cases, NSO Group's tools had been crafted to target users in Yemen, Turkey, Mozambique, Mexico, Kenya and the U.A.E.   Zamir Dahbash, an NSO Group spokesman, said in an email, ''The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations.''   Mr. Dahbash added that NSO Group does not operate any of its systems and requires that its customers use its products in a ''lawful manner.'' ''Specifically,'' he said, ''the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes.''   He would not say if the software is used by government agencies in the U.A.E. or Mexico.   In 2014, NSO Group sold a majority stake to San Francisco-based private equity firm Francisco Partners Management LLC for $120 million. Francisco Partners declined to comment.   Mr. Mansoor said in an interview that the discoveries were a sad reminder that no matter what he does to protect his devices and digital security, he will continue to be a target for companies that provide this sort of spying technology.   ''I guess I am their regular customer,'' he said. ''I am the guinea pig.''   Bill Marczak, the researcher at Citizen Lab who has been helping Mr. Mansoor protect his digital security, said that the surveillance experienced by Mr. Mansoor is likely to expand.   ''The targeting of these activists and dissidents is a taste of what's to come,'' Mr. Marczak said. ''What they're facing today will be faced by ordinary users tomorrow.''     "
A Brief Explanation of Apple's Showdown With the U.S. Government,"The F.B.I. wants Apple to help unlock an encrypted iPhone used by one of the two attackers who killed 14 people in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting in December.  Specifically, the bureau wants Apple to create software that would help it override a security system on the phone designed to erase its contents after 10 unsuccessful tries to enter its password.    Apple is resisting for several reasons. First, it argues that the government is trying to force it to create software that does not exist. What is more, the company says writing that software would amount to hacking its own technology.   Apple claims this would create a security risk for all iPhone customers, especially because other government agencies in the United States and abroad could then demand Apple's assistance in other cases. In a court filing, Apple disclosed that there were nine other cases in which the Justice Department has asked for its help unlocking phones.   The F.B.I., for its part, says that Apple is overstating the issue, since the bureau is asking for the company's help breaking into only one phone, not phones all over the world.   The technology industry and the government have been wrangling for years over the growing use of encryption in communication tools that make it much harder for law enforcement and spy agencies to gather information in investigations.   That fight took on new urgency in 2013 after documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed extensive government spying on Internet traffic.   What's the latest?   On Feb. 16, a federal judge issued an order compelling Apple to assist the F.B.I. and gave the company until Feb. 26 to respond.   Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, wrote a letter to customers warning of the ''chilling'' breach of privacy sought by the government and vowed to appeal. The F.B.I. shot back, calling Apple's position a ''marketing strategy.''   On Thursday, Apple filed a formal response to the court order, asking the judge to vacate it. The company said that the order violated its First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights and exceeded the powers granted to the government in the All Writs Act, the 1789 law that the court had used to compel Apple's assistance.   Apple argues that software code can be treated as speech under the First Amendment, and that the court order violated due process because it deprives the company of its right to be free from ''arbitrary deprivation'' of its liberty by government.   What happens now?   The court will consider Apple's request. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google plan to file one or more briefs next week supporting Apple's position.   Both the F.B.I. and Apple say they want Congress to weigh in. On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on encryption issues. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., and Apple's top lawyer are among those scheduled to testify.     "
Murdoch Son Returning to a British Media Post,"The British pay television group Sky said on Friday that James Murdoch was returning as chairman almost four years after his humiliating departure at the height of the News Corporation  phone-hacking scandal. The announcement follows the recent return of another central figure in the scandal, Rebekah Brooks, and it has propelled speculation that the Murdoch family may be preparing to reassert itself in the European media landscape through a new takeover bid for Sky. The company's United States unit, 21st Century Fox, owns a 39 percent stake in Sky.    ''We're delighted that James Murdoch has agreed to step into the role of chairman,'' Sky's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, said in a statement that accompanied the British broadcaster's six-month financial results. ''James's deep knowledge of the international media industry and his passion for supporting Sky's ongoing success will make an even greater contribution to our business in the future.''    Mr. Murdoch, 43, is the younger son of News Corporation's founder, Rupert Murdoch, and is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, a position to which he was appointed in June, succeeding his father. At Sky, he will replace the current chairman, Nicholas Ferguson, who will step down in April.   From 2007 to 2012, the younger Mr. Murdoch was the chairman of Sky, one of the most prominent jobs in British media, and he was widely considered the heir apparent to lead his father's multibillion-dollar global empire.   But revelations in 2011 that reporters at a Sunday tabloid, News of the World, had hacked the mobile phone of a young British murder victim and listened to her voice mail messages quickly developed into a scandal that engulfed News Corporation's British newspaper business.   Mr. Murdoch, who at the time also presided over the group's holdings across Europe, the Middle East and Asia, was ultimately forced to oversee the closing of News of the World as well as the withdrawal of a $12 billion offer for the remaining 61 percent of Sky, which at the time was known as BSkyB.   Mr. Murdoch was never found to have had direct knowledge of the hacking by members of the paper's staff. But a parliamentary committee investigating the scandal accused him of ''willful ignorance'' after he acknowledged having failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims. Mr. Murdoch resigned as chairman in early 2012, he said, to avoid becoming a ''lightning rod'' for Sky. He retained his seat on the board.   The scandal also ensnared a number of Mr. Murdoch's other senior British lieutenants, including Ms. Brooks, now 47, who was reinstated in September as chief executive of News UK -- publisher of The Times of London, The Sunday Times and the tabloid The Sun -- after a court cleared her of criminal wrongdoing in the hacking case.   News Corporation spun off its publishing operations in 2013, and with it News UK. Sky is part of News Corporation's larger entertainment division.   ''I think that as soon as Rebekah Brooks was acquitted there was a start of a way back for James,'' said Claire Enders, chief executive of Enders Analysis, a media research firm in London. ''I think this is going to be very positively viewed, but not simply because people will say they could reignite the bid'' for Sky, she said.   Despite the taint of the hacking scandal, which cost him many of his influential political friends in Britain, at least temporarily, analysts said that James Murdoch was widely respected in European media circles as a pay-TV visionary whose early investments in technology helped secure Sky's dominance in broadband and enabled the development of new digital product lines that were emulated by rivals.   ''There is also the Murdoch brand advantage,'' Ms. Enders said. ''When people speak to him, they believe -- and rightly so -- that they are speaking to the strategic thinker who connects the dots at the mother ship.''   Another factor fanning speculation of a renewed takeover bid was the choice of a City of London veteran, Martin Gilbert, to become deputy chairman of Sky. Mr. Gilbert, 60, is chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, which has grown in recent years through a series of acquisitions to become one of Europe's largest listed fund managers.   Sky reported a 12 percent rise in operating profit for the six months to Dec. 31, to 747 million pounds, or about $1.1 billion. Revenue for the period rose by 5 percent to £5.72 billion.     "
21st Century Fox Reaches Preliminary Deal to Purchase Sky Television,"Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray. LONDON -- The media and entertainment mogul Rupert Murdoch was on the verge of taking full control of the British satellite television giant Sky five years ago when his takeover bid was derailed by a phone-hacking scandal in his company's publishing arm. On Friday, Sky said that Mr. Murdoch's 21st Century Fox had reached a preliminary deal to acquire the 61 percent stake in Sky it did not already own. The new takeover offer would value Sky at about $23 billion.     The two companies are still in talks over the final terms of a deal, Sky said.   The takeover approach came more than five years after 21st Century Fox's predecessor company, News Corporation, withdrew a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky -- then known as BSkyB -- as a firestorm erupted over phone-hacking by the media in Britain.   In 2011, it emerged that reporters at News of the World, a Sunday tabloid newspaper then owned by a subsidiary of News Corporation, had hacked the mobile phone of a young murder victim in Britain and listened to her voice mail messages, inciting outrage in Britain. The scandal led to the newspaper being closed and soon engulfed News Corporation's publishing business in Britain.   News Corporation split into two companies in 2013. Its entertainment assets were housed in the newly christened 21st Century Fox, while the new News Corporation consisted of its publishing business, including The Wall Street Journal and The Times of London.   The scandal also forced James Murdoch, the son of Rupert Murdoch and chief executive of 21st Century Fox, to step down as chairman of Sky. The younger Mr. Murdoch served as chairman of Sky from 2007 to 2012 and retained a seat on its board after resigning as chairman.   At the time of the phone hacking scandal, James Murdoch oversaw News Corporation's businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.   He was never found to have any direct knowledge of the hacking, but a Parliament committee investigating the scandal accused him of ''willful ignorance.''   James Murdoch acknowledged at the time that he had failed to read emails that referred to settlement payments made to hacking victims.   Despite the scandal, the younger Mr. Murdoch has remained well respected in European media circles and returned to serve as Sky's chairman this year, spurring speculation that another takeover bid by 21st Century Fox was in the works.   On Friday, Sky said that 21st Century Fox had offered to pay 10.75 pounds a share in cash ($13.58), less the value of any dividends subsequently paid by Sky.   The new offer represents a 40 percent premium to the Sky's closing price on Tuesday, the last day before the initial Fox approach.   Shares of Sky closed up nearly 27 percent in trading in London on Friday after the announcement but ended the day below the offer price. In the United States, shares of 21st Century Fox closed down 2 percent.   ''There can be no certainty that an offer will be made by 21st Century Fox, nor as to the terms of any such offer,'' Sky said in a news release.   Sky said that its independent directors had indicated to 21st Century Fox that they were willing to recommend the proposal to shareholders, subject to reaching an agreement on the other outstanding terms. The independent directors were advised by Barclays, Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners, Sky said.   The company also said that it had formed an independent committee of its directors that it considers free of any conflicts of interest to consider the terms of the Fox proposal.   A potential bid for the rest of Sky by 21st Century Fox was widely anticipated by analysts, particularly after AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner for $84.5 billion in October.   ''We think the likelihood of a Fox bid for Sky now rises, which would create a stronger vertically integrated business in Europe,'' Tim Nollen, senior media analyst at Macquarie Bank, wrote in a report in October after the Time Warner deal.   The AT&T-Time Warner deal was the latest in a series of transactions by media companies in recent years to gain scale, control more content and distribute that content directly to customers.   On Friday, 21st Century Fox said that its 39 percent stake in Sky was ''not a natural end position.''   ''A proposed transaction between 21st Century Fox and Sky would bring together 21st Century Fox's global content business with Sky's world-class direct-to-consumer capabilities, which have made it the number one premium pay-TV provider in all its markets,'' 21st Century Fox said in a news release.   ''It would also enhance Sky's leading position in entertainment and sport, and reinforce the U.K.'s standing as a top global hub for content generation and technological innovation,'' the company added.   Gaining full control of Sky would be consistent with efforts by James Murdoch since he took over as chief executive to simplify -- and gain greater control over -- 21st Century Fox's ventures.   Last year, 21st Century Fox announced a deal valued at $725 million to create a for-profit joint venture with the National Geographic Society that encompassed the National Geographic Channels cable television group along with National Geographic's other properties.   Twenty-First Century Fox owns a 73 percent stake in the venture, National Geographic Partners. The deal came after an 18-year partnership between Fox and the nonprofit group for National Geographic Channels.   The company has also looked for more ways to take its content directly to consumers, including signing a deal in November to provide live streaming of its television channels through a new service being introduced next year by Hulu, which 21st Century Fox partly owns.   Sky has reshaped itself into a Pan-European satellite provider in recent years, buying Sky Italia and a controlling stake in Sky Deutschland for more than $9 billion from 21st Century Fox in 2014.   Sky, which offers television, broadband and telephone phone services, has nearly 22 million customers in Austria, Britain, Germany, Ireland and Italy. It reported revenue of nearly £12 billion ($15.1 billion) in its 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30.   Sky exclusively licenses a variety of television shows from AMC Networks, HBO and Showtime in Europe, including ''Game of Thrones,'' ''The Walking Dead'' and ''The Affair.'' It also broadcasts the top soccer leagues in Britain, Germany and Italy.   Fox is being advised in the discussions by Centerview Partners and Deutsche Bank.     "
Flaws Seen in Venture That Uses Virtual Cash,"A group of computer scientists released a paper on Friday describing a number of security vulnerabilities in a novel cryptocurrency crowdfunding project that has raised more than $100 million. The authors of the paper argue that the money that has been put into the project, known as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, could be frozen or stolen by attackers as a result of flaws in the way that the venture, known as the D.A.O., was set up. The money is all in a digital currency called Ether, which is a newer alternative to Bitcoin and exists entirely online.    The threats emerged on the eve of the organization's move from fund-raising to operational mode, in which it will evaluate proposals to fund experimental digital projects.    The D.A.O. is a sort of venture capital fund that will pick investments based on direct voting from investors. The entire operation is computerized, with no humans in charge.   The authors of the new paper are calling for the D.A.O.'s investors to hold off on considering any potential investments until the vulnerabilities are fixed.   ''The current implementation can enable attacks with severe consequences,'' according to the paper, written by the computer scientists Dino Mark, Vlad Zamfir and Emin Gün Sirer.   Mr. Gün Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University, has particular authority in the area because he previously was an author of a paper pointing out a serious vulnerability in the structure of Bitcoin, the most popular virtual currency.   Mr. Gün Sirer said in an email on Friday that his team had decided to release the paper on the D.A.O. this week so that investors ''will not be subject to attacks when the fund-raising deadline is over.''   Mr. Gün Sirer said he sent the paper to the programmers who wrote the code underlying the D.A.O., and to some of the so-called curators on the project, who will help guide decisions in the venture. Christoph Jentzsch, who wrote the basic code, could not be reached for comment via email on Friday.   Mr. Zamfir, one of Mr. Gün Sirer's co-authors, is one of the 10 curators. Another curator, Alex Van de Sande, a programmer in Brazil, said on Friday that the authors ''really raise some interesting attack vectors.'' He said he did not see the attacks as an imminent threat, but he was hoping that investors would vote to make the structure of the D.A.O. more secure, potentially by dividing it into several smaller funds.   The D.A.O. is built on Ethereum, a newer cryptocurrency network that was created to overcome some shortcomings in Bitcoin.The Ethereum system enables so-called smart contracts in which legal agreements can be written into computer code. It is those smart contracts that serve as the basis for decision making and investments within the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The D.A.O. is motivated in large part by a broader desire to find more decentralized ways to make decisions and financial transactions, with fewer middlemen involved.   After the organization began raising funds from investors in April, the surprising level of interest led investors to buy Ether -- the virtual currency in the Ethereum network -- to invest in the D.A.O. That drove up the price of Ether, which in turn drove up the value of Ether invested in the organization. As of last weekend, the aggregate value of Ether that had been sent to the venture by investors around the world was more than $150 million.   More recently, several experts in the area have voiced concerns about the D.A.O., which has helped push down the price of Ether. On Friday, the value of the Ether in the D.A.O. was $131 million, even as the number of Ether invested had increased.   The new paper points to several ways that bad actors could exploit the voting process that investors in the D.A.O. will use to choose investments.   ''At a fundamental level, these attacks all stem from unintended consequences of the mechanisms built into the D.A.O.'' the paper says. ''These problems can give rise to complex strategic behaviors, all resulting in a corruption of the intended, honest debate and voting process to select the most deserving proposals.''     "
A Surge of Deceptive Apps for iPhones Arrives in Time for Holiday Shopping,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple's App Store in recent weeks -- just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard's and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo.    ''We're seeing a barrage of fake apps,'' said Chris Mason, chief executive of Branding Brand, a Pittsburgh company that helps retailers build and maintain apps. He said his company constantly tracks new shopping apps, and this was the first time it had seen so many counterfeit iPhone apps emerge in a short period of time.   Some of them appeared to be relatively harmless -- essentially junk apps that served up annoying pop-up ads, he said.    But there are serious risks to using a fake app. Entering credit card information opens a customer to potential financial fraud. Some fake apps contain malware that can steal personal information or even lock the phone until the user pays a ransom. And some fakes encourage users to log in using their Facebook credentials, potentially exposing sensitive personal information.   The rogue apps, most of which came from developers in China, slipped through Apple's process for reviewing every app before it is published.   That scrutiny, which Apple markets as an advantage over Google's less restrictive Android smartphone platform, is supposed to stop any software that is deceitful, that improperly uses another company's intellectual property or that poses harm to consumers.   In practice, however, Apple focuses more on blocking malicious software and does not routinely examine the thousands of apps submitted to the iTunes store every day to see if they are legitimately associated with the brand names listed on them.   With apps becoming more popular as a way to shop, it is up to brands and developers themselves to watch for fakes and report them, much as they scan for fake websites, said Ben Reubenstein, chief executive of Possible Mobile, a Denver company that makes apps for JetBlue Airways, the PGA Tour and the Pokémon Company, among others.   ''It's important that brands monitor how their name is being used,'' he said.   Apple removed hundreds of fake apps on Thursday night after The New York Times inquired about the specific app vendors that created many of them. Other apps were removed after a New York Post article last week drew attention to some of the counterfeits.   ''We strive to offer customers the best experience possible, and we take their security very seriously,'' said an Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr. ''We've set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure. We've removed these offending apps and will continue to be vigilant about looking for apps that might put our users at risk.''   In September, Apple also embarked on a campaign to review all two million apps in the App Store and remove ''apps that no longer function as intended, don't follow current review guidelines or are outdated.'' The company says that a significant number of apps have been removed and that the review is continuing.   Despite Apple's efforts, new fake apps appear every day. In some cases, developers change the content of an app after it has been approved by Apple's monitors. In other instances, the counterfeiters change their names and credentials, and resubmit similar apps after one round of fakes is discovered.   ''It's a game of Whac-a-Mole,'' Mr. Mason of Branding Brand said.   On Friday, for example, an entity calling itself Overstock Inc. -- an apparent attempt to confuse shoppers looking for the online retailer Overstock.com -- was peddling Ugg boots and apparel through a fake app that was nearly identical to one banished by Apple on Thursday.   The same Chinese app developer, Cloaker Apps, created both fake Ugg apps on behalf of Chinese clients.   Jack Lin, who identified himself as the head of Cloaker, said in a phone interview in China that his company provides the back-end technology for thousands of apps but does not investigate its clients.   ''We hope that our clients are all official sellers,'' he said. ''If they are using these brands, we need some kind of authorization, then we will provide services.''   Mr. Lin said Cloaker charged about 20,000 renminbi -- about $3,000 -- for an app written in English.   But like so many of the apps his company produces, Cloaker is not what it purports to be. Its website is filled with dubious claims, such as the location of its headquarters, which it says is at an address smack in the middle of Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, Calif.   In the interview, Mr. Lin at first said he had offices only in China and Japan. When asked about the California office, he then claimed to have ''tens of employees'' at the Facebook address.   China is by far the biggest source of fake apps, according to security experts.   Many of the fake retail apps have red flags signaling that they are not real, such as nonsensical menus written in butchered English, no reviews and no history of previous versions. In one fake New Balance app, for example, the tab for phone support did not list a phone number and said, ''Our angents are available over the hone Monday-Firday.''   Data from Apptopia show that some of the fake apps have been downloaded thousands of times, although it is unclear how many people have actually used them. Reviews posted on some of the apps indicated that at least some people tried them and became frustrated. ''Would give zero stars if possible,'' wrote one reviewer of the fake Dollar Tree app. ''Constantly gets stuck in menus and closes what you were doing and makes you start over.''   Mr. Mason says consumers want to shop online and they search for apps from their favorite stores and brands.   ''The retailers who are most exposed are the ones with no app at all,'' he said. Dollar Tree and Dillard's, for example, have no official iPhone apps, which made it easier to lure their customers to the fake apps.   But the counterfeiters have also mimicked companies that do have an official presence in the App Store, hoping to capitalize on consumer confusion about which ones are real.   The shoe retailer Foot Locker Inc., for example, has three iPhone apps. But that did not stop an entity calling itself Footlocke Sports Co. Ltd. from offering 16 shoe and clothing apps in the App Store -- including one purporting to be from a Foot Locker rival, Famous Footwear.   Similarly, the supermarket chain Kroger Company has 20 iPhone apps, reflecting the various retail chains in its empire. An entity calling itself The Kroger Inc. had 19 apps, purporting to sell things as diverse as an $80 pair of Asics sneakers and a $688 bottle of Dior perfume.   Some of the fake apps have even used Apple's new paid search ads to propel them to the top of the results screen when customers search for specific brands in the App Store.   Jon Clay, director of global threat communications for Trend Micro, an internet security firm, said Apple's tight control over the iPhone had historically kept malicious apps out of its App Store. Fake apps appeared more often on Google's Android platform or on third-party app stores, he said.   But that is beginning to change. Shortly after the Pokémon Go game was released in the United States in July, for example, a spate of fake iPhone apps related to the game appeared, especially in countries where the game was not yet available.   ''The criminals are going to take advantage of whatever is hot,'' Mr. Clay said.     "
Obama Administration Officials Soften Approach at Tech Symposium,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch joined a parade of Obama administration officials to tech's home turf on Tuesday. Their message: National security depends on the industry's cooperation. The heavyweights from Washington arrived against the backdrop of Apple's fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to an iPhone and a growing fissure between Washington and Silicon Valley.    The F.B.I. is trying to force Apple to write software to help it break into the phone of one of the gunmen in December's mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The phone is protected by a security scheme that would wipe its data after a series of incorrect password attempts. Apple has so far refused to cooperate, and the company is fighting a court order requiring it to aid investigators.    In a speech Tuesday at the RSA Conference, arguably the world's largest gathering of computer security experts, Ms. Lynch avoided directly addressing the fight with Apple, and emphasized the need to find middle ground.   ''I know that neither our technology companies nor their leaders have any sympathy for terrorists or criminals who target Americans,'' Ms. Lynch told an audience at the city's Moscone Center. ''And the Department of Justice will never sacrifice the safety of the American people or the ideals we all cherish.''   But in a stage interview with a Bloomberg journalist, Emily Chang, after her speech, Ms. Lynch was asked what the middle ground would be between the F.B.I. and Apple.   ''For me, the middle ground'' is to do ''what the law requires,'' Ms. Lynch responded, which drew a smattering of laughter and hisses from the audience. She said law enforcement has for years had Apple's help getting access to iPhones without controversy, and that ''having the inability to obtain evidence that could save lives is a real risk.''   Though it is focused on a tough password mechanism, the Apple controversy is an extension of a decades-long fight between the tech industry and the federal government over the use of encryption technology. Once considered a carefully regulated munition, not unlike a tank, encryption came into wide use with the advent of the commercial Internet and was the key to modern e-commerce.   The encryption fight was considered by many in Silicon Valley to have been settled in the 1990s, but the widespread government monitoring of Internet traffic revealed in documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor, in 2013 led to the renewal of industry efforts to toughen security.   Apple's fight with the F.B.I. has added to that tension, and a number of other tech companies are expected in the coming days to file court briefs in support of Apple. Among their fears is that creating the software to break into the iPhone could create a backdoor that could be used repeatedly by law enforcement or the spy agencies of other countries.   The director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, also attempted a conciliatory tone at the RSA event. Admiral Rogers did not speak to the Apple case, or even mention the word encryption, but repeatedly emphasized the need for partnership and dialogue to fight cyberthreats. ''I implore all of us to be part of that constructive dialogue,'' he said. ''It's time to stop talking past each other.''   In a speech made nearby at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter acknowledged that encryption had been a ''hot topic here in the Bay Area,'' but said he could not address the Apple case because of the ongoing litigation. Instead, he noted that the Pentagon had a vested interest in strong encryption and that the Defense Department is ''the largest user of encryption in the world.''   Security experts in the tech industry may not be so quick to embrace conciliation. ''You're opening a can of worms,'' Ron Rivest, a cryptographer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told a separate RSA audience.   ''The systems we have are so fragile that trying to have extra keys, or extra ways in, or ways to take them apart is asking for all kinds of trouble,'' Mr. Rivest said. ''The good of the country depends on having strong security.''   Other cryptographers on the panel with Mr. Rivest agreed, with one notable exception: Adi Shamir, an Israeli cryptographer and co-inventor, with Mr. Rivest and Len Adleman, of the RSA encryption algorithm that became the namesake of the annual security conference.   Mr. Shamir argued that Apple had ''goofed'' by not complying in the San Bernardino case and for not anticipating that the F.B.I. would ask for help to crack the shooter's iPhone password.   ''Even though Apple helped in countless numbers of previous cases, they decided not to comply this time,'' Mr. Shamir said. ''My advice would have been, comply this time, and wait for a better test case when the case is not so clearly in favor of the F.B.I.''     "
Checking the Delivery Date on That Android Update,"Q. Is there a way to tell definitely if my Android Marshmallow tablet has the latest security patches from Google? A. Last summer, Google began pushing out monthly updates to plug security holes and fix other issues with its Android operating system. You can quickly see if your device has the latest software by checking the settings. Open the Settings app from the home screen, or use two fingers to swipe down from the top edge of the screen to open the Quick Settings box and tap the gear-shaped icon.     In the System section of the Settings screen, select About Tablet; Android smartphone users will see About Phone instead. The next screen shows basic information about your device, including the make and model, current status of the battery and the overall version of the Android system installed. In the ''Android security patch'' area, check the date.   If the last listed patch date was within the past month, you probably have the most recent update. You can also check for a system update from the About Tablet screen by tapping System Updates at the top; the next screen displays the device's update status and provides a button to manually check for new software.   As Google's Android Security Bulletins page shows, patches for the system tend to come out the first week or two of each month -- if you are using Google's own Nexus hardware. For Android devices made by other companies, check with the manufacturer or wireless carrier for information on updates for your model; the support area of the company's website is a good place to start.   Google typically provides security updates for its own hardware for at least three years from when the device first went on sale, or 18 months from when the item was last sold in the Google Store -- depending on which time period is longer.

Russia's 'Troll Army' Retaliates Against an Effort to Expose It,"HELSINKI, Finland -- Seeking to shine some light into the dark world of Internet trolls, a journalist with Finland's national broadcaster asked members of her audience to share their experience of encounters with Russia's ''troll army,'' a raucous and often venomous force of online agitators. The response was overwhelming, though not in the direction that the journalist, Jessikka Aro, had hoped.    As she expected, she received some feedback from people who had clashed with aggressively pro-Russian voices online. But she was taken aback, and shaken, by a vicious retaliatory campaign of harassment and insults against her and her work by those same pro-Russian voices.    ''Everything in my life went to hell thanks to the trolls,'' said Ms. Aro, a 35-year-old investigative reporter with the social media division of Finland's state broadcaster, Yle Kioski.   Abusive online harassment is hardly limited to pro-Russian Internet trolls. Ukraine and other countries at odds with the Kremlin also have legions of aggressive avengers on social media.   But pro-Russian voices have become such a noisy and disruptive presence that both NATO and the European Union have set up special units to combat what they see as a growing threat not only to civil discourse but to the well-being of Europe's democratic order and even to its security.   This ''information war,'' said Rastislav Kacer, a veteran diplomat who served as Slovakia's ambassador to Washington and at NATO's headquarters in Brussels, ''is just part of a bigger struggle.'' While not involving bloodshed, he added, it ''is equally as dangerous as more conventional hostile action.''   For Ms. Aro, the abuse increased sharply last year when, following up on reports in the opposition Russian news media, she visited St. Petersburg to investigate the workings of a Russian ''troll factory.'' The big office churns out fake news and comment, particularly on Ukraine, and floods websites and social media with denunciations of Russia's critics.   In response to her reporting, pro-Russian activists in Helsinki organized a protest outside the headquarters of Yle, accusing it of being a troll factory itself. Only a handful of people showed up.   At the same time, Ms. Aro has been peppered with abusive emails, vilified as a drug dealer on social media sites and mocked as a delusional bimbo in a music video posted on YouTube.   ''There are so many layers of fakery you get lost,'' said Ms. Aro, who was awarded the Finnish Grand Prize for Journalism in March.   As Ms. Aro's experiences illustrate, Finland, a country at the center of Russia's concerns about NATO's expansion toward its borders, has emerged as a particularly active front in the information wars. A member of the European Union with an 830-mile-long border with Russia, Finland has stayed outside the United States-led military alliance but, unnerved by Russian military actions in Ukraine and its saber-rattling in the Baltic Sea, has expanded cooperation with NATO and debated whether to apply for full membership.   Public opinion is deeply divided, making Finland a prime target for a campaign by Russia.   ''Their big thing is to keep Finland out of NATO,'' said Saara Jantunen, a researcher at the Finnish Defense Forces in Helsinki, who last year published a book in Finland entitled ''Info-War.'' She said that she, too, had been savaged on social media, sometimes by the same and apparently fake commentators who have hounded Ms. Aro.   ''They fill the information space with so much abuse and conspiracy talk that even sane people start to lose their minds,'' she added.   Europe's main response so far has been to try to counter outright lies. In November, the European Union launched ''Disinformation Review,'' a weekly compendium of pro-Kremlin distortions and untruths.   But facts have been powerless against a torrent of abuse and ridicule targeted at European journalists, researchers and others labeled NATO stooges.   Pro-Russian activists insist that they are merely exercising their right to free speech, and that they do not take money or instructions from Moscow.   The most abusive messages against Ms. Aro were mostly sent anonymously or from accounts set up under fake names on Facebook and other social media.   One of her most vocal critics in Finland, however, has openly declared his identity. He is Johan Backman, a tireless supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who highlights the blurred lines between state-sponsored harassment and the expression of strongly held personal views.   Fluent in Russian, Mr. Backman now spends much of his time in Moscow, appearing regularly in the Russian news media and at conferences in Russia as ''a human rights defender.'' He also serves as the representative in Northern Europe for the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies, a state-funded research group led by a Soviet-era intelligence officer.   Mr. Backman, who also represents the Donetsk People's Republic, the breakaway state set up with Russian support in eastern Ukraine, denied targeting Ms. Aro as part of any ''information war.'' Rather, he insisted that Russia was itself the victim of a campaign of disinformation and distortion conducted by the West.   In a recent interview in Moscow, he said that Ms. Aro was part of this campaign and that she had tried to curtail the freedom of speech of Russia's supporters in Finland by labeling them as ''Russian trolls.'' All the same, Mr. Backman added, her complaints about being targeted for abuse ''have been very beneficial for Russia'' because they have made others think twice about criticizing Moscow.   ''She says she is a victim, and nobody wants to be a victim,'' he said. ''This changed the atmosphere in the journalistic community.''   Mr. Backman said he used his own private means to fund his activities in support of what he described as an ''entirely defensive'' campaign by Russia to counter Western propaganda. His activities, however, invariably follow Moscow's political and geopolitical script, particularly on NATO, which he regularly denounces as a tool for United States military occupation.   Aside from NATO, Mr. Backman's biggest bugbear of late has been Ms. Aro and the ''Russo-phobic'' tendencies that she, in his view, represents.   Just days after Ms. Aro made her first appeal in September 2014 for information about Russian trolls, Mr. Backman told Russian People's Line, a nationalist Russian website, and other media that she was a ''well-known assistant of American and Baltic special services.''   Around the same time, she received a call late at night on her cellphone from a number in Ukraine. Nobody spoke, and all she could hear was gunfire. This was followed by text and email messages denouncing her as a ''NATO whore'' and a message purporting to come from her father -- who died 20 years ago -- saying he was ''watching her.''   The hardest blow, Ms. Aro said, came early this year when a Finnish-language news site, MVLehti.net, which is based in Spain and mostly focuses on vilifying immigrants, dug up and published court records that showed she had been convicted of using illegal amphetamines in 2004. She had been fined 300 euros.   The website's headline: ''NATO's information expert Jessikka Aro turned out to be a convicted drug dealer.'' It also posted photographs of Ms. Aro dancing in a slinky outfit at a nightclub in Bangkok.   Mr. Backman requested and received Ms. Aro's old case file from the court shortly before the website published the documents. He denied passing them on to the site.   The false claim that Ms. Aro was a drug dealer triggered an unusual open letter signed by more than 20 Finnish editors infuriated by what they denounced as the ''poisoning of public debate'' with ''insults, defamation and outright lies.'' The Finnish police began an investigation into the website for harassment and hate speech.   ''I don't know if these people are acting on orders from Russia, but they are clearly what Lenin called 'useful idiots,''' said Mika Pettersson, the editor of Finland's national news agency and an organizer of the editors' open letter. ''They are playing into Putin's pocket. Nationalist movements in Finland and other European countries want to destabilize the European Union and NATO, and this goes straight into Putin's narrative. ''   Ilja Janitskin, the founder and head of MVLehti, who is based in Barcelona, Spain, said in response to emailed questions that he had no connection with Russia other than his surname. His political views, he said, are closer to those of Donald J. Trump, not Mr. Putin.   He added that he had become interested in Ms. Aro only after she accused his website of ''distributing Russian propaganda.''   Like Mr. Backman, he denied receiving any money from Russian sources, insisting that his website, which in just 18 months has become one of Finland's most widely read online news sources, finances itself from advertising and donations by readers.   Ms. Aro acknowledged that she had used amphetamines regularly in her early 20s but dismissed as a ''total lie'' claims that she had been or is a drug dealer.   ''They get inside your head, and you start thinking: If I do this, what will the trolls do next?'' she said.     "
Under the Din of the Race Lies a Once and Future Threat: Cyberwarfare,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The 2016 presidential race will be remembered for many ugly moments, but the most lasting historical marker may be one that neither voters nor American intelligence agencies saw coming: It is the first time that a foreign power has unleashed cyberweapons to disrupt, or perhaps influence, a United States election. And there is a foreboding sense that, in elections to come, there is no turning back.    The steady drumbeat of allegations of Russian troublemaking -- leaks from stolen emails and probes of election-system defenses -- has continued through the campaign's last days. These intrusions, current and former administration officials agree, will embolden other American adversaries, which have been given a vivid demonstration that, when used with some subtlety, their growing digital arsenals can be particularly damaging in the frenzy of a democratic election.    ''Most of the biggest stories of this election cycle have had a cybercomponent to them -- or the use of information warfare techniques that the Russians, in particular, honed over decades,'' said David Rothkopf, the chief executive and editor of Foreign Policy, who has written two histories of the National Security Council. ''From stolen emails, to WikiLeaks, to the hacking of the N.S.A.'s tools, and even the debate about how much of this the Russians are responsible for, it's dominated in a way that we haven't seen in any prior election.''   The magnitude of this shift has gone largely unrecognized in the cacophony of a campaign dominated by charges of groping and pay-for-play access. Yet the lessons have ranged from the intensely personal to the geostrategic.   Email, a main conduit of communication for two decades, now appears so vulnerable that the nation seems to be wondering whether its bursting inboxes can ever be safe. Election systems, the underpinning of democracy, seem to be at such risk that it is unimaginable that the United States will go into another national election without treating them as ''critical infrastructure.''   But President Obama has been oddly quiet on these issues. He delivered a private warning to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during their final face-to-face encounter two months ago, aides say. Still, Mr. Obama has barely spoken publicly about the implications of foreign meddling in the election. His instincts, those who have worked with him on cyberissues say, are to deal with the problem by developing new norms of international behavior or authorizing covert action rather than direct confrontation.   After a series of debates in the Situation Room, Mr. Obama and his aides concluded that any public retaliation should be postponed until after the election -- to avoid the appearance that politics influenced his decision and to avoid provoking Russian counterstrikes while voting is underway. It remains unclear whether Mr. Obama will act after Tuesday, as his aides hint, or leave the decision about a ''proportional response'' to his successor.   Cybersleuths, historians and strategists will debate for years whether Russia's actions reflected a grand campaign of interference or mere opportunism on the part of Mr. Putin. While the administration has warned for years about the possibility of catastrophic attacks, what has happened in the past six months has been far more subtle.   Russia has used the techniques -- what they call ''hybrid war,'' mixing new technologies with old-fashioned propaganda, misinformation and disruption -- for years in former Soviet states and elsewhere in Europe. The only surprise was that Mr. Putin, as he intensified confrontations with Washington as part of a nationalist campaign to solidify his own power amid a deteriorating economy, was willing to take them to American shores.   The most common theory is that while the Russian leader would prefer the election of Donald J. Trump -- in part because Mr. Trump has suggested that NATO is irrelevant and that the United States should pull its troops back to American shores -- his primary motive is to undercut what he views as a smug American sense of superiority about its democratic processes.   Madeleine K. Albright, a former secretary of state who is vigorously supporting Hillary Clinton, wrote recently that Mr. Putin's goal was ''to create doubt about the validity of the U.S. election results, and to make us seem hypocritical when we question the conduct of elections in other countries.''   If so, this is a very different use of power than what the Obama administration has long prepared the nation for.   Four years ago, Leon E. Panetta, the defense secretary at the time, warned of an impending ''cyber Pearl Harbor'' in which enemies could ''contaminate the water supply in major cities or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country,'' perhaps in conjunction with a conventional attack.   That is still a risk, of course -- one that the Pentagon and its United States Cyber Command spend billions of dollars trying to deter. Yet America's main adversaries know those steps would constitute an act of war, most likely prompting an overwhelming military response.   What has come instead -- doling out stolen emails, testing the defenses of the voting system -- clearly caught the administration off guard.   ''The unprecedented use of cyberintrusions to influence this election should galvanize our country to act,'' said John P. Carlin, who left the Justice Department two weeks ago as assistant attorney general for national security, a post in which he helped oversee legal responses to major Chinese and Iranian attacks on American banks and other institutions. ''Whoever is elected, how to regulate, defend and deter in cyberspace must be at the top of the national security agenda.''   Yet he noted that ''in a campaign where cyberintrusions and threats dominated the news more than any other in American history, there has been surprisingly little discussion on how our country should confront the problem going forward.''   The severity of the challenge has been particularly evident even in the final days of the campaign.   The Department of Homeland Security invited reporters on Friday to tour its war room, a vast monitoring center that is buried deep in a nondescript building in Virginia and is connected to the National Security Agency and sensors running through government networks. The center is supposed to be the internet equivalent of the giant North American Aerospace Defense Command in Cheyenne Mountain, just outside Colorado Springs, which opened almost exactly 50 years ago to scan the skies and warn of incoming Soviet nuclear missiles.   The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is expected to do the same thing, but its vision is limited to federal computer systems. Officials conceded that if a foreign power began tinkering with the registration rolls or vote-tallying systems on Tuesday -- a process run by the states -- it was unlikely that direct evidence would show up on the center's screens.   ''Our partners would have to call us,'' one senior official conceded.   Here on Sunday night in the battleground state of New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton held one of the final rallies of her campaign just miles from the headquarters of a company that was taken out two weeks ago in a ''denial of service'' attack that paralyzed websites along the East Coast.   Officials at the company, Dyn DNS, and others like it are frantically looking for ways to ward off another attack on Election Day out of fear that it could freeze up websites used for getting out the vote, showing people how to get to polling places or reporting results.   And just a few hours before she arrived here, Mrs. Clinton got news that the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, had informed Congress that his agency's review of the latest batch of her emails, found on the computer of former Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York, the estranged husband of one of Mrs. Clinton's top aides, did nothing to change his view of the case.   Mrs. Clinton's decision to use a private email server, of course, was the original digital act of this election season -- the decision by Mrs. Clinton that, to keep her personal emails private, she would conduct her government business from a private server.   Mr. Comey has never conclusively determined whether the Russians, or any other foreign power, broke into that server, which was kept in the Clintons' home in Chappaqua, N.Y. But the Russians had been behind many other break-ins, his investigators noted, including of the unclassified systems of the State Department, the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. If they skipped Mrs. Clinton's server, one investigator noted, it must have been an oversight.

"Daily Report: Breach Extends Yahoo's Long, Steep Fall","Whoa, Yahoo! When the internet company began its life in 1994, its founders added an exclamation mark to its name to convey a sense of excitement. But now that exclamation mark serves only to punctuate the incredulity of those who have seen the company's long, steep fall become even worse this week.     Yahoo, which is in the throes of completing a sale of its core business to Verizon Communications, revealed on Thursday that it was breached in 2014 by what it believed was a ''state-sponsored actor,'' resulting in the theft of the account information of at least 500 million users. The hacking is the biggest known intrusion into the company's computer network, writes Nicole Perlroth, exceeding other breaches in the last few years at companies like Sony.   It is another stumble by Yahoo, even as the company's last chapter as an independent entity seemed to be written. A $4.8 billion sale to Verizon was announced in July after Yahoo tried -- and failed -- under Marissa Mayer, its chief executive, to rev up growth in the last few years. It's unclear how the sale will be affected, if at all, by the revelation of the breach.   For Yahoo's users, the hacking is a major headache. The internet portal has one billion monthly active users, who use Yahoo mail and Yahoo groups and get their news through the site -- meaning it remains the gateway to many people's digital identities. While the extent of the fallout will not be known for a while, The New York Times compiled a guide for what Yahoo users can do for now if they think their account was compromised.     "
Yahoo Hack Could Reopen $4.8 Billion Verizon Deal,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Verizon Communications may seek to renegotiate its $4.8 billion purchase of Yahoo's operating business, dealing another blow to the struggling internet company. Verizon's top lawyer said on Thursday that his company thought that the hacking of 500 million Yahoo email accounts in 2014 -- disclosed last month, well after  the deal was announced -- had materially diminished the value of Yahoo, potentially allowing Verizon to reopen the sale discussions.    ''I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material, and we're looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact,'' Craig Silliman, Verizon's general counsel, told reporters in Washington. ''If they believe that it's not, then they'll need to show us that.''    The data breach, most likely the largest ever at a private company, is still under investigation by the companies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. F.B.I. officials have confirmed that the Yahoo breach has the hallmarks of a state-sponsored attack, but they also say it is too early to say which country was behind it, according to two people who with knowledge of the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   In a statement on Thursday, Yahoo said, ''We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.'' The transaction is expected to close by early next year.   On Monday, Verizon's chief executive, Lowell McAdam, said at a conference that the Yahoo deal made sense but that his company was still trying to assess the financial effect of the hack.   Yahoo has been vague about the timeline of the hacking, but has maintained that it learned of a potential breach after the Verizon agreement was struck in July.   It is unclear what long-term effect the attack -- and subsequent revelations that Yahoo scanned all of its customers' email under a federal court order -- will have on Yahoo's business.   The company's reputation has suffered online in the last few months, according to an analysis by Spredfast, a marketing firm that helps businesses analyze what people are saying about them on social networks. About 90 percent of the Twitter comments about Yahoo were negative in October, Spredfast said, up from 68 percent in August, before news of the hack.   Yahoo's stock dropped nearly 2 percent on Thursday after Reuters published the first report about Mr. Silliman's comments.   Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said investors were not concerned about a small price reduction. The real worry is that if Verizon walks away from the deal, it will delay the process of selling Yahoo's large stakes in two Asian tech companies, Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, which are worth far more than the portion of the company being sold to Verizon.   The Securities and Exchange Commission's guidance on cyberattacks says breaches can have a material impact and lead to lost revenue if proprietary information is stolen, or if companies ''fail to retain or attract customers following an attack.''   ''There are some serious questions about whether Yahoo's customers will continue to use the service knowing that their data has been compromised,'' said Jacob Olcott, vice president of BitSight Technologies, a security company. ''That is likely to be the biggest question Verizon is trying to determine here. They acquired Yahoo, in part, because of its large customer base.''   Yahoo customers have been inquiring how to switch out email accounts after the breach. Earlier this month, the company turned off automatic email forwarding, making it harder for users to switch to alternative services.   The S.E.C. guidance also notes that the costs of remediation -- which include increased security spending and the costs of customer notification and litigation -- can have a material effect. A report by the Ponemon Institute in July found that the cost to remediate a data breach was $221 per stolen record.   All tallied, that would top Verizon's $4.8 billion purchase price.     "
Australian Ends Attempt to Prove He Founded Bitcoin,"LONDON -- The mystery behind who created the online currency Bitcoin deepened on Thursday. Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur and computer programmer who earlier this week said he was that person, on Thursday withdrew an offer to prove his assertion, removing the contents of his blog and replacing it with a post simply titled, ''I'm sorry.''    ''I believed that I could do this,'' Mr. Wright wrote on his blog. ''I believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.''    Mr. Wright was first identified as Bitcoin's founder in December 2015 by Wired magazine and the technology website Gizmodo, but he did not come forward then. This week that changed, and he said in interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ that he was the digital currency's creator, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.   Almost as soon as Mr. Wright announced he was the creator of Bitcoin on Monday, skepticism surfaced in the Bitcoin community about the authenticity of his claims.   In a news release on Monday, Mr. Wright said that he had decided to make his identity public to ''dispel any negative myths and fears about Bitcoin.''   ''I cannot allow the misinformation that has been spread to impact the future of Bitcoin'' and the blockchain, the currency's communal digital ledger, he said at the time. ''I'm now able to build on what I have previously completed by releasing my research and academic work and help people understand just how powerful this can really be.''   Outside Organization, a public relations company that distributed his release on Monday, verified that the comments on the blog were from Mr. Wright and did not provide any additional comment on Thursday.   Bitcoin was founded as a digital competitor to existing currencies, and it has gained traction as financial institutions and others have begun researching how they can use the blockchain technology to improve transactions. The currency is created by people using computers to solve complex math problems, and it can then be traded digitally. Each coin is associated with its owner by a digital key.   The mysterious identity of its founder created an aura around the digital currency since it surfaced in 2009 and fueled a parlor game of speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto's identify.   Satoshi Nakamoto communicated only by electronic message and never revealed his or her true identity before ending all communication in 2011.   To verify his assertions this week, the BBC said, Mr. Wright provided digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys inextricably linked to Bitcoins generated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Wright also posted evidence on his blog, including a technical walk-through of how to verify cryptographic keys.   All of that information was wiped from his blog on Thursday.   ''When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked,'' Mr. Wright said on his blog on Thursday. ''When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.''   In his post on Thursday, Mr. Wright apologized to Jon Matonis, one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, and Gavin Andresen, who succeeded Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin developer.   Both men said on Monday that, after reviewing evidence provided by Mr. Wright, they believed that he was Satoshi Nakamoto.   ''I can only hope that their honor and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions,'' Mr. Wright said on his blog. ''They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I'm sorry.''   After the Wired and Gizmodo articles last year, Australian Federal Police raided Mr. Wright's home in a suburb of Sydney in connection with a tax investigation. Tax authorities in Australia said at the time that they had determined that Mr. Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto.   On Thursday, Mr. Wright seemed determined to return to the shadows, ending his post with the words, ''And goodbye.''     "
"A Venture Fund With Capital, but No Capitalist","Olivier Stern, a 31-year-old French socialist with an appetite for risk, recently invested a third of his life savings -- 10,000 euros, about $11,000 -- in a cryptocurrency start-up that has no legal standing and runs head-on into regulatory obstacles, yet might very well upend the mysterious world of virtual investing. The start-up, a sort of venture capital fund that calls itself the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, has essentially come out of nowhere in the last month and attracted about $152 million, at last count, from investors around the world like Mr. Stern -- making it the most successful crowdfunded venture ever, by a significant margin.    The venture, like so many things related to the digital currencies that cryptographers are creating on the Internet, is difficult to describe, and it may not be legal. But thousands of mostly anonymous investors have already heard about it through word of mouth and sent money -- in the form of Ether, a freshly coded form of currency that has held itself out as a new and improved version of Bitcoin, the most popular virtual scrip.    For these investors, in some sense it is the digital equivalent of buying into a bakery with no baker, no menu and no assurance that the ovens will even be delivered. But among the crowd that has invested, faith in the computer code that governs the project appears strong enough to override all those concerns.   After it collects Ether from investors -- the deadline to buy in is May 28 -- the D.A.O. aims to put the money into other digital currency start-ups. The investing decisions are to be made through online polling of shareholders like Mr. Stern, who has a day job dealing with parking policy in the town of Montreuil, just outside Paris.   ''I think it is the beginning of something that could, in a way, make history,'' said Mr. Stern, who previously lost a small sum of money he invested in Bitcoin when a major Bitcoin exchange -- Mt. Gox -- went bust. ''Maybe it can fail, maybe it can succeed, but for sure it is an idea that is very interesting.''   The rise of the new venture comes at a time when the technology underlying virtual currencies is rapidly being embraced by the mainstream: Most Wall Street firms and many central banks are experimenting with the blockchain, the online ledger system that Bitcoin and Ether pioneered. Banks hope the blockchain, or something like it, can provide a faster, cheaper way of conducting transactions and storing data.   The D.A.O., on the other hand, returns to the more radical ambitions of virtual currencies. It is set up according to computer code, with no human executives. All decisions will be made by votes of the people who buy in -- using software -- making it a sort of technology-enabled leaderless collective.   The basic code was written by a 32-year-old German programmer, Christoph Jentzsch. But he is not set to have any continuing role, and the D.A.O. does not hold the money of investors; instead, the investors own D.A.O. tokens that give them rights to vote on potential projects. Mr. Jentzsch said on Wednesday in an interview that he thought the structure absolved him of any legal responsibility for what could happen with the project.   ''Of course this venture is fraught with risks,'' Mr. Jentzsch said in an email. But he also predicted, ''This technology represents the future of the Internet.''   Experts on virtual currencies say that Mr. Jentzsch and others involved have stepped into dangerous regulatory legal territory. American regulators have previously come down hard on entrepreneurs who sold investments using virtual currencies.   Patrick Murck, a lawyer who has long dealt with Bitcoin issues, said that even if Mr. Jentzsch and his collaborators were not operating the venture, they could face legal liability for promoting it if the investments go awry -- and, potentially, even if they don't.   ''You can't code away your legal responsibilities,'' said Mr. Murck, who is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard. ''This is something that has been tried before and has failed before.''   As of Wednesday, an Ether was valued at $13 and a Bitcoin at $450 -- evidence, perhaps, of the strangeness and subjectivity of these new currencies. The D.A.O.'s reliance on Ether has allowed people to send their money to it from anywhere in the world without providing any identifying information, a design that is already raising concerns about potential money laundering.   The D.A.O. has also faced difficult questions from virtual currency aficionados, who worry that the organization's code was put together relatively hastily without the sort of security testing that has preceded previous projects based on Ethereum, the technology platform that underpins Ether.   ''It's an unstable thing right now,'' said Joseph Lubin, who was one of the founders of Ethereum. ''Young, complex machines tend to have flaws and vulnerabilities that you can't anticipate.''   Mr. Jentzsch acknowledged that he did not anticipate the venture growing to anything close to the size it has reached. The biggest similar projects have attracted a few million dollars.   ''If I would have known the size it has grown to, maybe the tester in me would say, 'I need more testing,''' he said. ''This is very risky. It's all new land.''   So far, two projects have applied to the D.A.O. for funding. One of them is a company run by Mr. Jentzsch and his brother, Simon, that is creating a new kind of physical lock that can be controlled remotely through the Ethereum network, according to contracts written into the network.   The code that Mr. Jentzsch wrote for the organization has several safeguards that would make it hard for him or anyone else to game the voting of shareholders to win investments. But even successful crowdfunding sites do not have a great track record of harnessing the enthusiasm of users to pick good investments.   The creator of a now defunct crowdfunding site fueled by Bitcoin, BitShares, wrote a biting online post on Tuesday arguing that the D.A.O. would most likely fail for the same reason that BitShares ultimately failed: ''people problems, economic problems and political problems.''   ''My opinion is that the D.A.O. will be D.O.A. (Dead on Arrival),'' Daniel Larimer, the founder of BitShares, wrote. ''The theory of jointly deciding to fund efforts will face the reality of individual self-interest, politics and economics.''   The possibility of failure did not deter Mr. Stern, the Frenchman who put in the equivalent of $11,000. He said he thought the D.A.O. would provide a good financial return, but he was also motivated by his belief that the venture is an experiment in a new way of organizing companies, and potentially even governments.   ''It's important for people to propose and try an alternative,'' he said.     "
"Central Banks Consider Bitcoin's Technology, if Not Bitcoin","Bitcoin was created by libertarian-minded programmers with a deep suspicion of central banks and the national currencies they issue. Yet it is central banks that are doing some of the most ambitious work of late in trying to harness the technology introduced by Bitcoin.    The central bankers do not want their institutions to own or use Bitcoin itself. Instead, they hope they can use the decentralized method of record-keeping introduced by Bitcoin -- known as the blockchain or distributed ledger -- to complete and record transactions in the real economy more efficiently, quickly and transparently.   The most enthusiastic central banks -- including the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China -- have discussed issuing their national currencies onto some sort of distributed ledger, a name that comes from the concept of several parties keeping records simultaneously.   Blockchains allow several different players to keep a shared spreadsheet using cryptography and so-called consensus mechanisms that provide a way to agree on which transactions happened at what time.    For the central banks, the promise of the technology is that it would allow them to track every pound or renminbi on every step of its travels through the financial system in real time -- something that is impossible now. The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.   If the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.   The Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country's economic output, thanks to the efficiency it could offer.   A deputy governor at the People's Bank of China, Fan Yifei, wrote for Bloomberg View that ''the conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.''   And in a speech on Friday, the Fed governor overseeing new technology, Lael Brainard, said the technology had the potential to transform multiple aspects of the financial system.   ''We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing and settlement,'' Ms. Brainard said.   Even the central bank officials who are most enthusiastic about these experiments say it will be years before any central bank issues its own currency onto a live distributed ledger.   Some critics say the public interest in the blockchain has been all talk and no substance -- an easy way for stuffy central bankers to appear hip and relevant.   David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said many of the central banks looking at blockchain technology would be better served by spending time and energy in updating the current software that underlies the financial system.   ''If you take a snapshot of the existing plumbing, it looks a bit ugly,'' Mr. Andolfatto said. ''There's nothing magical about a blockchain in solving this problem.''   Even within the Fed, though, other researchers and officials have expressed more excitement about the technology.   A week before Ms. Brainard of the Fed gave her speech on distributed ledgers, the chairwoman of the Fed, Janet L. Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that ''innovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.''   The Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its ''enterprise grade'' blockchain.   Most financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.   In the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank's computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors.   Eric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about.   Now, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures.   At the headquarters of the Netherlands' central bank in Amsterdam, Ron Berndsen set up five laptops to run an experimental virtual currency, derived from the Bitcoin software. The coins issued in the system were nicknamed Dukatons, after a 17th-century silver coin used in the time when the Netherlands was a part of the Spanish Empire.   Mr. Berndsen operated the Dukaton system for three months to see what would happen if the central bank were setting the rules and did not have the same limits as Bitcoin. While the experiment was a success, he is now thinking much bigger and is in constant conversation with other central bank officials who are looking at ways to put their own currencies on distributed ledgers.   ''There are so many things going on that it is hard to keep track of all the contacts,'' said Mr. Berndsen, the head of market infrastructure at the Dutch central bank. ''I hear from other central bank colleagues that it is the same everywhere.''   The experimentation so far has taken on many different forms and contemplated many different roles for distributed ledgers to play in the financial system.   The Russian national bank said last week that it had worked with a consortium of Russia's biggest banks to develop its own distributed ledger, which it dubbed Masterchain. The Russian institutions have been sending messages on the system but are also looking at it as a potential ''component of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.''   The Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation's five largest banks -- and the blockchain consulting firm R3 -- for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run this summer, the central bank issued so-called CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar to the one that underlies the Bitcoin alternative known as Ethereum.   The banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money -- in this case fictional money -- the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.   Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in an interview that while the experiment was a success, a great deal of testing is still necessary before the bank can decide whether distributed ledger technology is ready for the real world.   Critics of blockchain technology have noted the apparent contradiction in central banks' looking to distributed ledgers.   The blockchain was created to allow Bitcoin transactions to be recorded communally so that a central authority, such as a central bank, would not be necessary. If a central bank is involved and keeping track, why go to the trouble of keeping records communally?   The distributed ledgers being discussed by central bankers also generally lack the openness that has been one of the most attractive attributes of the Bitcoin network.   With Bitcoin, anyone can join the network and help support it, which has helped it win a following. The distributed ledgers being considered by the financial industry and central banks would generally allow only a small number of registered entities to join in and take part in the network.   Mark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, and perhaps the most prominent champion of distributed ledgers, has said that the technology could be worth using for central banks because it would make for a financial system that does not go down even if the central bank's computer systems are temporarily taken offline.   The Bank of England said last month that it wanted the next version of the bank's basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.   Ms. Wilkins said the Bank of Canada was interested in the technology as a way to build a single, shared record of all the transactions among several institutions. That could leave much less money sitting idle while banks reconcile their different ledgers, as now happens.   It would also create a standardized way of recording transactions that would allow all the players in the system to communicate more seamlessly.    ''There is currently a whole industry set up to reconcile and audit all these separate ledgers, and you can't easily connect them,'' she said. ''This comprehensive shared data source could be a real benefit.''     "
"Zcash, Less Traceable Than Bitcoin, Draws Investors","Speculators are snapping up a new virtual currency known as Zcash that was designed by university academics and built to be all but untraceable. Investors were paying over $1,000 for a single unit of Zcash on Monday, a few days after the currency was first brought online.    The company behind Zcash, led by a developer named Zooko Wilcox, has the support of privacy activists and computer scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It has already secured $3 million in backing from a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists who are involved in the virtual currency industry.    Zcash's developers say they have used advanced cryptography to create a virtual currency that can be sent around the world essentially without a trace, unlike Bitcoin.   While Bitcoin was initially described as an anonymous currency, its transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be tracked and traced by law enforcement. Each Bitcoin user has an address, made up of letters and numbers, and the authorities are often able to link an address to a real person using sophisticated data analysis.   In contrast, Zcash uses a method developed by a team of cryptographers working at M.I.T. and in Israel -- known as zk-Snark -- that allows transactions to be confirmed by the network without anyone recording the Zcash addresses involved in the transactions. Users can opt out of this privacy function.   The privacy features of Zcash could make it harder for the currency to win support from regulators and bankers.   Investigators have used Bitcoin's ledger, known as the blockchain, to track down some people selling drugs for Bitcoins on black market websites.   Such websites have proliferated since the first popular black market site, the Silk Road, was taken down in late 2013.   Since the demise of the Silk Road, mainstream financial institutions have shown significant interest in virtual currencies and particularly in the blockchain technology, which provides a new decentralized way to keep financial records and to power transactions of all sorts. Major central banks have recently been talking about using the technology for their own currencies.   Most projects in the virtual currency area, though, have been pushing in directions that would make it easier to integrate with the existing financial system.   Jonathan Levin, a founder of Chainalysis, a start-up that helps banks and regulators track activity on blockchains, said that the authorities had become comfortable with virtual currencies because they had been able to trace transactions in cases of criminal activity.   ''It's going to be quite difficult for Zcash in its opaqueness to show that, no, it is not all bad stuff going on,'' he said.   But Mr. Wilcox has the help of a former top New York state financial regulator and a former federal prosecutor to help ease the concerns of government officials. Mr. Wilcox is hosting an open virtual meeting later this month with law enforcement officials from across the country to explain the project.   Mr. Wilcox and the programmers who created Zcash say that they developed the currency not to facilitate illegal activity but to provide a degree of privacy for people who do not want their financial transactions visible to the world.   ''The basic story is that we have been gradually losing our privacy in a whole bunch of ways that people don't appreciate,'' said Matthew Green, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins who began developing Zcash with some of his graduate students in 2013. ''This brings back a little bit of that privacy that computers have taken away from us. This technology gives us a defense against something that until now we have been defenseless against.''   Mr. Wilcox said that existing virtual currencies have been unattractive to businesses because their transaction details are exposed to competitors, creating a business need for a more private virtual currency.   ''All of the conversations I've had with businesses, banks, regulators and law enforcement have been about the need for data security for commercial applications,'' he said.   Zcash is modeled closely on Bitcoin. The currency will be released slowly to computers that help support the network underlying the currency. New Zcash units will be distributed to users until there are 21 million of them in the world. Initially Zcash units are being released slowly -- as of Monday, only about 1,500 were out in the world, helping to feed the speculative frenzy around the currency.   The concepts behind Zcash were developed by Mr. Green and other academics, but the project is being run by a for-profit Delaware corporation, Zcash Electric Coin Company, which is led by Mr. Wilcox. The corporation, developers and early investors will be compensated by what amounts to a 10 percent charge on all the new Zcash generated by users during the first four years of operation. Some of these coins will also be directed to a nonprofit Zcash foundation.   There have already been several efforts beyond Zcash to correct for the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin users run their coins through so-called tumblers that can obscure the origin of transactions.   Another relatively new virtual currency, Monero, came with anonymity built into the system. Earlier this year it was seized upon by speculators who pushed up the value of Monero significantly before the price fell back down. Unlike Zcash, Monero can already be used for purchases on black market websites.   Mr. Green, the Zcash developer, said that some people may look to the currency for illegal purposes. But he believes that ultimately the privacy it provides will secure its importance to the mainstream economy.   ''You are going around on the Bitcoin blockchain leaving a trail of everything you do, which will last forever,'' he said. ''The idea of Zcash is you don't have to go to special lengths to achieve privacy -- privacy is baked into the system.''     "
"For Apple's C.E.O., a Journey to Bulwark for Digital Privacy","SAN FRANCISCO -- Letters from around the globe began pouring into the inbox of Timothy D. Cook not long after the publication of the first revelations from Edward J. Snowden about mass government surveillance Do you know how much privacy means to us? they asked Apple's chief executive. Do you understand?    Mr. Cook did. He was proud that Apple sold physical products -- phones, tablets and laptops -- and did not traffic in the intimate, digital details of its customers' lives.   That stance crystallized on Tuesday when Mr. Cook huddled for hours with lawyers and others at Apple's headquarters to figure out how to respond to a federal court order requiring the company to let the United States government break into the iPhone of one of the gunmen in a San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting. Late Tuesday, Mr. Cook took the fight public with a letter to customers that he personally signed.    ''We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the U.S. government,'' wrote Mr. Cook, 55. ''Ultimately, we fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect.''   Mr. Cook's standoff with law enforcement officials is indicative of his personal evolution from a behind-the-scenes operator at Apple to one of the world's most outspoken corporate executives. During that time, he has moved a once secretive Silicon Valley company into the center of highly charged social and legal issues. While Mr. Cook's predecessor, Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs, was considered a business icon, he never took aggressive positions on such matters as Mr. Cook now has.   Being at loggerheads with the United States government is risky for Apple and may draw a torrent of public criticism of the world's most valuable company at a time when its growth rate has significantly decelerated.   Yet people who know Mr. Cook said he did not believe he had a choice but to be vocal. Mr. Cook, who became Apple's chief executive in 2011, has long said that businesses and their leaders should think of themselves as important members of civic society. In September, he emphasized that this responsibility ''has grown markedly in the last couple of decades or so as government has found it more difficult to move forward.''   Mr. Cook ''says what he believes, especially in difficult situations,'' said Don Logan, the former chairman of Time Warner Cable who has been friends with Mr. Cook since he became chief executive of Apple, bonding over their shared alma mater, Auburn University. Of Mr. Cook's opposition to the court order, Mr. Logan said: ''Tim is currently dealing with a very difficult situation and he knows the decision he has made has lots of ramifications, good or bad. But he wants to do the right thing.''   Apple declined to make Mr. Cook available for an interview. The company is preparing to file an opposition brief against the court order.   Mr. Cook's ideas about civic duty were partly formed during his childhood in rural Alabama. In a speech at the United Nations in 2013, he recounted how Ku Klux Klansmen had once burned a cross on the lawn of a black family's home and how he yelled for them to stop. ''This image was permanently imprinted in my brain, and it would change my life forever,'' he said.   At Apple, which he joined as a senior executive in 1998, Mr. Cook was a quiet figure for much of the period when he worked for Mr. Jobs, a showman who prized secrecy at the company. After Mr. Jobs stepped down because of ailing health, Mr. Cook began making Apple more open, publishing an annual report on suppliers and working conditions for more than a million factory workers.   In 2014, Mr. Cook revealed he was gay, a move widely seen as making a statement about gay rights. Last year, he wrote an editorial decrying religious freedom laws that had been proposed in more than two dozen states that would let people skirt anti-discrimination laws that conflicted with their religious beliefs.   His outspokenness has drawn criticism, with some investors questioning how nonbusiness initiatives -- including some of Apple's environmental moves -- would contribute to the company's bottom line. Mr. Cook responded at a shareholder meeting that it is important for Apple to do things ''because they're just and right.''   Privacy has long been a priority for Mr. Cook. At a tech conference in 2010, he said Apple ''has always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley.'' He cited the iPhone's feature that shows where a phone -- and presumably its user -- is and said fears about abuse and stalking had compelled the company to let consumers decide whether or not their apps could use their location data.   Mr. Cook's views on privacy hardened over time as customers globally began entrusting more personal data to Apple's iPhones. At the same time, Apple was growing tired of requests from government officials worldwide asking the company to unlock smartphones.   Each data-extraction request was carefully vetted by Apple's lawyers. Of those deemed legitimate, Apple in recent years required that law enforcement officials physically travel with the gadget to the company's headquarters, where a trusted Apple engineer would work on the phones inside Faraday bags, which block wireless signals, during the process of data extraction.   Processing these requests was extremely tedious. More worrisome, the data stored on its customers iPhones was growing more personal, including photos, messages and bank, health and travel data.   And some government officials were not exactly instilling confidence in Apple's engineers. In one case, after law enforcement officials rushed a phone to Apple's headquarters for data extraction, the engineers discovered their target had not enabled the device's passcode feature.   So Mr. Cook and other Apple executives resolved not only to lock up customer data, but to do so in a way that would put the keys squarely in the hands of the customer, not the company. By the time Apple rolled out a new mobile operating system, iOS7, in September 2013, the company was encrypting all third-party data stored on customers' phones by default.   ''People have a basic right to privacy,'' Mr. Cook has said.   By then, Mr. Snowden's disclosures about how the National Security Agency had cozied up to some tech companies and hacked others to gain user data were reverberating worldwide. The disclosures included revelations of a comprehensive, decade-long Central Intelligence Agency program to compromise Apple's products; C.I.A. analysts tampered with the products so the government could collect app makers' data. In other cases, the agency was embedding spy tools in Apple's hardware, and even modifying an Apple software update that allowed government analysts to record every keystroke.   Letters from alarmed Apple customers started flooding into Mr. Cook's inbox, fortifying his stance on privacy. Apple's eighth mobile operating system, iOS8, which rolled out in September 2014, made it basically impossible for the company's engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.   For officials at the world's law enforcement agencies, the new software was a clear signal that Apple was growing defiant. A month after iOS8's release, James Comey, the director of the F.B.I., told an audience at the Brookings Institution that Apple had gone ''too far'' with the expanded encryption, arguing that the operating system effectively sealed off any chance of tracking kidnappers, terrorists and criminals.   Government agencies began to press Apple and other tech companies for so-called back doors that could bypass strong security measures. With tensions rising, some form of technical compromise -- whether in the form of a chip, a back door or a key -- was off the table by 2015.   At Apple, Mr. Cook and others continued to work with investigators to the extent the company could and complied with court orders. Last October, a federal judge in New York said the government was overstepping its boundaries by using a centuries-old law, the All Writs Act, as the basis for its request that Apple open an iPhone for a drug investigation. Apple's lawyer sided with the judge in the case. The matter has not been resolved.   After December's San Bernardino attack, Apple worked with the F.B.I. to gather data that had been backed up to the cloud from a work iPhone issued to one of the assailants, according to court filings. When investigators also wanted unspecified information on the phone that had not been backed up, the judge this week granted the order requiring Apple to create a special tool to help investigators more easily crack the phone's passcode and get into the device.   Apple had asked the F.B.I. to issue its application for the tool under seal. But the government made it public, prompting Mr. Cook to go into bunker mode to draft a response, according to people privy to the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The result was the letter that Mr. Cook signed on Tuesday, where he argued that it set a ''dangerous precedent'' for a company to be forced to build tools for the government that weaken security.   ''Compromising the security of our personal information can ultimately put our personal safety at risk,'' he wrote. ''That is why encryption has become so important to all of us.''   Far from backing down from the fight, Mr. Cook has told colleagues that he still stands by the company's longstanding plans to encrypt everything stored on Apple's myriad devices, services and in the cloud, where the bulk of data is still stored unencrypted.   ''If you place any value on civil liberties, you don't do what law enforcement is asking,'' Mr. Cook has said.     "
Reporting an 'I.R.S.' Telephone Scam,"Q. With phishing email, I can forward the message to the authorities, but how do you officially report those obvious phone scams from robot voices purporting to be from the Internal Revenue Service?  A. Phone calls and answering machine messages claiming to be from the I.R.S. and demanding money for alleged tax bills can happen year-round. The messages left on an answering machine often use awkward phrasing and sound distinctly like a computer reciting script with its text-to-speech function and synthesized voice.    If you have filed your return, do not owe any taxes and have deduced that the call is a hustle, you can file a report on the website of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which has a special form for I.R.S. Impersonation Scam Reporting. You can also send an email message with the subject line ''I.R.S. Phone Scam'' to phishing@irs.gov to report the call. In either case, include the number you were asked to call and any other information about the experience.   If you pick up a call and get a live person on the line who claims to be from the I.R.S., do not give out any personal information, even if the caller recites the last four digits of your Social Security number. Ask for the employee's name, badge number and the telephone number to call back. Then call 800-366-4484 yourself -- it is the official number for the Treasury Inspector General's hotline in Washington, but a spoofed version of those same digits may have been displayed on your Caller ID screen to feign legitimacy.   When you are talking to an official government employee, provide the original caller's information and ask about your account status, just to confirm that you are dealing with a scammer. (If you know you owe taxes and have questions, you can call the I.R.S. itself at 800-829-1040.)   The I.R.S. has stated on numerous occasions that it first contacts people with a letter in the mail if there is an issue with a tax payment; the agency also does not initiate contact with a taxpayer over email or social media.

Borrowing Real Tech From Virtual Money,"A well-known former JPMorgan Chase executive, Blythe Masters, has raised $52 million from several big banks for a start-up built on the technology underlying the Bitcoin virtual currency.  The start-up Digital Asset Holdings, based in New York, said on Thursday afternoon that it had raised the money from 13 financial institutions, including Ms. Masters's former employer, JPMorgan, as well as Citi, BNP Paribas and Santander.     At the same time, the company also announced that it had signed a deal with Australia's primary stock exchange, ASX, to provide technology that would speed up the settlement and transfer of money after stock trades. ASX Limited is also making a big investment in Digital Asset Holdings.    Digital Asset Holdings has based its technology on the blockchain concept that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin. The blockchain is the database in which all transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Unlike typical databases, the blockchain is maintained by users in a decentralized fashion. That has led many in the financial industry to hail it as a faster -- and more reliable -- alternative to existing transaction systems.    Many financial institutions have been looking at ways to use a blockchain to modernize financial transactions by cutting out various middlemen from the markets. The Nasdaq stock exchange has already integrated blockchain technology to improve stock trading.    Ms. Masters gave the technology a big boost when she announced her involvement with Digital Asset Holdings in early 2015. She left JPMorgan the previous year after a career during which she became one of the best-known figures in the financial industry.    Big questions remain, however, about how blockchain technology can be used in the real world, and so far talk of its potential has raced ahead of real-world uses.    In recent months, this disparity has caused some concern about the companies that are trying to raise money to build start-ups on the blockchain concept, including Digital Asset Holdings.    Potential investors said that it took Ms. Masters longer than expected to pull together her funders -- and that some big-name banks ultimately declined to participate.   But Ms. Masters ended up raising more money than the $35 million that had been previously discussed. This round of fund-raising values Digital Asset Holdings at $100 million.   The Australian exchange company said that Digital Asset Holdings would help it develop new technology for the processes that take place after a stock is actually traded.    ''Distributed Ledger Technology could provide a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reduce cost, time and complexity in the post-trade environment of Australia's equity market,'' the chief executive of ASX, Elmer Funke Kupper, said in a statement.    The other investors include CME Ventures, ABN AMRO, Santander's innovation arm, Deutsche Börse Group, Accenture, Broadridge Financial Solutions, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, and PNC Financial Services.

Sallie Krawcheck Joins Board of Software Start-Up,"Two former banking stars are joining forces. Sallie Krawcheck, a former top wealth management executive on Wall Street, joined the board of the software start-up Digital Asset Holdings, which is run by Blythe Masters, a former investment banker.  Last month, Digital Asset Holdings announced that it had raised $60 million from a group of banks and other investors, including Goldman Sachs, IBMand JPMorgan Chase, and said it would expand its board.    The company develops software to speed up trade settlement, money transfer and other behind-the-scenes transactional activities in the global financial markets. It is based on the blockchain concept that underpins the virtual currency Bitcoin.   Ms. Krawcheck is the chief executive and a co-founder of Ellevest, an online investment firm that caters to women, and she is the chairwoman of Ellevate Network, a professional women's network. Earlier in her career, she was the head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch's wealth management division, as well as head of Citigroup's wealth management unit and its chief financial officer.   Ms. Masters is a former top banker from JPMorgan Chase, where she was head of commodities before leaving in 2014. She was part of the team of bankers who developed the credit default swap in the 1990s.   Financial institutions are studying blockchain technology as a promising way to modernize markets, and Ms. Masters added to its legitimacy when she joined Digital Asset Holdings last year. Other board members include Donald R. Wilson Jr., the chief executive of the proprietary trading firm the DRW Trading Group; Cristobal Conde, the former chief executive of the financial software firm SunGard; and Catherine Flax, the head of commodities in the Americas for the French bank BNP Paribas.

New Kid on the Blockchain,"A new virtual gold rush is underway. Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency -- known as Ethereum -- has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.    Beyond the price spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0.   The rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been helped by a battle within the Bitcoin community over how the basic Bitcoin software should develop.   The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. Enter Ethereum.    Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen.   But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.   The system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes.   All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin.   Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.   But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things.   Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure.   ''Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution -- the most elegant solution we have seen to date,'' said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft.   Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository.   Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together -- somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.   Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system -- known as an Ether -- that people have recently been buying.   The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, ''Blockchain: Tapping Into the Real Potential, Cutting Through the Hype.''   Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain.   Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a ''significant'' purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved.   ''A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' '' he said. ''It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.''   Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.   Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum.   Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.   The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain -- the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source -- say, The Associated Press -- the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.   The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.   A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development.   Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers -- or nodes -- helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes.   One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.   The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around.   Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets.   ''Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,'' he said.   Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin.   It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned.   ''Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,'' Mr. Bonneau said. ''It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.''     "
Bitcoin Start-Up Gets Money License From Britain and a Link to Barclays,"The British government has pushed through its first licensing of a virtual currency company, underscoring its desire to make London a hub for the development of financial technology. The Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's top financial regulator, has granted an electronic money license to Circle, a company based in Boston that uses Bitcoin, the virtual currency, to enable consumers to make payments to other consumers using a mobile app, or ''social payments'' as the company puts it.    The regulator helped Circle get the license by putting it in the government's Innovation Hub, which is one of several initiatives Britain has undertaken to encourage experimentation in the financial industry.    The license makes it possible for Circle to establish a banking relationship with Barclays, the British bank. It is the first time that a large global bank has agreed to work with a Bitcoin company, though Circle has attracted investments from others.   The British economic secretary to the treasury, Harriett Baldwin, said in an email that the license and Barclays' relationship with Circle ''prove our decision to introduce the most progressive, forward-looking regulatory regime is paying off and cements our status as the world's fintech capital.''   Circle, which was founded in 2013, already allows customers in the United States to easily send payments to one another and buy and sell Bitcoin, and customers in Britain will now be able to do the same.   But Circle has long aimed to use Bitcoin as a back-end network to make it easier and cheaper to move money between national currencies. The Bitcoin technology, which first emerged in 2009, has been promoted as a way to quickly and cheaply move money across national borders without using traditional money-transmitting services such as Western Union.   Circle is set up so that its customers can hold their money in national currencies to avoid the volatile price of Bitcoin. When a customer wants to move money, he or she can buy Bitcoin for the short period of time required to send the money or simply move dollars or pounds from a linked bank account.   The British license will allow Circle customers to instantly transfer money between dollars and British pounds -- and soon enough, between those currencies and euros, given that the e-money license is valid across the European Union.   ''For the first time any consumer in the U.S. and the U.K. will be able to beam sterling and dollars back and forth, instantly for free,'' said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder of Circle. ''That's just never been possible.''   It is a difficult moment for the virtual currency. The developers who maintain the basic Bitcoin software have been divided over updates to the software. That has caused a schism in the Bitcoin community and slowed down transactions.   Some companies have been looking at other virtual currencies, such as Ethereum, as an alternative way to transfer money using what is known as a blockchain, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Mr. Allaire said that Ethereum was not yet ready for global use in the same way as Bitcoin, but that it could be in the future.   ''We are not wedded to one blockchain as the right one,'' he said.   In the United States, Circle has not managed to take Bitcoin mainstream, but it has gotten Bitcoin some key seals of approval. Back in 2013, it got funding from the major venture capital firms Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners. And last year, Circle became the first company to get a so-called BitLicense from New York state's top financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services.   The New York agency had been the only regulatory body to devise a licensing system for virtual currency companies, trying to confront the fraud and crime that have plagued the technology.   But the British government has taken several steps to emphasize its interest in attracting virtual currency start-ups, among other types of financial technology, to London.   The British chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, publicly purchased virtual currency from a Bitcoin A.T.M. in 2014 at an event where he announced the government's desire to work with virtual currency companies.   The moves appear to be, at least in part, a way to draw new businesses to London as many parts of the financial industry have struggled with lagging revenue.   Several executives at Barclays have previously discussed the bank's interest in Bitcoin and the blockchain technology. The bank has labs in London dedicated to experimenting with the technology.

Breaking the Chains,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Getting a financial start-up off the ground is tough enough. The likelihood of incurring huge legal fees to secure money transmission licenses in all 50 states makes it that much harder. Yet that is what some digital currency start-ups face as a result of a bewildering hodgepodge of regulations across state and national lines that can make it difficult even to know which rules apply.    Hoping to remove at least some of the burden, government agencies in the United States and elsewhere have been increasing their efforts to update the regulations.    Last week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, unveiled a white paper that it said was a first step in helping foster innovation in financial tech, particularly for businesses tied to existing banks.   ''Not every innovation is appropriate for a regulated financial institution, and not every innovation that is appropriate for a regulated institution is appropriate for all regulated institutions,'' Thomas J. Curry, the comptroller, said in remarks. ''But avoiding new approaches completely is equally dangerous.''   Many of the existing laws apply to older forms of finance like Western Union, the money-transfer company founded 165 years ago to capitalize on telegraph technology. The lack of fresh rules today means that modern fintech start-ups must also adapt to 19th-century regulations.   And states have their own rules. In Wyoming, for instance, digital currency start-ups must maintain enormous amounts of capital reserves to operate there.   ''There is no regulation that is focused specifically on fintech,'' said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a nonprofit advocacy group for digital currencies like Bitcoin. ''What happens is that there are places where tech has outpaced the law.''   The white paper follows some previous efforts by regulators to revise the rules. Last year, the Treasury Department sought information about marketplace lending, which matches borrowers and lenders over the Internet using algorithms.   This year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outlined a new policy meant to give start-ups more confidence in introducing financial products without fear of a regulatory rebuke, at least initially.   Existing rules make it difficult to guess which regulations apply to which firms. Take multisignature technology, in which wallets holding digital currencies like Bitcoin have authorization ''keys'' held by different parties. No transaction involving that money can take place without the consent of at least two of the key holders.   Whether digital wallet companies can do anything with those deposits in the meantime, as insurance companies do when they invest their unpaid premiums, remains an open question.   Some big banks, while arguing that they are embracing financial tech, want regulations for the new companies that are equal to what the banks face. Bank of America's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this year that disruptions to the payments system would be costly and that regulators must work to ensure that the industry can run smoothly.   As William Winters, the chief of Standard Chartered Bank, put it during that panel, ''As long as it's a level playing field, it's O.K.''   For some companies in the fintech business, that is not a problem. Take Prosper, an early entrant in the marketplace-lending industry.   The company has worked to comply with regulations on both sides of its business, its executives said. Investors in the loans it assembles are protected by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as regulators in 31 states.   Borrowers on Prosper's platform are covered by traditional banking rules, since Prosper technically teams with WebBank of Utah to disburse its loans.   ''It's the same framework that applies to any bank lending program,'' Sachin Adarkar, Prosper's general counsel, said in an interview.   Other governments have been starting their own initiatives. Britain unveiled Project Innovate last year to establish ways for start-ups to introduce services under the eye of government agencies.   The European Union allows companies that hold a license in one country to ''passport'' it to other members of the bloc.   Allowing something similar in the United States would most likely require action from Congress. Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, has said that Republicans plan to introduce legislation meant to modernize rules and let fintech innovation flourish. But analysts say that such a move could face resistance.   ''It would be politically difficult,'' Mr. Brito said. ''What you would be doing is challenging or removing authority of many different state regulators.''   That makes it unlikely that the bramble of regulations will go away soon.     "
"Taking Credit for Bitcoin, and Facing Skepticism","Follow Paul Mozur @paulmozur and Nathaniel Popper @nathanielpopper on Twitter. An Australian entrepreneur claimed on Monday to be the creator of the online currency Bitcoin. Within hours, the skepticism started. Whether the truth is ultimately uncovered, the hunt for the founder's identity is part of the new reality of the online age. A vast array of new tools and technologies make it ever easier to hide in the vast digital ocean that is the Internet -- and all the more difficult to put a face to every screen name.    The identity debate is crucial for Bitcoin as those in the virtual currency community take sides over its direction. Some purists want to maintain Bitcoin's outsider status, underscored by the mystique surrounding its founder. Others see an opportunity to expand Bitcoin into the commercial realm, making it more vulnerable to speculation and uncertainty.   Craig Steven Wright, the computer programmer who claimed in interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ to be the currency's progenitor, said that he had come forward to quell the rumors. While Mr. Wright was first identified as Bitcoin's founder in December 2015 by Wired magazine and the technology website Gizmodo, he remained silent then.    Mr. Wright said that he now wanted to ''dispel any negative myths and fears'' about the virtual currency. ''I cannot allow the misinformation that has been spread to impact the future of Bitcoin,'' he said.   He didn't offer further insight in the timing of his announcement. And he declined an interview request through a representative at the Outside Organisation, a public relations company.   If his claims prove true, Mr. Wright could help shape the debate over the future of Bitcoin. The direction of the virtual currency is at an impasse ahead of a major Bitcoin conference on Monday.   But many technical experts, including some of the leading Bitcoin developers, said that Mr. Wright's evidence did not prove he was the digital currency's creator, identified by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.   ''It would take the real Satoshi about five minutes to provide conclusive proof to the entire Bitcoin community, if the real Satoshi wanted to do that,'' said Joseph Bonneau, a researcher at the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University.   Then there were the enthusiasts who sought to play down the importance of the founder's identity. The creator, they argued, has remained anonymous for years and the currency's popularity has grown regardless.   Mr. Wright is ''a lot like those very difficult geek/nerd/blatherers that turn minor I.T. support into a social drama,'' Ian Grigg, a crypto-currency researcher, wrote in a blog entry.   ''Satoshi was more than a name, it was a concept, a secret, a team, a vision. Now Satoshi lives on in a new form -- changed,'' he added. ''Much of the secret is gone, but the vision is still there.''   In the world of cybercrimes and encryption, finding the human behind the computer is the exception, not the rule.   The leaker of the Panama Papers, the trove of documents that exposed offshore accounts used by the rich and powerful, remains anonymous. The digital culprits who stole more than $80 million from Bangladesh's central bank remain at large. And there is still no concrete indication of the perpetrators of the hack against Sony in 2014.   The creator of the illicit Internet market called the Silk Road, known in part for its reliance on Bitcoin, was confirmed only by an operation in which he was grabbed at a San Francisco library with his laptop open. Before that, all that was known about him was an intriguing screen name: Dread Pirate Roberts.   The latest twist in Bitcoin's origins story is likely to feed the power vacuum that has plagued the virtual currency.   While a decentralized nature is at Bitcoin's core, it has also led to internal reflection over its evolution. Bitcoin's longtime backers have recently split over the proper way to expand the network.   Founded as a digital competitor to existing currencies, Bitcoin has moved more into the mainstream of late. Financial institutions are putting resources into researching how they can use the blockchain, the currency's communal digital ledger, to make transactions faster and cheaper. Competition, too, has risen, with a host of new virtual currencies, like Ethereum. And the growth of the Bitcoin system has stalled.   The mystery of Bitcoin's founder has been central to its cachet ever since it surfaced in 2009. Yet the creator has also been mostly silent since Bitcoin rose to prominence.   If Mr. Wright's claims can be confirmed, they open a whole new set of issues for Bitcoin. Does its creator have more power than others who have played a major role in its development? If the founder asserts authority over its direction, does that undercut the very power of the currency as a decentralized system?   Mr. Wright's revelation was made just before a large Bitcoin conference began in New York on Monday. After the announcement, the price of Bitcoin fell about $10.   Satoshi, as the creator became known, communicated only by electronic message and never revealed his or her true identity before cutting off all communication in 2011. That has led to frequent speculation about the identity of Satoshi -- speculation that has so far proved wrong.   In perhaps the most notable case, Newsweek claimed in 2014 that the founder was Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a physicist living in California. The revelation fueled a reporter-driven car chase of Mr. Nakamoto across Los Angeles, an indication of the tabloid-level curiosity behind Bitcoin's originator. Dorian Nakamoto eventually denied being the Bitcoin founder.   If Mr. Wright is perpetrating a hoax, it is a rather elaborate one.   To back up his claims, the BBC said Mr. Wright had provided digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys inextricably linked to Bitcoins generated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Wright also posted evidence on his blog, including a technical walk through of how to verify cryptographic keys.   ''I didn't take the decision lightly to make my identity public,'' Mr. Wright said in a news release, ''and I want to be clear that I'm doing this because I care so passionately about my work.''   Soon after the stories were published in Wired and Gizmodo, the Australian Federal Police raided Mr. Wright's home in suburban Sydney in connection with a tax investigation. The Australian tax authorities said at the time that they had determined that Mr. Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto.   Gavin Andresen, who succeeded Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin developer, wrote Monday on his blog that he believed Mr. Wright's claim. Mr. Andresen has pushed for a bigger Bitcoin, a strategy Mr. Wright also appears to back.   ''After spending time with him, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi,'' Mr. Andresen wrote. ''During our meeting, I saw the brilliant, opinionated, focused, generous -- and privacy-seeking -- person that matches the Satoshi I worked with six years ago.   But the Bitcoin community was not in consensus.   Another of the leading developers working on Bitcoin's basic software, Gregory Maxwell, said that the evidence presented by Mr. Wright was not enough to convince him. ''It demonstrates no connection between this person and Bitcoin's creation,'' Mr. Maxwell wrote in an email to the Times.   A programmer who is in charge of the Bitcoin discussion boards, Michael Marquardt, wrote on Reddit -- under the screen name ''theymos'' -- that Mr. Wright's new writings suggest an effort to deceive the public. And the main Reddit page dedicated to Bitcoin was full of discussion on Monday about the legitimacy of Mr. Wright's claims.   ''Altogether, the weight of the new evidence tips the scales very little, and the scales were already stacked against him being Satoshi,'' said Jeremy Clark, an assistant professor at the Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering in Montreal.

Claims Run in Trillions; Mt. Gox Has Just Millions,"$2,411,412,137,427. That figure -- $2.4 trillion for those with an untrained eye for very large numbers -- is in the same ballpark as the annual economic output of France.    It is also exactly the amount that people around the world claim they lost when Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based virtual currency exchange, collapsed into bankruptcy in 2014, after huge, unexplained losses of the volatile digital currency Bitcoin.   As with most of the people who lost money with Bernard L. Madoff, the investment manager who was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme, most of those who put their Bitcoin in Mt. Gox will be disappointed: The Japanese trustee overseeing the case said on Wednesday that only $91 million in assets has been tracked down to distribute to claimants -- a small portion of the more than $500 million in assets that Mt. Gox claimed it had in the weeks before it went bankrupt in February 2014, and a tiny portion of the amount that claimants have requested.    The giant gaps between those numbers are an indication, if nothing else, of the sheer number of dishonest people who have been drawn to the fiasco around Mt. Gox and Bitcoin. They are also the latest reminders of the topsy-turvy nature of the digital-currency realm. A currency designed to bring computer precision and traceability to money has been marked by multiple unsolved mysteries swirling around it.   Journalists and others have made many unsuccessful attempts to determine the true identity of the creator of the Bitcoin technology, a programmer or group of programmers going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.   Bitcoin experts and law enforcement officials have spent over two years trying to figure out how hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange. There have been lots of conspiracy theories but few solid answers.   The amount that claimants have requested from the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate is absurd on its face, given that all the Bitcoins in the world today are worth about $7 billion, or 0.3 percent of the $2.4 trillion being claimed.   Most of that huge number is an outsize claim by one individual -- but even after that is taken out, the rest of the claimants said they lost some $27 billion, or 54 times what the exchange claimed it held before it went under.   The trustee said on Wednesday at a meeting with creditors that $414 million of the claims appeared to be legitimate and have been approved. Each of those claimants will get some portion of the $91 million. It is not yet clear how much because of outstanding lawsuits and investigations.   Bitcoin investors have complained about how long it has taken to work through the claims, not to mention the legal and accounting costs. The trustee reports that those costs have added up to about $5.5 million so far.   ''I am disturbed by the amount of money which the bankruptcy process has burned through,'' Kolin Burges, one of the most outspoken creditors, said on Wednesday. ''We have seen very poor results from the investigations, and the details have been constantly shrouded from the creditors.''   Mt. Gox's collapse in 2014 threatened to destroy the cottage industry that was built around Bitcoin in the years after it was released in early 2009. The price that people were willing to pay for Bitcoin steadily declined for over a year after the bankruptcy.   But the problems in Tokyo also led to a professionalization of the virtual currency world, with established entrepreneurs and venture capitalists getting involved and regulators establishing basic rules for businesses in the industry. These days, many banks are examining how to harness the technology underlying Bitcoin, known as the blockchain, though Bitcoin itself has been hurt by infighting among the developers working on the technology.   Mt. Gox was the most prominent company during Bitcoin's early, Wild West years, as it became one of the first widely used places to exchange dollars or euros for Bitcoin.   The company was run from Tokyo by a young Frenchman named Mark Karpeles, who had essentially no experience working with financial software. The exchange suffered several breakdowns and attacks, but many customers still kept their money there.   Mr. Karpeles filed for bankruptcy after months of unexplained behavior. While he initially said the exchange could not locate 850,000 Bitcoins -- worth about $450 million at the time -- he later reported to the court that he had found 200,000 Bitcoins in misplaced digital wallets.   Those 200,000 Bitcoins form the bulk of the money that the bankruptcy trustee will return to Mt. Gox customers. In an unusual step, the trustee has indicated that he will allow valid claimants to be paid in Bitcoin rather than yen or dollars.   Mr. Karpeles was arrested by the Japanese authorities last August on suspicion of illegally adding money to an account under his control, though not on charges directly related to the missing Bitcoins. This week, the trustee said he was helping with the ''ongoing criminal investigation'' of Mr. Karpeles.   Japanese government officials have still given few indications of what they think happened to the missing money. A Tokyo computer security company, WizSec, has published reports on its own private investigation of the money using the blockchain ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded.   WizSec has said it appears that Bitcoins began disappearing from Mt. Gox back in 2011 and continued being transferred out of the exchange in small amounts over time. The researchers believe that the thief altered Mt. Gox's internal records so that Mr. Karpeles did not realize the money was gone.   ''The unfortunate reality of Bitcoin is that it's just so tempting to steal it digitally,'' Kim Nilsson, a researcher with WizSec, said on Wednesday.   Mr. Nilsson says he lost a few thousand dollars with Mt. Gox, some of which he hopes to recover from the estate.   Mr. Nilsson said he no longer trusted his Bitcoin to anyone other than himself. But he says he is as excited as ever about the virtual currency, in part because of the way that the blockchain made it possible for individuals like him to do their own investigation of the Mt. Gox collapse.   ''Thanks to the blockchain, everyone has an equal starting point,'' he said. ''It's possible to crowdsource forensic investigations.''     "
American Tech Giants vs. the Nation-State,"Virtual reality is all fun and games, until your avatar gets strip-searched at the border. Things haven't gone that far yet, but it might be time to get ready. As Farhad Manjoo reports, the biggest American technology companies appear to be headed for a global clash with governments that want to curb their practices.    The most familiar controls have to do with the storage and movement of personal data, which compelled Amazon to build data centers in Germany to abide with laws on keeping personal information inside that country. At the time, an Amazon executive called German law ''a form of customer demand.''    New types of control go into things like perhaps compelling Netflix to offer local content in Europe and forbidding Facebook to provide a limited type of free internet access and refusing Apple's attempt at selling refurbished iPhones in India.   The Indian government wants smartphones that have 30 percent local parts, but the big global conflict here is equally about the way that technology is now overtly steering culture, something nations often protect as vigorously as their borders.   That is ironically fitting. As the late Benedict Anderson pointed out, the nation-state came about as a result of technology: The printing press created the mass market of vernacular literature, including (thanks to the likes of Martin Luther, the first best-selling writer) translations of the Holy Bible. Marketing directly to speakers of French, English and German created a new kind of language and cultural consciousness that hadn't existed before. Over time, that turned into the ideas of a nation and a people. No Gutenberg, no nations.   The new borderless technologies appear to be having much the same effect, at lightning speed. Bitcoin, the currency backed by no government, creates a belief in a kind of transnational society of Bitcoin holders. Google Translate collapses the barrier of language, so a Finnish and a Chinese speaker can converse with just a smartphone between them. Facebook's 10-year plan to put enough bandwidth in the world for virtual reality anywhere indicates that even cultural gestures will be shared with everyone.   At first pass, the spread of these seemingly limitless freedoms seems akin to the spread of American products like Hollywood movies and rock 'n' roll across much of the world (much to the consternation of many governmental, cultural and religious leaders.) Or maybe they seem like the less-remarked-on spread of Western democratic tropes after World War II, so that even a totalitarian state like North Korea holds sham elections to declare its government the people's will.   That seems to be the case, since places like Europe worry about the big computers of Google and Amazon, but not so much about similarly sized systems inside the Chinese giants Alibaba and Tencent. The Chinese companies tend to stay inside China.   In fact, it may be something newer and more threatening to the state: the triumph not of American values but of algorithmic ones, designed to engage the largest audience, to understand the most about a person and to infer the greatest number of patterns in nature and society in order to exploit them.   For now, one or another intelligence agency may snoop on an American tech company's findings, but as the recent Apple-F.B.I. conflict shows, that doesn't mean interests are allied anymore.   There is no allegiance to any government, perhaps, but to something we don't yet understand. It could be maximizing scientific discovery or ensuring the most consumer pleasure, or connecting with people who matter most. Big as they are, the new systems are still only partly built out.   Even the chief executives at the biggest of them don't know where all this will lead, any more than Gutenberg could have foreseen Martin Luther and the nation-state.     "
The New Bitcoin Superpower,"A delegation of American executives flew to Beijing in April for a secret meeting just blocks from Tiananmen Square. They had come to court the new kingmakers in one of the strangest experiments in money the world has seen: the virtual currency known as Bitcoin. Against long odds, and despite an abstruse structure, in which supercomputers ''mine'' the currency via mathematical formulas, Bitcoin has become a multibillion-dollar industry. It has attracted major investments from Silicon Valley and a significant following on Wall Street.    Yet Bitcoin, which is both a new kind of digital money and an unusual financial network, is having something of an identity crisis. Like so many technologies before it, the virtual currency is coming up against the inevitable push and pull between commercial growth and the purity of its original ambitions.   In its early conception, Bitcoin was to exist beyond the control of any single government or country. It would be based everywhere and nowhere.    Yet despite the talk of a borderless currency, a handful of Chinese companies have effectively assumed majority control of the Bitcoin network. They have done so through canny investments and vast farms of computer servers dispersed around the country. The American delegation flew to Beijing because that was where much of the Bitcoin power was concentrated.   At the time of the meeting, held at the Grand Hyatt hotel, over 70 percent of the transactions on the Bitcoin network were going through just four Chinese companies, known as Bitcoin mining pools -- and most flowed through just two of those companies. That gives them what amounts to veto power over any changes to the Bitcoin software and technology.   China has become a market for Bitcoin unlike anything in the West, fueling huge investments in server farms as well as enormous speculative trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges. Chinese exchanges have accounted for 42 percent of all Bitcoin transactions this year, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Chainalysis. Just last week, the Chinese internet giant Baidu joined with three Chinese banks to invest in the American Bitcoin company Circle.   But China's clout is raising worries about Bitcoin's independence and decentralization, which was supposed to give the technology freedom from the sort of government crackdowns and interventions that are commonplace in the Chinese financial world.   ''The concentration in a single jurisdiction does not bode well,'' said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell and a Bitcoin researcher. ''We need to pay attention to these things if we want decentralization to be a meaningful thing.''   The power of Chinese companies has already come to play a major role in a civil war that has divided Bitcoin followers over the last year and led to the departure of one of the top developers of the virtual currency. The dispute has hinged on technical matters as well as on bigger questions of what Bitcoin should look like in 10 or 20 years.   Network Bottleneck   The American companies whose executives journeyed to the Grand Hyatt -- including venture-capital-funded start-ups like Coinbase and Circle -- are fighting to make Bitcoin bigger. They hope to expand the capacity of the Bitcoin network so that it can process more transactions and compete with the PayPals and Visas of the world.   The current size of the network goes back to the early days, when Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, limited the amount of data that could travel through the network, essentially capping it at about seven transactions a second. As Bitcoin has grown more popular, those limits have caused severe congestion and led to lengthy transaction delays.   The American delegation in China had a software proposal, known as Bitcoin Classic, that would change all that.   The Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of longtime programmers who wanted to keep Bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides.   In a hotel conference room, the American team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall.   ''We kept coming back and saying, 'For better or worse, you have this leadership in the industry, and everyone is looking to you to show some leadership,''' said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase.   Ultimately, Mr. Armstrong said, ''We were unable to convince them.''   Some Bitcoin advocates have complained that the Chinese companies have been motivated only by short-term profit, rather than the long-term success and ideals of the project. Bobby Lee, chief executive of the Bitcoin company BTCC, which is based in Shanghai, bristled at that -- and at the notion that the Chinese companies represent any sort of united front. He attended the April meeting and pointed out that the Chinese companies had disagreed among themselves on how urgent it was to make changes to the Bitcoin software.   He said the American companies failed to understand the power dynamics in the room that day. ''It was almost like imperialistic Westerners coming to China and telling us what to do,'' Mr. Lee said in an interview last week. ''There has been a history on this. The Chinese people have long memories.''   A Mining Powerhouse   The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released the software in early 2009. It was designed to provide both a digital coin and a new way to move and hold money, much as email had made it possible to send messages without using a postal service.   From the beginning, the system was designed to be decentralized -- operated by all the people who joined their computers to the Bitcoin network and helped process the transactions, much as Wikipedia entries are written and maintained by volunteers around the world.   The appeal of a group-run network was that there would be no single point of failure and no company that could shut things down if the police intervened. This was censorship-free money, Bitcoin followers liked to say. Decision-making power for the network resided with the people who joined it, in proportion to the computing power they provided.   The allure of new riches provided the incentive to join: Every 10 minutes, new Bitcoins would be released and given to one of the computers helping maintain the system. In the lingo of Bitcoin, these computers were said to be mining for currency. They also served as accountants for the network.   For the first few years, aside from its use as a payment method on the Silk Road, an online drug market that has since been shut down, Bitcoin failed to gain much traction. It burst into the world's consciousness in 2013 when the price of the digital money began to spike, in no small part because Chinese investors began trading Bitcoins in large numbers.   Mr. Lee said the Chinese took quickly to Bitcoin for several reasons. For one thing, the Chinese government had strictly limited other potential investment avenues, giving citizens a hunger for new assets. Also, Mr. Lee said, the Chinese loved the volatile price of Bitcoin, which gave the fledgling currency network the feeling of online gambling, a very popular activity in China.   There has been widespread speculation that Chinese people have used Bitcoin to get money out of the country and evade capital controls, but Mr. Lee and other experts said the evidence suggests this is not a significant phenomenon.   ''No Chinese person is pushing for Bitcoin because it's libertarian or because it's going to cause the downfall of governments,'' said Mr. Lee, who moved to China after growing up in Africa and the United States and studying at Stanford. ''This was an investment.''   The extent of the speculative activity in China in late 2013 pushed the price of a single Bitcoin above $1,000. That surge -- and the accompanying media spotlight -- led China's government to intervene in December 2013 and cut off the flow of money between Chinese banks and Bitcoin exchanges, popping what appeared to be a Bitcoin bubble.   The frenzy, though, awakened interest in another aspect of the currency: Bitcoin mining.   Peter Ng, a former investment manager, is one of the many people in China who moved from trading Bitcoins to amassing computing power to mine them. First, he mined for himself. More recently he has created data centers across China where other people can pay to set up their own mining computers. He now has 28 such centers, all of them filled with endless racks of servers, tangled cords and fans cooling the machines.   Mr. Ng, 36, said he had become an expert in finding cheap energy, often in places where a coal plant or hydroelectric dam was built to support some industrial project that never happened. The Bitcoin mining machines in his facilities use about 38 megawatts of electricity, he said, enough to power a small city.   The people who put their machines in Mr. Ng's data centers generally join mining pools, which smooth the financial returns of smaller players. A popular one, BTCC Pool, is run by Mr. Lee's company. This month it attracted about 13 percent of the total computational power on the Bitcoin network. The most powerful pool in China -- or anywhere in the world -- is known as F2Pool, and it had 27 percent of the network's computational power last month.   The Politics of Pools   Big pool operators have become the kingmakers of the Bitcoin world: Running the pools confers the right to vote on changes to Bitcoin's software, and the bigger the pool, the more voting power. If members of a pool disagree, they can switch to another pool. But most miners choose a pool based on its payout structure, not its Bitcoin politics.   It was his role overseeing BTCC Pool that got Mr. Lee invited to the meeting with the American delegation in Beijing. The head of operations at F2Pool, Wang Chun, was also there.   Perhaps the most important player in the Chinese Bitcoin world is Jihan Wu, 30, a former investment analyst who founded what is often described in China as the world's most valuable Bitcoin company. That company, Bitmain, began to build computers in 2013 using chips specially designed to do mining computations.   Bitmain, which has 250 employees, manufactures and sells Bitcoin mining computers. It also operates a pool that other miners can join, called Antpool, and keeps a significant number of mining machines for itself, which it maintains in Iceland and the United States, as well as in China. The machines that Bitmain retains for itself account for 10 percent of the computing power on the global Bitcoin network and are enough to produce new coins worth about $230,000 each day, at the exchange rate last week.   Mr. Wu and the other mining pool operators in China have often seemed somewhat surprised, and even unhappy, that their investments have given them decision-making power within the Bitcoin network. ''Miners are the hardware guys. Why are you asking us about software?'' is the line that Mr. Ng said he often hears from miners.   This attitude initially led most Chinese miners to align themselves with old-line Bitcoin coders, known as the core programmers, who have resisted changing the software. The miners wanted to take no risks with the money they were minting.   But lately, Mr. Wu has grown increasingly vocal in his belief that the network is going to have to expand, and soon, if it wants to keep its followers. He said in an email last week that if the core programmers did not increase the number of transactions going through the network by July, he would begin looking for alternatives to expand the network.   However the software debate goes, there are fears that China's government could decide, at some point, to pressure miners in the country to use their influence to alter the rules of the Bitcoin network. The government's intervention in 2013 suggests that Bitcoin is not too small to escape notice.   Mr. Wu dismissed that concern. He also said that as more Americans buy his Bitmain machines and take advantage of cheap power in places like Washington State, mining will naturally become more decentralized. Already, he said, 30 to 40 percent of new Bitmain machines are being shipped out of China.   For now, though, China remains dominant.   ''The Chinese government normally expects its businesses to obtain a leading role in emerging industries,'' he said. ''China's Bitcoin businesses have achieved that.''     "
Chinese Investors in a Deal for Caesars Mobile Games,"Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter @paulmozur . HONG KONG -- Gambling may be illegal in mainland China, but that is not stopping Chinese tech investors from betting on casino-style mobile games. In the most recent example in a growing trend of big deals for smartphone-based games, a consortium of Chinese investors led by the game company Shanghai Giant Network Technology said in a statement on Saturday that it would pay $4.4 billion to Caesars Interactive Entertainment for Playtika, its social and mobile games unit. Caesars Interactive is controlled by the owners of Caesars Palace and other casinos in Las Vegas and elsewhere.     The Chinese consortium -- which also includes Yunfeng Capital, the private equity fund of Jack Ma, the chairman of Alibaba -- said it would allow Playtika, based in Israel, to continue to operate independently. The all-cash deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year, does not include Caesars Interactive's World Series of Poker game or its other real-money game businesses.   In recent years, the Montreal-based Caesars Interactive has built Playtika, which it acquired in 2011, into a major player in the world of smartphone-based casino-style games. While many of Playtika's games, like Slotomania and Bingo Blitz, are free to play, users can also pay for virtual currency and items to enhance play. The virtual currency used in Playtika games will continue to be not exchangeable for real money, according to the statement.   While it is not clear when or whether Chinese regulators will accept gambling-style games, the Chinese investment is an example of how internet companies in China often invest first and then worry about legal restrictions. It is also a sign that investors are willing to pay increasingly large sums for smartphone games, which have proved to be one of the best ways to make money from users.   In June, the Chinese internet giant Tencent said it would pay $8.6 billion for a controlling stake in the Finnish game maker Supercell, which makes the popular smartphone game Clash of Clans. Late last year, the American video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard said it would pay about $6 billion for King Digital, maker of Candy Crush.   While social networking apps may be more popular, mobile games like Clash of Clans and Candy Crush are some of the most profitable apps around. In China, where playing games on a smartphone can often stand in for other entertainment, like going to a movie, technology companies have competed intensely to lure players and the spare change those players are willing to spend on games.   For Shanghai Giant Network Technology, acquiring Playtika will also extend its reach beyond China. Other Chinese tech companies have used deals to reach players around the world. Among them is Tencent, which has gained control over internationally well-known games like League of Legends.   Last year, one of Caesars Interactive's parent companies, Caesars Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy protection. It has been working to get creditor backing for a plan to restructure.     "
Bitcoin Dives After Exchange Is Hacked,"Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang . HONG KONG -- The digital currency Bitcoin plunged on Wednesday after Bitfinex, an exchange based in Hong Kong, said it had been hacked and funds stolen. The exchange said it had halted trading, deposits and withdrawals while it investigated which users had been affected. Bitcoin's trading value fell about 20 percent early on Wednesday, local time in Hong Kong, but had recovered about half the loss by early afternoon.     Zane Tackett, Bitfinex's director of community and product development, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But he said in a posting on Reddit that 119,756 Bitcoins had been  stolen.   Before the hacking was made public, that number of Bitcoins would have been worth about $72 million. Now that the currency has slumped, the figure is closer to $65 million. The exchange, one of the world's largest, said in a blog post that any outstanding settlements would be made at the price before the hacking. ''As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach,'' Bitfinex said in the post. It added that customers' losses would be addressed later.   Security breaches of this type have raised questions about the viability of Bitcoin. The most notable episode was the collapse in 2014 of Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, in which hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins were stolen in a heist that experts and law enforcement officials are still trying to unravel. This past June, a hacker stole more than $50 million worth of Ether, another digital currency, from an experimental virtual currency project called the Decentralized Autonomous Organization.   Jack Liu, chief strategy officer at OKCoin, a large digital currency exchange, said he was not concerned about the security of his company because it uses a different system. But he noted that there should be more discussion between exchanges over best practices.   ''We care about the health of the ecosystem,'' he said, although he emphasized that nobody should be dictating how Bitcoins are secured. ''Hackers are only getting better and so adoption of the same solution may not be the safest for the industry.''   Although some view Bitcoin as the future of finance, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions, the Bitcoin community has been rived with infighting over the development of the technology. The blockchain ledger, part of the coding that underlies the currency, has also gained more mainstream traction, as banks see an opportunity to use the technology to speed up trades.   Bitfinex said the theft had been reported to law enforcement.     "
Digital Backbone for Virtual Currencies Gains an Influential Backer,"A new report from the World Economic Forum predicts that the underlying technology introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin will come to occupy a central place in the global financial system. A report released Friday morning by the forum, a convening organization for the global elite, is one of the strongest endorsements yet for a new technology -- the blockchain -- that has become the talk of the financial industry, despite the shadowy origins of Bitcoin.    ''Rather than to stay at the margins of the finance industry blockchain will become the beating heart of it,'' the head of financial services industries at the World Economic Forum, Giancarlo Bruno, said in a statement released with the report.    The blockchain originally referred to the database where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded and stored.   Unlike existing financial ledgers or databases used by banks and other institutions, the blockchain is updated and maintained not by a single company or government. Instead it is run by a network of users. It's akin to the way Wikipedia is maintained by users around the globe.   Initially, bank executives shied away from endorsing Bitcoin because it had been used for drugs and crime. Now, however, many have focused on ways to create blockchains without using Bitcoins for transactions in any way.   This is attractive because blockchains -- or ''distributed ledgers,'' as they are often described -- could offer a new way to move money and track transactions across borders and other networks in a more secure, transparent and effective way than the current system.   Distributed ledgers are often viewed as most attractive to industries with businesses that lack a central institution they can trust to keep their records.   The World Economic Forum report notes that most developments are likely to happen behind the scenes. So consumers won't see the changes to infrastructure, but the changes could lead to cheaper and faster financial services. The report says the technology could help improve both mainstream transactions, like global payments and stock trading, and lesser-known areas like trade finance and contingent convertible bonds.   The 130-page report from the forum is the product of a year of research and five gatherings of executives from several major institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Visa, MasterCard and BlackRock.   The report estimates that 80 percent of banks around the world could start distributed ledger projects by next year. Large central banks are also studying how the blockchain will alter the way money moves around the globe.   Most banks have already put together blockchain working groups and released research reports hailing the potentially transformative effect of the technology.   But few real-world uses of the blockchain have come to fruition, other than Bitcoin itself. That has led to some questions about whether the blockchain is the proverbial solution looking for a problem, rather than an innovation that will be used widely.   Existing virtual currencies have continued to struggle with security problems. One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Bitfinex, recently lost more than $60 million worth of Bitcoin in a hacking -- the latest of several such incidents.   The World Economic Forum report suggests that it will take some time for such problems to be worked out. In addition to the technology issues, the report says that the industry will have to work with governments to create standard rules and laws to govern transactions.   The report does not make a single mention of Bitcoin. That mirrors the pronouncements from banks, which have often said that they can harness distributed ledgers without using existing virtual currencies. Rather, these ledgers would be run by groups of institutions that want to keep common records.   Just this week, 15 global banks, including Wells Fargo and UBS, said that they had completed a prototype of a distributed ledger that could track trade financing around the globe -- providing a single record for a series of scattered, hard-to-track transactions.

Fintech Comes of Age as Government Seeks Oversight Role,"The Beatles sang ''I'm the taxman, and you're working for no one but me.'' The Internal Revenue Service is delivering that message to users of Bitcoin as it demands information from Coinbase, the largest virtual currency exchange that maintains ''wallets'' for holding digital value. The government wants to know about the identities of those who may be trying to hide income. As the world of financial technology has gone from a geeky backwater to the forefront of innovation, regulators are following along by seeking a role in overseeing how the firms operate and determining who may be abusing their services. You know that fintech has come of age when the government comes knocking at the door just like it does with any other bank or broker.    Transactions in virtual currencies like Bitcoin are recorded on a public ledger, but the identity of those actually buying or selling is not available. Coinbase wallets give users a measure of anonymity that they would not have if dealing with large amounts of cash at a bank, something that has garnered the attention of the I.R.S. The inspector general for tax administration in the Treasury Department issued a report in September criticizing the agency for not developing a program to ensure that Bitcoin users were complying with the tax laws.    On Nov. 30, a federal magistrate judge in San Francisco approved a ''John Doe summons'' to Coinbase that requires it to identify Americans who maintained wallets transacting in virtual currencies at any time from 2013 through 2015. The company's website says it has 4.9 million customers, so the government will be able to obtain information about a substantial number of people who have traded Bitcoin over the three years identified.   The I.R.S. uses this type of summons when it does not know the identity of the taxpayers who may have violated the law. This method means it is a civil investigation at this point, but if there are indications of large-scale tax evasion, the Justice Department could start a criminal inquiry into Bitcoin traders.   Because this type of financial information is so personal, federal law requires the I.R.S. to show a reasonable basis that an ''ascertainable group'' may have failed to comply with the tax laws and that the information is not readily available from other sources. Unlike an investigation of a particular individual who can challenge a summons, the I.R.S. goes into court unopposed and the judge considers only the application and any information provided to support the request, known as an ex parte proceeding.   In 2014, the I.R.S. issued a notice that virtual currencies were property, which means that every transaction may result in a capital gain or loss, depending on the value at the time of each trade. That would be like having to figure out how much a dollar was really worth on the currency market when it went into your pocket and then was used -- a reporting nightmare for those who engage in a number of transactions. It is understandable that Bitcoin users would simply ignore the need to report gains and losses.   The summons to Coinbase looks to be an effort to respond to the lack of action on the virtual currency front by focusing on more nefarious uses of virtual currencies. The government submitted an affidavit from an I.R.S. agent describing information received in its investigation that indicated Bitcoin users have not properly reported transactions.   The government identified three instances of possible tax evasion to justify the broad demand for information from Coinbase, essentially pointing to these cases as the tip of an iceberg of violations. One individual started using virtual currencies after offshore banks became too cumbersome to hide assets, the government said. Two companies tried to evade paying taxes by designating transactions in Bitcoin as ''technology expenses'' to make them appear to be just ordinary costs of doing business.   Needless to say, Coinbase is unhappy about having to turn over information about its customers. A statement issued in response to the filing for the John Doe summons says ''we are extremely concerned with the indiscriminate breadth of the government's request. Our customers' privacy rights are important to us,'' vowing to ''oppose the government's petition in court.''   The information sought is not outside the norm for this type of sweeping investigation. In 2014, a federal district judge in Manhattan issued a summons for records from FedEx, DHL and United Parcel Service for information about deliveries from 2005 to 2013 from an offshore firm that helped Americans avoid paying taxes. In 2015, a Miami federal district judge issued a summons to Bank of America and Citibank for almost nine years of records from correspondent accounts they maintained on behalf of a bank in Belize that was used to shield assets.   Unfortunately, there is little Coinbase can do to resist this type of demand for information once it is approved by the court. It could refuse to provide the information and then appeal an order requiring it to comply with the summons, but the anonymity cherished by many Bitcoin users is unlikely to get much traction when there is evidence of potential tax evasion. Failing to provide the information could also result in Coinbase being found in contempt of court, which can result in substantial fines until it chooses to comply.   The I.R.S. inquiry shows how Coinbase is now important enough to draw the same kind of scrutiny as more established banks. That shift also is apparent in a new initiative by the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the federal banking regulators, that would allow fintech companies to apply for a new charter to become a ''special purpose national bank.''   As The New York Times reported, the idea is to extend oversight to companies moving into services provided by traditional banks that have largely avoided direct regulation. The new type of charter could help fintech firms avoid dealing with a patchwork of laws that make expanding their businesses more difficult while extending federal regulatory oversight.   One of the crucial requirements for any bank or broker is compliance with the strict rules against money laundering, especially the ''know your customer'' requirement that largely prevents secret accounts and untraceable transactions. An interesting question is whether companies like Coinbase that provide a repository for virtual currencies will migrate toward becoming more like banks or stock brokerages that would remove the anonymity they now provide to users of their services.   The key to the tax system is identifying taxpayers who may be trying to skirt reporting requirements. Virtual currency and the fintech industry as a whole have grown outside the traditional regulatory system, but their size and emerging importance mean that more oversight is on the doorstep.   When your client base is large enough for the taxman to go on a fishing expedition to see who is using your services, you have truly come of age. Whether that attention is welcome is another issue.     "
"U.S. and Britain Spied on Israeli Drone Flights, Documents Show","JERUSALEM -- The United States and Britain have monitored secret drone flights and communications by the Israeli Air Force in a hacking operation dating to 1998, according to documents attributed to leaks by the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden.  Israel voiced disappointment but no great surprise at the disclosures, published on Friday by The Intercept, an online publication associated with Glenn Greenwald, who has collaborated with Mr. Snowden, and by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel.    The disclosures raised the possibility of further strained ties between Israel and the United States, but the two close allies have traditionally had an understanding that they spy on each other despite pledging not to.   Israel has said it stopped spying on the United States after it employed the United State Navy analyst Jonathan J. Pollard as an agent in the 1980s. Mr. Pollard was released from a North Carolina prison in November after serving 30 years.   Yuval Steinitz, the minister of national infrastructure and energy, and a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, sought to play down the issue but also said lessons would be learned.   ''I do not think that this is the deepest kingdom of secrets, but it is certainly something that should not happen, which is unpleasant,'' he told Army Radio. ''We will now have to look and consider changing the encryption, certainly.''   Mr. Steinitz said Israel was not surprised by the hacking. ''We know that the Americans spy on the whole world, and also on us, also on their friends,'' he said. ''But still, it is disappointing, inter alia because, going back decades already, we have not spied nor collected intelligence nor hacked encryptions in the United States.''   The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth said that the National Security Agency in the United States and its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters, which monitor electronic and other communications, had decrypted Israeli communications on air force missions over Gaza, Iran and Syria.   The spy operation, under the code-name Anarchist, was run out of a base in Cyprus and also targeted other countries in the region, including Egypt, Iran, Syria and Turkey, according to The Intercept.   Israel neither confirms nor denies using armed drones, though a senior Israeli military officer was quoted as acknowledging their use in a secret United States diplomatic cable from 2010 that was published by WikiLeaks.   The United States Embassy in Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.   A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Tel Aviv said it did not comment on intelligence matters, and there was no immediate response from the Foreign Office in London, Reuters reported.     "
"Privacy vs. Security, Battle Lines Drawn","The tech industry's battle with the United States government over encryption has reached a fever pitch. Ever since the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed in 2013 that the agency was hacking some tech companies and cozying up to others to gain user data, Silicon Valley behemoths have had an uneasy relationship with the United States government. Apple, which encrypts its iPhones, has been one of the most outspoken on the issues of encryption and privacy, saying it cannot give authorities access to people's private data and information.     That outspokenness reached a new height on Tuesday after a federal court order was issued requiring Apple to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, published a strongly worded letter opposing the order and argued that unlocking one iPhone could lead to a slippery slope.   ''We fear that this demand would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect,'' Mr. Cook wrote.   Mr. Cook's move immediately sparked a debate about which side was in the right, write Eric Lichtblau and Katie Benner. Other tech companies responded with caution. It was also a culmination of the turning of the tables by the tech industry against the United States government, which had been triggered by the Snowden revelations, writes Farhad Manjoo.

U.S. Asks Tech and Entertainment Industries to Aid Antiterror Efforts,"Obama administration officials met with executives of major technology and entertainment companies in Washington on Wednesday to discuss combating the activities of violent extremists online, according to industry and government officials. The meeting was called by the White House, according to a person who attended and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The session began with government officials admitting their shortcomings in tackling the explosion of activity by terrorist groups online.    John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, started the meeting by saying that federal law enforcement had struggled to reach audiences that were responding to recruitment by violent extremists, according to the participant. Nick Rasmussen, director of the national counterterrorism center, lauded some social media platforms for aggressively taking down accounts of suspected terrorists.    The hourslong meeting, which took place at the Justice Department, also included speeches by Megan Smith, the national chief technology officer; and Jen Easterly, the senior director for counterterrorism.   The event was another step toward coordinating government and private sector efforts on national security. After the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., last year, the White House and presidential candidates have pushed for Internet firms to clamp down on the use of social media by extremists to recruit new members, organize and broadcast their demands.   Last month, the White House and tech chief executives held a security meeting in San Jose, Calif., to discuss the use of social media by terrorist groups and encryption practices by tech firms to keep consumer data private. Secretary of State John Kerry also met with Hollywood studio executives earlier this month, and entertainment firms have been asked by government officials to help create ''counternarratives'' to those of terrorists on social media networks.   Wednesday's gathering was attended by company executives but few, if any, chief executives. Participants included representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr and Microsoft.   The meeting brought together tech companies in Washington at a time of heightened tension between the administration and Silicon Valley. Apple and the United States government have engaged in a public fight over access to the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. Some of the tech firms have expressed cautious support of Apple.   Many of the tech companies are willing to work on ways to combat violent extremism on social media. The meeting on Wednesday, called the ''Madison Valleywood Project,'' in reference to the participation of marketing, tech and entertainment firms, focused on terrorists' use of social media to organize and recruit members for violent extremism.   The subject of encryption and Apple's resistance to being ordered to break through its encrypted software for law enforcement was not on the agenda.   Some social media companies have stepped carefully with counterterrorism efforts, saying it is technologically difficult to weed out true terrorist activity. They have also expressed fears of stifling the free speech of users. Others, including Twitter, have started to more aggressively shut down the accounts of suspected terrorists. Twitter had a representative at the meeting.   ''Over the past year, organizations and companies across a range of industries have asked how they might contribute to efforts to counter radicalization and recruitment activities by ISIL and other violent extremists,'' said Marc Raimondi, the Justice Department's national security spokesman, using a term for the Islamic State.   ''The U.S. government recognizes that these private sector actors, which include N.G.O.s, social media companies and content producers, have a crucial role to play in developing creative and effective ways to undermine terrorist recruiting and counter the call to violence,'' Mr. Raimondi said.     "
Addressing the Legal Status of Code,"Computer code is incomprehensible to anyone without programming skills, but Apple argued in a court filing on Thursday that code is a form of speech. So, the company contends, the government's order to crack a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers would violate Apple's First Amendment rights. Apple, its lawyers contend, ''wrote code for its operating system that reflects Apple's strong view about consumer security and privacy.'' Changing its code, they add, would ''undermine those values'' -- a position that raises several legal questions.     Q. What is the legal argument?   A. ''The basic concept is that computer code is a way of expressing an idea,'' said A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami.   Apple elaborates on that essential notion by saying that its code is expressing its corporate viewpoint on consumer security and privacy. If it loses this case, Apple suggests, the company would be forced to have its code change its digital tune -- and corporate message.   ''Apple goes pretty far by saying its software has a viewpoint,'' said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law. ''That's pretty novel here. But this case is unprecedented, so we shouldn't be surprised by novel defenses.''   Q. How unusual is Apple's argument?   A. There are a number of cases in which the issue has come up. Most often, the technology has involved computer security and encryption software, similar to the current case.   In the 1990s, the National Security Agency wanted American computer makers to build a hardware ''back door,'' known as a Clipper Chip, that could be unlocked by the government. First Amendment and other protests were made, and the government eventually backed down. The Clipper Chip episode was not litigated.   A case that was taken to court involved Daniel J. Bernstein, who was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, when he wrote an encryption program called ''Snuffle.'' At the time, the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations were expansively interpreted, and the government took the stance that even academics, like Mr. Bernstein, presenting or publishing research abroad were criminals. Mr. Bernstein filed suit.   But a Federal District Court in Northern California ruled in Mr. Bernstein's favor in 1996, agreeing that his code was speech and protected by the First Amendment. The export controls as applied to encryption software were eased later.   In its filing, Apple cited the Bernstein case, among others, and declared it was ''well-settled law'' that computer code is protected speech.   Q. But is Apple's argument surprising?   A. No, legal experts say. Apple has signed up Theodore B. Olson as a key member of its legal team. A renowned litigator, Mr. Olson successfully argued before the Supreme Court that money is a form of free speech in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.   Good lawyers make every plausible argument they can, and this one is certainly plausible.   Q. How might the government reply?   A. Mr. Froomkin of the University of Miami said the government would probably make two points. First, he said, the Supreme Court has never ruled that code is speech. Second, Mr. Froomkin said that the government might contend that Apple was going too far in its claim. ''The government will tell Apple, 'You're not being denied the ability to speak,' '' he said.     "
Obama Calls for Law Enforcement Access in Encryption Fight,"AUSTIN, Tex. --  President Obama said Friday that law enforcement must be legally able to collect information from smartphones and other electronic devices, making clear, despite disagreement within his administration, that he opposes the stance on encryption taken by technology companies like Apple. Speaking to an audience of about 2,100 technology executives and enthusiasts at the South by Southwest festival here, Mr. Obama delivered his most extensive comments on an issue that has split the technology community and pitted law enforcement against other national security agencies. Mr. Obama declined to comment specifically on the efforts by the F.B.I. to require Apple's help in gaining data from an iPhone used by one of the terrorists in the December attack in San Bernardino, Calif.     But the president warned that America had already accepted that law enforcement can ''rifle through your underwear'' in searches for those suspected of preying on children, and he said there was no reason that a person's digital information should be treated differently.   ''If, technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system, where the encryption is so strong that there is no key, there is no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child pornographer?'' Mr. Obama said. ''How do we disrupt a terrorist plot?''   If the government has no way into a smartphone, he added, ''then everyone is walking around with a Swiss bank account in your pocket.''   Mr. Obama's decision to embrace the law enforcement position on encryption represents a fundamental break with a tech community that has strongly supported his political career. For years, the president nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley, tapping the youthful talent there to help him reshape the federal government's aging technology infrastructure and seeking out leading executives for private advice and millions in campaign cash.    That partnership was in part a result of a philosophical affinity between Mr. Obama and technology executives that included broad agreement about gay rights, immigration, civil liberties and health care. Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he remains a fierce defender of civil liberties, including the right to privacy.   Within the administration, there is a division over encryption between the F.B.I., along with other law enforcement agencies, which says it must have a way of breaking into encrypted devices, and the intelligence community, which worries that the same techniques could be used against the American government. In his comments, which were greeted with polite silence, Mr. Obama said he, too, supported the development of strong encryption to make sure that the government can protect banks and critical infrastructure. And he said he wanted proper oversight of law enforcement. But, he said, technology executives who are ''absolutist'' on the issue are just wrong.   ''This notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other trade-offs we make, I believe, is incorrect,'' he said.   Mr. Obama spoke broadly at the music, film and technology festival about the need for technology to be used to support civic life and the functioning of democracy.   He became the first sitting president to visit the festival, which in the past three decades has become a mecca for the high-tech, social-media set. He made his comments during an hourlong conversation with Evan Smith, the editor in chief of The Texas Tribune.   At the festival, the president sought to make the case that the technologies behind today's entertainment and communication apps should also be directed at solving the problems of voter turnout, access to information and civic engagement. ''We want to create a pipeline where there is a continuous flow of talent that is helping to shape the government,'' he told the audience.    Mr. Obama is something of a technology geek, so his presence at the festival does not come as much of a surprise. He enjoys dinners with technology moguls and has tapped the wealth of Silicon Valley for his two presidential campaigns.   He has talked to his closest advisers about creating a high-tech presidential center when he leaves office, in part to help visitors engage with his legacy and in part to encourage better use of technology in society.   He has also sought to lure more tech executives and engineers to government to make federal agencies more responsive to their customers. Mr. Obama created the United States Digital Service as a kind of troubleshooting team to upgrade the technology associated with government services, and he has filled its staff largely with veterans of Google, Microsoft and other such companies.   ''The work they're doing is impactful -- and it's hard to see how they don't become a permanent feature of our government,'' Jason Goldman, the chief digital officer for the White House, said in an article posted on the Medium website on Thursday.  ''Indeed, this might be President Obama's most important accomplishment as the First Tech President: establishing a lasting legacy of service that will carry on long after he leaves office.''   Still, questions about how to harness the power of Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat to help government are not always clear, especially when the companies involved are, above all, designed to make money for their shareholders.   This spring, the White House will host what it is calling a summit meeting on civic engagement, and aides said the president would use it to continue the conversation about the role that technology could play.

"The Clash of Privacy, Legislation and Software","Digital encryption, with its mind-numbing mathematics, is hard to do. It's almost as tough as the arguments on what to do with it. As Cecilia Kang writes, the United States government is facing off with the American technology industry over a bill that would require tech companies to comply with court orders seeking access to people's encrypted data. The two sides are engaged in heavy and vigorous behind-the-scenes lobbying.     On first pass, the government has a good point: In moments of grave danger, or to establish a chain of evidence, there are good reasons to think authorized warrants should not be limited by actions taken by companies.   But the companies have their own points: If they build software that can be cracked or opened, they are building flawed products that hackers know they can exploit.   Moreover, these are multinational companies that might have to grant the same secrets-reading powers to totalitarian states where they also do business. Whether the companies are giving up people's privacy to foreign or American police, many of their top engineers might leave instead of abetting.   Turning to the general public for guidance will not make this easier. Some people are for absolute personal privacy, no matter whether you are a piano teacher or an ISIS recruiter. Others think the government should be able to see your every move -- after all, if you aren't doing anything wrong, what have you got to hide?   The great middle, however, doesn't like ISIS, or living in a world where a police officer reads our love letters (or notes on organizing an antigovernment protest).   What seems to bother the government as much as the problems of cheap, plentiful and effective electronic secrecy is the new militancy companies are bringing to the issue.   It's not just that Apple and Google are lobbying against this bill. In April, Microsoft sued the Justice Department, challenging secrecy orders that keep Microsoft from telling people the lawmen have a warrant to see their email.   Meantime, software development is moving faster than lawmaking. Last month, Viber, a free communications app owned by Japan's Rakuten, said it had put full encryption on every message. The app, which is popular internationally, was previously considered to have weak security. WhatsApp, owned by Facebook and used by one billion people globally, did the same, and published a white paper on just how good it is.   That's another casualty of modern tech: It's hard to control information when it's hard to see national borders.     "
"For Online Privacy, Signal Stands Out","BY the time you finish reading this column, you would be foolish not to download the messaging app Signal onto your smartphone and computer. The free encrypted messaging service has won the acclaim of security researchers and privacy advocates, including Edward J. Snowden. All have said that Signal goes above and beyond other chat tools in keeping electronic communications private.    And now more than ever, we may need it. That's because hacks are on the rise -- look at how the activist group WikiLeaks posted a trove of emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, for all to see. Many are also watching for how government surveillance may grow under Donald J. Trump, who has chosen Mike Pompeo, who advocates greater surveillance, to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.   Signal is one of many encrypted messaging services, but it stands out for its uncompromising security and ease of use. The chat service retains virtually no information from users, including messages and address books, on its servers. What's more, messages remain encrypted when passing through Signal's servers, meaning that the app's creators can't read them.    ''The default recommendation you'll get from most security researchers for a messaging app is Signal,'' said Joseph Bonneau, a postdoctoral researcher at the Applied Crypto Group at Stanford University. ''It's still the best in the field.''   That said, Signal is not perfect. It lacks some features of other messaging apps, like the ability to send stickers. And during my tests, the service had some glitches. But adding Signal to your folder of messaging apps is a must in an era when technology companies are collecting more personal information and government surveillance may expand.   Some people have already cottoned on to this. Signal experienced a 400 percent jump in daily downloads since Mr. Trump won the election, according to Moxie Marlinspike, who founded Open Whisper Systems, the nonprofit that developed Signal. To Mr. Marlinspike, the surge in downloads reflects anxiety among Americans about the implications of Mr. Trump's presidency for personal privacy.   ''Trump has threatened a lot of people and he's about to be in control of the most pervasive and least accountable surveillance infrastructure in the world,'' Mr. Marlinspike said. ''A lot of people are justifiably concerned about that.''   How Signal Stands Out   Signal offers end-to-end encryption, meaning a message is scrambled so that it becomes indecipherable to anyone but its intended recipient when it is sent from your device, and it remains so when it passes through the app's server and reaches the recipient.   When you initiate a conversation with someone on Signal, you and the recipient exchange so-called cryptographic keys. Only the person who receives your message holds the key to decrypt and read it. That means that if a government agency had a wiretapping order for your Signal messages, Open Whisper Systems would not have the key to decipher the messages and would be unable to comply.   Signal's technology sets the standard for other messaging services, with its protocol being an open-source system that other companies can freely use. WhatsApp, Facebook's Messenger and Google embedded Signal's encrypted messaging system into their own apps this year.   Even so, security researchers said they preferred Signal over other messaging apps because it was more thorough in protecting users' privacy. The only information Signal stores about users in its database is the last time someone connected to its server and when a person signed up for Signal. Other messaging apps maintain pieces of personal data on their servers.   By contrast, while WhatsApp enables Signal's full encryption by default in messages, there are caveats. WhatsApp may retain some so-called meta data on conversations, including the phone numbers used in an exchange and the times that the messages were sent, according to the company's privacy policy. WhatsApp also regularly accesses your phone number and contacts list, so the app can provide an up-to-date list of your contacts who use its service to make it easier to message them.   Google Allo, Google's new messaging app that leverages artificial intelligence, does not enable Signal's end-to-end encryption in all its messages by default. Google offers full encrypted messaging only in so-called Incognito sessions, a private mode that must be turned on manually. When you're not chatting in Incognito mode, Google stores your Allo messages on its server.   Similarly, Facebook's Messenger enables end-to-end encryption inside a private chat mode called Secret Conversations. But by default, normal Messenger chats lack that encryption.   Even though Signal doesn't record your information, the app still works across devices, like a desktop computer and a mobile device. Messages and contacts' data are stored directly on users' devices and synchronized between them.   Let's say you already use Signal on your iPhone and want to use it to chat on a Mac (Signal is available as a web app for Google's Chrome browser for desktop computers). To link the desktop app with your iPhone, you would use the iPhone's camera to scan a bar code on the Mac web app, which links the two devices together. Then, to get your contacts list and conversations to appear on the Mac, the Mac app pulls your contacts list and messages directly from the iPhone via an encrypted channel, according to Mr. Marlinspike.   ''It's a bit more work, from our perspective,'' Mr. Marlinspike said. ''It's more complicated than storing all this stuff on a server.''   Bugs and Missing Features   Signal occasionally runs into glitches, such as when it comes to synchronizing data between computers and smartphones. In my tests, there were several occasions when Signal messages that were sent or received on my smartphone did not immediately show up inside the desktop app -- though the messages eventually synchronized minutes later.   Mr. Marlinspike, who is also the former head of security at Twitter, says he encourages people to report bugs so the group can continue to improve the service.   Another downside is that your Signal account can work on only one mobile device at a time; I could not, for instance, use Signal on both my iPhone and iPad. Mr. Marlinspike said it would support multiple mobile devices eventually.   One last caveat is that Signal isn't as fun to use as apps like Facebook Messenger, which lets you send stickers and animated GIFs to add color and personality to conversations. Open Whisper Systems said it planned to add these features, noting that GIFs are already supported in the Android version of Signal.   Still, this is a trivial issue. I'd choose stronger privacy over sending stickers and animations any day.   The Bottom Line   There is no logical reason to skip using Signal. The app is free for Android and iOS, and for computers it is a free add-on for the Google Chrome browser. Plus, it's easy to install and so architecturally secure that you can have the confidence to say whatever you want without fear of being spied on.   Another benefit is that Open Whisper Systems is a nonprofit that relies on donations and grants, not a business that might eventually have an incentive to share your information with third parties like advertisers.   That's not to say Signal should be your only messaging app. You could use it exclusively for sensitive matters, like work-related conversations. Then for casual chats like making plans with friends and loved ones, you could switch to more ''fun'' apps like Facebook Messenger and send all the stickers you want.   Probably the biggest thing missing from Signal will be many of your friends. The app isn't as popular among consumers as other mainstream messaging apps, so hanging out on Signal can feel lonely. So if you care about your privacy, other than installing Signal today, you should nag everyone you know to join the service, too.     "
