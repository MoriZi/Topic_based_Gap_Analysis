Toymaker VTech Settles Charges of Violating Child Privacy Law,"The popular electronic toymaker VTech Electronics agreed to pay $650,000 to settle charges that it had collected digital data on children without parents' permission and failed to keep that information secure from hackers, the Federal Trade Commission said Monday. It was the first enforcement action against a company that makes internet-connected toys by the F.T.C., which has received several complaints about privacy violations and online advertising aimed at children. Some child advocates have complained that the agency has been slow to respond to the complaints, which cover a variety of products including toys and apps for smartphones and tablets.  The F.T.C. said that the action against VTech, a Hong Kong-based maker of online apps and toys, showed the agency's dedication to child safety and privacy issues -- particularly given the fast growth of the connected toy market. ""As connected toys become increasingly popular, it's more important than ever that companies let parents know how their kids' data is collected and used and that they take reasonable steps to secure that data,"" said Maureen K. Ohlhausen, the commission's acting chairwoman. ""Unfortunately, VTech fell short in both of these areas."" The agency said in its complaint that VTech had collected data about more than 638,000 children -- including text messages, photos, and audio messages -- without notifying users or asking parents for permission to collect that information. The company was accused of violating the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires parents to give permission for a company to collect internet data on children under the age of 13. The F.T.C. also accused the company of having inadequately secured its network in 2015, when VTech's servers were hacked. Personal information of children -- including email addresses, names and gender -- were stolen during the breach. The company did not, for example, encrypt information transmitted through some of its online services, the F.T.C. said in its complaint. The company, which sells numerous electronic devices geared toward children, said it has updated its privacy policies to comply with privacy and security laws. ""Following the cyber attack incident, we updated our data security policy and adopted rigorous measures to strengthen the protection of our customers' data,"" said Allan Wong, the chairman of VTech Holdings Limited. Mr. Wong said the company had also taken steps to address issues associated with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Numerous technology companies, including Facebook and Google, have been pushing to reach younger audiences with their products. Facebook recently announced a messenger service for children as young as 6 and Google introduced YouTube Kids in 2015. The services have set off debate about what digital tools are appropriate for children and what companies were doing to prevent abuse. Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that the F.T.C. has moved slowly in investigating VTech, a company whose conduct was brought to the agency's attention in 2015. ""This is good news that the F.T.C. finally took action but we feel like they are moving too slow and clearly following and not leading,"" Mr. Rotenberg said.

Why It's So Hard to Punish Companies for Data Breaches,"What happens to the companies that allow our personal data to be stolen? In most cases, nothing. Sometimes there is a short-lived flurry of bad publicity, a brief dip in stock prices, a class-action lawsuit or a Federal Trade Commission investigation that leads to a token settlement or fine. Facebook is unlikely to face any serious, long-term consequences as a result of a security breach it announced last month, which exposed the account data of 50 million users.  At first glance, the lack of consequences that companies face for data breaches might seem to be a clear problem and something that can be easily remedied through heavy regulation like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. However, the problem turns out to be more complicated than that. Two challenges, in particular, have hindered effective legal and regulatory responses to breaches: determining whether a company was negligent in its security practices, and figuring out how to calculate the monetary value of stolen personal information and the harms inflicted on the people whose data was breached.  The fact that your personal information was stolen from a company does not necessarily mean that the company did a poor job of securing your data and therefore deserves to be punished. The Facebook breach, for example, was made possible by three software vulnerabilities tied to user tools for privacy and for uploading birthday videos. These vulnerabilities might seem like problems that Facebook should have caught early on, but the truth is that every company has bugs like these in its software.  The crucial question for determining Facebook's culpability for this breach is whether it should have been able to catch and fix those particular vulnerabilities sooner. Did the company test the code rigorously before releasing it? Did it ignore any warning signs or outside notifications about the bugs? Did it take swift action when it first realized something was wrong?  Perhaps Facebook did absolutely everything right and was just unlucky. If that's the case, then it would be unfair and unproductive to penalize the company severely. On the other hand, if Facebook ignored several warning signs and failed to properly vet its new tools before releasing them, then it is entirely appropriate for the company to face a significant fine as an incentive to be more attentive to security in the future. The difficulty lies in trying to determine where the line is between companies that do their due diligence and those that are negligent. In one of the few cases that directly tackled this issue, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in 2015 that the Wyndham Worldwide hotel chain had failed to provide its customers with reasonable security protections because it failed to use firewalls or encryption and did not require users to change default passwords. But for a company like Facebook, which certainly clears that very low bar, it is still not clear what level of security is high enough for it to fulfill its responsibility to its customers. Beyond the challenge of deciding whether a company like Facebook was negligent, it is often difficult for judges and regulators to put a dollar value on how much harm a data breach has caused to the people affected. It's easier to assess the damages if the stolen data can be directly tied to financial losses, but often stolen data leads to more personal humiliations, as in the case of the 2015 breach of the Ashley Madisonwebsite that revealed the identities of people seeking extramarital affairs, or Sony Pictures employees whose embarrassing emails were leaked in the aftermath of the company's 2014 breach. We do not know how to put a price on these types of losses of privacy, and that makes it harder to use legal or regulatory remedies to punish the companies that are responsible. That, in turn, reduces the financial incentives for all companies to invest in securing user data. The class action lawsuit brought against Ashley Madison, for instance, culminated last year in a settlement totaling $11.2 million. And the F.T.C., which had initially sought a penalty of $17.5 million for that breach, agreed to a $1.6 million settlement. Meanwhile, the company reported strong growth in its user numbers following the breach. After its 2017 breach of 146 million people's data, the Equifax credit reporting bureau is also doing just fine. Just one year later, it is on track to post record profits. Yes, Britain fined Equifax 500,000 pounds last month (hardly a staggering sum for a company that brings in upward of $3 billion in annual revenue), but the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided this year to back off from its investigation of the breach. It's unlikely that the United States government will take the lead in investigating what happened at Facebook and whether the breach warrants any consequences. It's possible that the European Union will use the increased penalties in its new General Data Protection Regulations to fine Facebook up to $1.63 billion, but the actual fines will almost certainly be much less than that since regulators will be wary of chasing the company away. Not only would European Facebook users be upset if they could no longer use the site, but Facebook employs thousands of people in Ireland, the country whose Data Protection Commission is currently investigating the breach. A fine of more than $1.5 billion would hurt Ireland as much as it hurt Facebook if it drove the company out of the country. What should happen to these companies? Ideally, they would face a combination of consequences that included both fines and corrective security measures. The fines would need to be hefty enough to motivate greater investment in data security and cover their customers' losses -- recognizing not just lost money but also lost time, lost privacy and lost peace of mind -- but not so hefty that the fines could never be enforced or would drive the company out of the country.  The corrective measures would be designed to ensure that breached companies ramp up their security and privacy practices. This could mean requiring outside audits of their security programs or mandating that they adhere to recommended security standards published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (an agency of the Department of Commerce) or the International Organization for Standardization. It could also involve asking them to provide security resources and assistance to the third parties whose security has also been undermined by the breach, as in the Facebook case, where apps like Spotify and Yelp that allowed users to authenticate using their Facebook credentials were also affected by the breach. We are caught between two extremes: a weak regulatory system in the United States that refuses to so much as investigate the Equifax breach and a fine-based scheme in Europe that is so harsh that regulators will never be able to impose the maximum allowable penalties. Neither of these systems comes close to striking the right balance of financial penalties mixed with corrective security measures. And until they do, companies will continue to escape serious consequences for their breaches. PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) "
Learning to Attack the Cyberattackers Can't Happen Fast Enough,"PITTSBURGH -- In a technology lab full of graduate students huddled over laptops, Prof. Marios Savvides flipped through photos on a computer screen searching for one full of people whose faces were barely recognizable to the human eye. ""How about a riot?"" Professor Savvides asked. He had just come upon an image of police officers wearing helmets and gas masks and rioters covering their mouths and noses with bandannas -- all trying to shield themselves from the tear-gas- and smoke-filled air. Professor Savvides was delighted. It was a perfect example of where, with the facial recognition skills of artificial intelligence, ""we can now recognize a face from very few pixels,"" he said. The episode was unfolding at the Biometrics Center, part of theCyLab Security and Privacy Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.  The center was created by Professor Savvides, who is a widely recognized expert in biometrics -- the science of measuring and identifying people using facial and iris recognition systems. On any given day, the high-tech space is crowded with computers, robots, and other machines and populated with doctoral students working with him. CyLab, which includes the center, was founded in 2003 to expand the boundaries of technology and protect people when that technology -- or the people using it -- poses a threat. Based in the university's 25,000-square-foot Collaborative Innovation Center, CyLab works in partnership with roughly 20 corporations -- like Boeing, Microsoft and Facebook -- and government agencies to do research and education in internet privacy and security. The subject has become one of the hottest areas of research and training in the United States these days as increasingly sophisticated hackers threaten not only personal computer security but also the operation of everything from banking systems to water purification plants to nuclear arsenals. While the threats mount, the number of people qualified to confront them is far too low, experts say, and educational institutions and government agencies are scrambling to fill the gap. More than 300 researchers and graduate students are working or studying at CyLab this year, making it among the largest cybersecurity training centers in the world. It offers more than 50 courses in security and privacy and has trained more than 75,000 people. Biometrics, the science of using hard-to-mask physical attributes -- like facial characteristics, fingerprints, retinal scans and DNA -- is just one specialty. CyLab is also engaged in broader uses for A.I., cryptography, network security and an array of other cybersecurity skills. One of the first times Professor Savvides and his group used his facial-recognition technology for something besides research was just after the 2015 Boston Marathon bombing. His lab took the blurry, low-resolution, surveillance image of the suspected bomber released by the F.B.I. and, using A.I. technology, reconstructed the image and sent it to the bureau. The next morning, the identity of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of the bombing, was revealed. Professor Savvides doesn't know whether his reconstruction helped the F.B.I., but ""we were extremely surprised to see the resemblance to Tsarnaev that was constructed from the very low resolution, pixelated face that even our human brain cannot comprehend,"" he said. Professor Savvides was also happy to demonstrate another gee-whiz technology -- long-distance iris scanning. Rather than requiring that an eye be placed directly up to a scanner, the device he helped invent looks like a very large camera lens with a smaller one on top and wings of infrared lights on either side. It can identify people by their irises from as far as 40 feet away. Like fingerprints, each person's iris is unique; it stays the same as we age, and unlike fingerprints, cannot be scratched or covered up in some way short of removing the eye altogether And fingerprints can't be taken from a long distance. In a video he made, Professor Savvides showed how it would be possible for police officers to identify the driver of a car they've pulled over for a violation by capturing a detailed image of the iris as the driver glances into the side mirror and comparing it to their database of irises. Then police would know whether the person was driving a stolen car, had a criminal record or was on a terrorist list -- and might be dangerous -- before walking up to the car. It could also help speed up endless security lines at airports. Instead of a human agent taking a passport or a driver's license and running it through a security check, the irises of travelers could be quickly scanned. Of course, the potential for abuse makes some people wary of the technology. An article in The Atlantic magazine on the concept noted that ""identification to a degree comparable to fingerprints at a distance is not something our social habits and political institutions are wired for."" Professor Savvides gets annoyed with such talk. ""We all want better computer and human relations -- we've craved it for decades,"" he said. ""But biometrics and facial recognition are stigmatized by Hollywood."" Some of the CyLab work is focused on the threats that most affect people in their daily lives: password security. Lujo Bauer, director of the university's Cyber Autonomy Research Center, within CyLab, said his research showed that to avoid being hacked, a computer user's passwords had not only to be complex, but long. ""A password that's long and just slightly complex is stronger than a password that's very complex but short,"" said Mr. Bauer, an associate professor of computer science and electrical and computer engineering. Just changing a few words or adding numbers in a password already used does very little to stop hackers, who can easily try thousands of variations of a password in rapid succession, he said. As everyone has been told repeatedly, the worst thing to do is reuse passwords from different accounts. That may be how many people's accounts have been hacked. One way to check if your account has been compromised in a data breach is to go to haveibeenpwned.com. Other research from CyLab has discovered that, contrary to common assumptions, older people are less likely to be a target of phishing than 18- to 25-year-olds, perhaps because younger people are more likely to take risks, said Jason Hong, a professor at Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute Much of cybersecurity is, as Kathleen Carley, a professor at Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, put it, ""employing computer techniques to better understand society and employing our knowledge of society to better understand computer techniques."" Her work is social cybersecurity -- that is figuring out how to make social media ""a free and open place without undue influence."" It's a subject that has become a major societal issue with the suspected Russian hacking of the 2016 election in the United States. Most people, she said, don't realize the impact of bots, which are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. The role of bots is to convince and direct individuals; it could be for relatively innocuous reasons such as marketing, but increasingly bots are used by organizations or governments to run schemes or sow discord on social media by creating or amplifying an existing conversation, making it more virulent and divisive. The bots exploit how human brains are wired. People hear something repeated over and over, seemingly from many sources, and it soon seems like the truth. ""They are affecting the country's values and beliefs,"" she said. One example, which Professor Carley and her team discovered in 2015, was a bot used to persuade Syrians and those in the Syrian diaspora to go to a website to donate to charity for Syrians. ""We believe it was actually a money-laundering site for ISIS,"" she said. In that case, the bots, or botnet, which are bots connected together and controlled as a group, were identified simply through human detection. But A.I. researchers have now created algorithms to identify bots. The one Professor Carley and her team created is called bot-hunter. Perhaps even more insidious are bots that generate and magnify discord on social media, ""warping the information environment,"" Professor Carley said, and affecting everything from how people vote to what they buy to how they view others in society. There are relatively few bots compared with real human accounts, but they are so active that their effect is far out of proportion to their size, she said. One popular example is the big role bots played in the civil unrest in Ukraine in 2013 believed to be fomented by the Russians, Professor Carley said. She and others are developing technological fixes, such as using A.I to do automatic fact-checking, to identify bots and to identify posts with abusive language. But, she said, ""the tools are in their infancy,"" and technology alone won't solve this problem ""Policymakers and the public have to be educated,"" she said. But technology can solve a lot, and that is why graduate students working with CyLab have helped create a digital cybersecurity game for those over 13 years old called picoCTF, for Capture the Flag. In its fourth year, the competitionattracted more than 27,000 students from around the world this time, usually working in teams. It is played over two weeks and involves increasingly complex challenges -- requiring high-tech solutions -- to capture the flag. Only participants in the United States are eligible for the top prize -- a visit to Carnegie Mellon and $5,000. But the prestige is high. And while fun, it is also a way to encourage young people to think about a profession they may never have considered before. ""There's a dramatic shortage of people in cybersecurity,"" said Martin Carlisle, a professor and director of academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon who oversees the contest. ""And we know the vast majority of students have picked their major by the time they get to college."" So targeting middle- and high-school students, he said, is a way to get them excited about a career in cybersecurity before they're already in college. This year's winner? Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, Calif. It was the only team that solved every challenge, although thousands made significant inroads, he said. ""This was one of the few competitions I could access as a high school student,"" said Carolina Zarate, who entered the contest in Maryland and who is now a graduate student studying information security at Carnegie Mellon. She helps develop problems for picoCTF and is also part of Carnegie Mellon's competitive hacking team, which has won four out of the last six competitions at the Def Con conference, considered to be the Olympics of hacking competitions. For Ms. Zarate, the interest in cybersecurity was always there, but she said she hoped the challenge got more people involved. ""If you think how many new areas technology is touching -- what if someone hacked self-driving cars or bitcoins?"" she said. ""I want my money and life to be safe.""

"Facebook Back on the Defensive, Now Over Data Deals With Device Makers","Facebook endured a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe on Monday after disclosures that the social media giant had allowed dozens of hardware manufacturers access to its trove of personal user data. Just months after being forced to explain its privacy measures and pledging reforms in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook found itself on the defensive once again, fending off questions about whether company executives had misled elected officials and why it had not fully disclosed the data-sharing agreements during recent testimony in the United States and Europe.  The European authorities who last month enacted the world's strictest data privacy law said Facebook's sharing of personal information with cellphone makers and other manufacturers deserved further investigation. Germany's top privacy regulator, Johannes Caspar, called Facebook's partnerships ""an unprecedented violation of privacy laws and user trust."" And New York's attorney general, Barbara Underwood, said her office would expand its investigation of Facebook's data practices to include Facebook's sharing with hardware manufacturers. The broad scope of Facebook's data partnerships -- with Apple, Samsung, Amazon and other companies that make or sell phones, tablets, televisions and video game consoles -- was reported by The New York Times on Sunday, showing that Facebook had exempted at least 60 hardware makers from restrictions imposed on other companies in 2015. Those restrictions were intended to prevent games and other apps from gaining access to the Facebook information of their customers' friends. ""I'm extremely concerned that we are just now learning that even more personal user data was provided without consent,"" said Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and one of the lawmakers who questioned Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, at a hearing in April. Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have repeatedly cited the 2015 restrictions to assure policymakers that no outside company could again harvest swaths of personal information without the explicit consent of users, as a contractor for Cambridge Analytica did in 2014. But Facebook officials said this week that they did not consider hardware partners to be outside companies, under the terms of Facebook's privacy policies and a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. When Facebook delivers data to a partner device, a Facebook executive said in a statement posted on the company's website Sunday night, the device maker effectively functions as an extension of Facebook. And when Facebook users decide to share photos or phone numbers with their friends, they also consent to having that information flow to any partner devices their friends use. ""Friends' information, like photos, was only accessible on devices when people made a decision to share their information with those friends,"" said the executive, Ime Archibong. ""We are not aware of any abuse by these companies."" But some American lawmakers criticized Facebook's rationale and urged the F.T.C. to review whether the partnerships violated Facebook's promises to the regulator. ""I think this explanation is completely inadequate and potentially disingenuous,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee charged with consumer protection. ""I think Mark Zuckerberg's testimony raises very serious and severe questions about Facebook's credibility."" David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee, responded even more harshly. ""Sure looks like Zuckerberg lied to Congress about whether users have 'complete control' over who sees our data on Facebook,"" Mr. Cicilline wrote on Twitter. Senior Republicans also said the partnerships merited further review. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said in a statement that The Times's reporting ""raises important questions about transparency and potential privacy risks for Facebook users."" Mr. Thune said the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, would seek more information from Facebook. The F.T.C. is already investigating whether the access to friends' data that Facebook allowed until 2015 violated the terms of its earlier consent decree with the regulator. Rohit Chopra, a current F.T.C. commissioner, declined to comment on any specific company or investigation, but said he believed that the commission would act to enforce any agreements it had with companies. ""Too often, sensitive consumer data gets shared and copied over and over again to a point of no return,"" Mr. Chopra said. ""F.T.C. orders are not suggestions. When companies violate them, there can be serious consequences."" Since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in March, Facebook executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, have appeared before officials in Washington, London and Brussels. But on Monday, Facebook leaders, including the company's departing security chief, took to another social media platform -- Twitter -- to fend off criticism of its privacy policies. The company also addressed American lawmakers from its own Twitter account, saying that no users' privacy had been violated by the data partnerships. Other privacy experts also weighed in, including one engineer at Facebook's advertising rival, Google. And executives at Apple -- which took advantage of Facebook's data-sharing until last year -- took a swipe at Facebook's privacy settings during a developer's conference on Monday. During the event's keynote address, Craig Federighi, an Apple senior vice president, unveiled a new feature that will let Apple users more easily control what sort of information is shared with Facebook and other social media companies. Mr. Federighi chose to demonstrate the new feature onstage by showing Apple's Safari browser open to a webpage. Above it, a pop-up graphic appeared. ""Do you want to allow 'facebook.com' to use cookies and website data while browsing 'blabbermouth.net'?"" the pop-up read.

New York Today: Is Your Wi-Fi Network Safe?; New York Today,"Updated, 6:30 a.m. Good morning on this mediocre Monday. Picture this. You've just nestled into a seat at your local coffee shop to catch up on emails and read New York Today. You click your Wi-Fi network options, select ""CAFE GUEST Net,"" and -- woo hoo -- you're online. The name looked innocuous enough. Convenient, too, without a password. But is that network actually safe?  ""Illegitimate networks are difficult to spot because they look exactly like real ones,"" said David Mitchell, the chief technology officer of Intersection, a New York-based company that manages Wi-Fi networks around the world. Signing in to an unsecured wireless network puts much of your private information -- including browser history, documents and photos -- at risk of being discovered by a hacker. Even your bank login and account numbers could be compromised if you visit your bank's website on an unsecured network. (That's reason enough to think twice before choosing a network that looks and feels legitimate.) At a time when data privacy concerns have taken on added urgency, what can New Yorkers do to take extra precaution? In the coming weeks, NYC Cyber Command, a group responsible for the city's cyber defense efforts, plans to launch NYC Secure, an initiative to help New Yorkers protect their personal information online and strengthen the public Wi-Fi security system. The first part of the project: a free smartphone app. Once you've downloaded the app, you can turn on notifications, which will alert you when you've connected to an unsecured network that could make you vulnerable to a malicious user. You'll receive a real-time pop-up with a description of the threat and recommendations for how to get around it, like connecting to a secure network the app is able to locate. And unlike many other apps, NYC Secure does not ask for personal information during the setup process. (A release date has not been officially set, but Maya Worman, a spokeswoman for NYC Cyber Command, said the app should be available this summer.) Until then, Mr. Mitchell gave us a tip for determining whether a network is safe: ""Your device will indicate that a network is encrypted by showing a padlock icon or other visible indication next to the network name."" So before you give in to temptation to connect to any listed network, trust the padlock. Here's what else is happening: Weather The weekend rain may spill over into Monday. There's a chance of showers and thunderstorms today, with otherwise cloudy skies and a high just above 80. Remember: August is, on average, the third-rainiest month in New York City.

Another staple on our skyline has been declared an individual city landmark, joining the ranks of more than 1,400 others in our backyard. It was first the American Telephone and Telegraph Company building (longhand for AT&T), then Sony Plaza and now, simply, 550 Madison Avenue.

The structure, between East 55th and 56th Streets, has classical touches that set it apart from many neighboring skyscrapers in Midtown.

The 3 Biggest Challenges for Tech in 2019,"If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds.  Privacy Is Dead In 2018, it became very clear that Americans have no control over their digital information. We discovered that our cellphones could be monitored, and many of the apps on our phones are tracking us. We found out that Facebook shared our private messages with third parties and let developers using its platform harvest and exploit our data in order to influence political elections. Our data is perpetually being gathered, leaked, exploited, breached and sold. And perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren't aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts.  But 2018 was also the first year of privacy protection in Europe: The General Data Protection Regulationwent into effect in May. Despite the protestations of those who complain that G.D.P.R. places an undue organizational burden on start-ups, it could return privacy to millions of people living in the European Union.  But those of us in the United States have no similar privacy protections. There is no way for us to know which companies have our data, and I don't think that will change in 2019. I'm also not very optimistic that any significant legislation will be passed, especially given the relationships between some members of Congress and Silicon Valley companies. The only people who have a chance to hold tech companies accountable and demand better protections are ordinary people like you and me. And I think that we will fail. Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won't be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones.  The End of Security There were some very large and frightening data breaches this year. Quora was hacked, and 100 million user accounts were compromised. Facebook was hacked, and 50 million users were affected. Google+ user information was compromised, and Facebook was hacked again, disclosing that it gave developers access to photos that users had uploaded but never posted. Then we learned that the Google+ vulnerabilities were worse than we initially knew. And then Marriott realized it had been hacked, exposing the personal data of 500 million people. The knee-jerk response this year has been to say that these companies need stronger punishments for security breaches, or that we need to regulate tech companies. This response is appropriate in cases where the breach is a result of poor security practices, as appears to have been the case in the 2017 Equifax breach. But some of this year's breaches were different: The Marriott and Quora hacks seem to have been the work of malicious hackers, and in the case of Marriott, the hackers are reportedto have been Chinese government spies. It's not clear that these breaches were a result of poor security practices or corporate negligence. The truth is -- and I say this as someone who has worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer -- the security teams and security practices at Google and Facebook are among the best in the world. It's not clear that stronger punishments or more regulation will fix the problem or prevent these kinds of data breaches from happening. Being the best in the world when it comes to security and following the best security practices have not protected these companies, and, ultimately, they have not kept our data safe. We will see more of these breaches in the coming year, at large companies, and our data will be exploited in ways we never could have dreamed of. Preventing these companies from storing our data would, ultimately, protect it, but the chances that will happen are slim to none. Instead, as these security breaches become routine, engineers and their employers will accept them as an inevitability and treat them (at least internally) as a nonevent -- much the same as credit card companies and credit card users treat credit card fraud today. There's a lot at stake. The spies from foreign governments hacking into American companies aren't trying to destroy you, me or any specific individuals living in the United States -- they are trying to destroy the country that we live in. Tech's Anti-Government Stance Employees at tech companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have begun to organize. In response to an employee walkout at Google, the company changed the way it enforces forced arbitration agreements in sexual harassment cases. The company also dropped out of a competition to provide cloud computing services to the Pentagon after employees protested the company's involvement. Some of the internal protests at these companies centered on civil rights issues, such as the way that victims of sexual harassment are treated. Others, like the outcry about Google's ProjectDragonfly (a censored search engine Google was building for China), were related to freedom of expression. However, a majority of the employee protests and complaints seem to have been about government-related projects. At Salesforce, hundreds of employees signed a petition asking the company to cease working with United States Customs and Border Protection. At Microsoft, employees circulated an open letter urging the company to stop working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and also complained about the company's bid for the Pentagon's cloud computing contract -- the very same one that Google employees pressured their employer about. And, at Amazon, employees protested the company selling its Amazon Web Services products to the United States government. It's not entirely clear if these employees are opposed to working with the government in general, reflecting Silicon Valley's strong libertarian leanings, or if they are only opposed to working with the government under the Trump administration. As the historian Margaret O'Mara has argued, Silicon Valley has long been in the business of war. Amazon, Google and Microsoft were selling their commercial services to (and building customized services for) the United States government long before Donald Trump took office. But I don't recall any open letters, protests or walkouts being staged during the Obama administration. The United States is under siege from foreign governments and malicious hackers. And Silicon Valley's products are the battlefields where the war is being fought. The Russian government influenced elections in the United States through misinformation that was spread on social media, and foreign hackers phished government officials in order to gain access to their email accounts. An investigation by Politico Magazine found that Chinese and Russian spies are working at Silicon Valley companies, where they were planted to ""steal U.S. technology secrets"" and to engage in ""traditional political intelligence gathering, influence and perception-management operations in California."" And it's not just professional spies who are doing the spying: The same investigation by Politico found that Chinese nationals working in Silicon Valley are often threatened by the Chinese government and coerced into providing their government with this information.  The United States is engaged in cyberwarfare with China and Russia, in which tech companies are inevitably involved. Employees of these same tech companies are pushing their employers to drop contracts with the United States government. If they succeed, who is going to win the war?

"AnchorFree, Maker of a Top Online Privacy App, Raises $295 Million","Despite the recent attention on digital privacy, venture capital investors have mostly stayed away from companies that offer virtual private networks, which allow users to hide their online tracks. Now there is one big exception. AnchorFree, the maker of Hotspot Shield, one of the oldest VPN apps, said Wednesday that it had raised $295 million. The round brings AnchorFree's total funding to $358 million, far outpacing any of its competitors. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., is the latest tech start-up to secure a giant investment. Fund-raising rounds of over $100 million have become more commonplace than ever this year.  The investment in AnchorFree suggests that the VPN category is becoming more mainstream. Investors previously avoided it in part because relatively few users have adopted the technology. In addition, some of the networks are not as secure as their companies claim. But after events like the Equifax hack, the repeal of net neutrality rules and Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, downloads of Hotspot Shield spiked. It's a little perplexing, since a VPN would not have protected people affected by any of those events. David Gorodyansky, the founder and chief executive of AnchorFree, said they had pushed typical consumers to take privacy and security more seriously. Hotspot Shield has been downloaded 650 million times. Lately, it has averaged 250,000 downloads a day. For most of the summer, it has been the top-grossing app in its category in the Apple App Store, and in the top 50 over all, according to the app-ranking site App Annie. AnchorFree's other apps, Betternet and HexaTech, ranked high on the App Store charts this week, as well as competing VPN apps owned by Norton, McAfee and a variety of obscure companies. ""Two years ago, there were no privacy or security apps in the top 100,"" Mr. Gorodyansky said. ""There's been a massive shift."" Virtual private network technology is open-sourced, or freely available to use, making it easy for anyone to enter the market. There are hundreds of VPN apps. Some, including AnchorFree, have built additional technology on top of the open-source software. Some free services log users' browsing data and sell it or turn it over to governments when asked. Others say they are based in the United States or the Cayman Islands but actually operate out of countries with censorious governments. Still others obscure what a VPN can actually protect people from. ""They are marketing themselves as 'sprinkle our security or privacy dust on your device and suddenly it will become private and secure,'"" said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights. AnchorFree made for an attractive venture investment because the technology it has built on top of the open-sourced VPN software makes it faster than other VPN services, said Sujay Jaswa, a partner at WndrCo, the investment firm that led the latest round of financing. Many of AnchorFree's competitors license its technology, including Bitdefender, Dashlane, Kaspersky and McAfee. AnchorFree's tech is also prevalent in smartphones and the products of telecommunications companies. Samsung Galaxy phones come loaded with AnchorFree's VPN software; Verizon and Telefónica license it as well. The companies split revenue earned from anyone who becomes a paying customer. The company said it has been profitable since 2010. It has just 110 employees; 80 are engineers, and it has no salespeople. Hotspot Shield is free, but a small percentage of users pay a monthly fee for extra features, including faster internet speeds, the ability choose their internet server, and added protection from phishing, malware and spam. The company recently added a product specifically for businesses. In 2017, the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that promotes digital rights, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate AnchorFree and Hotspot Shield, accusing the company of deceptively redirecting users to certain websites and sharing data. AnchorFree, which has denied the allegations, declined to comment on the investigation. But after the criticism, the company rewrote its terms of service, to avoid legalese, and AnchorFree began to release transparency reports. The first one, issued in November, showed the company received 81 requests for user data from government agencies in the first 10 months of 2017 and 79 in 2016. AnchorFree complied with none of the requests. Hotspot Shield does not log any of its users' activity, Mr. Gorodyansky said. As a result, the company could not provide the data to the government. ""Our conversations are super simple,"" he said. ""We have no data. End of story."" The latest round of funding comes from WndrCo along with Accel Partners, 8VC, SignalFire and Green Bay Ventures. AnchorFree would not disclose its valuation or revenue. AnchorFree said it would use the capital to expand into related areas, such as security for internet-connected devices (say, smart doorbells or thermostats). The company will also pursue acquisitions, potentially of companies with sales teams in place.

An American Alternative to Europe's Privacy Law; Contributing Op-Ed Writer,"Imagine that you've been struggling with a serious and fairly embarrassing personal problem. Putting aside a longstanding reluctance to address it, you finally consult a therapist. The therapist is friendly and welcoming and promises to protect your privacy. Gaining a sense of trust, you bare your soul, describing the issue you are struggling with in all of its painful detail. Only later do you realize, to your horror, that your confessions were being recorded and retained by the therapist. It turns out that your therapist, to supplement his income, has gotten into the advertising business: He takes data gleaned from his patients and offers it to advertisers (or any other interested party) for a fee.  Everyone would be outraged by this; it is professionally unethical and a serious breach of trust. Yet what I've described is not so different from our relationship with businesses like Google, Facebook, Quora and Amazon. They hold themselves out as trustworthy, enticing us to share our information with them -- from the banal details of our lives to our most intimate secrets -- without making it very clear that everything is being recorded, kept and used for advertising. The Europeans find this kind of thing distasteful, which is why last Friday they instituted a strict online privacy law -- the General Data Protection Regulation. The law's approach is, for want of a better word, European: broad, rule-driven and administered by regulators. Under the G.D.P.R., any company that gathers or processes personal data is defined as a ""data controller"" and is subject to a raft of new rights and duties that are enforced by Europe's member states. Many people have argued that the United States should adopt or borrow from the G.D.P.R. in strengthening its own online privacy protections. But Congress is the stumbling block. It has repeatedly failed to pass a number of proposed privacy bills, and despite increased public outrage, it seems unlikely to create a European-style privacy bureaucracy anytime soon. For all these reasons, the United States may need to try something different and more American: namely, to rely on judges and state law to establish that the legal concept of ""fiduciary duty"" can apply to technology companies. To understand what fiduciary duties are, return to the example of the unfaithful therapist. Given that he used a position of trust and expertise to gain sensitive information from you, medical ethics and the law hold that he has a special obligation to be loyal and careful with your data. He is a fiduciary. (The word derives from the Latin for ""trust."") The idea of a fiduciary duty is intuitive and familiar to American law: Your lawyer, your doctor, your therapist and your accountant are all fiduciaries. So why not your search engine, your digital assistant and your social media platform? These entities present themselves as trustworthy, have a special expertise and usually require you to reveal information about yourself to be useful. As Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, himself put it: ""We have a responsibility to protect your data."" These companies should be considered, to borrow a term coined by the law professor Jack Balkin, ""information fiduciaries"" -- or perhaps ""data fiduciaries."" How would this work in practice? Once these fiduciary duties were established by state legislation or a court ruling, questions about the breach of such duties would be addressed case by case, by courts and judges, in the American common-law manner. Instead of asking what responsibilities all ""data controllers"" have, as the Europeans must now do, courts in the United States could ask more specific questions. For example: Did Equifax, the credit reporting agency, fail to adequately protect user data? (Obviously.) Should a firm like Quora, the question-and-answer website, require that users ""opt in"" before allowing other people to find out what you are asking about? (Almost certainly.) Should Alexa, Amazon's digital assistant, require users to ""opt in"" before it listens to their conversations? (It depends on how it would be carried out.) To be sure, a European-style regulatory system operates faster and has clearer rules than an American-style common-law approach. But the European approach runs the risk of being insensitive to context and may not match our ethical intuitions in individual cases. If the past decade of technology has taught us anything, it is that we face a complex and varied array of privacy problems. Case-by-case consideration might be the best way to find good solutions to many of them and, when the time comes (if the time comes), to guide the writing of general federal privacy legislation. A defining fact of our existence today is that we share more of ourselves with Silicon Valley than with our accountants, lawyers and doctors. It is about time the law caught up with that.

Why All the New Terms of Service?; TECH TIP,"Q. This week alone, I've gotten several notifications from online services that I use about privacy policy updates. Is this because of the Facebook  flap? A. Facebook's recent and well-documented issues with protecting the personal information of its users prompted the company to announce that it was changing some of its practices and redesigning its privacy settings to make them easier for its users to find and understand. But certain changes were already in the works for Facebook -- and many other online services -- because of strict new data privacy rules taking effect next month in Europe.  The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) goes into effect on May 25 and is meant to ensure a common set of data rights in the European Union. It requires organizations to notify users as soon as possible of high-risk data breaches that could personally affect them. It also gives citizens the right to obtain copies of the data companies have compiled about them and codifies their right, under certain circumstances, to have their personal data erased (also known as the ""right to be forgotten"").  The law also dictates that when a company asks a consumer to give consent to use his or her personal information, those user agreements and other dense legal forms people tend to click past ""should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms."" The age of consent itself is set at 16 years.  The G.D.P.R. applies stiff financial penalties for those who do not comply, and American companies handling the data of E.U. citizens must also follow the rules. Many online services have customers worldwide, and are updating their privacy policies and terms of service to factor in these new European rules -- which is mainly why you are seeing so many notifications. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Watchdog Finds Cambridge Analytica Misused Data,"LONDON -- The defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica violated British law when it used improperly harvested Facebook data to aid Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and would face a significant fine if it were not already in bankruptcy, Britain's top data protection watchdog found Tuesday. The long-awaited report by Britain's Information Commissioner's Office, which has been investigating the misuse of personal data by political campaigns, also said an insurance company owned by Arron Banks, a main backer of Britain's campaign to leave the European Union, broke British law when it used customer data to aid the Brexit effort.    According to the commissioner's office, the company, Eldon Insurance, shared private email addresses to be sent campaign messages on behalf of Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group, months before the 2016 referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union.    The 112-page report underscored how modern political campaigns rely on Facebook data and other consumer information, extracted or bought by consulting firms with little oversight and few protections for consumers. An investigation in March by The New York Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian revealed how Cambridge Analytica -- at the time an upstart data firm bankrolled by the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer -- had improperly obtained and exploited Facebook data from as many as 87 million users around the globe.   The commissioner's investigation revealed that political campaigns in Britain had exercised little restraint in exploiting consumer data, despite the European Union's relatively strict data laws. Political groups were acting more like online businesses and internet marketing firms to target and engage voters, the report concluded.   ''We have uncovered a disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy,'' the commissioner found.   The finding also adds to legal and political scrutiny of Mr. Banks, who was the single largest donor to the Brexit campaign. His dealings with the Russian ambassador ahead of the referendum have separately raised questions about whether the Kremlin sought to reward important backers of Britain's exit from the European Union, and prompted British election officials last week to ask for a police investigation. In Washington, the special prosecutor, Robert S. Mueller III, has obtained records of Mr. Banks's communications with Russian diplomats.   Now Mr. Banks's insurance company and the Leave.EU campaign are facing total fines of 135,000 pounds, or about $177,000, for the privacy breaches, which occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The insurance company owned by Mr. Banks will also be audited, the report said.   But the commissioner rejected accusations that Leave.EU secretly employed Cambridge Analytica -- and possibly exploited its Facebook data haul -- during the Brexit campaign, potentially violating British election disclosure laws. Though Cambridge Analytica considered working with Leave.EU, and even sent one executive to appear with Leave.EU officials at a news conference, the data company never reached an agreement with the campaign, the commissioner found.   Mr. Banks, sometimes described as the ''godfather of Brexit,'' has denied wrongdoing and was quick to rebuff the findings of the information commissioner's office. The investigators ''find no evidence of a grand data conspiracy and find we may have accidentally sent a newsletter to customers,'' Mr. Banks said on Twitter.   But investigators specifically described an improper intermingling of data between Eldon Insurance, Mr. Bank's company, and the Leave.EU campaign he co-founded.   Investigators said more than one million emails sent to Leave.EU supporters over two separate periods had also included marketing for Eldon Insurance services. Eldon customers also were sent a Leave.EU newsletter, an incident the company described as a mistake in managing an email distribution system.   The two organizations were already known to have close ties, including sharing board members.   The investigation began last year to look into the potential misuse of data in the British referendum on leaving the European Union. But it took on new urgency when The Times, The Observer and The Guardian revealed in March that Cambridge had improperly harvested the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.   The British investigation involved 71 witnesses, 30 organizations whose data practices were reviewed and 700 terabytes of data -- the equivalent of 52 billion pages.   In an earlier report, issued in July, the Information Commissioner's Office said it had fined Facebook £500,000, or about $660,000 -- the maximum under British law -- for allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest user data.   In addition to the new details about Mr. Banks, Tuesday's report provides more information about the investigation into how Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user data.   The investigation found that Cambridge had nimbly evaded what few restrictions Facebook imposed by contracting with an academic researcher working at Cambridge University, who used an app to harvest the data, almost all of it without the users' explicit consent.   The political consulting firm teamed up with the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, who had created an application that collected demographic information, News Feed posts, friend lists, pages that users had liked and other data.   The information was used to create physiological profiles that could guide the targeting of political messages.   In March, officials obtained a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's offices, getting access to mobile phones, storage devices, computers and financial records. At one location, the authorities said, they discovered a number of physically damaged servers, from which investigators were able to recover information.   Investigators said the Information Commissioner's Office needed more to time to review evidence, including Cambridge Analytica's email system, to better determine who had access to data on Facebook users.   ''There are several strands that will take us into the future,'' said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner.   Cambridge Analytica announced in May that it was ceasing most operations and filing for bankruptcy amid growing legal and political scrutiny of its business practices and work for the Trump campaign. The elections division of Cambridge's British affiliate, SCL Group, was also shut down.   In its report on Tuesday, the information commissioner said that had the company still existed, it would have faced ''a substantial fine for very serious breaches'' or Britain's data protection laws. The company, the report added, engaged in ''unfairly processing people's personal data for political purposes, including purposes connected with the 2016 U.S. presidential campaigns.''   The report did not draw any conclusions about whether data mining techniques used by Cambridge Analytica and others had determined the outcome of elections in the United States or Britain, but the regulator called on policymakers to draft new laws to restrict how data is collected and shared for political purposes.   ''We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the U.K. E.U. referendum or the U.S. election campaigns,'' the report said. ''But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.''    "
Facebook's Data Sharing and Privacy Rules: 5 Takeaways From Our Investigation,"You are the product: That is the deal many Silicon Valley companies offer to consumers. The users get free search engines, social media accounts and smartphone apps, and the companies use the personal data they collect -- your searches, ""likes,"" phone numbers and friends -- to target and sell advertising. But an investigation by The New York Times, based on hundreds of pages of internal Facebook documents and interviews with about 50 former employees of Facebook and its partners, reveals that the marketplace for that data is even bigger than many consumers suspected. And Facebook, which collects more information on more people than almost any other private corporation in history, is a central player.   Here are five takeaways from our investigation. Facebook deals in data ""We don't sell data to anyone,"" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, told Congress during a hearing in April. His pledge -- that the torrent of data Facebook collects from its 2.2 billion users will always remain safely in Facebook's hands -- has been a cornerstone of the company's defensive strategy this year, as lawmakers, regulators and activists have pummeled the social network over a series of privacy breaches and public relations blunders. While it is true that Facebook hasn't sold users' data, for years it has struck deals to share the information with dozens of Silicon Valley companies. These partners were given more intrusive access to user data than Facebook has ever disclosed. In turn, the deals helped Facebook bring in new users, encourage them to use the social network more often, and drive up advertising revenue. Facebook's largest partners got far more access than Cambridge Analytica did Revelations in March that a political consulting firm linked to President Trump had improperly obtained data on as many as 87 million Facebook users set off the worst crisis in Facebook's history. The company's stock plunged, as regulators around the world demanded answers and users worried that Facebook wasn't protecting their data. In response, Facebook pointed to changes it had made to its privacy policy in 2014, saying that developers no longer had the kind of access that Cambridge had exploited. But The Times's investigation reveals that Facebook continued to give huge tech companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, access to much more: the data of hundreds of millions of people a month, including email addresses and phone numbers -- without users' knowledge or consent. Facebook never directly told users that it was sharing this data Internal documents obtained by The Times show that Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies -- most of them tech businesses, but also automakers, media organizations (including The Times) and others.  While Facebook users can control what data they share with most of the thousands of apps on Facebook's platform, some companies had access to users' data even if they had disabled all sharing. Many of the partners' applications never even appeared in Facebook's user application settings. According to Facebook, each of the outside companies acted as an extension of the social network. Any information a user shared with friends on Facebook, the company argues, could be shared with these partner companies without additional consent. Facebook was sloppy The data partnerships date to 2010, at the start of a period of headlong growth and expansion for Facebook. Within a few years, the social network had struck so many of these deals that Facebook employees built a tool to track the different types of access the partners had. Despite this, Facebook appears not to have kept close tabs on how its users' data flowed out into the world. A Russian social media company, Yandex, that has been accused of having overly close ties to the Kremlin, still had access to Facebook's unique user IDs for years after Facebook had cut off other applications from the data, citing security concerns. Likewise, Facebook gave Yahoo the ability to display a Facebook user's news feed -- including friends' posts -- on the search company's home page. Yahoo got rid of the feature in 2012. But as of last year, it still had access to data for close to 100,000 people a month.  Regulators let it happen Under the terms of a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, Facebook was required to strengthen privacy safeguards and disclose data practices more thoroughly. The company hired an independent firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to formally assess its privacy procedures and report back to the F.T.C. every two years. Four former officials and employees of the F.T.C., briefed on The Times's findings, said the data-sharing deals likely violated the consent agreement, since users had no way of knowing which companies Facebook had shared their data with, and no clear means of granting or withholding permission. At least one assessment by PricewaterhouseCoopers, in 2013, found that Facebook had done little to ensure that the shared data was appropriately safeguarded. Facebook maintains that the partnerships are covered by an exemption to the consent decree. A spokeswoman for the F.T.C., which last spring opened a new investigation into Facebook, declined to say whether the commission agreed.

Two Tools to Protect Privacy Online; TECH TIP,"Q. What is the difference in security protections between TunnelBear and Ghostery?   A. Both programs are meant to protect your privacy and give you more online anonymity.  But TunnelBear primarily encrypts your overall internet connection, and Ghostery blocks the software that wants to track your wanderings around the web. (Both apps have desktop and mobile versions.)  TunnelBear is a virtual private network (VPN) service, and it is designed to protect the data transferred by your computer over the internet, even on an open public network, by connecting your device to a secure server (sometimes called ""tunneling"") that shields your online activity from others. The data transferred by your computer is encrypted, and the VPN can even mask the location of your computer, or make it seem that you are connected from another country.  Using the internet may seem slower than surfing without the protection, but TunnelBear can block some online tracking software, too -- software that can slow websites. TunnelBear is one of numerous paid and free VPN services and apps that are available, including IPVN, the provider recommended by Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times.  Ghostery is a free extension that works with most browsers to block ads and web trackers. Ad blockers can speed up and declutter your surfing experience while protecting your personal privacy by making you seem anonymous, although some websites refuse to load if an ad blocker is in use. AdBlock, AdBlockPlus and Privacy Badger are similar extensions.  You can use VPN services with ad-blocking extensions simultaneously to protect personal data transmitted over your internet connection and to block advertisements and websites from monitoring your activity. If you prefer to use fewer programs at once, you can also find VPN services that include ad blockers, like Private Internet Access and WindScribe.

Tech Giants Brace for Europe's New Data Privacy Rules,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Over the past two months, Google has started letting people around the world choose what data they want to share with its various products, including Gmail and Google Docs. Amazon recently began improving the data encryption on its cloud storage service and simplified an agreement with customers over how it processes their information. And on Sunday, Facebook rolled out a new global data privacy center -- a single page that allows users to organize who sees their posts and what types of ads they are served. While these changes are rippling out worldwide, a major reason for these shifts comes from Europe: The tech giants are preparing for a stringent new set of data privacy rules in the region, called the General Data Protection Regulation.  Set to take effect on May 25, the regulations restrict what types of personal data the tech companies can collect, store and use across the 28-member European Union. Among their provisions, the rules enshrine the so-called right to be forgotten into European law so people can ask companies to remove certain online data about them. The rules also require anyone under 16 to obtain parental consent before using popular digital services. If companies do not comply, they could face fines totaling 4 percent of their annual revenue. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley's tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. ""Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,"" said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. ""G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone."" The rush of activity is a reminder of how Europe has set the regulatory standard in reining in the immense power of tech giants, while other places -- including the United States -- have largely taken a noninterventionist stance. The G.D.P.R. rules were approved in late 2015 after tech companies like Facebook ran into problems over data protection with national privacy watchdogs in various European countries. European officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back. ""There has not been any pushback from American companies,"" said V[#x11b]ra Jourová, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. ""If anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation."" Officials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards. The coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google's director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. ""When G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,"" he said. The biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation's mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services -- from Gmail to its Cloud storage services -- to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone's data. ""For a company with infrastructure of our size, it takes a lot of work,"" Mr. Golan said. Facebook has also taken multiple steps to deal with the coming rules. On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week. The new privacy center would give Facebook a ""very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,"" Ms. Sandberg said. Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said the social network has also held a series of ""Design Jams"" where it invites designers and engineers to reimagine how products look so that people can more easily see and control their online data. With the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws. Last November, for instance, the company unveiled a program that uses artificial intelligence to monitor Facebook users for signs of self-harm. But it did not open the program to users in Europe, where the company would have had to ask people for permission to access sensitive health data, including about their mental state. The social network has also kept out of Europe facial recognition software that tracks when photos of users are posted across the platform. Amazon, too, has made changes. Last April, the company wrote a blog post outlining its efforts to comply with the new European regulations. The internet retailer said it would strengthen the encryption around the data it stores on its cloud storage services, and reaffirmed the rights of customers to choose which region -- Europe or otherwise -- where they want their data stored. Amazon declined to discuss the work. Some American tech companies said they welcomed the new data protection rules. ""We embrace G.D.P.R. because it sets a strong standard for privacy and data protection rights, which is at the core of our business,"" Julie Brill, a corporate vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an interview. ""We began work on G.D.P.R. as soon as it was adopted by the European Union. Our preparations for G.D.P.R. touch every part of our company."" How the biggest tech companies handle the regulations will most likely influence their smaller counterparts. Angelo Spenillo, general counsel for Siteimprove, which helps companies manage their presence online, said many little tech companies have been looking toward Google and Facebook for how user privacy and data will be managed online. ""Where the bigger companies go, the smaller companies will follow suit,"" he said. ""We're going to see real changes across the board."" Ms. Jourová said as the new rules take effect, countries outside Europe could begin demanding similar data protection measures for their citizens. ""There will be a moment, especially as more and more people in the U.S. find themselves uncomfortable with the channels monitoring their private lives,"" she said.

Finding Privacy for Email; TECH TIP,"Q. After reading recently updated privacy policies -- are there any web-based mail providers out there that do not scan your mail, mine your data or stick ads on your messages? If I wanted to leave Yahoo for a more secure mail provider, how do I move my mail and address book?  A.  Free email services are generally free because those companies make money by selling advertising based on the data you generate. That is the trade-off.  Using an encryption tool, such as OpenPGP, is an option for more secure mail, but another option is to use a web-based mail service that builds in privacy. Most secure mail providers charge a fee, but some have free accounts with limited features and reduced storage capacity. Many of the more popular secure mail providers are based overseas and are subject to the privacy laws in their particular country of incorporation, so read up before signing up. Services include Countermail (Sweden), FastMail (Australia), Hushmail (Canada), ProtonMail (Switzerland), RunBox (Norway) and Tutanota (Germany). Compared to several other countries or regions, the United States has looser legal restrictions about what companies can do with customer data. For example, the United States government repealed certain consumer privacy protection laws last year, making it easier for broadband internet providers to track and sell customer data without first getting permission from those being tracked.  As for moving your data to a new service, Yahoo Mail does not have an export function for the mail in your existing mailbox, but you might be able to download your messages to a third-party desktop mail program like Mozilla Thunderbird in order to save copies locally. Yahoo's help site does have instructions for exporting your contacts list as a file that you can import elsewhere.  Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

A Simple Proposal to Help Fix Corporate America's Cybersecurity Problem; Another View,"The public's confidence in the capability of companies to protect customers' personal information has taken a beating in recent weeks. Customers of Sears and Kmart, Best Buy, Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, and Delta Air Lines recently learned that hacks have exposed their personal data, including credit and debit card numbers. And then there's the disclosure that Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal information of nearly 87 million Facebook users. Despite these disclosures and others, we continue to entrust our personal information to businesses without any standard for judging how safe it is. It doesn't have to be that way.  When we head out for dinner in major cities, for example, the restaurant has a letter grade from the health inspector in the window. As a society, we recognize that when consumers dine out, they may be putting their health at risk. We require, in turn, that restaurants display the simple but powerful information about their hygienic standards. There is no equivalent standard by which a consumer may judge the data security practices of a business. That lack of public information about the cyber-preparedness of businesses is all the more striking given the relative severity of the threat. More than half the adult population of the United States was affected by the breach of Equifax last year. Unfortunately, we have become inured to these hacks. Our response to breaches has become routine: more calls for regulation, followed by congressional hearings and failed regulatory proposals. Consumers go about their lives, numbed by the frequency and the lack of consequences. Meanwhile, the hacks get worse. This cycle stems in part from a lack of information about the security practices of businesses. But forcing companies to explain how they are keeping the bad guys out would only help the bad guys. The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force. Current measures to assess cyber-preparedness are either not compulsory or too complex. The federal government's National Institute of Standards and Technology framework is widely respected, but it's voluntary, underused and not easily digestible for the average consumer. Only seven Fortune 500 companies mentioned it in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, and only one said it had adopted it. MSCI -- an index provider and independent research firm for institutional investors -- ranks companies on cybersecurity. More than a year before Equifax's breach was revealed, MSCI scored Equifax a 0 out of 10 on privacy and data security. As prescient as it was, consumers would have had difficulty absorbing such a rating, which is just one of several components that MSCI uses to arrive at an environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., rating of overall corporate citizenship. A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact? Each year, the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM look at the cost of the average data security breach, as well as the average cost of each piece of data compromised. In 2017, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $7.35 million, or $141 per record compromised. But if a company has an incident response team, uses encryption, trains its employees, has a business continuity program and monitors cyber-threat intelligence, that reduces the cost of the average data breach by nearly 47 percent. Using these five factors -- weighed for their impact of cost reduction -- is a simple starting point. There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers. A grading system would not solve every cybersecurity problem, nor prevent every breach. But our sad state of affairs -- in which we are equal parts fearful, apathetic and ignorant about digital security -- must change. Providing clearer information to the public is the most productive next step we can take. PHOTO: Last year, Equifax disclosed a data breach that exposed information of 148 million people.

"The Personal Data of 346,000 People, Hung on a Museum Wall","BEIJING -- Deng Yufeng wanted to create art that prods people to question their lack of data privacy. What better way, he reasoned, than to buy the personal information of more than 300,000 Chinese people off the internet and display it in a public exhibition? The police did not appreciate the irony.  Last week, the authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan shut down Mr. Deng's exhibition in a local museum after two days and told him that he was being investigated on suspicion of amassing the information through illegal means. Mr. Deng's project coincides with a growing debate about the lack of data privacy in China, where people are starting to push back against tech companies and their use of information. Online brokers regularly, and illegally, buy and sell personal information online. Chinese people are often bombarded with calls and text messages offering bank loans or home purchases that seem too personalized to be random. Mr. Deng, a 32-year-old artist based in Beijing, said he hoped to get Chinese people to question that everyday scenario. ""When these nuisance text messages become a daily routine, we develop a habit of ignoring and avoiding these text messages in a numb state,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""This is actually the mental state of most people here: a state of helplessness."" Last month, Robin Li, the chief executive of the search giant Baidu, set off a firestorm when he said that Chinese people were willing to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency. In December, the software developer Qihoo 360 angered many internet users when a blogger discovered that the company was taking surveillance footage from restaurants and gyms in Beijing and broadcasting it without permission onto its platform. The rising public anger is taking place amid a similar debate in the United States, over Facebook. But Beijing officials keep the volume lower because personal data is broadly available to another powerful constituency: the Chinese government. Tech companies cooperate with the police in handing over information, with few questions asked. Citizens are resigned to the fact that they are tracked by the government, and there is little pushback about the increased state of surveillance. So six months ago, Mr. Deng started buying people's information, using the Chinese messaging app QQ to reach sellers. He said that the data was easy to find and that he paid a total of $800 for people's names, genders, phone numbers, online shopping records, travel itineraries, license plate numbers -- at a cost at just over a tenth of a penny per person. He said he knew he was breaking the law. He wanted to prove a point. ""Artists are not merely aesthetic creators,"" Mr. Deng said. ""In the very complicated state of our world today, we should also bear social responsibility."" At his exhibition, called ""346,000 Wuhan Citizens' Secrets,"" he printed the pieces of personal data on sheets of paper using a special liquid solution. The sheets were hung in neat rows and columns on a wall. Museumgoers could only see the data under a special light source, and key identifying details were redacted. According to Mr. Deng, plainclothes police officers took him away on April 6, two days after his exhibition opened. They told him that he was being investigated for the buying of citizens' information online and was barred from leaving Wuhan. When reached for comment, a Wuhan-based police officer from the station investigating the case said she did not know anything about it and hung up. Under Chinese criminal law, Mr. Deng faces up to seven years in jail. But Raymond Wang, a lawyer who specializes in data security, said he believed it was unlikely that Mr. Deng would be sentenced because there were no ""damaging consequences."" Whether Mr. Deng's exhibit will catch the attention of China's leaders isn't clear. But Legal Daily, an official, government-run publication, said Mr. Deng's project showed how the existing laws on the protection of personal information were weak and enforcement was poor. ""The organizer's purpose was to call for the protection of personal privacy, and he himself violated the law to purchase personal information,"" the newspaper wrote in an opinion piece. ""Due to the complexity of the plot, it will make for a lively legal lesson."" The privacy project is just one of Mr. Deng's many works of art touching on social issues. He has gone undercover to investigate the kidnappings of children, a major problem in China. He has also worked on a project on how people buy fake identification cards and guns. Mr. Deng pointed out that the lack of data privacy was also a global problem. With the help of volunteers, Mr. Deng sent about 10,000 text messages to the people whose information he used in the exhibition, inviting them to come. One of them was not amused, according to Mr. Deng, responding back: ""You're sick.""

New Privacy Rules Could Make This Woman One of Tech's Most Important Regulators,"DUBLIN -- If Mark Zuckerberg doesn't know who Helen Dixon is, he will soon. From an unassuming townhouse in the Irish capital, Ms. Dixon, the country's data protection commissioner, leads an agency that was once a bureaucratic backwater. Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook's building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea. Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world's most consequential regulators. She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able -- or willing -- to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.  ""There's a wave coming toward us that we need to push back against,"" Ms. Dixon, who spent the first 10 years of her career working for tech companies, said in an interview. Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation is seen by experts as the world's most aggressive set of internet privacy rules. It is expected to come into force on May 25, and it will give more than 500 million people living in the European Union the right to keep companies from collecting personal data, or to have it deleted. Regulators like Ms. Dixon will be able to fine companies up to 4 percent of global revenue -- equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] The privacy law highlights broader skepticism of Silicon Valley in Europe, where regulators have punished companies for violating taxand antitrust laws, not doing enough to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation online, and intrusively gobbling up data on consumers. Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn. If companies do not comply with the law, Ms. Dixon said, ""they will suffer consequences."" But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That's roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin. The data protection office was once an afterthought. During an effort by the Irish government to move less-critical agencies out of Dublin, it was relocated in 2006 50 miles west to a town called Portarlington, population 8,368. Its power was so limited that it could not publicize investigations. Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science. Fittingly for her current position, Ms. Dixon guards her privacy. She will not share her age, other than saying she is in her ""40s,"" and she has become more careful with data since taking the job. She does not use Facebook or Instagram (though she does have a LinkedIn profile). Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved. But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland's financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater. ""The question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?"" said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. ""We need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced."" Budgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley. There is evidence those concerns are well founded. In a Reuters survey of privacy regulators in 24 European Union countries, 17 said they did not have the needed funding or legal powers to enforce data protection regulation. Ireland did not participate in the survey. Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland's history of lax oversight of the technology industry. Her predecessors are faulted for not taking earlier action against Facebook, even when complaints were filed years ago about data-mining practices similar to those eventually used by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The European Commission in 2016 also ordered Ireland to recoup about $15.6 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple. (The decision is being appealed.) ""The culture has to be changed,"" said Max Schrems, a Austria-based lawyer and online privacy advocate who filed the earlier complaints against Facebook. ""You can have the best law, but if nobody enforces it, then you're not going to go anywhere."" Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints -- not as common in Europe as the United States -- that could result in sizable damages against businesses. A looming question, however, is how much people really care. Ms. Dixon cited Facebook's most recent financial report, which showed growing user numbers, revenue and profit, despite the Cambridge Analytica scandal. ""We should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you're not mandated by the general public,"" she said. ""Either they don't care or they actively oppose what we're doing."" Representatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon's team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law. ""We've really leapt into explaining what we've done and the thinking that's gone into that,"" said Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer. ""I've got faith and confidence that the way Helen Dixon's office will perform its function will be true to the spirit and requirements of G.D.P.R., rather than being blown around by whatever is happening in the media."" Google and Twitter declined to comment. Even with limited resources, Ms. Dixon is studying her adversaries. When Mr. Zuckerberg testified before Congress last month, she stayed up late at home despite the time difference to watch as the Facebook chief executive answered questions. Asked if she had a message for him and other tech executives, she said they should expect her to use her new powers ""to the fullest.""

"Data Subjects of the World, Unite!","The European Union's new digital privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, doesn't just protect European residents or citizens. The law covers ""data subjects."" You are a data subject. If you got an email in the last few days from an online shopping website advising you of new privacy policies that are compliant with the rule, you are likely a data subject of Europe, even if you've never been to Europe and don't even have a passport. A data subject is defined as ""a natural person"" inside or outside the European Union whose personal data is used by ""a controller or processor""; in a curious inversion, it is individuals who are the subjects of data, not the data that is secondary to the individual.  The term started appearing in privacy regulations in the early 1980s. But it is mainly because of the internet that our digital lives have actually become de-territorialized. Our bodies can only be in one place at a time, but data can be in multiple locations at once. Digital information is split up, fragmented, multiplied and dispersed. We don't always know where our files, emails and photos are stored; who ends up mining them for information; or how those mining them put the insights they gather to use. What matters to regulators is whether the company collecting and processing your data is in the European Union, and, if it's outside the union, whether it offers these services to or monitors people who are in Europe. The privacy law essentially compels companies operating globally to play by stricter European Union rules if they want to keep doing business there. It entitles us ""data subjects"" to move our information from one platform to another; to know how and by whom it is being used; and to contest a decision made by an algorithm, among other things. By reaching extraterritorially, regulators make it harder for companies to shop around for friendly jurisdictions to avoid these rules. In broader terms, the regulation is an attempt to make sense of newly complex and decentralized relationships among individuals, their data, the state and the private sector that have emerged under globalization. These are relationships we negotiate and renegotiate every day. The artist James Bridle explores this process in Citizen Ex, a browser extension that uses the domains of the websites visited by people using the browser to determine where they appear to be ""from."" Online, individuals ""pass through time, space and law""; reduced to their browsing activities, they appear as ""a collection of data extending across many nations, with a different citizenship and different rights in every place."" The tool can yield surprising results. I consider myself a citizen of the world, but lately, my browsing habits have been embarrassingly provincial: Although I'm not a United States citizen, I appear overwhelmingly American, with a smattering of Singapore, Ireland, France and Germany. Mr. Bridle's term for this form of belonging is ""algorithmic citizenship"": a decentralized and fragmented status. It can be split ""into an infinite number of sub-citizenships,"" and it can ""produce combinations of affiliations to different states."" The digital privacy law's ""data subject"" gets at the same idea, by tethering what's done with our data to places on earth. The law doesn't draw borders around the data itself, or indeed around us; it acknowledges that on the internet, individuals and their data travel all over. Under the new law, you can be a citizen of the United States, a resident of Japan and a European ""data subject"" at the same time. And this time, the borders are being drawn around corporations. The law's extraterritorial reach ensures that corporations can't weasel their way out. Like so many laws, this one is meant to provide some protections to vulnerable populations from those who wield a lot of power. In the digital world, the power rests with a small handful of multinational leviathans; all of us are vulnerable, and we can be exploited without even knowing it. The new privacy law acknowledges the dangerous power of these companies while attempting to return some personal sovereignty to their clients, the people. We should all start thinking of ourselves not just as clients of a company, residents of a state or citizens of a country, but also as data subjects of the world. Data is currency; creating and holding it is power. This power has gone to Google, Facebook, Amazon and the other neo-feudal masters that use it to their advantage, not ours. If it takes a European Union bureaucrat's definition of ""data subject"" to help us wrest back some of that power, I'm O.K. with that, because what's done to us should be a matter of fundamental rights, whether online or in real life. Technological innovations should be for the good of the world, not just the market. To cite one of the law's more touching lines: ""The processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind.""

"Facebook Gives Lawmakers Follow-Up Answers, but Not Much Is New","SAN FRANCISCO -- During two days of grilling from Congress in April, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, repeatedly promised to ""get back to"" lawmakers on questions he could not answer. On Monday, Congress released the social network's follow-up responses to those queries. In 454 pages that were made public by the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees, Facebook provided information to more than 2,000 questions from lawmakers on topics including its policies on user data, privacy and security. Yet much of the information that Facebook included was not new and the social network sidestepped providing detailed answers, in a move that may embolden some of its critics.  In dozens of responses about how Facebook operates and how it deals with its online content, the company referred members of Congress back to its terms of service and community standards. In 224 instances, Facebook simply asked lawmakers to look back at previously answered questions. ""See response to Question 2,"" Facebook wrote in seven answers to questions from Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, who asked whether the company blocked people from seeing content that came from conservative voices. Mr. Zuckerberg appeared in Washington two months ago after a swell of outrage over whether the company had mishandled its users' data. The visit was spurred by revelations from The New York Times and others over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, had improperly harvested the information of millions of Facebook users. During Mr. Zuckerberg's two days on Capitol Hill, he sat through hours of questioning over everything from the company's business model to its data security and how foreign agents had misused the platform during the 2016 presidential election. He said he would get back to 24 lawmakers with follow-up answers, according to a tally by The New York Times. After the hearings wrapped up, lawmakers submitted a formal list of written questions that they wanted more information on. In a statement that Facebook included with its answers, the company thanked members of Congress for the questions and said it ""did our best to review and answer them in the available timeframe."" A Facebook spokesman said the company was also preparing to send its responses to questions posed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In many of the company's answers, it sought to assure lawmakers that it was actively looking for other companies that might have harvested people's personal data. In response to a question by Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, for example, the company said it was in the process of investigating every app that had gathered a large amount of Facebook data and that 200 apps had already been suspended pending further investigation. Many senators also asked Facebook about its work to secure its platform for the November midterm elections. The company gave nearly identical answers to those questions, outlining how it was deploying new tools to root out fake accounts and disinformation campaigns. Some senators asked the company a large volume of questions. Mr. Cruz, for instance, posed 119 queries, many of which had subsections. His lines of inquiry ranged from whether Facebook employees had donated money to Republican and Democratic candidates over the years to how Facebook defined its hate speech policies. Members of Congress said they were reviewing Facebook's answers.

California Passes Sweeping Law to Protect Online Privacy,"SAN FRANCISCO -- California has passed a digital privacy law granting consumers more control over and insight into the spread of their personal information online, creating one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data-collection practices of technology companies in the United States. The bill raced through the State Legislature without opposition on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, just hours before a deadline to pull from the November ballot an initiative seeking even tougher oversight over technology companies.  The new law grants consumers the right to know what information companies are collecting about them, why they are collecting that data and with whom they are sharing it. It gives consumers the right to tell companies to delete their information as well as to not sell or share their data. Businesses must still give consumers who opt out the same quality of service. It also makes it more difficult to share or sell data on children younger than 16. The legislation, which goes into effect in January 2020, makes it easier for consumers to sue companies after a data breach. And it gives the state's attorney general more authority to fine companies that don't adhere to the new regulations. The California law is not as expansive as Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., a new set of laws restricting how tech companies collect, store and use personal data. But Aleecia M. McDonald, an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in privacy policy, said California's privacy measure was one of the most comprehensive in the United States, since most existing laws -- and there are not many -- do little to limit what companies can do with consumer information. ""It's a step forward, and it should be appreciated as a step forward when it's been a long time since there were any steps,"" Ms. McDonald said. The legislation is modeled closely on the ballot initiative, which a real estate developer, Alastair Mactaggart, spent $3 million and secured more than 600,000 signatures to get certified. With the ballot proposal hanging over legislators' heads, the push for an alternative gained grudging support. If the bill had failed to pass before the deadline, the proponents of the ballot initiative would have taken their case straight to voters in November, they said. The state's technology and business lobbies were opposed to the measure that was passed on Thursday, but they didn't try to derail it because they thought the ballot initiative was worse. Even legislators who voted for the bill complained that they had little choice because a ballot measure would provide less flexibility to make changes in the future. And some privacy advocates said the bill did not go as far as the ballot initiative in allowing individuals to sue for not complying. Mr. Mactaggart said he wanted a sensible privacy law, whether through a ballot measure or the legislative process. He said that the Legislature was the right place to debate such a policy, but that it had been hard to get legislators to address privacy. ""If we didn't have the initiative process in California, we wouldn't be here today,"" Mr. Mactaggart said in an interview. One of the authors of the new law, Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat, tried last year to pass a bill that would have required internet service providers to seek permission from customers before accessing, selling or sharing their browser activity. The bill never made it out of committee -- an example of the influence of telecommunications and technology companies in California. But with the ballot measure looming and a growing awareness of how technology companies are gobbling up user information -- highlighted by revelations that the voter profiling firm Cambridge Analytica gained access to the personal data of millions of Facebook users -- the legislation went from draft to law in one week. ""This is a huge step forward to people all across the country dealing with this very challenging issue,"" State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and a co-author of the bill, said at a news conference after it was signed. The ballot initiative, which would have made it easier for private individuals to sue companies for not adhering to its privacy requirements, had drawn vocal opposition from industry groups that worried about the potential liability risk. The measure included a provision that would have required a 70 percent majority in both houses of the Legislature to approve any changes after it became law. Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each contributed $200,000 to a committee opposing the proposed ballot measure, and lobbyists had estimated that businesses would spend $100 million to campaign against it before the November election. Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon, said in a statement that the new law contained many ""problematic provisions."" But the group did not try to obstruct it, he added, because ""it prevents the even worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California."" Mr. Callahan said the group would ""work to correct the inevitable, negative policy and compliance ramifications this last-minute deal will create."" Legislators said they expected to pass ""cleanup bills"" to make any fixes to the law in the 18 months before it takes effect. Some privacy advocates are worried that lobbyists for business and technology groups will use that time to water it down. Mr. Mactaggart said those concerns are ""overblown."" ""Having gotten this right, it'll be very hard to take it away,"" he said, noting that the ballot measure had been polling at around 80 percent approval. ""They can't rewrite the law.""

Just Don't Call It Privacy; news analysis,"What do you call it when employers use Facebook's advertising platform to show certain job ads only to men or just to people between the ages of 25 and 36 How about when Google collects the whereabouts of its users -- even after they deliberately turn off location history? Or when AT&T shares its mobile customers' locations with data brokers? American policymakers often refer to such issues using a default umbrella term: privacy. That at least is the framework fora Senate Commerce Committee hearing scheduled for this Wednesday titled ""Examining Safeguards for Consumer Data Privacy.""  After a spate of recent data-mining scandals -- including Russian-sponsored ads on Facebook aimed at influencing African-Americans not to vote -- some members of Congress are now rallying behind the idea of a new federal consumer privacy law. At this week's hearing, legislators plan to ask executives from Amazon, AT&T, Google, Twitter and other companies about their privacy policies. Senators also want the companies to explain ""what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation,"" according to the hearing notice. There's just one flaw with this setup. In a surveillance economy where companies track, analyze and capitalize on our clicks, the issue at hand isn't privacy. The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences -- among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination. In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism. ""Congress should not be examining privacy policies,"" Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a prominent digital rights nonprofit, told me last week. ""They should be examining business practices. They should be examining how these firms collect and use the personal data of customers, of internet users."" The Senate Commerce hearing, however, doesn't seem designed to investigate commercial surveillance and influence practices that might merit government oversight. For one thing, only industry executives are currently set to testify. And most of them are lawyers and policy experts, not engineers versed in the mechanics of data-mining algorithms. Companies are sending their ""policy and law folks to Washington to make the government go away -- not the engineering folks who actually understand these systems in depth and can talk through alternatives,"" Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University, told me. That may be because Congress is under industry pressure. California recently passed a new privacy law that would give Californians some power over the data companies' hold on them. Industry groups hope to defang that statute by pushing Congress to pass federal privacy legislation that would overrule state laws. The industry-stacked Senate hearing lineup seems designed to pave the way for that, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland. Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee, said the group planned future hearings that would include other voices, such as consumer groups. But ""for the first hearing,"" Mr. Hill said, ""the committee is bringing in companies most consumers recognize to make the discussion about privacy more relatable."" What is at stake here isn't privacy, the right not to be observed. It's how companies can use our data to invisibly shunt us in directions that may benefit them more than us. Many consumers know that digital services and ad tech companies track and analyze their activities. And they accept, or are at least resigned to, data-mining in exchange for conveniences like customized newsfeeds and ads. But revelations aboutRussian election interference and Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling company that obtained information on millions of Facebook users, have made it clear that data-driven influence campaigns can scale quickly and cause societal harm. And that leads to a larger question: Do we want a future in which companies can freely parse the photos we posted last year, or the location data from the fitness apps we used last week, to infer whether we are stressed or depressed or financially strapped or emotionally vulnerable -- and take advantage of that? ""Say I sound sick when I am talking to Alexa, maybe they would show me medicine as a suggestion on Amazon,"" said Franziska Roesner, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Washington, using a hypothetical example of Amazon's voice assistant. ""What happens when the inferences are wrong?"" (Amazon said it does not use Alexa data for product recommendations or marketing.) It's tough to answer those questions right now when there are often gulfs between the innocuous ways companies explain their data practices to consumers and the details they divulge about their targeting techniques to advertisers. AT&T's privacy policy says the mobile phone and cable TV provider may use third-party data to categorize subscribers, without using their real names, into interest segments and show them ads accordingly. That sounds reasonable enough. Here's what it means in practice: AT&T can find out which subscribers have indigestion -- or at least which ones bought over-the-counter drugs to treat it. In a case study for advertisers, AT&T describes segmenting DirecTV subscribers who bought antacids and then targeting them with ads for the medication. The firm was also able to track those subscribers' spending. Households who saw the antacid ads spent 725 percent moreon the drugs than a national audience. Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company's privacy policy was ""transparent and precise, and describes in plain language how we use information and the choices we give customers."" But consumer advocates hope senators will press AT&T, Amazon and other companies this week to provide more details on their consumer-profiling practices. ""We want an inside look on the analytics and how they're categorizing, ranking, rating and scoring us,"" Professor Citron said. Given the increased public scrutiny, some companies are tweaking their tactics. AT&T recently said it would stop sharing users' location details with data brokers. Facebook said it had stopped allowing advertisers to use sensitive categories, like race or religion, to exclude people from seeing ads. Google created a feature for users to download masses of their data, including a list of all the sites Google has tracked them on. Government officials in Europe are not waiting for companies to police themselves. In May, the European Union introduced a tough new data protection law that curbs some data-mining.  It requires companies to obtain explicit permission from European users before collecting personal details on sensitive subjects like their religion, health or sex life. It gives European users the right to see all of the information companies hold about them -- including any algorithmic scores or inferences.  European users also have the right not to be subject to completely automated decisionsthat could significantly affect them, such as credit algorithms that use a person's data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan. Of course, privacy still matters. But Congress now has an opportunity to press companies like Amazon on broader public issues. It could require them to disclose exactly how they use data extracted from consumers. And it could force companies to give consumers some rights over that data.

A Law to Protect Online Privacy; letter,"To the Editor: Re ""Your Apps Know Where You've Been, and Can't Keep a Secret"" (front page, Dec. 10):  The internet industry believes that we need a modern American approach to privacy that empowers users and gives them more meaningful control over their data. We support a federal privacy law that provides people the ability to access, correct, delete and download their data. Moreover, as the article points out, different approaches can leave consumers confused. A nationwide standard is needed to avoid a patchwork of state rules that will leave consumers less protected. Consumers should be able to understand how the data they provide companies is collected and used, including by offline companies and opaque data brokers. That's why any law needs to apply across the economy. We can't forget how data benefits our daily lives. Data helps us get to work on time with efficient navigation, find the perfect playlist and see the faces of loved ones hundreds of miles away. Americans deserve a federal law that protects their privacy and allows companies to develop products people love.

Internet Hacking Is About to Get Much Worse,"It&#39;s no secret that computers are insecure. Stories like the recent Facebook hack, the Equifax hack and the hacking of government agencies are remarkable for how unremarkable they really are. They might make headlines for a few days, but they&#39;re just the newsworthy tip of a very large iceberg.  The risks are about to get worse, because computers are being embedded into physical devices and will affect lives, not just our data. Security is not a problem the market will solve. The government needs to step in and regulate this increasingly dangerous space. The primary reason computers are insecure is that most buyers aren't willing to pay -- in money, features, or time to market -- for security to be built into the products and services they want. As a result, we are stuck with hackable internet protocols, computers that are riddled with vulnerabilities and networks that are easily penetrated.   We have accepted this tenuous situation because, for a very long time, computer security has mostly been about data. Banking data stored by financial institutions might be important, but nobody dies when it's stolen. Facebook account data might be important, but again, nobody dies when it's stolen. Regardless of how bad these hacks are, it has historically been cheaper to accept the results than to fix the problems. But the nature of how we use computers is changing, and that comes with greater security risks.  Many of today's new computers are not just screens that we stare at, but objects in our world with which we interact. A refrigerator is now a computer that keeps things cold; a car is now a computer with four wheels and an engine. These computers sense us and our environment, and they affect us and our environment. They talk to each other over networks, they are autonomous, and they have physical agency. They drive our cars, pilot our planes, and run our power plants. They control traffic, administer drugs into our bodies, and dispatch emergency services. These connected computers and the network that connects them -- collectively known as ""the internet of things"" -- affect the world in a direct physical manner.  We&#39;ve already seen hacks against robot vacuum cleaners, ransomware that shut down hospitals and denied care to patients, and malware that shut down cars and power plants. These attacks will become more common, and more catastrophic. Computers fail differently than most other machines: It&#39;s not just that they can be attacked remotely -- they can be attacked all at once. It's impossible to take an old refrigerator and infect it with a virus or recruit it into a denial-of-service botnet, and a car without an internet connection simply can't be hacked remotely. But that computer with four wheels and an engine? It -- along with all other cars of the same make and model -- can be made to run off the road, all at the same time.  As the threats increase, our longstanding assumptions about security no longer work. The practice of patching a security vulnerability is a good example of this. Traditionally, we respond to the never-ending stream of computer vulnerabilities by regularly patching our systems, applying updates that fix the insecurities. This fails in low-cost devices, whose manufacturers don't have security teams to write the patches: if you want to update your DVR or webcam for security reasons, you have to throw your old one away and buy a new one. Patching also fails in more expensive devices, and can be quite dangerous. Do we want to allow vulnerable automobiles on the streets and highways during the weeks before a new security patch is written, tested, and distributed? Another failing assumption is the security of our supply chains. We&#39;ve started to see political battles about government-placed vulnerabilities in computers and software from Russia and China. But supply chain security is about more than where the suspect company is located: we need to be concerned about where the chips are made, where the software is written, who the programmers are, and everything else.  Last week, Bloomberg reported that China inserted eavesdropping chips into hardware made for American companies like Amazon and Apple. The tech companies all denied the accuracy of this report, which precisely illustrates the problem. Everyone involved in the production of a computer must be trusted, because any one of them can subvert the security. As everything becomes a computer and those computers become embedded in national-security applications, supply-chain corruption will be impossible to ignore.  These are problems that the market will not fix. Buyers can&#39;t differentiate between secure and insecure products, so sellers prefer to spend their money on features that buyers can see. The complexity of the internet and of our supply chains make it difficult to trace a particular vulnerability to a corresponding harm. The courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities. And, for most companies, it has generally been good business to skimp on security, rather than sell a product that costs more, does less, and is on the market a year later. The solution is complicated, and it's one I devoted my latest book to answering. There are technological challenges, but they're not insurmountable -- the policy issues are far more difficult. We must engage with the future of internet security as a policy issue. Doing so requires a multifaceted approach, one that requires government involvement at every step.  First, we need standards to ensure that unsafe products don't harm others. We need to accept that the internet is global and regulations are local, and design accordingly. These standards will include some prescriptive rules for minimal acceptable security. California just enacted an Internet of Things security law that prohibits default passwords. This is just one of many security holes that need to be closed, but it's a good start. We need to accept that the internet is global and regulations are local, and design accordingly.  We also need our standards to be flexible and easy to adapt to the needs of various companies, organizations, and industries. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework is an excellent example of this, because its recommendations can be tailored to suit the individual needs and risks of organizations. The Cybersecurity Framework -- which contains guidance on how to identify, prevent, recover, and respond to security risks -- is voluntary at this point, which means nobody follows it. Making it mandatory for critical industries would be a great first step. An appropriate next step would be to implement more specific standards for industries like automobiles, medical devices, consumer goods, and critical infrastructure. Second, we need regulatory agencies to penalize companies with bad security, and a robust liability regime. The Federal Trade Commission is starting to do this, but it can do much more. It needs to make the cost of insecurity greater than the cost of security, which means that fines have to be substantial. The European Union is leading the way in this regard: they've passed a comprehensive privacy law, and are now turning to security and safety. The United States can and should do the same.  We need to ensure that companies are held accountable for their products and services, and that those affected by insecurity can recover damages. Traditionally, United States courts have declined to enforce liabilities for software vulnerabilities, and those affected by data breaches have been unable to prove specific harm. Here, we need statutory damages -- harms spelled out in the law that don't require any further proof. Finally, we need to make it an overarching policy that security takes precedence over everything else. The internet is used globally, by everyone, and any improvements we make to security will necessarily help those we might prefer remain insecure: criminals, terrorists, rival governments. Here, we have no choice. The security we gain from making our computers less vulnerable far outweighs any security we might gain from leaving insecurities that we can exploit. Regulation is inevitable. Our choice is no longer between government regulation and no government regulation, but between smart government regulation and ill-advised government regulation. Government regulation is not something to fear. Regulation doesn't stifle innovation, and I suspect that well-written regulation will spur innovation by creating a market for security technologies.  No industry has significantly improved the security or safety of its products without the government stepping in to help. Cars, airplanes, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, food, medical devices, workplaces, restaurants, and, most recently, financial products -- all needed government regulation in order to become safe and secure. Getting internet safety and security right will depend on people: people who are willing to take the time and expense to do the right things; people who are determined to put the best possible law and policy into place. The internet is constantly growing and evolving; we still have time for our security to adapt, but we need to act quickly, before the next disaster strikes. It's time for the government to jump in and help. Not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, not when the next big technology company or government agency is hacked, but now.

"Failed by Facebook, We'll Return to the Scene of the Crime. We Always Do.; DealBook","As Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder, begins two days of testimony on Capitol Hill, where he will undoubtedly face withering criticism over his site's handling of user data, millions of people will spend the day the way they always do: scrolling through their News Feeds, sending each other messages and ""liking"" posts, oblivious to any privacy concerns. The reality is that when it comes to privacy, the trade-off has already been made: We decided long ago to give away our personal information in exchange for free content and the ability to interact seamlessly with others. With the latest disclosure about Facebook's data missteps -- that the personal information of some 87 million users had been improperly harvested and shared with a British analytics firm -- politicians can scream from the rooftops about privacy, and they should. But the public has proved over and over again that it doesn't care.  The evidence is all too clear: After just about every big privacy hack over the past decade, people quickly returned to the scene of the crime, using the same store or online site that had been compromised. Remember the massive breaches at Home Depot, Target and Yahoo? The number of consumers who never went back is minuscule. Perhaps Facebook's latest privacy scandal -- combined with its role in the spread of false news and in foreign interference in United States elections -- will be a turning point in consumer behavior. But if history is any guide, we won't do anything differently, unless regulators take steps to save us from ourselves. For all the head-scratching and criticism over Facebook's slow response to various breaches and privacy fiascos, it wasn't completely irrational. The incentive for companies to go to great lengths to protect our data -- with the exception of banks and financial firms -- just isn't there. Benjamin Dean, the president of Iconoclast Tech, a technology consulting firm, and a former fellow in cybersecurity and internet governance at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, has studied some of the biggest data hacks, poring over companies' financial records before and after a breach. The financial pain they experienced was small, he found. ""The actual expenses from the recent and high-profile breaches at Sony, Target and Home Depot amount to less than 1 percent of each company's annual revenues,'' he wrote in a 2015 article titled ""Why Companies Have Little Incentive to Invest in Cybersecurity.'' ""After reimbursement from insurance and minus tax deductions, the losses are even less."" When Google first introduced Gmail in 2004, this newspaper raised questions about the prospect of users objecting to a service that displayed advertising to them based on the content of their email: ""For many, the bottom line appears to be that sifting through personal email with an eye toward making a sale is beyond the pale."" Well, now more than 1.2 billion people have active accounts with Gmail, a service that until the end of last yearsifted through your private messages. Apparently, it wasn't beyond the pale. For consumers, the transaction has always been pretty clear: The convenience of free service in exchange for information that allowed advertisers to specifically target us. The distinction in that equation was motivation; we figured our data was being used by benign companies seeking to sell us that pair of sneakers we wanted, not by bad actors trying to influence our political votes -- or incite violence in places like in Myanmar. None of this is to suggest that Facebook handled these situations properly; it clearly did not. And over the past week, Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly said as much to just about anyone who would listen. The problem is that Mr. Zuckerberg has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his ""community."" And guess what? After each mea culpa, the Facebook community has grown. Notwithstanding the #DeleteFacebook campaign, the only way companies are going to change the way they protect our data is if users abandon them -- or if regulators step in. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to behavioral change -- besides our insatiable desire for all things ""free"" -- is that it is unusual for most consumers to truly feel the effects of a massive data breach. For most people, it's a theoretical problem -- the way some people view climate change or the growing national debt. The people who are most directly affected by privacy breaches are those who have had money stolen or whose email was exposed. But in huge data breaches, those people are a statistical anomaly. Amy Pascal, the former of top film executive at Sony Pictures, has an authentic claim to being a victim of a data breach; she suffered national embarrassment when her emails were revealed, and she later lost her job. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman in 2016, also had his email compromised, to deleterious effect. But most people don't feel it. Over the weekend, I asked users on Twitter whether they had deleted their Facebook accounts or reduced their activity on it. Nearly 700 users replied. For every one saying they were spurning Facebook, there were more saying they were continuing to use it. ""Understand nothing in social media is truly private and recognize that in most areas of life someone is trying to sell you something or affect your behavior,"" one user wrote. Another wrote: ""People love the service they get from Facebook but forget nothing is free. We pay for using it by providing our demographic and personal information so that they can sell ads to businesses to better understand and target us. We benefit by getting more relevant ads sent to us."" And while a number of people said they were distancing themselves from Facebook, they cited not only privacy concerns but said the service had become less relevant to them. In 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg was asked about privacy during an interview. His answer reflected where we are right now. ""People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information -- and different kinds -- but more openly with more people,'' he said. ""And that social norm is just something that's evolved over time. And we view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and updating what our system is, to reflect what the current social norms are."" Unless our social norms change, Facebook and other sites probably won't, either.

Boeing Possibly Hit by 'WannaCry' Malware Attack,"Boeing said on Wednesday that it was hit by a cyberattack that some Boeing executives identified as the same WannaCry computer virus that struck thousands of computer systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  In an internal memo, Mike VanderWel, chief engineer of Boeing Commercial Airplane production engineering, said the attack was ""metastasizing"" and he worried it could spread to Boeing's production systems and airline software. ""We are on a call with just about every VP in Boeing,"" Mr. VanderWel wrote. The memo called for ""All hands on deck."" WannaCry is a particularly vicious form of what is known as ransomware -- malware that locks up victims' computers and data with encryption, until attackers' extortion demands are met, often in the form of the virtual currency Bitcoin. Even for victims who agree to pay, decryption is not always guaranteed. The City of Atlanta was hit with a different form of ransomware last week and was still reeling from the fallout on Wednesday. In a statement Wednesday evening, Boeing played down the attack and said it was limited in scope and that it had not affected the company's production lines. ""A number of articles on a malware disruption are overstated and inaccurate,"" Boeing's statement said. ""Our cybersecurity operations center detected a limited intrusion of malware that affected a small number of systems. Remediations were applied and this is not a production or delivery issue."" Charles Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, declined to elaborate or confirm whether the attack was indeed WannaCry, the computer virus United States officials officially blamed on North Korea last December. What made WannaCry so much more destructive, security experts discovered during last year's outbreak, was that it employed an automated tool that was first developed at the National Security Agency and later dumped online in 2016 by mysterious hackers called the ""Shadow Brokers."" That tool, which the N.S.A. code-named Eternal Blue, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software that allowed attackers to spread their malware automatically through vulnerable machines. In other cases, ransomware attackers had to manually encrypt victim's systems. By incorporating the N.S.A.'s tool into their ransomware last May, hackers ensured their attack would encrypt as many vulnerable machines as possible, causing maximum disruption. White House officials said North Korea was ""directly responsible"" for the attack. The WannaCry attacks paralyzed computers and business operations in more than 74 countries, forcing Britain's public health system to turn patients away and freezing computers at government agencies in Russia and FedEx in the United States, in what was the largest known ransomware assault. Microsoft offered an emergency ""patch"" that effectively neutralized the vulnerability WannaCry's attackers used to spread, but unpatched systems remain vulnerable.

Tech Giants Await Change On Privacy In Europe,"Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @sheeraf SAN FRANCISCO -- Over the past two months, Google has started letting people around the world choose what data they want to share with its various products, including Gmail and Google Docs. Amazon recently began improving the data encryption on its cloud storage service and simplified an agreement with customers over how it processes their information.    And on Sunday, Facebook rolled out a new global data privacy center -- a single page that allows users to organize who sees their posts and what types of ads they are served.   While these changes are rippling out worldwide, a major reason for these shifts comes from Europe: The tech giants are preparing for a stringent new set of data privacy rules in the region, called the General Data Protection Regulation.    Set to take effect on May 25, the regulations restrict what types of personal data the tech companies can collect, store and use across the 28-member European Union. Among their provisions, the rules enshrine the so-called right to be forgotten into European law so people can ask companies to remove certain online data about them. The rules also require anyone under 16 to obtain parental consent before using popular digital services. If companies do not comply, they could face fines totaling 4 percent of their annual revenue.   With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley's tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules.   ''Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,'' said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. ''G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.''   The rush of activity is a reminder of how Europe has set the regulatory standard in reining in the immense power of tech giants, while other places -- including the United States -- have largely taken a noninterventionist stance. The G.D.P.R. rules were approved in late 2015 after tech companies like Facebook ran into problems over data protection with national privacy watchdogs in various European countries.   European officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back.   ''There has not been any pushback from American companies,'' said VÄ[#x203a]ra JourovÃ¡, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. ''If anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation.''   Officials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards.   The coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google's director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. ''When G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,'' he said.   The biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation's mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services -- from Gmail to its Cloud storage services -- to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone's data.   ''For a company with infrastructure of our size, it takes a lot of work,'' Mr. Golan said.   Facebook has also taken multiple steps to deal with the coming rules. On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week.   The new privacy center would give Facebook a ''very good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,'' Ms. Sandberg said.   Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said the social network has also held a series of ''Design Jams'' where it invites designers and engineers to reimagine how products look so that people can more easily see and control their online data.   With the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws.   Last November, for instance, the company unveiled a program that uses artificial intelligence to monitor Facebook users for signs of self-harm. But it did not open the program to users in Europe, where the company would have had to ask people for permission to access sensitive health data, including about their mental state. The social network has also kept out of Europe facial recognition software that tracks when photos of users are posted across the platform.   Amazon, too, has made changes. Last April, the company wrote a blog post  outlining its efforts to comply with the new European regulations. The internet retailer said it would strengthen the encryption around the data it stores on its cloud storage services, and reaffirmed the rights of customers to choose which region -- Europe or otherwise -- where they want their data stored. Amazon declined to discuss the work.   Some American tech companies said they welcomed the new data protection rules.   ''We embrace G.D.P.R. because it sets a strong standard for privacy and data protection rights, which is at the core of our business,'' Julie Brill, a corporate vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft, said in an interview. ''We began work on G.D.P.R. as soon as it was adopted by the European Union. Our preparations for G.D.P.R. touch every part of our company.''   How the biggest tech companies handle the regulations will most likely influence their smaller counterparts. Angelo Spenillo, general counsel for Siteimprove, which helps companies manage their presence online, said many little tech companies have been looking toward Google and Facebook for how user privacy and data will be managed online.   ''Where the bigger companies go, the smaller companies will follow suit,'' he said. ''We're going to see real changes across the board.''   Ms. JourovÃ¡ said as the new rules take effect, countries outside Europe could begin demanding similar data protection measures for their citizens.   ''There will be a moment, especially as more and more people in the U.S. find themselves uncomfortable with the channels monitoring their private lives,'' she said.    "
Facebook Hack Puts Thousands of Other Sites at Risk,"SAN FRANCISCO -- When Mark Zuckerberg introduced an online tool called Facebook Connect in 2008, he hailed it as a kind of digital passport to the rest of the internet. In just a few clicks, users would be able to log in to other apps and sites with their Facebook passwords. The tool was adopted by thousands of other firms, from mom-and-pop publishing companies to high-profile tech outfits like Airbnb and Uber. Now those outfits could have been exposed to the consequences of an attack on Facebook's computer systems. On Friday, the company said the account entry keys of at least 50 million Facebook users had been stolen in the largest hack in the company's 14-year history.  But the impact could be significantly bigger since those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company -- trusted by so many -- fail. ""Just the sheer fact that this exists will magnify the scale of any hack,"" said Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In Europe, where tough new data privacy regulations went into effect in May, the authorities are preparing an investigation of the Facebook breach. Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for overseeing Facebook in the region, said it was gathering information and establishing the scope of its inquiry. Tinder, the dating app, has found no evidence that accounts have been breached, based on the ""limited information Facebook has provided,"" Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Tinder and its parent company, the Match Group, said in a statement. Tinder, as well as other Match Group apps, rely on Facebook Connect as a method of logging in. Ms. Sacco added that Facebook could do more to help by providing a specific list of users hit by the attack. Over the past decade, Facebook has sold outside companies on Facebook Connect with a simple proposition: Connect to our platform, and we'll make it faster and easier for people to use your apps. The Connect tool was about achieving ubiquity. Users would be more apt to sign up for new apps and sites if doing so was easier, Facebook argued. It also brought an added measure of security, since users wouldn't need to create and remember new passwords every time they signed up for a new app. But in July 2017, that measure of security fell short. By exploiting three software bugs, attackers forged ""access tokens,"" digital keys used to gain entry to a user's account. From there, the hackers were able to do anything users could do on their own Facebook accounts, including logging in to third-party apps. In a blog post on Tuesday evening, Facebook said a continuing investigation of the close to 50 million accounts that were compromised ""has so far found no evidence that the attackers accessed any apps using Facebook Login."" But there are still questions about an additional 40 million Facebook accounts that may have been affected. Facebook forced those 40 million users to log out and reauthenticate their credentials. It was unclear whether these accounts used Facebook to connect to outside apps. Citing ""an abundance of caution,"" Facebook said it was building a tool to help outside developers identify users who were affected in the hack by pinpointing potentially compromised accounts on their services. In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Facebook said it had not assessed the scope of the breach, nor did the company discover who was responsible for the attack. The Facebook breach is reminiscent of a catastrophic attack on Yahoo that was disclosed in 2016. Yahoo said attackers had gotten access to the company's code and used it to forge 32 million access tokens like those stolen from Facebook. Hackers often target large databases of credentials, which can provide access to other accounts if users created the same password for multiple sites or have logged in to third-party accounts with their Facebook account. Since Friday, Facebook has held calls with developers at other companies to explain steps they can take to assess the damage at their own organizations. The security team at Uber, the ride-hailing giant, is logging some users out of their accounts to be cautious, said Melanie Ensign, a spokeswoman for Uber. It is asking them to log back in -- a preventive measure that would invalidate older, stolen access tokens. Uber has reviewed its login data from the past year and hasn't found any indications that Facebook credentials were used improperly. ""But we still have to go through the investigation,"" Ms. Ensign said. ""For those that are most at risk, we have logged them out, so they'll have to log back in to the account."" Facebook faces fallout from regulators both at home and abroad. On Friday, Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, both Democrats, used the occasion to renew their calls for legislation reining in large tech companies. The European Union's probe will be an early test of its new data-protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation. The law allows Facebook to be fined up to 4 percent of its global revenue, though many consider such an outcome unlikely. ""G.D.P.R. was designed to address the big tech giants, who are enormous, have huge resources and do very complicated things with personal data,"" said James Castro-Edwards, the head of the data-protection practice at the London law firm Wedlake Bell. ""This is the sort of battle that G.D.P.R. was drafted to be used in."" As Facebook's power has grown, some outside companies have become wary of relying on it too much. While Tinder originally relied exclusively on the Facebook login for several years, the dating company last year introduced a way for people to create new accounts without using Facebook. Since then, fewer than 25 percent of new users sign up for Tinder using Facebook Connect. Similarly, Netflix stopped allowing users to connect using their Facebook accounts three years ago, and new customers must create user names and passwords when they sign up. But for the thousands of other companies that rely on Facebook to serve customers, it is unclear whether or not they will know the extent of the damage. ""So many websites support Facebook login, and it was vulnerable for so long that it's hard to give an idea of the scope of this attack,"" Mr. Polakis said.

Hackers Stole Data From Millions of Cards at Saks,"Saks has been hacked -- adding to the already formidable challenges faced by the luxury retailer. A well-known ring of cybercriminals has obtained more than five million credit and debit card numbers from customers of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, according to a cybersecurity research firm that specializes in tracking stolen financial data. The data, the firm said, appears to have been stolen using software that was implanted into the cash register systems at the stores and that siphoned card numbers until last month.    The Hudson's Bay Company, the Canadian corporation that owns both retail chains, confirmed on Sunday that a breach had occurred.    ''We have become aware of a data security issue involving customer payment card data at certain Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th and Lord & Taylor stores in North America,'' the company said in a statement. ''We have identified the issue, and have taken steps to contain it. Once we have more clarity around the facts, we will notify our customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring.''   Hudson's Bay said that its investigation was continuing but that its e-commerce platforms appeared to have been unaffected by the breach. The company declined to identify how many customer accounts or stores were affected.   The theft is one of the largest known breaches of a retailer and shows just how difficult it is to secure credit-card transaction systems despite the lessons learned from other large data breaches, including the theft of 40 million card numbers from Target in 2013 and 56 million card numbers from Home Depot in 2014. Last year, Equifax, a credit reporting firm, disclosed that sensitive financial information on 145.5 million Americans had been exposed in a breach of the company's systems.   The research firm that identified the Saks breach, Gemini Advisory, said on Sunday that a group of Russian-speaking hackers known as Fin7 or JokerStash posted online on Wednesday that it had obtained a cache of five million stolen card numbers, which the thieves called BIGBADABOOM-2. The hackers, who have also hit other retail chains, offered 125,000 of the records for immediate sale.   Fin7 did not disclose where the numbers had been obtained. But the researchers, working in conjunction with banks, analyzed a sample of the records and determined that the card numbers all seemed to have been used at Saks and Lord & Taylor stores, mostly in New York and New Jersey, from May 2017 to March 2018.   Although it's unclear exactly how the malware was installed in the stores' checkout systems, Gemini said it was most likely through phishing emails sent to Hudson's Bay employees. In a phishing attack, hackers send seemingly legitimate emails to a company's employees that encourage them to click on a link or attached file that secretly installs software on their computers, giving the attackers a back door into the systems.   The breach comes at a difficult time for Saks and Lord & Taylor, and retailers more generally.   Online shopping has cut deeply into the traditional brick-and-mortar retail industry, and department stores have been particularly slow to adapt to the new ways that people shop.   Chains that cater to a spectrum of income levels and affluence have seen their sales dwindle. The once-mighty Macy's has closed stores and laid off thousands of employees. Neiman Marcus, a high-end brand, was at one point mulling a merger with Hudson's Bay. And last year, Lord & Taylor, a jewel of luxury shopping in the Hudson's Bay portfolio, sold its 676,000-square-foot flagship Manhattan location, the latest retail titan to acknowledge that much of its value now comes simply from the physical buildings where shoppers once flocked.   As digital forces reshape the retail industry, Hudson's Bay executives have watched the company's stock plummet in recent years. Comparable store sales -- one important measure of performance -- dropped 2.6 percent in its department stores group in the most recent quarter.   In October, Hudson's Bay announced that its chief executive, Gerald L. Storch, would step down, a departure that shook up the top ranks just ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. Helena Foulkes, a veteran of the pharmacy giant CVS Health Corporation, was appointed to the position in February.   Hudson's Bay said customers could get further information on dedicated pages on the websites of Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th and Lord & Taylor.

Data Breaches Keep Happening. So Why Don't You Do Something?,"Last year was a banner year for the exposure of personal information, and so far this year there has been a steady drumbeat of data breaches, so many that experts worry that people are just throwing up their hands in defeat. Timehop, an app that collects old photos and posts from social media, disclosed a breach in July that affected 21 million of its users. Names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses were among the identifiable details that were leaked.  Under Armour revealed a data breach in March of 150 million accounts on its food and nutrition app MyFitnessPal; the genealogy site MyHeritage announced one in June affecting 92 million users, and 340 million individual records held by the marketing firm Exactis were exposed that month on a publicly accessible server. In one of the most jaw-dropping cases, Yahoo last year updated figures to reveal that an attack in 2013 had affected all three billion of its user accounts, up from a previous estimate of one billion. Experts caution that the stream of news about such breaches can set a new normal and instill a sense of fatalism -- and complacency -- in consumers. Anthony Vance, an associate professor and director of the Center for Cybersecurity at the Fox School of Business at Temple University, said last year's breach of information held by the credit reporting company Equifax, which affected 145 million Americans, was ""a game-changer."" The information gleaned could be used to fraudulently open new credit accounts, he said, adding, ""That should give even the most jaded American consumer pause and prompt them to do something."" But evidence suggests that high-profile breaches don't typically change consumers' behavior. A Pew Research Center study found most Americans keep track of their passwords by memorizing or writing them down, with only 12 percent using a password manager, which can generate hard-to-crack passwords. A RAND Corporation report in 2016 said only 4 percent of people started using password managers after being notified that their data was exposed in a breach, Mr. Vance said. And an experiment conducted by Mr. Vance and other researchers found a disconnect between consumers' professed concerns about online security and their actions. In the experiment, people using their personal computers to complete an assigned task tended to ignore warnings that some sites they were about to visit were not secure. He said consumers may be told the same advice repeatedly but are slow to respond unless they've already had a bad experience. Only then does this ""once bitten, twice shy"" lesson sink in. ""You're not going to back up data, no matter what I tell you, until you lose the baby pictures of your first child,"" Mr. Vance said. ""Sometimes it takes an incident to internalize behavior. It's so easy to get inured."" Experts call this behavior ""breach fatigue."" Steven Andrés, who teaches at the Fowler College of Business and homeland security program at San Diego State University, said it would be reasonable to think consumers would be more diligent after heavily publicized breaches, but some research indicates just the opposite. ""We may adjust to this being the 'new normal,'"" he said, adding that ""digital natives and younger generations may perceive their personal data -- in a distorted sense -- to never have been private, so what's the big deal with it leaking out on the web anyway?"" A ""recency bias"" leads consumers to believe that as a breach recedes in the headlines, it becomes less threatening, Mr. Vance said. However, the data in the Equifax breach does not have a half-life and could be used for nefarious purposes at any point. Blame human nature. Anticipated danger can easily be ""deflected, deferred or declined"" because it makes us feel anxious and stressed, said James Norrie, dean of the Graham School of Business at York College of Pennsylvania and a cybersecurity expert. People also tend to have unrealistically optimistic outlooks about future events and believe that bad things will happen to someone else, experts said. ""There's not going to be a magic bullet,"" said Vinny Troia, chief executive and principal security consultant of Night Lion Security and an expert in network security. ""It's the same things we've been saying over and over again."" Consumers will be best served if they heed this familiar advice: Don't reuse passwords, rely on two-factor verification, install software only from trusted sources, question any alert that pops up on your screen and get a password manager. ""We are not living in a bubble per se, but instead we are underestimating the security of our data,"" said Gilbert E. Franco, an assistant professor of psychology at Beacon College in Leesburg, Fla. ""Much like a teenager underestimates the risks they take, we as a society are still in our adolescent years when it comes to the internet.""

Amid a spate of high-profile leaks of personal information, consumers are growing numb to them and complacent about their security, experts say.

Manufacturers Remain Slow to Recognize Cybersecurity Risks,"They have names like Notpetya, Samsam and perhaps the most cynically namedWannaCry. These are just some of the most recent cyberattacks that have not only affected financial institutions, retailers and shipping companies but have also plagued manufacturers, like Merck &amp; Company, the pharmaceutical firm, and the snack company Mondelez International. Whether they come from ransomware, phishing or more arcane, highly sophisticated means, manufacturers are increasingly vulnerable to attacks that can shut down production and have ramifications throughout a supply chain. And it is not just the giants that get hacked; external threats can be agnostic, affecting manufacturers regardless of size.  Thomas Siebel, the chairman and chief executive of C3, an artificial intelligence platform based in Redwood City, Calif., and the founder of Siebel Systems, puts it more bluntly, ""Manufacturers are sloppy when it comes to cybersecurity."" The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company learned that the hard way in August. A third-party vendor shipped software to the chip maker without pre-screening it. An engineer at Taiwan Semiconductor failed to scan the software, which was infected with the WannaCry ransomware, installed it and then connected it to the company's operating system. The undetected virusthen spread. The chief executive, C.C. Wei, speaking at a news conference at the time, rejected rumors of hacking. Instead, he acknowledged, it was ""purely our own act of negligence."" But the company was lucky. A full recovery took only a few days, and while initially it seemed that third-quarter revenue would be off by 2 percent, Elizabeth Sun, a company spokeswoman, said in an email that the revenues did not suffer because Taiwan Semiconductor fulfilled some of the delayed orders, while ""increases in demand in other areas"" helped to offset the losses. Mondelez International and Merck suffered much more significant losses after the 2017 Notpetya attack, although they described them differently in filings. In its annual report for 2017 filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mondelez stated that the ""malware affected a significant portion of our global sales, distribution and financial networks."" The net revenue loss, the company said, was less than 1 percent of the company's global net revenues of $25.9 billion. That still amounts to $103.6 million. In addition, the company incurred ""incremental expenses of $84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort."" Merck, in its S.E.C. filings, stated that the attack ""led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations."" The fallout was significant: a $260 million loss in sales for 2017 with an expected additional loss for 2018 of $200 million. The total costsfor expenses and remediation are $285 million, a net amount after insurance. Unlike Taiwan Semiconductor, neither Merck nor Mondelez described how the malware infected their operations. Boeingwas said to have been attacked by WannaCry as well in March, but the company downplayed the hacking. While manufacturers weren't traditionally at risk when hackers sought troves of individual data that could be sold for financial gain, motives have become more complex. Some using ransomware hope to extort money -- sometimes in the form of cryptocurrencies -- from companies whose systems are shut down. Others seek to steal intellectual property -- a host of trade secrets including patent information and formulas, as well as blueprints and schematics. And last year's NotPetya attack, which overall inflicted more than $1 billion in damage worldwide, was linked to the Russian military, the C.I.A. found. Irrespective of method or motive, the costs can be high, whether resulting from the ransom demands or the ensuing business disruption. Michael Tanenbaum an executive vice president of insurer Chubb, said attacks ""have gone from being a nuisance to significant, with some demands exceeding seven figures."" Apart from the disruption to business, public companies that are hacked may also face scrutiny by the S.E.C. for failure to have a sufficient system of internal accounting controls, theagency warned in October. It doesn't need to be that way, Mr. Siebel said. ""It's amazing what you can do with off-the-shelf cybersecurity products. Ninety percent of penetration can be stopped with fundamental practices that most people aren't following, like employee training, two-factor authorization, changing passwords and fixing USB ports so they can't download."" The vulnerabilities run from the mundane to the high-tech. Despite training and repeated warnings, employees still open phishing emails that can disrupt a company. Mr. Tanenbaum said that, according to a Chubb index, 50 percent of manufacturing losses in 2018 had resulted from phishing attacks or those known as ""spear phishing,"" which used some specific information to trick the recipient. ""It means that individuals are clicking on links more readily in manufacturing than other industries,"" he said. ""This can cause real harm."" But there's much more. A manufacturer's exposure exists throughout a facility. Rare is the employee who punches a clock at the beginning of the day; instead, workers log in with passwords or biometrics. The vulnerabilities can be surprisingly simple and can emanate even from outdated equipment. John Reed Stark, president of John Reed Stark Consulting, a cybersecurity advisory firm, said a company, could, for example, have an old printer remain on a network even if it's not used. A hacker could, through a phishing scheme, pick up the administrative passwords and then gain network access through the obsolete, but still connected printer. ""And it can be difficult to know exactly what's been exfiltrated -- or stolen -- from the network."" That was the vulnerability with the Notpetya attack -- outdated Windows XP for which there hadn't been updated security. While Microsoft did release a so-called patch to fix the problem, other outdated technologies still in use can result in exposure. So-called ntracontrol systems can connect aging as well as newer equipment, and frequently it's difficult to shut some down without disrupting production. But if a manufacturer doesn't take equipment offline to update security, there's a risk that a ransomware attack, for example, could take an entire production line down, Mr. Tanenbaum explained. The growth of the Internet of Things -- the direct connecting and communicating of disparate pieces of equipment -- makes the potential for abuse even worse. While it is not yet considered an immediate concern, as hackers develop more sophisticated methods, the exposure could grow exponentially. ""Manufacturing equipment is getting smarter, and we're now moving into the information technology world in the manufacturing space,"" said Manesh Patel, the senior vice president and chief information officer of the Sanmina Corporation, a Fortune 500 maker of optical, electronic and mechanical products based in San Jose, Calif. Many I.T. organizations, he added, focus on operations such as human resources, but still aren't as well connected to the manufacturing side of the business. MForesight an independent, nonprofit manufacturing consortium focused on ""technology, policy and the work force"" has sounded the alarm and among other recommendations, suggests establishing organizations to ""facilitate fault-free, anonymous sharing of incidents, threats, vulnerabilities, best practices and solutions."" The group also suggests developing a ""comprehensive framework specifically for manufacturing supply chain cybersecurity, similar to existing frameworks on cybersecurity and cyberphysical security."" While comparing information seems at odds with companies that often compete, Mr. Patel, for one, stressed the importance of superior cybersecurity measures over a perceived competitive advantage. Mr. Patel, who said his company's investment in cybersecurity measures has ""increased 100 percent over the past three years,"" also recommended segmenting, which means keeping systems on a network separate from each other. This can permit vendors to regularly update its equipment without having access to other parts of the system. Segmenting, he explained, secures a network so that it is not exposed to a potential breach from the vendor. It's a relatively new area and if done incorrectly, can cause its own headaches. ""We're at the early stages of getting the grips of it."" Mr. Siebel has also asked known hackers to test his system by trying to infiltrate it. ""We have hackers beating up our systems, and so far only one guy has gotten through, and we paid him a reward. He found a vulnerability, and we fixed it. Another approach is to adopt something called whitelisting. For years, Mr. Patel said, most companies had software that excluded known viruses, essentially blacklisting potential problems. But that was too reactive and sometimes exposed systems to unknown attackers. Now, he said, the better approach is to whitelist -- that is specify approved software applications that are permitted to be active on a computer system. ""It's increasingly become one of the most important types of defenses."" Manufacturers also need to know the precautions that others -- whether suppliers or customers -- are taking, especially as they have increased access to equipment. ""You are only as strong as your weakest link,"" Mr. Stark said. ""Hackers will find that weakest link and can break in and attack others in the supply chain. Companies are connected in ways that are extremely complex, and anyone in the supply chain can be vulnerable and could be the source of an attack.""

"Alexa, What Happened to My Car?","Amazon's Alexa voice-controlled virtual assistant is the Chatty Cathy of the tech world, a digital darling that consumers can't get enough of. It can tell chicken jokes, order pizza and turn off the kitchen faucet. So it's not surprising that Alexa has made the leap from the home to the car. But just as Alexa promises added hands-free convenience for drivers, researchers and engineers warn that it also opens new avenues for hacking, tracking and sonic attacks. Depending on how voice-activated assistants are connected, such hacks could range from annoying pranks like opening a car's windows in the rain to dangerous attacks like remotely unlocking a house's doors for a robbery.    ''As we make everything smarter and more connected,'' said Nadir Izrael, chief technology officer of the internet security firm Armis, ''we end up creating a huge attack surface on devices, like cars, that weren't intended.''    Last year, Armis discovered one such vulnerability -- known as BlueBorne -- that exposed billions of connected devices, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home smart speakers, to the possibility of being hijacked by hackers. Cars with Bluetooth were also vulnerable.   Cars are a highly lucrative target, said Yoni Heilbronn, chief marketing officer at Argus Cyber Security, which the automotive systems supplier Continental recently acquired. ''People are inside these vehicles moving at high speeds, and cars cost a significant amount of money. So how many Bitcoins would you pay a ransomware hacker?''   Navigation systems already recognize -- often imperfectly -- drivers' voices, and many cars have their own speech-recognition features. Connect a smartphone to a car's infotainment system, and a driver can have access to features including Apple's Siri or Google's Assistant.   But in those cases, voice commands are limited. They can't remotely start a car or open its windows. Siri can't even change the radio station.   Alexa, on the other hand, is intended -- via specific, preprogrammed commands -- to interact with thousands of connected devices, performing tasks like turning on lights, opening door locks, disabling home security systems or even ordering a year's supply of toilet paper. And it's already connecting living rooms to cars.   Automakers ranging from BMW, Ford, Hyundai and Nissan to start-ups like Byton have tapped into Alexa's appeal. Although voice assistants are increasingly becoming intertwined with new models, including those from Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, most current Alexa car skills are strictly one-way, from the home to the car, and use existing automotive smartphone applications.   ''Alexa piggybacks on our app,'' said Denise Barfuss, a senior manager for connected services at Nissan. ''So if it's 25 degrees outside, you can just tell Alexa to start the car'' from inside your house to warm it up, she said.   Simple Alexa commands can flash the lights or honk the horn, Ms. Barfuss said, but remote instructions that alter the state of the car -- such as locking the doors and starting the engine -- also require a spoken PIN code.   And even though voice bots like Alexa and Google's Assistant can be taught to recognize different voices -- well enough to cater to each family member's favored Pandora stations, for example -- they do not offer any sort of biometric security, such as voice print analysis. As a result, Alexa's voice-recognition capabilities are not discerning enough for security purposes, according to Amazon. (A company spokesman noted, however, that Amazon had special teams dedicated to continually reviewing and updating the security of its software.)   Without such measures, anyone who eavesdropped on a spoken PIN command could use it to unlock and get into a vehicle, leaving a victim to ask, ''Alexa, what happened to my car?''   Security experts are also concerned about more sophisticated cyberattacks involving voice assistants.   ''There are synthetic voice sound clips,'' said Gang Wang, assistant professor at Virginia Tech's College of Engineering. ''It sounds like random noise to us, but to the machine it sounds like a specific command.'' So a seemingly innocuous sound, like an explosion in a YouTube video played on a nearby TV or tablet, could contain secret instructions.   Other hacks have included ultrasonic commands that are beyond the range of human hearing but understood by voice bots. And even if they do establish biometric security features, Mr. Wang said, regenerative machine learning could use a recording of a person's voice to synthesize new commands that could fool them.   The safety and security concerns become more challenging when tools like Alexa are used to make car-to-home connections. While cruising down I-95, a driver can open a garage door back at home or shut off the living room lights, for example. Ford already offers such car-to-home capabilities that, using its Ford+Alexa app, can tap into some 25,000 Alexa skills in vehicles that have the company's Sync 3 in-dash system. Ford has also added a new feature that allows the driver to forgo the push-to-talk button and trigger Alexa by uttering a wake-up phrase.   Such convenience does allow for the possibility that restive children could prank Alexa from the back seat simply by calling out for, say, Rick Astley songs. Timur Pulathaneli, Ford's supervisor of connected vehicles and services, said that if it proved to be a nuisance, drivers could turn the feature off in the app so that Alexa would respond only after a button was pushed on the steering wheel.   Ford's setup also limits what a car thief or a parking attendant can do behind the wheel. A person wouldn't automatically be able to unlock a home's front door from the car because such functions work only in conjunction with the owner's smartphone (which they'd have to steal, too).   Adding voice assistants to vehicles may make cars seem like just another device on the so-called Internet of Things, but it raises the stakes significantly.   ''What gets added with the car is your specific location,'' Mr. Wang said. ''You can track where the car goes and at what times.''   If compromised, Alexa could provide a criminal with details about a user's purchases, driving habits and travel routines. And to make it easier to connect different smart devices, Alexa can scan for compatible gadgets. All that information is sent back to Amazon's servers and then shared with other companies, Travis Witteveen, chief executive of the security firm Avira, pointed out. The sharing of such information increases the system's -- and the car's -- security vulnerabilities.   Nevertheless, the conveniences that digital assistants offer may make them an ineluctable part of the next generation of cars. Nuance, a leading speech-recognition company involved in the automotive business, is already working on voice systems for cars that would be even easier to use. Eric Montague, Nuance's senior director of product marketing and strategy, said the company would introduce a system this year that did not require the driver to use a wake-up word or push a button to talk.   Ultimately, the car will simply understand when it's being spoken to.   ''People will expect to be able to have a conversation with their car,'' said Martyn Humphries, a vice president at NXP, whose sensors are used extensively in automotive applications. ''So security is going to have to continue to evolve with it.''    "
"Malware, Possibly 'WannaCry,' Strikes Computers at Boeing","Follow Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @nicoleperlroth Boeing said on Wednesday that it was hit by a cyberattack that some Boeing executives identified as the same WannaCry computer virus that struck thousands of computer systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year.  In an internal memo, Mike VanderWel, chief engineer of Boeing Commercial Airplane production engineering, said the attack was ''metastasizing'' and he worried it could spread to Boeing's production systems and airline software.    ''We are on a call with just about every VP in Boeing,'' Mr. VanderWel wrote. The memo called for ''All hands on deck.''   WannaCry is a particularly vicious form of what is known as ransomware -- malware that locks up victims' computers and data with encryption, until attackers' extortion demands are met, often in the form of the virtual currency Bitcoin. Even for victims who agree to pay, decryption is not always guaranteed. The City of Atlanta was hit with a different form of ransomware last week and was still reeling from the fallout on Wednesday.   In a statement Wednesday evening, Boeing played down the attack and said it was limited in scope and that it had not affected the company's production lines.   ''A number of articles on a malware disruption are overstated and inaccurate,'' Boeing's statement said. ''Our cybersecurity operations center detected a limited intrusion of malware that affected a small number of systems. Remediations were applied and this is not a production or delivery issue.''   Charles Bickers, a Boeing spokesman, declined to elaborate or confirm whether the attack was indeed WannaCry, the computer virus United States officials officially blamed on North Korea last December.   What made WannaCry so much more destructive, security experts discovered during last year's outbreak, was that it employed an automated tool that was first developed at the National Security Agency and later dumped online in 2016 by mysterious hackers called the ''Shadow Brokers.''   That tool, which the N.S.A. code-named Eternal Blue, exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software that allowed attackers to spread their malware automatically through vulnerable machines. In other cases, ransomware attackers had to manually encrypt victim's systems.   By incorporating the N.S.A.'s tool into their ransomware last May, hackers ensured their attack would encrypt as many vulnerable machines as possible, causing maximum disruption. White House officials said North Korea was ''directly responsible'' for the attack.   The WannaCry attacks paralyzed computers and business operations in more than 74 countries, forcing Britain's public health system to turn patients away and freezing computers at government agencies in Russia and FedEx in the United States, in what was the largest known ransomware assault.   Microsoft offered an emergency ''patch'' that effectively neutralized the vulnerability WannaCry's attackers used to spread, but unpatched systems remain vulnerable.    "
Regulating Privacy; Letter,"To the Editor: ""Big Tech's Hand Grows Stronger in Privacy Push"" (front page, April 24) suggests that new privacy rules ""may instead serve to strengthen Facebook's and Google's hegemony.""  It's difficult to imagine a more complete hegemony. Google and Facebook control eight of the top 10 internet services -- search, email, online video, web browser software, advertising networks, social networks and more. They are among the five largest corporations in the world. They face no meaningful competition. And their power came about through the unregulated collection and use of personal data. Privacy laws restore user control over their personal data. They encourage the development of innovative services that rely on less data and are less vulnerable to data breach, less likely to extend monopoly controls to adjoining markets, and less likely to undermine democratic institutions. Privacy laws also establish accountability for companies that have become ever more secretive even as they demand more of our personal information. Let us at least concede that privacy rules are a step in the right direction, and long overdue.

"F.B.I. Admits Overstating Locked Phone Problem, and Critics Pounce","WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I. came under fire from electronic privacy and security advocates on Wednesday after acknowledging that it has repeatedly exaggerated the number of locked smartphones and other mobile electronic devices it has been unable to access because of encryption, including in congressional testimony and public speeches. The miscount, which the bureau said was because of an inadvertent programming error in a system that gathered statistics from F.B.I. databases, was a significant embarrassment at a time when the bureau has been pushing for a legal mandate that tech companies build unlocking tools into such devices for law-enforcement access to potential evidence.  Electronic privacy and security activists have opposed the F.B.I.'s push to mandate an unlocking mechanism -- which the government calls ""extraordinary access"" and critics call ""back doors"" -- saying it would make devices too vulnerable to hacking. Among those who seized on the disclosure to rain criticism down upon the bureau was Greg Nojeim, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Freedom, Security, and Technology Project. ""The factual basis of the F.B.I.'s arguments to weaken encryption has been called into doubt,"" Mr. Nojeim said, calling for an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog. Kevin Bankston, director of New America's Open Technology Institute, questioned the F.B.I.'s competence and trustworthiness on encryption. He, too, called for an inspector general investigation to determine ""just how the F.B.I. could have made such a massive mistake on such an important issue, and repeatedly given false information in sworn testimony for Congress."" The F.B.I. said it was conducting its own ""in-depth review of how this overcounting previously occurred, and how the methodology can be corrected to capture future data accurately."" Specifically, top law enforcement officials -- including the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein -- have touted a talking point that in the fiscal year that ended in September, encryption prevented the F.B.I. from unlocking about 7,800 smartphones and other devices despite having legal authority to access them for evidence. ""This figure represents slightly over half of all the mobile devices the FBI attempted to access in that time frame,"" Mr. Wray told the House Judiciary Committee in December. But that number is wrong, the F.B.I. said in a statement late on Tuesday. The bureau said that it had discovered in late April that the system it was using to gather such statistics from its databases was flawed. It appeared that inadvertent ""programming errors resulted in significant overcounting"" of how many mobile devices it had been thwarted from accessing, it said. F.B.I. officials refused to provide an estimate for the real number of such devices, saying it was still conducting a review to both figure that out and determine what methodology to use in the future. The Washington Post, which first disclosed the miscount, cited unnamed officials as saying the real number was probably between 1,000 and 2,000. The F.B.I. has been pushing, in fits and starts, since 2010 for legal changes that would require tech companies to help it gain access to secured data, saying the ability of law-enforcement officials to carry out court-approved wiretaps and searches is ""going dark"" because of the spreading use of encryption. That fight last peaked in 2016, when the Justice Department obtained a court order requiring Apple to design a specialized operating system that would help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone recovered after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple fought the order, and the case launched a debate over tech freedom, security and encryption. The issue was eventually defused when prosecutors disclosed that the F.B.I. had unlocked the phone using a method developed by another company. (No significant evidence was found on the phone.) In March, the Justice Department's inspector general issued a report finding that the F.B.I. had not searched for all possible solutions to unlock the phone before seeking the court order, raising suspicions among the privacy and technology community about whether the bureau tried to use the San Bernardino case to create a precedent for weakening encryption. In recent months, the Justice Department and the F.B.I. under the Trump administration have revived its push for a solution, leading to the speeches and congressional testimony that invoked the inaccurately large number of devices that the bureau purportedly was stymied from accessing. Among the critics of that renewed push who reacted angrily to the disclosure was Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. On Wednesday, he sent a letter to the F.B.I. demanding more information and reiterating the case against its proposal. ""The government has long held discredited views about encryption,"" Mr. Wyden wrote. ""Now we see that the F.B.I. is struggling with basic arithmetic -- clearly it should not be in the business of dictating the design of advanced algorithms."" But the F.B.I. also insisted that its growing inability to access devices that are encrypted remains a significant challenge, whatever the correct number turns out to be, vowing to keep pushing for changes. ""Going Dark remains a serious problem for the F.B.I., as well as other federal, state, local, and international law enforcement partners, all of whom face similar challenges in maintaining access to electronic evidence despite having legal authorization to do so,"" it said. ""The F.B.I. will continue pursuing a solution that ensures law enforcement can access evidence of criminal activity with appropriate legal authority."" PHOTO: The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, has publicly touted an exaggerated number when discussing cellphones that agents were unable to investigate because of encryption. The bureau has acknowledged the error.

Google Plus Will Be Shut Down After User Information Was Exposed,"Google said on Monday that it would shut down Google Plus, the company's long-struggling answer to Facebook's giant social network, after it discovered a security vulnerability that exposed the private data of up to 500,000 users. Google did not tell its users about the security issue when it was found in March because it didn't appear that anyone had gained access to user information, and the company's ""Privacy &amp; Data Protection Office"" decided it was not legally required to report it, the search giant said in a blog post.  The decision to stay quiet, which raised eyebrows in the cybersecurity community, comes against the backdrop of relatively new rules in California and Europe that govern when a company must disclose a security episode. Up to 438 applications made by other companies may have had access to the vulnerability through coding links called application programming interfaces. Those outside developers could have seen user names, email addresses, occupation, gender and age. They did not have access to phone numbers, messages, Google Plus posts or data from other Google accounts, the company said. Google said it had found no evidence that outside developers were aware of the security flaw and no indication that any user profiles were touched. The flaw was fixed in an update made in March. Google looked at the ""type of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. None of these thresholds were met in this instance,"" Ben Smith, a Google vice president for engineering, wrote in the blog post. The disclosure made on Monday could receive additional scrutiny because of a memo to senior executives reportedly prepared by Google's policy and legal teams that warned of embarrassment for the company -- similar to what happened to Facebook this year -- if it went public with the vulnerability. The memo, according to The Wall Street Journal, warned that disclosing the problem would invite regulatory scrutiny and that Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, would most likely be called to testify in front of Congress. A Google spokesman, Rob Shilkin, declined to comment on the memo. He said the company had planned to announce the disclosures later this week but moved up the announcement when it learned of The Journal's article. Early this year, Facebook acknowledged that Cambridge Analytica, a British research organization that performed work for the Trump campaign, had improperly gained access to the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, spent two days testifying in congressional hearings about that and other issues. In May, Europe adopted new General Data Protection Regulation laws that require companies to notify regulators of a potential leak of personal information within 72 hours. Google's security issue occurred in March, before the new rules went into effect. California recently passed a privacy law, which goes into effect in 2020, allowing consumers in the event of a data breach to sue for up to $750 for each violation. It also gives the state's attorney general the right to go after companies for intentional violations of privacy. Steven Andrés, a professor who lectures about management information systems at San Diego State University, said there was no obvious legal requirement for Google to disclose the vulnerability. But he added that it was troubling -- though unsurprising -- to see that the company was discussing how reporting the vulnerability might look to regulators. There is no federal law requiring companies to disclose a security vulnerability. Companies must wade through a patchwork of state laws with different standards. Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton University who is often critical of tech companies for lax privacy practices, said on Twitter that it was common for companies to fix a problem before it is exploited. ""That happens thousands of times every year. Requiring disclosure of all of these would be totally counterproductive,"" Mr. Narayanan wrote. In private meetings with lawmakers last month, Mr. Pichai promised to testify before the end of the year at a hearing about whether tech companies are filtering conservative voices in their products. He is also expected to be asked if Google plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a censored search engine. The vulnerability that was discovered in March and the company's discussions about how regulators could react also are likely to come in his testimony. Just last month, Google was criticized for not sending Mr. Pichai to a hearing attended by top executives from Facebook and Twitter. Introduced in 2011, Google Plus was meant to be a Facebook competitor that linked users to various Google products, including its search engine and YouTube. But other than a few loyal users, it did not catch on. By 2018, it was an afterthought. Google would not say how many people now frequent Google Plus, but it said in the blog post that the service had low usage -- 90 percent of users' sessions are less than five seconds long. When Google's engineers discovered the vulnerability, they concluded that the work required to maintain Google Plus was not worth the effort, considering the meager use of the product, the company said. Google said it planned to turn off the consumer version of Google Plus in August 2019, though a version built for corporate customers will still exist. The failure of Google Plus has relieved Google of some pressure on issues faced by Facebook and Twitter, particularly Russian disinformation efforts. When Google announced in August that it had deleted accounts suspected of ties to Iranian influence campaigns, the company disclosed that it had deleted 13 Google Plus accounts -- compared to 652 accounts that Facebook had deleted for the same concerns.

A Whistle-Blower's Canadian Roots: The Canada Letter,"Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower, brought Canada into a story that's drawn intense scrutiny to Facebook this week. And it's not just because he's from Victoria, British Columbia. After focusing close attention on the social network with the disclosure that Cambridge used personal data from millions of the social media site's users without permission to help Donald J. Trump's election campaign, Mr. Wylie broughta company from his hometown, Aggregate IQ, into the fray this week during testimony before Britain's Parliament. In his testimony, Mr. Wylie said that Aggregrate, a subsidiary of Cambridge Analytica's parent, drew on Cambridge's Facebook data to sway social media opinion in favor of the Leave side in the 2016 British referendum on the European Union vote, and he repeated claims that the Canadian company was used to avoid British campaign spending limits. (The company has denied the claims.)  Attention inevitably turned to Mr. Wylie's activities in Canada. When he was 19, Mr. Wylie worked briefly in the office of Michael Ignatieff, then the Liberal leader. Then early in 2016, when Mr. Trump's victory was not being widely predicted, Mr. Wylie, through a company called Eunoia Technologies, was given a 100,000 Canadian dollar contract by the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau. Like all of the political parties' research shops, the bureau is separate from the party's other operations and is funded by Parliament. Melissa Cotton, the bureau's managing director, said in a statement that Mr. Wylie did not have access to the party's data and that he worked on projects that appeared to have involved monitoring social media, identifying issues and analyzing how Liberal members communicate with voters. ""Preliminary work was done by Eunoia Technologies but after seeing what was offered, Liberal Caucus Research Bureau decided not to move forward."" Ms. Cotton said, without explaining why it cut ties. Mr. Wylie's time in Ottawa, however, brought to light something that most people have overlooked. Unlike businesses and the federal government itself, federal political parties aren't subject to Canada's internet privacy and data protection laws. Some of those laws date to the 1980s and the federal privacy commissioner, among others, has been calling for a 21st century update. But while Canada lags behind Europe in this area, it's still well ahead of the United States. The political party exemption came about in part because of a parliamentary tradition of not giving bureaucrats or outside bodies control over a party's affairs. I called Michael Pal, an assistant law professor at the University of Ottawa who studies election laws and related issues like voter suppression, and asked if it's time for a change. ""Every other sector is covered by privacy laws but political parties,"" he said. ""They are all using data so I don't think there is a good argument about why they should be under privacy rules."" As for concerns about encroaching on Parliament, Professor Pal isn't buying that either. He noted that parties were already ""heavily regulated"" through Elections Canada and election fund-raising laws. So what's a Facebook user to do now? My colleague Brian X. Chen, who writes about consumer technology, has offered some guidance on minimizing privacy risks on Facebook, although his overall take on the situation facing Facebook users is a little discouraging: What about deleting old Facebook and Twitter posts? Brian tried it and found that his ""delete-everything approach was probably not worth most people's time. And even after all that time, my Facebook timeline was still decorated with posts that my friends had published about me -- including photos from my 21st birthday (need I say more?) -- because that content was not mine to delete."" That, of course, leaves the option of quitting social media. And that's what I'm interested in hearing about from you. Have the last couple of weeks turned your mind toward leaving Facebook or other social media sites? If you're inclined, do you think it's possible to leave? And if you leave, what will you lose and what will you gain? Please send your thoughts to nytcanada@nytimes.com.

Can You Spare a Few Hours? Historical Moment About a year ago, I wrote about how the house where the Dionne quintuplets were born faced an uncertain future. The birth, and survival, of the quints at the height of the Great Depression was both a global sensation and a tale of grave injustice. The girls were taken from their family and made wards of the province of Ontario, ostensibly to protect them from exploitation. But the government turned around and exhibited almost like zoo animals. Millions of visitors viewed them from a special gallery. Other injustices and misfortune followed the five through their lives. The decision by the City of North Bay to turn over the log house to a village without the obvious means to maintain or restore it looked like the latest one. But much has changed in the past year. After a public campaign, North Bay reversed its decision, and the house has been moved to downtown where it will become a museum. And this week, The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated the birth of the quints an event of national historical significance. Carlo Tarini, a friend who acts as the family's spokesman, told me this week that Annette and Cécile, the two surviving sisters, are doing well, although Cécile was hospitalized for a time in January because of pneumonia. ""In the pre-internet decades of the 30s and 40s, the worldwide fascination they sparked as children brings shade to the Kardashian kids popularity,"" Mr. Tarini wrote in an email.

California Passes Major Online Privacy Law,"Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka. SAN FRANCISCO -- California has passed a digital privacy law granting consumers more control over and insight into the spread of their personal information online, creating one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data-collection practices of technology companies in the United States. The bill raced through the State Legislature without opposition on Thursday and was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, just hours before a deadline to pull from the November ballot an initiative seeking even tougher oversight over technology companies.     The new law grants consumers the right to know what information companies are collecting about them, why they are collecting that data and with whom they are sharing it. It gives consumers the right to tell companies to delete their information as well as to not sell or share their data. Businesses must still give consumers who opt out the same quality of service.   It also makes it more difficult to share or sell data on children younger than 16.   The legislation, which goes into effect in January 2020, makes it easier for consumers to sue companies after a data breach. And it gives the state's attorney general more authority to fine companies that don't adhere to the new regulations.   The California law is not as expansive as Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., a new set of laws restricting how tech companies collect, store and use personal data.   But Aleecia M. McDonald, an incoming assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in privacy policy, said California's privacy measure was one of the most comprehensive in the United States, since most existing laws -- and there are not many -- do little to limit what companies can do with consumer information.   ''It's a step forward, and it should be appreciated as a step forward when it's been a long time since there were any steps,'' Ms. McDonald said.   The legislation is modeled closely on the ballot initiative, which a real estate developer, Alastair Mactaggart, spent $3 million and secured more than 600,000 signatures to get certified. With the ballot proposal hanging over legislators' heads, the push for an alternative gained grudging support.   If the bill had failed to pass before the deadline, the proponents of the ballot initiative would have taken their case straight to voters in November, they said.   The state's technology and business lobbies were opposed to the measure that was passed on Thursday, but they didn't try to derail it because they thought the ballot initiative was worse.   Even legislators who voted for the bill complained that they had little choice because a ballot measure would provide less flexibility to make changes in the future. And some privacy advocates said the bill did not go as far as the ballot initiative in allowing individuals to sue for not complying.   Mr. Mactaggart said he wanted a sensible privacy law, whether through a ballot measure or the legislative process. He said that the Legislature was the right place to debate such a policy, but that it had been hard to get legislators to address privacy.   ''If we didn't have the initiative process in California, we wouldn't be here today,'' Mr. Mactaggart said in an interview.   One of the authors of the new law, Assemblyman Ed Chau, a Democrat, tried last year to pass a bill that would have required internet service providers to seek permission from customers before accessing, selling or sharing their browser activity. The bill never made it out of committee -- an example of the influence of telecommunications and technology companies in California.   But with the ballot measure looming and a growing awareness of how technology companies are gobbling up user information -- highlighted by revelations that the voter profiling firm Cambridge Analytica gained access to the personal data of millions of Facebook users -- the legislation went from draft to law in one week.   ''This is a huge step forward to people all across the country dealing with this very challenging issue,'' State Senator Bob Hertzberg, a Democrat and a co-author of the bill, said at a news conference after it was signed.   The ballot initiative, which would have made it easier for private individuals to sue companies for not adhering to its privacy requirements, had drawn vocal opposition from industry groups that worried about the potential liability risk.   The measure included a provision that would have required a 70 percent majority in both houses of the Legislature to approve any changes after it became law.   Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each contributed $200,000 to a committee opposing the proposed ballot measure, and lobbyists had estimated that businesses would spend $100 million to campaign against it before the November election.   Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Google, Facebook and Amazon, said in a statement that the new law contained many ''problematic provisions.'' But the group did not try to obstruct it, he added, because ''it prevents the even worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.''   Mr. Callahan said the group would ''work to correct the inevitable, negative policy and compliance ramifications this last-minute deal will create.''   Legislators said they expected to pass ''cleanup bills'' to make any fixes to the law in the 18 months before it takes effect. Some privacy advocates are worried that lobbyists for business and technology groups will use that time to water it down.   Mr. Mactaggart said those concerns are ''overblown.''   ''Having gotten this right, it'll be very hard to take it away,'' he said, noting that the ballot measure had been polling at around 80 percent approval. ''They can't rewrite the law.''    "
Mark Zuckerberg's Reckoning: 'This Is a Major Trust Issue',"For much of the past week, Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy involving Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald J. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and how the firm improperly obtained and exploited personal data from 50 million Facebook users. On Wednesday, following widespread questions about his whereabouts, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, spoke with two New York Times reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Kevin Roose, about the controversy and the steps he was taking to make the social network less prone to abuse. Below is a transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. Sheera Frenkel: Did it come as a surprise to you, the user response to the news that Cambridge Analytica had accessed this trove of data  Mark Zuckerberg: Privacy issues have always been incredibly important to people. One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data. If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it's a photo or a video or a text message -- whether it's Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram -- and you're trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with. Whenever there's an issue where someone's data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn't have allowed it to, that's rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar. Frenkel: It took quite a few days for your response to come out. Is that because you were weighing these three action points that you noted in your post Zuckerberg: The first thing is, I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened. I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate. The second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don't happen again. It's not like there aren't going to be other different kind of things we'll also have to fix. But when there's a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem. So the actions here that we're going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can't do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we're going ahead and doing that. Even if you solve the problem going forward, there's still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people's trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That's why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here's what it's going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we're going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren't doing what Kogan did here. The third thing is, it's really important that people know what apps they've authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we're taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven't used them for three months. But it's also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you've connected to and authorized, here's an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity. Kevin Roose: Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica? Zuckerberg: Yes. We're going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared. Now, there's a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we're going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don't know for certain that they were. It's likely that we'll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this. Roose: Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you'll be investigating? Zuckerberg: It will be in the thousands. Frenkel: Were those app developers notified that you'll be investigating this yet? Zuckerberg: Just when I posted. And we'll be reaching out in the near term. Frenkel: Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations? Zuckerberg: Yes, I would imagine we're going to have to grow the team to work on this. Roose: You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information. What will be the terms of that contract, and what will be the penalties for violating it? Zuckerberg: So, the important thing there is that it's a high-touch process. The specific point we were trying to make is that it's not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something. I guess technically, that would be a contract as well. The point of what we're trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn't mean that -- if you're a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people. Frenkel: We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered. Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in? Zuckerberg: The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm, that they don't have any people's data from our community and that they've deleted anything, including derivative data, that they might have. We're working with the regulator in the U.K. on this, so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation. We're certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there's no wrongdoing here. Roose: There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set. Why didn't you suspend them then? Zuckerberg: So, we actually heard, I think it was at the end of 2015 -- some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said. And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica, it was about this developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who had shared data with them. We took action immediately at that point. We banned Kogan's app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn't have the data, and weren't using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision. Frenkel: In retrospect, do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted? Zuckerberg: Yes. They gave us a formal and legal certification, and it seems at this point that that was false. Again, we haven't done our full investigation and audit yet so I can't say definitively that they actually have data. I've just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here. That's the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data. Frenkel: Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently, that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data? Zuckerberg: Yes, we're investigating that too. Roose: Are you worried about the #DeleteFacebook campaign that's been going around? Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts, and are you worried that will be a trend? Zuckerberg: I don't think we've seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it's not good. I think it's a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don't feel good about using Facebook, that's a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify. Frenkel: We're now heading into the 2018 midterms. Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won't be used this way again? Zuckerberg: This is an incredibly important point. There's no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community. Now, the good news here is that these problems aren't necessarily rocket science. They're hard, but they're things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they're trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere. One of the things that gives me confidence is that we've seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France. In last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven't talked about publicly before, so you're the first people I'm telling about that. I feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we're dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important. Frenkel: The Times reported that [Facebook chief security officer Alex] Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year. Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections? Zuckerberg: Sure. One of the important things we've done is, we want to unify all of our security efforts. And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos, and I'll say something about him in a second. He's been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia. And I think he has done very good work, and I'm hopeful he'll be engaged for a while here on that. One of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It's not all A.I., right? There's certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we're going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We'll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it's really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal. The last thing I'd add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It's the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the '90s, now they're trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we've made, like O.K., if you're anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can't put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else. Roose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users -- do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks? Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that -- our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can't afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned. Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That's certainly something we've thought about over time. But I don't think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it's important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free. Roose: Adam Mosseri, Facebook's head of News Feed, recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook's role in the violence in Myanmar. You've said you're ""outraged"" about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world, are you losing any sleep? Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world? Zuckerberg: That's a good question. I think, you know, we're doing something here which is unprecedented, in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them, and connect across boundaries. I think what we're seeing is, there are new challenges that I don't think anyone had anticipated before. If you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I'd need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other's elections, there's no way I thought that's what I'd be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room. I don't know that it's possible to know every issue that you're going to face down the road. But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them, and do a good job for our community. It's certainly true that, over the course of Facebook, I've made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that's technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We've launched product after product that didn't work. I spend most of my time looking forward, trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today, because I think that's what people in our community would want.

Can Europe Lead on Privacy?; Op-Ed Contributor,"""We have a responsibility to protect your information,"" Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, declared recently in a full-page newspaper advertisement. ""If we can't, we don't deserve it."" It is nice to see Facebook taking some responsibility for the exploitation of the personal information of 50 million of its users in the service of a political campaign. But Mr. Zuckerberg's comments suggest he still doesn't get it: What matters is not whether internet companies ""deserve"" our private information but why we as consumers do not have meaningful ways to protect that data from being siphoned for sale in the first place. The American government has done little to help us in this regard. The Federal Trade Commission merely requires internet companies to have a privacy policy available for consumers to see. A company can change that policy whenever it wants as long as it says it is doing so. As a result, internet companies have been taking our personal property -- our private information -- while hiding this fact behind lengthy and coercive legalese and cumbersome ""opt out"" processes.  The European Union, however, is handling the problem differently. Starting in May, its General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect in its 28 member nations. The regulation is powerful in its simplicity: It ensures that consumers own their private information and thus have the right to control its usage and that internet companies have an obligation to give consumers the tools to exercise that control. The European rules, for instance, require companies to provide a plain-language description of their information-gathering practices, including how the data is used, as well as have users explicitly ""opt in"" to having their information collected. The rules also give consumers the right to see what information about them is being held, and the ability to have that information erased. Why don't we have similar protections in the United States? We almost did. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission imposed similar requirements on the companies that provide internet service, forcing them to offer an explicit ""opt in"" for having personal data collected, and to protect the information that was collected. This didn't last. Internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T and companies that use their connections, like Facebook and Google, lobbied members of Congress. Congress passed a law this year, signed by President Trump, that not only repealed the protections but also prohibited the F.C.C. from ever again imposing such safeguards. The same coalition of corporate interests succeeded in discouraging California from passing a state privacy law similar to the 2016 F.C.C. requirements. Fortunately, the European Union's law should indirectly help Americans somewhat. In only a few weeks, Facebook, Google and all the other internet companies that collect our private information will have to allow European customers the protections these companies have fought to deny Americans. In an interconnected world where digital code doesn't respect the geographical or national borders, this will surely have a positive global impact. Internet companies are preparing for a future in which regardless of where a website is based, if it is visited by even a single European Union citizen and if it seeks to collect that person's data, it must provide that person the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation. Hopefully, this experience will show these companies that protecting privacy is simply the responsible thing to do, not the end of their business. The United States government has a lot of explaining to do. Why is it that American internet companies such as Facebook and Google are required to provide privacy protections when doing business with European consumers but are free to not provide such protections for Americans? Why is it that Americans' best privacy hope is the secondary effect of interconnected networks rather than privacy protections designed for Americans? Why shouldn't Americans also be given meaningful tools to protect their privacy? Congress is now considering bipartisan legislation that responds to the problem of Russian targeted political advertising on social media by adding the requirement, long applied to broadcast advertising, that those websites disclose who is paying for their advertisements. But as well intentioned as that step may be, it addresses only a symptom of the problem of the extensive surveillance of Americans, not the root of the problem. The New World must learn from the Old World. The internet economy has made our personal data a corporate commodity. The United States government must return control of that information to its owners.

Facebook Is Not the Problem. Lax Privacy Rules Are.; Editorial,"As recently as 2010, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, believed that privacy was no longer a ""social norm."" But over the past few weeks -- and not a moment too soon -- he and his colleagues have learned that privacy still matters to individuals and society. Revelations about how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump's campaign, amassed data about more than 50 million Facebook users without their consent has forced the social media company to tell anyone who will listen that it takes privacy very seriously. Last week, Facebook said it was simplifying and centralizing privacy settings, making it easier for its more than two billion users to change how much personal information they share. That was an important and necessary change, but what we have learned about the data collection practices of social media firms, advertisers, political campaigns, online publishers and other groups suggests that company-specific changes like Facebook's will be insufficient. What is needed is for Congress to adopt rigorous and comprehensive privacy laws.  The technology and advertising industries have long resisted such rules, and neither this Congress nor the Trump administration has shown any interest in privacy. But someday new politicians will be in charge, and now is as good a time as any to begin a serious examination of how American privacy regulations can be strengthened. There's no need to start from scratch. In 2012, President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights that included many ideas for giving people more control over their information, making data collection more transparent and putting limits on what business can do with the information they collect. The bill of rights fizzled out when Congress showed little appetite for it. But the European Union has used a similar approach in developing its General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect on May 25. The new European rules are not perfect -- they include the so-called right to be forgotten, which allows people to ask companies to delete personal information that they no longer wish to share. That could be implemented in ways that limit free speech. But the Europeans have made progress toward addressing some of the problems that have recently been highlighted in the United States. For instance, their laws require companies to seek consent before collecting sensitive personal information, to make the request understandable, and to give users an easy way to opt in to sharing such data, rather than forcing them to opt out if they don't want to be tracked. Further, companies that want to collect data about Europeans will have to be upfront about how they use personal data, and they cannot collect more information than they need to provide the services they are offering. The Obama bill of rights included a similar concept, saying that personal information should only be used in ""ways that are consistent with the context in which consumers provide the data."" Today, it is standard procedure for many companies to vacuum up as much data as they can by getting users to agree to long, impenetrable terms of service. Companies might not even know how they will use the information being collected but collect it anyway, in case they later develop a specific use for it. Recently, some Facebook users discovered that the company's Android app had been logging metadata from every incoming and outgoing phone call and text message, in some cases for years. The company said that users had consented to sharing this information and that doing so ""helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook."" That statement is positively Orwellian. It's hard to believe that many people would have given the company access to so much personal data if they actually understood what they were agreeing to. The new European regulation will also let people access their own data, transfer their information from one business to others that provide a similar service and delete it altogether under certain circumstances. Companies will have to notify customers within 72 hours if they become aware of a breach of personal information. Many businesses will struggle to comply with the European Union's new rules, and officials in member countries will have a hard time enforcing it consistently. ""We will have a learning curve,"" said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads France's privacy regulator, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés. ""We will have to adjust."" But it is increasingly clear that businesses will figure out how to live with and make money under tougher privacy rules. Some companies are also planning to apply some or all of the data protection requirements to all of their customers, not just Europeans. And other countries have or are considering adopting similar rules. Throughout history, meatpackers, credit card companies, automakers and other businesses resisted regulations, arguing they would be ruined by them. Yet, regulations have actually benefited many industries by boosting demand for products that consumers know meet certain standards. Facebook and other internet companies fear privacy regulations, but they ought not to. Strong rules could be good for them as well as for consumers.

"Europe's Data Protection Law Is a Big, Confusing Mess","There is a growing realization that our data is under attack. From breaches at Equifax to Cambridge Analytica's misuse of the profile information of more than 87 million Facebook users, it seems as if none of our personal data is safe. And more and more about us is being captured, stored and processed by smart devices like thermostats, baby monitors, WiFi-connected streetlights and traffic sensors. In the United States, people who are concerned are looking to Europe. They see Europe's ""right to be forgotten,"" by which citizens can force companies to erase some of their personal data, as a step toward regaining ownership of their online selves. And on May 25, the European Union will bring into force the most sweeping regulation ever of what can be done with people's data.  This law, the General Data Protection Regulation, will give citizens greater control over their data while requiring those who process personal data in the European Union or about its citizens to take responsibility for its protection. The G.D.P.R. will give Europeans the right to data portability (allowing people, for example, to take their data from one social network to another) and the right not to be subject to decisions based on automated data processing (prohibiting, for example, the use of an algorithm to reject applicants for jobs or loans). Advocates seem to believe that the new law could replace a corporate-controlled internet with a digital democracy. There's just one problem: No one understands the G.D.P.R. The law is staggeringly complex. After three years of intense lobbying and contentious negotiation, the European Parliament published a draft, which then received some 4,000 amendment proposals, a reflection of the divergent interests at stake. Corporations, governments and academic institutions all process personal data, but they use it for different purposes. There's another reason for the regulation's complexity and ambiguity: What are often framed as legal and technical questions are also questions of values. The European Union's 28 member states have different historical experiences and contemporary attitudes about data collection. Germans, recalling the Nazis' deadly efficient use of information, are suspicious of government or corporate collection of personal data; people in Nordic countries, on the other hand, link the collection and organization of data to the functioning of strong social welfare systems. Thus, the regulation is intentionally ambiguous, representing a series of compromises. It promises to ease restrictions on data flows while allowing citizens to control their personal data, and to spur European economic growth while protecting the right to privacy. It skirts over possible differences between current and future technologies by using broad principles. But those broad principles don't always accord with current data practices. The regulation requires those who process personal data to demonstrate accountability in part by limiting data collection and processing what is necessary for a specific purpose, forbidding other uses. That may sound good, but machine learning, for example -- one of the most active areas of research in artificial intelligence, used for targeted advertising, self-driving cars and more -- uses data to train computer systems to make decisions that cannot be specified in advance, derived from the original data or explained after the fact. In 2017, the year after the regulation was approved, I interviewed scientists, data managers, legal scholars, lawyers, ethicists and activists in Sweden. I learned that many scientists and data managers who will be subject to the law find it incomprehensible. They doubted that absolute compliance was even possible. One expert at Sweden's national bioinformatics platform said: ""We often wonder, like, what does the law say about this? Nobody knows."" Or as a scientist in charge of computing and storage facilities at a major university put it, the G.D.P.R. says, more or less, ""that adequate safety should be in place, and so on. Right -- what does that mean?"" Many of the law's broad principles, though they avoid references to specific technologies, are nevertheless based on already outdated assumptions about technology. ""I think it's very clear that they imagined some company that has your data physically stored somewhere, and you have the right to take it out,"" a law professor told me of the G.D.P.R.'s approach to data portability. But in the era of big data and cloud services, data rarely exists in only one place. What the regulation really means is likely to be decided in European courts, which is sure to be a drawn-out and confusing process. Still, the G.D.P.R. is not a lost cause. We do need rules about data. But legal frameworks, particularly when they are long, complex and ambiguous, can't be the only or even the primary resource guiding the day-to-day work of data protection. If the ultimate goal is to change what people do with our data, we need more research that looks carefully at how personal data is collected and by whom, and how those people make decisions about data protection. Policymakers should use such studies as a basis for developing empirically grounded, practical rules. In the end, pragmatic guidelines that make sense to people who work with data might do a lot more to protect our personal data than a law that promises to change the internet but can't explain how.

Timeline: Facebook and Google Under Regulators' Glare,"Over the years, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have cracked down on Facebook and Google for privacy violations. But as the European Union prepares to introduce comprehensive new data protection regulation in May, European regulators have been stepping up investigations into tech industry data practices. The Federal Trade Commission for the first time requires a company to institute a comprehensive program to protect consumer data privacy   Google reaches a settlement with the F.T.C., which charged the company with using deceptive tactics and violating its own privacy promises to consumers. Google had enrolled Gmail users in its social network, Buzz, without effective ways for them to opt out of the service or limit the sharing of their personal details, the agency said.  The F.T.C. goes after Facebook for exposing users' information Facebook agrees to settle charges by the F.T.C. that it deceived users by telling them that they could keep their profile information private and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public. The F.T.C. fines Google $22.5 million for Safari privacy violations Google agrees to pay $22.5 million to settle F.T.C. charges that the company misled people who used Apple's Safari browser by placing advertiser tracking codes, called cookies, on their computers after Google told them that they would be opted out of such tracking. Google also violated a previous settlement that prohibited it from misleading consumers over how they could control collection of their data, the agency said. Facebook turns off facial recognition in Europe after complaints that the company failed to ensure user consent After an audit by Ireland's data protection commissioner, regulators report that Facebook turned off its photo-tagging facial recognition feature for new users in the European Union and will delete facial template data it had already collected from users there. The commissioner's office said Facebook had not sufficiently notified users or obtained their explicit consent to use the feature. The European Commission fines Facebook $122 million, saying the social network misled regulators about WhatsApp The European Commission fines Facebook $122 million for misleading regulators during their investigation of the company's acquisition of the WhatsApp messaging service. The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, says Facebook told regulators that it would be unable to automatically match an individual user's Facebook account with his or her WhatsApp account. But WhatsApp later announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook. In December, the French Data Protection Authority orders WhatsApp to stop sharing data with Facebookor face penalties. And in March, a German court bars Facebook from using data from German users of WhatsApp for Facebook's own purposes, upholding the ruling of a lower court. German antitrust regulators censure Facebook's data practices In a preliminary finding, Germany's Cartel Office reports that Facebook has abused its dominant position in the country by requiring users to allow it to endlessly amass data by tracking them through other online services. In February, the regulator says it planned to investigate whether the ability of large platforms like Facebook and Google to set up closed advertising systems and have access to user data was limiting market competition. A Belgian court tells Facebook to stop tracking users around the web A court in Belgiumrules that Facebook must stop tracking users on third-party sites and delete the data it had already collected. The court says Facebook hadn't sufficiently informed users about the data it gathered on their use of sites outside the social network or how it used that data.   A sweeping data privacy law is set to take effect in Europe, reshaping data collection practices   The European Union will put into effect a comprehensive privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, that requires companies to obtain consent from users before processing their data and allows the authorities to fine companies up to 4 percent of their annual revenue if they fail to comply.

"Banks and Retailers Are Tracking How You Type, Swipe and Tap","When you're browsing a website and the mouse cursor disappears, it might be a computer glitch -- or it might be a deliberate test to find out who you are. The way you press, scroll and type on a phone screen or keyboard can be as unique as your fingerprints or facial features. To fight fraud, a growing number of banks and merchants are tracking visitors' physical movements as they use websites and apps. Some use the technology only to weed out automated attacks and suspicious transactions, but others are going significantly further, amassing tens of millions of profiles that can identify customers by how they touch, hold and tap their devices. The data collection is invisible to those being watched. Using sensors in your phone or code on websites, companies can gather thousands of data points, known as ""behavioral biometrics,"" to help prove whether a digital user is actually the person she claims to be.  To security officials, the technology is a powerful safeguard. Major data breaches are a near-daily occurrence. Cyberthieves have obtained billions of passwords and other sensitive personal information, which can be used to steal from customers' bank and shopping accounts and fraudulently open new ones. ""Identity is the ultimate digital currency, and it's being weaponized at an industrial scale,"" said Alisdair Faulkner, one of the founders of ThreatMetrix, which makes fraud detection software for large merchants and financial companies. Many of his company's customers are now using or testing behavioral biometric tools, he said. Privacy advocates view the biometric tools as potentially troubling, partly because few companies disclose to users when and how their taps and swipes are being tracked. ""What we have seen across the board with technology is that the more data that's collected by companies, the more they will try to find uses for that data,"" said Jennifer Lynch, a senior lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""It's a very small leap from using this to detect fraud to using this to learn very private information about you."" The Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the few banks that will talk publicly about its collection of biometric behavioral data, started testing the technology two years ago on private banking accounts for wealthy customers. It is now expanding the system to all of its 18.7 million business and retail accounts, according to Kevin Hanley, the bank's director of innovation. When clients log in to their Royal Bank of Scotland accounts, software begins recording more than 2,000 different interactive gestures. On phones, it measures the angle at which people hold their devices, the fingers they use to swipe and tap, the pressure they apply and how quickly they scroll. On a computer, the software records the rhythm of their keystrokes and the way they wiggle their mouse. R.B.S. is using software designed by a small New York company called BioCatch. It builds a profile on each person's gestures, which is then compared against the customer's movements every time they return. The system can detect impostors with 99 percent accuracy, BioCatch says. A few months ago, the software picked up unusual signals coming from one wealthy customer's account. After logging in, the visitor used the mouse's scroll wheel -- something the customer had never done before. Then the visitor typed on the numerical strip at the top of a keyboard, not the side number pad the customer typically used. Alarm bells went off. The R.B.S. system blocked any cash from leaving the customer's account. An investigation later found that the account had been hacked, Mr. Hanley said. ""Someone was trying to set up a new payee and transfer a seven-figure sum,"" he said. ""We were able to intervene in real time and stop that from happening."" That case was unusually blatant. A user's behavior isn't constant; people act differently when they're tired, injured, drunk, distracted or in a hurry. The way people type at an office desk is distinct from when they're slumped on their sofa at home. Behavioral monitoring software churns through thousands of elements to calculate a probability-based guess about whether a person is who they claim. Two major advances have fed its growing use: the availability of cheap computing power and the sophisticated array of sensors now built into most smartphones. The system's unobtrusiveness is part of its appeal, Mr. Hanley said. Traditional physical biometrics, like fingerprints or irises, require special scanning hardware for authentication. But behavioral traits can be captured in the background, without customers doing anything to sign up. BioCatch occasionally tries to elicit a reaction. It can speed up the selection wheel you use to enter data like dates and times on your phone, or make your mouse cursor disappear for a fraction of a second. ""Everyone reacts a little differently to that,"" said Frances Zelazny, BioCatch's chief strategy and marketing officer. ""Some people move the mouse side to side; some people move it up and down. Some bang on the keyboard."" Because your reaction is so individual, it's hard for a fraudulent user to fake. And because customers never know the monitoring technology is there, it doesn't impose the kind of visible, and irritating, roadblocks that typically accompany security tests. You don't need to press your thumb on your phone's fingerprint reader or type in an authentication code. ""We don't have to sit people down in a room and get them to type under perfect laboratory conditions,"" said Neil Costigan, the chief executive of BehavioSec, a Palo Alto, Calif., company that makes software used by many Nordic banks. ""You just watch them, silently, while they go about their normal account activities."" Businesses call that a ""frictionless"" experience. Privacy watchdogs call it dangerous. Biometric systems can sometimes detect medical conditions. If a customer with a once-steady hand develops a tremor, her automobile insurance company might get worried. That's potentially a problem if the customer's bank, which detected the tremor through its security software, is also her insurer. ""This is the kind of data that usually has some kind of consumer protections around it, but here there's none at all,"" said Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum. ""Companies are using these systems with no notice of any kind."" In most countries, there are no laws governing the collection and use of biometric behavioral data. Even Europe's new privacy rules have exemptions for security and fraud prevention. A new digital privacy law in California includes behavioral biometrics on the list of tracking technologies companies must disclose if they collect, but it does not take effect until 2020. Banks and merchants sometimes store their customers' biometric data internally. In many cases, though, they allow the outside vendors they work with to hold it. That magnifies the risks, Ms. Dixon said. BioCatch has profiles on about 70 million individuals and monitors six billion transactions a month, according to Ms. Zelazny, the company's strategy executive. American Express, an investor in BioCatch, recently began using its technology on new account applications. Some of BioCatch's rivals have even larger networks. Forter, a New York start-up that sells online fraud detection software incorporating behavioral biometrics to big retailers, said its database has records on 175 million people from more than 180 countries. Another competitor, NuData, was acquired last year by Mastercard. More than a dozen technology vendors, from under-the-radar start-ups to giants like I.B.M., have built behavioral biometrics into the security software they sell to retailers and banks. The technology can be useful for rooting out fraud even without personal data on individual customers. On new account applications, for example, behavioral biometric systems pay close attention to where and when applicants pause. A legitimate applicant typically types personal information -- their name, their address, their Social Security number -- fluidly, with few breaks. A scammer will often either cut and paste or take breaks to consult their notes. ""This used to be like science fiction,"" said Ryan Wilk, a NuData employee who is now a Mastercard vice president. ""When we described what we did, people would give us looks like, 'Is this real?' Now, it's become not just a gimmick but a major technology in the financial industry. Lots of big companies are using it."" PHOTO: A phone&rsquo;s touchscreen sensors can track where and how you swipe your device to help determine who you are.

Hard Choice for Cities Under Cyberattack: Whether to Pay Ransom,"Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Nicole Perlroth from Boulder, Colo. ATLANTA -- The dilemma confronts city and state officials with alarming frequency: Digital extortionists have hijacked their computer systems and demanded ransom. Should they pay? It has surfaced in the suburbs of Dallas and in Birmingham, Ala., in North Carolina and in New Mexico, and twice in a matter of weeks at the Colorado Department of Transportation. And for the past week it has gripped Atlanta, where the municipal government has been struggling with one of the gravest cyberattacks on record against a major American city.    The assault on Atlanta's computers is a vivid example of the perils local governments face in the internet age. They are seen as more vulnerable than private businesses, both in their technology and in their limited ability to tolerate system failures and down time.   ''They're a target of opportunity for criminals, because people feel it's easier to hack into them than it is private systems and companies,'' said Alan R. Shark, the executive director of the Public Technology Institute, which offers training to local governments.    Not all cyberattacks involve ransomware, the malicious code that renders the victim's data inaccessible until a ransom is paid. But the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cybersecurity clearing house for state and local governments, has said that ransomware is now the biggest digital threat its members face.   Anyone hit with a ransomware attack must reckon with the dollars and cents: Will it cost more to pay up, or to try to eradicate the malware and restore the data without giving in? But government victims must also grapple with the dubious propriety -- and dubious legality -- of rewarding crime with taxpayers' money.   The episodes are at once familiar and frightening. Hackers with no apparent motive other than curiosity and avarice indiscriminately scan the web for vulnerable servers and networks, and all too often find them.   Cybersecurity experts say local government agencies and universities tend to be at a particular disadvantage because they manage many public-facing web services and servers and employ many people who must have access.   Antivirus software tools can ward off some kinds of malicious attacks, but they often fail to stop ransomware because cybercriminals have found too many ways around them -- whether by exploiting a security hole in a vulnerable server or tricking a naïve employee into opening a malicious email attachment.   ''In cybersecurity, the more places you have where your door is sort of open -- which it has to be in local government -- the higher your risk is,'' said Scott Smith, a former mayor of Mesa, Ariz.   In 2013, the year Mr. Smith became president of the United States Conference of Mayors, the group adopted a resolution identifying cybersecurity as ''a critical public safety issue of concern to mayors and cities.''   But local governments are often working with antiquated systems, tight budgets and short-handed I.T. staffs. According to a 2016 survey of chief information officers for jurisdictions across the country, 38 percent of local governments were relying on technology that was at least one generation out of date, and fewer than half had bought cybersecurity insurance, which can help cover the costs of responding to a major attack.   The survey, by the International City/County Management Association and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, found that extorting ransom was the most common purpose of cyberattacks on city or county governments, accounting for nearly one-third of all attacks. (Mischief and theft of private information were the next most common.)   Local governments were not always high on the ransom target list. In recent years, security experts say, criminal groups like SamSam, the shadowy hacking crew implicated in the Atlanta episode, had been zeroing in on health care providers, particularly hospitals, which they knew could ill afford to lose patient records or wait for weeks to restore normal operations. More than seven-eighths of all recorded ransomware attacks in the United States in 2016 were aimed at the health care industry, according to NTT Security.   That onslaught, experts say, prompted many in the industry to shore up their digital defenses -- and the hackers to turn to new targets. ''As health care has spent more on their security, we've seen attackers moving to local governments,'' said Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, a security firm.   The past 16 months have seen high-profile ransomware attacks at public agencies ranging from a fire department in Ohio to the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which offered free rides after attackers took down their ticketing systems. Recently, Mr. Liska said, cybercriminals who call themselves ''The Dark Overlord'' have said in an underground web forum that they had begun to attack state and local governments because their security is so poor.   In Atlanta, the attack apparently mounted by the SamSam group brought down many (though not all) city systems on the morning of March 22. Among other effects, residents have not been able to pay water bills or traffic tickets online, the court schedule has been upended, and police officers have had to file reports on paper. For days, city workers were not allowed even to turn on their computers.   Through a spokeswoman, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta declined to be interviewed about the ransom demanded by SamSam to end the attack: the Bitcoin equivalent of about $51,000.   But Atlanta's leaders are likely to have weighed a host of concerns, including whether the SamSam hackers would keep their end of the bargain. Security experts said the city also had to decide whether it was willing, in effect, to finance a criminal enterprise, and whether it could stomach a reputation as an easy mark.   ''Local governments often don't feel comfortable using taxpayer funds to pay a criminal, especially when they consider where those funds may be going,'' said Jason Rebholz, a vice president at Icebrg, a security firm. ''On the other hand, they have to weigh a $51,000 ransom demand with the fact that they are likely going to pay a lot more to resume operations.''   Ransomware attacks used to be low-odds propositions. In 2012, by one estimate, only 2.9 percent of victims paid. But these days, the rate is as high as 48 percent, according the Ponemon Institute, a privacy research group.   Those who pay -- from a Massachusetts town and police department to the Hancock Health hospital group -- generally calculate that it is the cheapest way out. Mr. Rebholz estimated that the total cost for Atlanta to rebuild all its affected systems could run from ''several hundred thousand dollars easily into millions of dollars.''   Though many of their concerns are the same, business leaders hit by cyberattacks are often able to respond more nimbly than politicians can.   Corporate executives ''can compare and contrast different options in a much freer way,'' said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas and a former president of Pizza Hut.   In the public sector, he said, ''It's not as simple as cost-benefit analysis -- you are gambling the trust and the perception of what the city stands for at the same time.''   The Ponemon Institute found that the decision often turns on whether the victim has access to a full and accurate backup for the seized data. The hackers know it: Victims are finding that the first thing intruders like SamSam do is to search the compromised system for ''back up'' or the names of popular backup services, and delete those files.   ''They now go out of their way to force you to pay,'' Mr. Rebholz said. ''It's increasingly rare that victims can fully recover.''   The Colorado Department of Transportation awoke late last month to discover that SamSam had locked its employees out of their computers, email and timecard systems; encrypted the agency's most important databases; and renamed files with the words ''i'm sorry.''   Deborah Blyth, the state's chief information security officer, said in an interview Wednesday that it was an easy decision not to pay. For one thing, the state has a policy forbidding ransom payments. For another, the data had been backed up offline, out of the attackers' reach, making the department better prepared than most targets.   The department had everything back to normal in a little over a week -- but the story was not over. SamSam's attackers had planted some undetected digital footholds during the first attack that opened the door for a second attack with improved ransomware as soon as the systems came back online.   Three weeks later, Ms. Blyth said, the second restoration job is about 80 percent complete. She is scheduled to brief other state and local governments on Friday about the double whammy.   ''I feel terrible for Atlanta,'' she said. ''I know exactly where they're at. We need to give other local governments information on SamSam so it doesn't happen to them. I'm really worried that other state agencies are at risk.''   Officials have been slow to awaken to that danger. After the mayors' conference adopted its warning resolution in 2013, it tried to hold a cybersecurity forum in Washington for city officials. It was canceled for lack of interest.   ''If you had a cybersecurity summit now,'' Mr. Smith said this week, ''it would be oversubscribed.''    "
Freezing Credit Will Now Be Free. Here's Why You Should Go for It.; Your Money Adviser,"Consumers will soon be able to freeze their credit files without charge. So if you have not yet frozen your files -- a recommended step to foil identity theft -- now is a good time to take action, consumer advocates say. Security freezes, often called credit freezes, are ""absolutely"" the best way to prevent criminals from using your personal information to open new accounts in your name, said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy nonprofit group. Free freezes, which will be available next Friday, were required as part of broader financial legislation signed in May by President Trump. Free security freezes were already available in some states and in certain situations, but the federal law requires that they be made available nationally. Two of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax and TransUnion, have already abandoned the fees. The third, Experian, said it would begin offering free credit freezes next Friday. To be effective, freezes must be placed at all three bureaus.  The Federal Trade Commission says that when the law takes effect, its identity theft website will provide links to each bureau's freeze website. A security freeze makes it harder for criminals to use stolen information to open fraudulent new accounts, or borrow money, in your name. Credit bureaus house records of your accounts and payment history, which card companies and lenders use to decide whether you are likely to pay your bills. If you freeze your file, the bureaus will not provide information to lenders unless you ""thaw"" the freeze first, using a special personal identification number. Free security freezes are becoming available more than a year after a huge data breach was discovered at Equifax. The breach compromised the personal information, including Social Security numbers, birth dates and other sensitive details, of more than 145 million people -- nearly half the population of the United States. Despite the scale of that breach, and a steady stream of other incidents, security freezes have not really caught on. An AARP survey of about 2,000 adults found that just 14 percent had frozen their credit files. (The survey, conducted in July by GfK Group using a probability-based online panel, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.) In-depth interviews with 24 consumers by researchers at the University of Michigan School of Information found thatmany people knew about the Equifax breach, but few had taken the step of freezing their credit files as a result. Consumers suffer from ""optimism bias,"" the researchers found. They realized that the breach created risk, but did not think anything would happen to them personally. ""People tend to underestimate their own risk,"" said Florian Schaub, an assistant professor at the school and one of the study's authors. Others incorrectly assumed that because they had poor credit or little wealth, they would be unattractive targets for identity thieves. ""They think: 'I don't have much money. I have nothing to lose,'"" Mr. Schaub said. ""But that's not how identity thieves operate."" People interviewed also cited the cost of freezes as a barrier. It can cost as much as $10 per bureau to place a freeze, and a similar fee is charged to thaw it temporarily when you want to apply for credit. Consumer advocates hope that making freezes free will spur more consumers to use them. (The new law requires that a thaw must also be free.) But the freeze process is not as easy as it could be, said Mike Litt, consumer campaign director for U.S. PIRG, the consumer advocacy group. He would prefer credit files to be ""frozen"" by default, and thawed on request. As it stands, consumers must place freezes separately at all three bureaus, and keep track of three PINs. And because it's not always possible to know in advance what credit bureau a lender will use, consumers typically must lift the freezes at all three bureaus when they want to apply for new credit. Brett Merfish, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., said she froze her credit at all three bureaus several years ago, after her personal information was used to open ""a steady flow"" of fraudulent credit card accounts. The freeze process was ""tedious,"" she recalled, but ultimately effective because she no longer has problems with fake accounts. ""It's worth it to do it,"" she said. One credit bureau, TransUnion, introduced a smartphone app, myTransUnion, this month that consumers can use to more easily freeze and thaw their credit. The app is available for both Apple and Android phones. Mr. Stephens, of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said he had not seen the app, but cautioned consumers to tread carefully, in case it is used to market other, fee-based products and services. The credit bureaus also offer something called a credit ""lock,"" which they promote as a more convenient way to protect your information. But some offerings carry fees, and consumer advocates prefer freezes because the rules are set by law, rather than by the credit bureaus. One other less-protective option is a fraud alert, which requires credit bureaus to contact you to verify your identity when a company requests your credit file. Under the new law, initial fraud alerts must last for one year once established. Fraud alerts are free, and, unlike the freezes, an alert placed at one bureau is automatically placed at all three. U.S. PIRG also recommends freezing your file at a lesser-known reporting agency known as the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange. The exchange provides credit information to some cellphone, pay television and utility companies. (Some consumers have reported having cellular accounts opened in their names, even though they had placed freezes on their credit reports at the main bureaus.) The website for the utilities exchange says its database is ""housed and managed"" by Equifax. But the exchange is a ""distinct"" entity that requires its own freeze, said Craig Caesar, outside counsel to the exchange. ""A separate request to N.C.T.U.E. is required because it is a separate database,"" Mr. Caesar said in an email. There is no cost for a freeze, he said. The new law also requires credit bureaus to allow parents to create and freeze credit files for their children under 16, to prevent their identities from being misused. The Federal Trade Commission offers information on what to do. Freezes will not protect you from other types of fraud, like someone using the number of a credit card you already have, or impersonating you online to claim your Social Security benefits. To help prevent those types of theft, Mr. Litt recommends checking your credit card statements regularly for suspicious charges, and setting up and monitoring an online Social Security account, to prevent criminals from opening one first and diverting your benefit checks. A PIRG report suggests other helpful steps as well. Checking your credit report periodically is also wise. You are entitled to one free copy each year from the big three bureaus at annualcreditreport.com. (A security freeze will not prevent you from getting your free annual report, the F.T.C. says.)

Making the Break From Facebook In 6 Steps,"You may have decided enough is enough: It's time to delete Facebook. There have been months -- or is it years now? -- of bad news about the social network. Last month, Facebook revealed that a security vulnerability exposed up to 50 million accounts to being hijacked by hackers. Through the vulnerability, a hacker could take over your account -- meaning anything you ever posted on Facebook, or even apps that you connected with using your Facebook account, could have been infiltrated.    The company said in a statement that it was investigating the incident and would share updates. ''People's privacy and security is incredibly important, and we're sorry this happened,'' the company said Wednesday. ''It's why we took immediate action to secure people's accounts and fix the vulnerability.''   The breach followed a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling firm that got its hands on the private data belonging to millions of Facebook users. And maybe you are just tired of the partisan yammering and updates from the six-degrees-of-friends.    I have some firsthand experience with all of this. After the disclosure of Facebook's breach, I felt my trust in the social network was broken. So I pulled out my data from Facebook and purged the account. What I found out about the process: The more you have integrated Facebook into your life, the more time-consuming it will be to delete it.   To make account deletion as painless as possible, here is a step-by-step guide. I also included steps on breaking up with Instagram, Facebook's photo-sharing app, for those looking for a cleaner getaway.   Step 1: Assess what you might lose   Before you commit to breaking up with Facebook, it's important to handicap the potential collateral damage. Some products and services are deeply integrated with Facebook and could become difficult to use without the social networking account.   The quickest way to test the waters is to deactivate your Facebook account, which is essentially an account suspension that can immediately be reversed. To deactivate, you simply click through your settings and select ''Manage Your Account.'' Then click the button marked ''Deactivate your account.''   When I did that, I noticed I could no longer run Instagram ads to promote my dog's Instagram account because the advertising tools are directly tied to Facebook. So if you are a business owner who advertises products on Instagram, deleting Facebook would cut off that marketing channel.   Deactivating my account also broke access to apps and websites that I used my Facebook account to sign up for. I found I could no longer easily get into Pinterest because I had used my Facebook account to register for the virtual scrapbooking service. To regain access, I reactivated my Facebook account and then went into my Pinterest settings. Once there, I disconnected the Pinterest account from Facebook and reset my Pinterest password. Then I logged back in to Pinterest with my email address instead.   For other apps, like Spotify and ChefSteps, I similarly disconnected the apps from my Facebook account. Then I reset the passwords for those services to regain access with my email address.   Doing all of that was a pain. But the exercise was worth it to ensure I wouldn't break my accounts for other sites.   Step 2: Download your data   Now that I knew I could safely delete Facebook, I started pulling my data out of the social network. That means any personal information that I had collected in my account, including my photos, message transcripts and friends list, and that I did not already have copies of elsewhere.   To help with this, Facebook offers a comprehensive tool called Download Your Information, which can be found in the site's settings. Using this tool, you can decide what types of data you want to grab.   I requested a copy of all my data. Facebook took about an hour to assemble all the information into one file that measured about 700 megabytes. The file took about 10 minutes to download, and the information was organized into folders for different types of data, like photos, search history and messages.   Pulling your information off Facebook doesn't mean you are removing it from the company's servers, though. More on that in a bit.   Step 3: Hit the delete button   After making sure I had a copy of all the Facebook data I cared about, it was time to do the deed. In Facebook's settings menu, I clicked the button ''Your Facebook information'' and then clicked ''Delete Your Account and Information.''   Finally, I clicked on the blue ''Delete Account"" button. A prompt popped up asking for my password. Then a box showed up warning that deletion was permanent. I wasn't fazed -- and hit the button.   Step 4: Resist getting back together   But wait. After hitting delete, my Facebook account was not actually erased, despite all the hoops I had jumped through. The site said that my account was scheduled for permanent deletion after 30 days, and that if I logged in again, I would have the option to cancel the deletion request.   This grace period is here so people can change their minds. In addition, the entire deletion process may take up to 90 days to purge all backups of your data from the company's servers, according to Facebook. In other words, be patient.   Step 5: Delete Instagram   If you also want to get away from Facebook's clutches by removing your Instagram account, that process is much easier. That's because Instagram is not nearly as wide-reaching as Facebook; you don't use your Instagram account to log in to other apps, for instance.   Here are the steps: Inside the photo app's settings, you can select an option to download a copy of your data. From there, Instagram will email a link to download the file. This process took about 10 minutes for my account. Then you can visit the Delete Your Account webpage and click through the buttons to kill your account.   I confess I did not personally follow through with this. I kept my Instagram account because I like keeping in touch with friends there.   Step 6: Ensure there is no tracking   After ending a romantic relationship, have you ever blocked your ex on Facebook so that he or she can't follow you around? You should do the same after breaking up with Facebook to make sure the site stops tracking your browsing activities.   Be extra thorough about eliminating tracking methods that Facebook and other sites use to follow you. That includes clearing your web cookies, resetting your advertising identifier and installing a tracker blocker. For these steps, follow my previous guide about fighting targeted ads to safeguard your smartphone, tablet or computer.   After I completed these steps myself, there was no sense of closure as I had expected. That's probably because I knew I might end up reversing the Facebook deletion for the sake of writing instructive articles like this one. I have 30 days to decide.    "
Meet the Hacker Kids,"In August, a young hacker named Emmett Brewer (above right) made news headlines around the country by hacking into a simulated version of Florida's election-results website -- in just 10 minutes. Emmett, 11, was participating in an event for kids at Def Con, a hacking conference held each year in Las Vegas. The goal of the event, Emmett says, was to test parts of the United States' election process and to expose its potential technical vulnerabilities. (If hackers could gain access to and manipulate actual voting machines, for example, they could control the outcome of an election.) ''I changed everyone else's votes to zero, added my name, then gave myself billions of votes,'' he explains.     Hackers are often portrayed as people who like to cause trouble online -- by trolling, harassing or stealing data. For kids like Emmett, though, the appeal is very different from those stereotypes. ''I really like programming and coding,'' he says, adding that an interest in hacking can be a good way to learn those skills. There's also a strong sense of camaraderie among the hacking community. A portion of Def Con, called R00tz Asylum, is designed just for kids -- and drew over 300 participants, some as young as 8. ''I like the idea of being able to socialize with other young kids about hacking and electronics,'' Emmett says.    In some ways, spending so much time thinking about computer systems can lead kids away from online trends. A 17-year-old hacker at the conference known as CyFi (above left) -- because of privacy concerns, she asked to be identified only by her handle -- says that she avoids social media and other online databases as much as she possibly can. ''My friends have definitely been frustrated with my lack of social media,'' she says. ''But the less data there is about you out in the world, the less people can try to mess with you.''   Emmett agrees. ''My friends put everything up on the internet,'' he says, ''but I'm more mindful.'' â--[#x160]    "
Google Is Teaching Children How to Act Online. Is It the Best Role Model?,"Google is on a mission to teach children how to be safe online. That is the message behind ""Be Internet Awesome,"" a so-called digital-citizenship education program that the technology giant developed for schools. The lessons include a cartoon game branded with Google's logo and blue, red, yellow and green color palette. The game is meant to help students from third grade through sixth guard against schemers, hackers and other bad actors.  Google plans to reachfive million schoolchildren with the program this year and has teamed up with the National Parent Teacher Association to offer related workshops to parents. But critics say the company's recent woes -- including revelations that it was developing a censored version of its search engine for the Chinese market and had tracked the whereabouts of users who had explicitly turned off their location history -- should disqualify Google from promoting itself in schools as a model of proper digital conduct.   Among other things, these critics argue, the company's lessons give children the mistaken impression that the main threat they face online is from malicious hackers and bullies, glossing over the privacy concerns that arise when tech giants like Google itself collect users' personal information and track their actions online. As an analysis of Google's curriculum published in Emerging Library &amp; Information Perspectives, a graduate student journal at Western University in Ontario, put it, ""'Be Internet Awesome' generally presents Google as impartial and trustworthy, which is especially problematic given that the target audience is impressionable youth."" In a statement, Julianne Yi, who leads the Google program, said it had ""proven useful to kids, teachers, and families around the world,"" and was supported by, among others, the National P.T.A., the International Society for Technology in Education and the Family Online Safety Institute. Of those groups, Google is a national sponsor of the National P.T.A., a financial supporter of theFamily Online Safety Institute and a year-round mission sponsor of the International Society for Technology in Education, which promotes the use of technology in public schools.  Jim Accomando, the president of the National P.T.A., said that the organization ""does not endorse any commercial product or service,"" although companies that give money to the group may receive ""promotional consideration."" ""Google is a great example of a partner that aligns with our goals, and they have deep tech knowledge that they bring to the table,"" he said. What Is the Program? The cartoon game, Interland, offers an animated world ""presented by Google."" In it, children navigate spammers and hackers in ""Reality River"" and consider who in their social network can see what they post online on ""Mindful Mountain."" The game, which comes with a lesson plan and classroom activities, is meant to teach children ""the fundamentals of digital citizenship and safety so they can explore the online world with confidence,"" according to Google's site description. Once students learn skills like how to create strong passwords and not share information with strangers, the program encourages them to be ""fearless"" online explorers. Kerry Gallagher, an assistant principal at St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Mass., said Google's program helped students learn concrete ways to be safer and kinder online. ""Rather than being a bystander, they feel as though they have the skills to intervene"" when they observe other children being mean online, Ms. Gallagher said. She added that younger students also gained a ""better sense for who they should share things with and who they shouldn't, depending on what that content is."" Ms. Gallagher also works as the kindergarten through 12th grade education director at ConnectSafely, a Silicon Valley nonprofit group that receives financing from Google. She said Google had paid for her air travel, lodging and meals to speak at events. Educational Tool or Ad?  Google's name appears on every screen of Interland and the program's certificates, which also incorporate Google's colors. The curriculum features cartoon robots that resemble the company's Android robot icon.  To some observers, the game is essentially a big ad for Google. David Monahan, campaign manager at the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit advocacy group, likened the program to asking Budweiser to talk to parents and children about underage drinking. ""There is an increasing awareness of the fact that all these supposedly free platforms are not free and that all of us are being tracked and our information is really the commodity we're paying,"" Mr. Monahan said. ""This seems like the wrong time to be pushing resources that tell kids to be brave and fearless on the internet without telling them to be cautious and without giving them the information they really need."" This month, Kevin Hodgson, a public-school teacher in western Massachusetts, is teaching his sixth-grade class how to navigate the internet. Google materials are not part of the lesson plan. Mr. Hodgson said the company's program offered students some important information, and he specifically cited the tips on how to create stronger passwords. But he said Google was defining privacy too narrowly by focusing on what users share, while failing to teach children how companies constantly track users' activities and amass their personal data to show them ads.  Mr. Hodgson said one practice he taught his students was how to change online default settings that are often preset to allow for maximum data collection by companies. He said he also taught students how to navigate online platforms that can feature negative user comments, like Google's YouTube, which he knows they use even though they're not supposed to. And he talks about privacy-preserving online tools, like the search engine DuckDuckGo,which does not track users around the web. ""We are helping them become more knowledgeable about what the digital landscape is like,"" Mr. Hodgson said of his students, ""so they can make choices about what they use and what they don't use."" Ms. Yi of Google said the company was aware that multiple efforts were needed to help children learn to navigate the digital world. In addition to ""Be Internet Awesome,"" she said, ""we've also built products like Family Link, which lets parents supervise their kids' Google accounts; have hosted online safety school assemblies for years; and will continue to develop new tools and resources for kids, parents and educators."" A History of Corporate Influence in Classrooms  American corporate giants are no strangers to the country's schools. In the 1970s, General Motors circulated a free booklet in public schools that featured cartoon characters like Harry Hydrocarbon, who played down concerns about the health risks of industrial pollution and suggested that air pollution would soon not be a problem, according to a 1979 report, ""Hucksters in the Classroom: A Review of Industry Propaganda in Schools."" In the 1990s, Procter &amp; Gamble promoted its own curriculum, ""Decision: Earth,"" in schools. Among other things, it instructed children that synthetic diapers were no more harmful for the environment than cloth diapers. Around the same time, Campbell Soup sponsored a classroom kit called the ""Prego Thickness Experiment."" According to a 1997 article in The New York Times, ""Corporate Classrooms and Commercialism,"" the kit was supposed to teach children the scientific method -- by having them ""prove"" that Prego pasta sauce was thicker than rival Ragu. Critics see a similar self-serving agenda with ""Be Internet Awesome,"" which presents malicious third parties as the primary online threat to children, while failing to teach them how to navigate corporate data-mining practices. ""The best solution would be for this kind of training to be undertaken by an organization less invested in how consumers conceive of privacy on the internet,"" the authors of the journal article wrote. ""At the very least, 'Be Internet Awesome' should have significantly less Google branding.""  Google's Emphasis on Education Tech companies have been competing for years to win over young students as lifelong customers. In the past few years, Google has dominated the competition for classroom influence in the United States, outpacing rivals like Apple and Microsoft in the number of children who use its apps and laptops in schools. It has taken the lead partly by developing useful products specifically for teachers and students, rather than simply repurposing its consumer or business tools for school use. Millions of students now use Google Classroom, a classroom-management system that allows teachers to assign and correct lessons online.  But even teachers like Mr. Hodgson, who uses Google tools with his students, are leery of the company's presence in schools. ""Maybe it has some good for the public if you use it in certain ways,"" he said of the ""Be Internet Awesome"" program. But, he added, ""it reinforces the footprint that Google already has and doesn't want to lose.""

"Germany Acts to Tame Facebook, Learning From Its Own History of Hate","BERLIN -- Security is tight at this brick building on the western edge of Berlin. Inside, a sign warns: ""Everybody without a badge is a potential spy!"" Spread over five floors, hundreds of men and women sit in rows of six scanning their computer screens. All have signed nondisclosure agreements. Four trauma specialists are at their disposal seven days a week. They are the agents of Facebook. And they have the power to decide what is free speech and what is hate speech. This is a deletion center, one of Facebook's largest, with more than 1,200 content moderators. They are cleaning up content -- from terrorist propaganda to Nazi symbols to child abuse -- that violates the law or the company's community standards.  Germany, home to a tough new online hate speech law, has become a laboratory for one of the most pressing issues for governments today: how and whether to regulate the world's biggest social network. Around the world, Facebook and other social networking platforms are facing a backlash over their failures to safeguard privacy, disinformation campaigns and the digital reach of hate groups. In India, seven people were beaten to death after a false viral message on the Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp. In Myanmar, violence against the Rohingya minority was fueled, in part, by misinformation spread on Facebook. In the United States, Congress called Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to testify about the company's inability to protect its users' privacy. As the world confronts these rising forces, Europe, and Germany in particular, have emerged as the de facto regulators of the industry, exerting influence beyond their own borders. Berlin's digital crackdown on hate speech, which took effect on Jan. 1, is being closely watched by other countries. And German officials are playing a major role behind one of Europe's most aggressive moves to rein in technology companies, strict data privacy rules that take effect across the European Union on May 25 and are prompting global changes. ""For them, data is the raw material that makes them money,"" said Gerd Billen, secretary of state in Germany's Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection. ""For us, data protection is a fundamental right that underpins our democratic institutions."" Germany's troubled history has placed it on the front line of a modern tug-of-war between democracies and digital platforms. In the country of the Holocaust, the commitment against hate speech is as fierce as the commitment to free speech. Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" is only available in an annotated version. Swastikas are illegal. Inciting hatred is punishable by up to five years in jail. But banned posts, pictures and videos have routinely lingered on Facebook and other social media platforms. Now companies that systematically fail to remove ""obviously illegal"" content within 24 hours face fines of up to 50 million euros. The deletion center predates the legislation, but its efforts have taken on new urgency. Every day content moderators in Berlin, hired by a third-party firm and working exclusively on Facebook, pore over thousands of posts flagged by users as upsetting or potentially illegal and make a judgment: Ignore, delete or, in particularly tricky cases, ""escalate"" to a global team of Facebook lawyers with expertise in German regulation. Some decisions to delete are easy. Posts about Holocaust denial and genocidal rants against particular groups like refugees are obvious ones for taking down. Others are less so. On Dec. 31, the day before the new law took effect, a far-right lawmaker reacted to an Arabic New Year's tweet from the Cologne police, accusing them of appeasing ""barbaric, Muslim, gang-raping groups of men."" The request to block a screenshot of the lawmaker's post wound up in the queue of Nils, a 35-year-old agent in the Berlin deletion center. His judgment was to let it stand. A colleague thought it should come down. Ultimately, the post was sent to lawyers in Dublin, London, Silicon Valley and Hamburg. By the afternoon it had been deleted, prompting a storm of criticism about the new legislation, known here as the ""Facebook Law."" ""A lot of stuff is clear-cut,"" Nils said. Facebook, citing his safety, did not allow him to give his surname. ""But then there is the borderline stuff."" Complicated cases have raised concerns that the threat of the new rules' steep fines and 24-hour window for making decisions encourage ""over-blocking"" by companies, a sort of defensive censorship of content that is not actually illegal. The far-right Alternative for Germany, a noisy and prolific user of social media, has been quick to proclaim ""the end of free speech."" Human rights organizations have warned that the legislation was inspiring authoritarian governments to copy it. Other people argue that the law simply gives a private company too much authority to decide what constitutes illegal hate speech in a democracy, an argument that Facebook, which favored voluntary guidelines, made against the law. ""It is perfectly appropriate for the German government to set standards,"" said Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and public policy. ""But we think it's a bad idea for the German government to outsource the decision of what is lawful and what is not."" Richard Allan, Facebook's vice president for public policy in Europe and the leader of the company's lobbying effort against the German legislation, put it more simply: ""We don't want to be the arbiters of free speech."" German officials counter that social media platforms are the arbiters anyway. It all boils down to one question, said Mr. Billen, who helped draw up the new legislation: ""Who is sovereign? Parliament or Facebook?"" Learning From (German) History When Nils applied for a job at the deletion center, the first question the recruiter asked him was: ""Do you know what you will see here?"" Nils has seen it all. Child torture. Mutilations. Suicides. Even murder: He once saw a video of a man cutting a heart out of a living human being. And then there is hate. ""You see all the ugliness of the world here,"" Nils said. ""Everyone is against everyone else. Everyone is complaining about that other group. And everyone is saying the same horrible things."" The issue is deeply personal for Nils. He has a 4-year-old daughter. ""I'm also doing this for her,"" he said. The center here is run by Arvato, a German service provider owned by the conglomerate Bertelsmann. The agents have a broad purview, reviewing content from a half-dozen countries. Those with a focus on Germany must know Facebook's community standards and, as of January, the basics of German hate speech and defamation law. ""Two agents looking at the same post should come up with the same decision,"" says Karsten König, who manages Arvato's partnership with Facebook. The Berlin center opened with 200 employees in 2015, as Germany was opening its doors to hundreds of thousands of migrants. That year a selfie went viral. Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee, posed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and posted the image on Facebook. It instantly became a symbol of her decision to allowing in hundreds of thousands of migrants. Soon it also became a symbol of the backlash. The image showed up in false reports linking Mr. Modamani to terrorist attacks in Brussels and on a Christmas market in Berlin. He sought an injunction against Facebook to stop such posts from being shared but eventually lost. The arrival of nearly 1.4 million migrants in Germany has tested the country's resolve to keep a tight lid on hate speech. The law on illegal speech was long-established but enforcement in the digital realm was scattershot before the new legislation. Posts calling refugees rapists, Neanderthals and scum survived for weeks, according to jugendschutz.net, a publicly funded internet safety organization. Many were never taken down. Researchers at jugendschutz.net reported a tripling in observed hate speech in the second half of 2015. Mr. Billen, the secretary of state in charge of the new law, was alarmed. In September 2015, he convened executives from Facebook and other social media sites at the justice ministry, a building that was once the epicenter of state propaganda for the Communist East. A task force for fighting hate speech was created. A couple of months later, Facebook and other companies signed a joint declaration, promising to ""examine flagged content and block or delete the majority of illegal posts within 24 hours."" But the problem did not go away. Over the 15 months that followed, independent researchers, hired by the government, twice posed as ordinary users and flagged illegal hate speech. During the tests, they found that Facebook had deleted 46 percent and 39 percent. ""They knew that they were a platform for criminal behavior and for calls to commit criminal acts, but they presented themselves to us as a wolf in sheep skin,"" said Mr. Billen, a poker-faced civil servant with stern black frames on his glasses. By March 2017, the German government had lost patience and started drafting legislation. The Network Enforcement Law was born, setting out 21 types of content that are ""manifestly illegal"" and requiring social media platforms to act quickly. Officials say early indications suggest the rules have served their purpose. Facebook's performance on removing illegal hate speech in Germany rose to 100 percent over the past year, according to the latest spot check of the European Union. Platforms must publish biannual reports on their efforts. The first is expected in July. At Facebook's Berlin offices, Mr. Allan acknowledged that under the earlier voluntary agreement, the company had not acted decisively enough at first. ""It was too little and it was too slow,"" he said. But, he added, ""that has changed."" He cited another independent report for the European Commission from last summer that showed Facebook was by then removing 80 percent of hate speech posts in Germany. The reason for the improvement was not German legislation, he said, but a voluntary code of conduct with the European Union. Facebook's results have improved in all European countries, not just in Germany, Mr. Allan said. ""There was no need for legislation,"" he said. Mr. Billen disagrees. ""They could have prevented the law,"" he said. YouTube scored 90 percent in last year's monitoring exercise. If other platforms had done the same, there would be no law today, he said. A Regulatory Dilemma Germany's hard-line approach to hate speech and data privacy once made it an outlier in Europe. The country's stance is now more mainstream, an evolution seen in the justice commissioner in Brussels. Vera Jourova, the justice commissioner, deleted her Facebook account in 2015 because she could not stand the hate anymore. ""It felt good,"" she said about pressing the button. She added: ""It felt like taking back control."" But Ms. Jourova, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in what is now the Czech Republic, had long been skeptical about governments legislating any aspect of free speech, including hate speech. Her father lost his job after making a disparaging comment about the Soviet invasion in 1968, barring her from going to university until she married and took her husband's name. ""I lived half my life in the atmosphere driven by Soviet propaganda,"" she said. ""The golden principle was: If you repeat a lie a hundred times it becomes the truth."" When Germany started considering a law, she instead preferred a voluntary code of conduct. In 2016, platforms like Facebook promised European users easy reporting tools and committed to removing most illegal posts brought to their attention within 24 hours. The approach worked well enough, Ms. Jourova said. It was also the quickest way to act because the 28 member states in the European Union differed so much about whether and how to legislate. But the stance of many governments toward Facebook has hardened since it emerged that the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of up to 87 million users. Representatives of the European Parliament have asked Mr. Zuckerberg to come to Brussels to ""clarify issues related to the use of personal data"" and he has agreed to come as soon as next week. Ms. Jourova, whose job is to protect the data of over 500 million Europeans, has hardened her stance as well. ""Our current system relies on trust and this did nothing to improve trust,"" she said. ""The question now is how do we continue?"" The European Commission is considering German-style legislation for online content related to terrorism, violent extremism and child pornography, including a provision that would include fines for platforms that did not remove illegal content within an hour of being alerted to it. Several countries -- France, Israel, Italy, and Canada among them -- have sent queries to the German government about the impact of the new hate speech law. And Germany's influence is evident in Europe's new privacy regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R.. The rules give people control over how their information is collected and used. [Here's what G.D.P.R. means for you, and the internet.] Inspired in part by German data protection laws written in the 1980s, the regulation has been shaped by a number of prominent Germans. Ms. Jourova's chief of staff, Renate Nikolay, is German, as is her predecessor's chief of staff, Martin Selmayr, now the European Commission's secretary general. The lawmaker in charge of the regulation in the European Parliament is German, too. ""We have built on the German tradition of data protection as a constitutional right and created the most modern piece of regulation of the digital economy,"" Ms. Nikolay said. ""To succeed in the long-term companies needs the trust of customers,"" she said. ""At the latest since Cambridge Analytica it has become clear that data protection is not just some nutty European idea, but a matter of competitiveness."" On March 26, Ms. Jourova wrote a letter -- by post, not email -- to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. ""Is there a need for stricter rules for platforms like those that exist for traditional media?"" she asked. ""Is the data of Europeans affected by the current scandal?"" she added, referring to the Cambridge Analytica episode. And, if so, ""How do you plan to inform the user about this?"" She demanded a reply within two weeks, and she got one. Some 2.7 million Europeans were affected, Ms. Sandberg wrote. But she never answered Ms. Jourova's question on regulation. ""There is now a sense of urgency and the conviction that we are dealing with something very dangerous that may threaten the development of free democracies,"" said Ms. Jourova, who is also trying to find ways to clamp down on fake news and disinformation campaigns. ""We want the tech giants to respect and follow our legislation,"" she added. ""We want them to show social responsibility both on data protection and on hate speech."" So do many Facebook employees, Mr. Allan, the company executive, said. ""We employ very thoughtful and principled people,"" he said. ""They work here because they want to make the world a better place, so when an assumption is made that the product they work on is harming people it is impactful."" ""People have felt this criticism very deeply,"" he said. A Visual Onslaught Nils works eight-hour shifts. On busy days, 1,500 user reports are in his queue. Other days, there are only 300. Some of his colleagues have nightmares about what they see. Every so often someone breaks down. A mother recently left her desk in tears after watching a video of a child being sexually abused. A young man felt physically sick after seeing a video of a dog being tortured. The agents watch teenagers self-mutilating and girls recounting rape. They have weekly group sessions with a psychologist and the trauma specialists on standby. In more serious cases, the center teams up with clinics in Berlin. In the office, which is adorned with Facebook logos, fresh fruit is at the agents' disposal in a small room where subdued colors and decorative moss growing on the walls are meant to calm fraying nerves. To decompress, the agents sometimes report each other's posts, not because they are controversial, but ""just for a laugh,"" said another agent, the son of a Lebanese refugee and an Arabic-speaker who has had to deal with content related to terrorism generally and the Islamic State specifically. By now, he said, images of ""weird skin diseases"" affected him more than those of a beheading. Nils finds sports injuries like breaking bones particularly disturbing. There is a camaraderie in the office and a real sense of mission: Nils said the agents were proud to ""help clean up the hate."" The definition of hate is constantly evolving. The agents, who initially take a three-week training course, get frequent refreshers. Their guidelines are revised to reflect hate speech culture. Events change the meaning of words. New hashtags and online trends must be put in context. ""Slurs can become socialized,"" Mr. Allan of Facebook explained. ""Refugee"" became a group protected from the broad hate speech rules only in 2015. ""Nafri"" was a term used by the German police that year to describe North Africans who sexually harassed hundreds of women, attacking and, in some cases, raping them. Since then, Nafri has become a popular insult among the far-right. Nils and his colleagues must determine whether hateful content is singling out an ethnic group or individuals. That was the challenge with a message on Twitter that was later posted to Facebook as a screenshot by Beatrix von Storch, deputy floor leader of the far-right party, AfD. ""What the hell is wrong with this country?"" Ms. von Storch wrote on Dec. 31. ""Why is an official police account tweeting in Arabic?"" ""Do you think that will appease the barbaric murdering Muslim group-raping gangs of men?"" she continued. A user reported the post as a violation of German law, and it landed in Nils's queue. He initially decided to ignore the request because he felt Ms. von Storch was directing her insults at the men who had sexually assaulted women two years earlier. Separately, a user reported the post as a violation of community standards. Another agent leaned toward deleting it, taking it as directed at Muslims in general. They conferred with their ""subject matter expert,"" who escalated it to a team in Dublin. For 24 hours, the post kept Facebook lawyers from Silicon Valley to Hamburg busy. The Dublin team decided that the post did not violate community standards but sent it on for legal assessment by outside lawyers hired by Facebook in Germany. Within hours of news that the German police were opening a criminal investigation into Ms. von Storch over her comments, Facebook restricted access to the post. The user who reported the content was notified that it had been blocked for a violation of section 130 of the German criminal code, incitement to hatred. Ms. von Storch was also notified too. In the first few days of the year, it looked like the platforms were erring on the side of censorship. On Jan. 2, a day after Ms. von Storch's post was deleted, the satirical magazine Titanic quipped that she would be its new guest tweeter. Two of the magazine's subsequent Twitter posts mocking her were deleted. When Titanic published them again, its account was temporarily suspended. Since then, things have calmed down. And even Mr. Allan conceded: ""The law has not materially changed the amount of content that is deleted."" Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

Cathay Pacific Admits Breach Exposed Data Of 9.4 Million,"Follow Raymond Zhong on Twitter: @zhonggg. Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based international airline, acknowledged on Wednesday that its computer system had been compromised at least seven months ago, exposing the personal data and travel histories of as many as 9.4 million people.  The breach involved private user information, including phone numbers, dates of birth, frequent flier membership numbers and passport and government ID numbers, as well as information on passengers' past travels. The airline said that 27 credit card numbers -- but not their corresponding security codes -- had been obtained, as had 403 expired credit card numbers.    The company said that no passwords were compromised, and that the breach would not affect flight operations or safety. It said it learned in May that passenger data had been exposed after first discovering suspicious activity on its network in March. It did not immediately respond when asked whether it had any indication of who was responsible, and why it did not announce the breach earlier.   ''The safety and security of our passengers remains our top priority,'' said Rupert Hogg, the carrier's chief executive.   As Asia's economic might has grown over the last half-century, Cathay has become a major carrier in the region, one known globally for its customer service. Last year it carried nearly 35 million passengers to around 200 destinations in more than 50 countries or territories. But the security breach has come at a tough time for the company, which counts the state-backed carrier Air China as a major shareholder.   Cathay has faced growing competition in the region from low-cost carriers and other emerging rivals, and has been losing money for the past two years. Its shares fell in Hong Kong trading on Thursday.   Airlines are juicy targets for hackers, with their vast stores of information not only on people's identities and credit cards, but also on where they have been.   In an era when issues of data protection have come to the fore in Washington and other global capitals, the Cathay breach does not stand out for its scale. The airline said in a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that around 860,000 passport numbers and 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers had been exposed. By contrast, the security breach discovered by Facebook last month involved 50 million user accounts.   Still, the types of information in Cathay's systems that were compromised could be particularly useful to malicious agents. Names, birthdays, travel itineraries and passport details could be used to reset passwords or obtain private financial information.   Last month, British Airways said that criminals had stolen data on people who booked flights on its website or app during a roughly two-week period in August and September. That security breach exposed personal and financial details, the airline said, but not travel or passport information.   Delta Air Lines said earlier this year that customer payment information had been exposed after a security breach at a company that provided online chat services for it. In that case, no customers' passport details were compromised, Delta said.    "

Protecting Yourself From Ransomware,"Q. What kind of software should I use to protect my computer from ransomware?  A. An up-to-date anti-malware program running on your computer is one way to help block ransomware -- that malicious software that wants to invade your system and encrypt your files with demands for payment to release them. Several companies make programs that guard against ransomware and other threats, like Bitdefender Antivirus Plus and Webroot Secure Anywhere Antivirus (both less than $40). PCMag.com is one site that regularly reviews and rates new security software, and you can find reviews from other technology sites around the web.     If you want a specific program to protect your files from online hijacking, you have options there, too. ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware is available to download with a free 30-day trial, Trend Micro's  page has free or trial ransomware protection programs, and Bitdefender has a free Anti-Ransomware Tool of its own.   Most ransomware programs are aimed at Windows computers, and Microsoft has its own  online guide to protecting your PC from ransomware. The company also includes its Windows Defender Security Center utility for protecting Windows 10 if you do not want to install a third-party program.   Macs are a smaller target for most virus writers, but Mac-specific ransomware is out there. If Apple's built-in protections for its operating system do not put the mind at ease, commercial Mac security software is readily available; Bitdefender and Webroot make Mac versions of their programs, too.   In addition to security software, assuming a stance of ''defensive computing'' can help shield you from internet scammers. Steer clear of links and file attachments in messages from people you do not know (or from friends who do not seem to be themselves, possibly because of hacking). Keep your system files backed up regularly so you have copies in case something does happen to your system. The Federal Trade Commission's OnGuard Online site has tips and videos on protecting yourself from ransomware and other internet threats.

How to Bolster Your Email Defenses,"Q. Could you please review best practices if one's email is hacked? Is changing the password for that email sufficient? Is it necessary to change the email address (use a whole new email) for each site, like Amazon, that uses the hacked email as the user login?  A. If you still have access to the compromised account, changing the password is one of many steps you should take to protect yourself. If you are having trouble regaining control of the account, visit your mail provider's site for instructions on recovering your account. Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all have guides on their sites, as should other email and internet service providers. Tell your friends that your account was hacked and to ignore any odd messages that appear to have come from you.    Your account may have been hacked through malicious software, so scan your computer for malware and viruses with a security program. If you do not have security software installed, you can use Microsoft's built-in Windows Defender or Microsoft Security Essentials. Avast and AVG are among the many companies that make free basic antivirus software for Windows and Mac. Malwarebytes has free and trial versions of its malware-scanning program for Windows and Mac that can work alongside antivirus software. You should also update your computer and devices with the latest security updates.   Next, check your mail settings to make sure nothing has been changed -- like copies of your messages set to forward to an unfamiliar addresses, unfamiliar entries in your address book, or new links or information added to your email signature file. Take this opportunity to change and update your security questions and answers that your provider uses to confirm your identity if you use the Forgot Password option.   While you are in your mail settings, set up two-factor authentication or two-step verification if you have not already and the feature is available from your mail provider. You will need to provide a code or acknowledge a login attempt on another device after you enter your password, but the extra step helps keep your account more secure.   If you have rescued your account and bolstered its defenses, you should be able to keep using the address as a login for other sites, but go in and change the password you used with it, along with all the other passwords for other sites where you used the address as your login. You should also update any site where you repeatedly used the same password as the one for the hacked mail account.   The Federal Trade Commission has an online guide to dealing with a hacked mail account. And to avoid being hacked again, follow basic precautions like avoiding public wireless networks without using a virtual private network.   ______   Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Cyberattack Shows Vulnerability of Gas Pipeline Network,"HOUSTON -- A cyberattack on a shared data network forced four of the nation's natural-gas pipeline operators to temporarily shut down computer communications with their customers over the last week. No gas service was interrupted, the companies said, and the interruption of customer transactions was merely a precaution. It was unclear whether any customer data was stolen. The attack highlighted the potential vulnerability of the nation's energy system, cyberexperts say. Beyond consumer and business data -- energy companies possess much proprietary information about their holdings, trading strategies and exploration and production technologies -- the increasing dependence of pipeline infrastructure on digital systems makes them a particularly ripe target. Control valves, pressure monitors and other equipment connected to wireless networks are vital to daily functions of everything from refineries to oil wells.  With nearly 2.5 million miles of oil, gas and chemical pipelines crisscrossing the country, intrusions into control systems could do more than disrupt deliveries, said Andrew R. Lee, a cybersecurity expert at the law firm Jones Walker in New Orleans. The risks include ""explosions, spills, or fires, which easily will threaten human life, property and the environment,"" he said. Nothing close to that kind of disaster happened this time. But the pipeline industry leaders Oneok; Energy Transfer Partners; Boardwalk Pipeline Partners; and Eastern Shore Natural Gas, a Chesapeake Utilities subsidiary, all reported communications system interruptions. The attack's target appears to have been Latitude Technologies, a Texas-based provider of electronic data-sharing between pipeline companies and their gas producer and utility customers. The company handles the critical computer communications of gas storage facilities, as well as sales contracts and shipment scheduling. Chris Bronk, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Houston, said such attacks on the gas marketing communications hub is a way to gather intelligence on the entire gas industry. ""If I compromise their operations, I can see all the buyers and sellers,"" he said. ""If I can persistently be in their network I can issue fake transactions."" In that way, Mr. Bronk added, hackers could potentially jumble gas shipments, and even cause electricity production outages. Latitude Technologies, a unit of Energy Services Group, declined to discuss the disruption in detail. In a statement, it said, ""We do not believe any customer data was compromised."" The Department of Homeland Security was investigating the attack, and no suspect has been publicly identified. But the attack came shortly after the department and the F.B.I. issued a report alleging that Russia was taking aim at the electric grid and other critical infrastructure with cyber probes. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology released a staff report this month that described Russian efforts to influence American energy markets and energy policy through inflammatory posts on social media. The motivation for such efforts appeared to be the increase in exports of liquefied natural gas from the United States, a challenge to Russian dominance in European markets. Cybercriminals, frequently suspected of working for foreign governments, have been increasingly active in the energy sector in recent years. Last fall, hackers penetrated safety systems of a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia, the latest in a spate of increasingly sophisticated attacks on the kingdom's energy infrastructure. An attack on Ukraine's grid in 2015 led to extensive blackouts. American gas pipeline companies were targeted in 2012, although the damage was believed to have been limited. Employees of several pipeline companies have been targets of spear-phishing attacks -- efforts to lure them to click on email attachments containing malicious code. The Trump administration has announced that it is establishing an office within the Department of Energy to shore up cybersecurity for critical infrastructure like nuclear plants, refineries and pipelines.

"YouTube Is Improperly Collecting Children's Data, Consumer Groups Say","A coalition of more than 20 consumer advocacy groups is expected to file a complaint with federal officials on Monday claiming that YouTube has been violating a children's privacy law. The complaint contends that YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, has been collecting and profiting from the personal information of young children on its main site, although the company says the platform is meant only for users 13 and older.    The coalition of consumer groups said YouTube failed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that requires companies to obtain consent from parents before collecting data on children younger than 13. The groups are asking for an investigation and penalties from the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the law.    ''Google has been continually growing its child-directed service in the United States and all over the world without any kind of acknowledgment of this law and its responsibilities,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of the groups leading the coalition. ''It's living in a world of online fiction and denied that it's serving children.''   YouTube defines its main site and app as destinations for viewers 13 and older. It directs younger children to the stand-alone YouTube Kids app, which contains a filtered set of videos from the main site.   YouTube's distinction between its main product and YouTube Kids is significant because of the rules on disclosure and parental consent that kick in for sites with ''actual knowledge'' that they are trafficking in the personal information of children under 13.   Those rules were first detailed in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, known as Coppa. The Federal Trade Commission expanded the act in 2012, noting that it needed to be updated for the age of mobile devices. The revised rules made clear that companies must obtain parental consent before collecting details that could be used to identify, contact or locate a child. These included photos, video, audio and the location of a child's mobile device.   In the complaint that will be filed on Monday with the commission, the advocacy groups say YouTube is able to collect data on children under 13 through its main site, where cartoons, nursery-rhyme videos and those ever-popular toy-unboxing clips garner millions of views.   YouTube's terms of service hold that visitors to its main site are affirming that they are at least 13 and agree to Google's privacy policy, which outlines how the company collects information on individuals and then tailors ads and services to them. By watching a YouTube video, the policy says, viewers give Google permission to collect data tied to their device, location, browsing habits, phone number and more.   The groups say this kind of tracking requires parental notification and consent first. While companies can collect some of that information from children to deliver relevant ads, they are supposed to obtain parental consent to use it for more tailored purposes, like behavioral advertising or profiles of individuals. The YouTube Kids app, for example, specifies in its privacy policy that it ''does not allow interest-based advertising or re-marketing.''   ''We haven't received the letter yet but look forward to reviewing it,'' a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission said in an email. She added that the commission took enforcement of Coppa ''very seriously'' and had brought more than two dozen cases tied to the rule.   YouTube provided an emailed statement that said the platform had not yet received the complaint but that ''protecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us.''   ''We will read the complaint thoroughly and evaluate if there are things we can do to improve,'' the company went on. ''Because YouTube is not for children, we've invested significantly in the creation of the YouTube Kids app to offer an alternative specifically designed for children.''   Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood who is also leading the coalition, said YouTube had been ''actively packaging under-13 content for advertisers.''   To bolster their case, the groups shared screenshots of Barbie advertisements set to appear between videos aimed at children. They also pointed to a number of channels for toddlers and preschoolers within ''Google Preferred,'' a collection of top videos on the main YouTube site and app that are vetted and packaged for advertisers.   As YouTube's popularity has surged, it has faced a string of issues related to content geared to children, from inappropriate videos that have appeared on its YouTube Kids app to deceptive advertising.   YouTube said this year that human beings working for the platform would screen all videos from creators whose work appeared on Google Preferred, which the consumer advocates cited as proof that Google employees ''have actual knowledge that the content is child-directed.'' YouTube has also brokered ad deals with toy companies like Mattel, and has noted how its video ads have helped children's channels attract specific audiences, like American parents with children under 5.   Mr. Golin said he believed that YouTube was aware it was collecting and monetizing the data of children with such videos, and that the company should simply shift all the videos aimed at children to the YouTube Kids app.   ''We know kids are primarily consuming this through iPads and mobile phones, which are not particularly conducive to group watching,'' Mr. Golin said.   The complaint comes during a public reckoning around the collection and use of personal data by technology companies after revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British political data firm, improperly harvested the information of possibly more than 80 million Facebook users. It also strikes a warning note for Google and YouTube overseas as Europe prepares to roll out new data privacy rules. Mr. Chester said the groups will encourage consumer advocates in Europe to file similar complaints about Google and YouTube under those rules, where penalties for companies will be stiff.   Dylan Collins, chief executive of SuperAwesome, a privacy technology firm used by companies that market to children, said questions around data collection would only grow as children continued to flood huge tech platforms that were built for adults.   ''Silicon Valley now has a responsibility to figure out how to move from building adult tech into building kid tech,'' Mr. Collins said. ''I don't think any company, whether it's Facebook or YouTube or Snapchat, can hide from the fact that there are about 10 times more kids online today than there were six or seven years ago when their products were being designed or built.''

The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s,"In the fall of 1965, President Lyndon Johnson's administration announced a plan to consolidate hundreds of federal databases into one centralized National Data Bank. It was meant as an efficiency move to make the Great Society even greater. But there were many Americans who were worried about privacy -- from civil rights leaders and student activists under surveillance by the F.B.I. to lawmakers who had begun to question J. Edgar Hoover's use of his electronic arsenal -- and the National Data Bank confirmed their darkest fears. In the years that followed, Congress convened headline-making hearings, slamming the databank idea and warning of government information-gathering run amok.  The privacy warriors of the 1960s would have been astounded by what the tech industry has become. They would be more amazed to realize that the policy choices they made back then -- to demand data transparency rather than limit data collection, and to legislate the behavior of government but not private industry -- enabled today'stech giants to become as large and powerful as they are. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to question Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, over allegations of bias in its algorithms, and energized Democrats are vowing to turn up the heat on tech companies over antitrust and privacy when they take over House leadership in January. There is a growing recognition in Silicon Valley and Washington that current data privacy regulations need to be changed. Understanding how American lawmakers approached these issues in the past is essential to getting it right this time. The mid-1960s were the heyday of punch-card-powered mainframe computers. In the two decades since their invention, digital machines had proved capable of processing a dizzying amount of information. Much of this data was personal, from medical information to military records to the type of cereal families bought at the supermarket, and there were no legal limits on what kind of data could be collected or by whom. The targeted marketing business until then had been largely left alone by regulators because it was so inexact. The computer age, however, transformed consumer targeting into a far more powerful science. Worries about data privacy erupted in the spring of 1964 with the publication of ""The Naked Society,"" by Vance Packard, a journalist best known for his unsparing critique of modern advertising. ""The Naked Society"" made a comparable assessment of the marketing schemes of big corporations, noting their immense and profitable traffic in personal data about American consumers. But he trained most of his attention on the entity that was then the largest user of mainframe computing power: the United States government. Unnerving amounts of personal information now could be sucked into bureaucratic databases, Packard observed. ""There are banks of giant memory machines that conceivably could recall in a few seconds every pertinent action -- including failures, embarrassments or possibly incriminating acts -- from the lifetime of each citizen,"" he wrote. Packard hit a nerve. Congress convened a Special Subcommittee on the Invasion of Privacy and started hearings into the government's databank proposal in July 1966. The leading privacy crusader in the House, New Jersey's Neil Gallagher, was a Johnson ally who believed that the databank had some merit but that the plan didn't do enough to protect personal information. On the Senate side, North Carolina's Sam Ervin was a critic of the president's expansive domestic agenda and saw the databank as yet another sign of executive overreach. ""The computer never forgets,"" Ervin warned. Amid the growing distrust of the government's decisions in Vietnam, the threat of computer databases became irresistible media fodder. ""Would It Threaten Your Privacy?"" a headline in The New York Times asked. ""The names of most Americans appear repeatedly in government files,"" The Times noted, ""for a total of nearly 2.8 billion listings."" The uproar killed the National Data Bank. Over 100 pieces of data privacy legislation were introduced over the following years. The few that passed were landmarks -- the Freedom of Information Act in 1967, the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1970, and the Privacy Act in 1974 -- but all of them focused on individuals' right to know about the information these databases held. None addressed the question of whether this information should have been gathered in the first place. The push for data transparency rather than data restriction was in keeping with American legal precedents and political traditions that long predated the computer age. As the legal scholar Alan Westin observed in 1967, the United States cherished both individual privacy and the free flow of information, and the latter value usually prevailed. This was a contrast to Western Europe, where privacy was something to be carefully protected, and therefore treated with a far more robust regulatory approach. In being so relentlessly focused on the government's use and abuse of data, Congress paid little attention to what private industry was doing. American companies remained free to gather data on the people who used their products.  Congress is again wrestling with the balance between freedom of information and the right to privacy. Proposals for greater transparency -- such as labeling bots so people know when they are interacting with a machine, and providing access for consumers to the data that companies obtain about them -- are important first steps. But industry and lawmakers need to take a hard look at the data that companies are allowed to collect in the first place. Congress should recognize what it did not half a century ago: protecting privacy is bigger than quashing one databank, condemning one company or curbing one industry. And the decisions made now will shape technological generations to come. The computer never forgets.  PHOTO: A view of the F.B.I. National Crime Information Center in Washington in 1967.

"A Security Expert Tied to WikiLeaks Vanishes, and the Internet Is Abuzz","OSLO -- In a remote Norwegian town north of the Arctic Circle, a cybersecurity expert with ties to WikiLeaks checked out of a hotel, dressed in khaki hiking gear and carrying heavy baggage. That was on Aug. 20. No one has reported seeing him since. The disappearance of Arjen Kamphuis, 46, has so far flummoxed a widening police investigation that has chased stray clues and false leads in Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. Norwegian police have released statements saying that they have no idea whether he was a victim of foul play, but that they ""are open to all possibilities.""  The uncertainty, and Mr. Kamphuis's links to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that has run afoul of governments and other powerful interests, has the internet buzzing with conspiracy theories. Some suggest a kidnapping -- or worse -- involving Russia, the C.I.A., MI6, Islamists or the Clintons, while others ask if he intended to disappear, possibly on some secret assignment for WikiLeaks. Other spurs to speculation include that Bodo, the town where he was last seen, is home to Norway's main military air base, that the armed forces' joint operations center is nearby, and that part of the country's cyberdefense center is hidden in a mountain outside town. Investigators have ruled out any connection between the military presence and his disappearance. Friends say that Mr. Kamphuis, who is Dutch, was genuinely in Norway for vacation, had been there a few times before, and had plans to return to the Netherlands. ""He's an avid hiker and mountaineer,"" said Ancilla van de Leest, 33, a friend and prominent Dutch activist for online privacy rights. On Twitter, WikiLeaks described Mr. Kamphuis as an ""associate"" of Julian Assange, the group's founder. Mr. Assange has lived for years in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid arrest and what he fears would be extradition to the United States to face prosecution for publishing government secrets. But Mr. Kamphuis's precise relationship with WikiLeaks is unclear. Friends say he is not close to Mr. Assange, but he has reportedly offered training to WikiLeaks members relating to ""Information Security for Journalists,"" a handbook he co-wrote on how to shield communications and data from government surveillance. Bodo is on a peninsula bordering one of the hundreds of ocean inlets that crease Norway's mountainous, wooded coastline. Police have reported that before heading north, Mr. Kamphuis bought a foldable kayak from an outdoor equipment store in the Netherlands, and told the manager that he planned to paddle the fjords. After leaving the Scandic Hotel in Bodo on Aug. 20, Mr. Kamphuis had planned on taking a 10-hour train ride south to Trondheim, Norway, Ms. van de Leest said in a telephone interview. The Dutch police have said that he was booked on an Aug. 22 flight back to the Netherlands. He did not make the train or the plane, but he was not reported missing until Aug. 29, when friends and colleagues in the Netherlands alerted the Dutch police. At first, the case was not taken seriously, Ms. van der Leest complained. But as days passed and search crews in and around Bodo failed to turn up any sign of Mr. Kamphuis, the investigation intensified, spurred on by online publicity campaigns, most of them using the hashtag #FindArjen. The search has grown into a cross-border hunt for a man who specializes in evading detection. The Norwegian National Criminal Investigation Service, Kripos, has assigned investigators in Oslo to the case, and on Tuesday, it sent four officers to Bodo. The Dutch police searched Mr. Kamphuis's apartment in Amsterdam, taking DNA samples from his toothbrush, Ms. van de Leest said. Partial breakthroughs have only added to the mystery. The police revealed that 10 days after Mr. Kamphuis had disappeared in the High North, someone tried to use his cellphone near the village of Vikesa, 650 miles south of Bodo, attempting to activate a German SIM card. Unconfirmed sightings of the missing man have been reported in Sweden and as far away as southern Denmark, in two towns on the North Sea coast, Esbjerg and Ribe. Those reports and the SIM card pulled the German, Danish and Swedish police into the investigation. A grass-roots, crowdsourced hunt has also taken shape online, with people passing on potential clues and sightings to the police. Some false leads have drawn the attention of amateur sleuths and the news media, including excitement a few days ago about the sighting of an abandoned tent in Lofoten, an archipelago north of Bodo that is popular with hikers, which turned out to be unrelated to Mr. Kamphuis. Hundreds of people are reported missing in Norway each year, and although most are located within hours or days, 15 to 30 per year are not found, officials say. Kayaking and mountain climbing accidents kill a handful of people each year, according to the Norwegian Maritime Authority and the Norwegian Mountain Climber Association. ""After all this, there is no scenario that I haven't thought about. It could literally be anything,"" Ms. van de Leest said. ""He wasn't afraid to make enemies,"" she added. ""He did not 'hide his opinions under a chair,' as we say in Holland."" Richard Martyn-Hemphill contributed reporting from London.

Is Facebook Just a Platform? A Lawyer to the Stars Says No,"BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- Paul Tweed made his name suing news organizations like CNN, Forbes and The National Enquirer on behalf of Hollywood movie stars, winning high-profile cases for celebrities like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake by hopscotching among Belfast, London and Dublin to take advantage of their favorable defamation or privacy laws. So it was telling last year when Mr. Tweed stopped by the Dublin office of a lawyer for Facebook, Twitter and other social media giants -- many of which keep their non-United States headquarters in Ireland for tax reasons -- with some half-playful questions.    Was public sentiment turning against the companies? Mr. Tweed wanted to know. Was a groundswell building over fake news, hate speech, revenge porn, online sex trafficking, defamation and privacy rights?    ''It was odd,'' the Dublin lawyer, Richard Woulfe, recalled. ''He wanted to sound me out, to find out my view on whether there were going to be more cases like this in the future.''   Yes, indeed. Having enjoyed two decades of legal immunity on both sides of the Atlantic, social media giants are suddenly under growing pressure from regulators and lawmakers, especially in Europe. Lawyers are after them, too, filing lawsuits that seek to chip away at the legal protections afforded the social media companies and to extract financial payments for defamation, privacy rights violations and data breaches.   Since the early years of the internet boom, American and European rules and regulations have deemed social media companies to be neutral ''platforms'' or ''hosts,'' and thus immune from the liabilities faced by traditional publishers. But a series of scandals over their content has put the companies under a new assault -- and the broad question of whether they should be seen as publishers rather than agnostic platforms has sweeping legal ramifications.   ''I say to Facebook, 'What is the difference between you and a national newspaper being responsible for the letters they publish on their letters page? Why do you have to be treated differently?'' Mr. Tweed said in an interview in his walk-up office across the street from City Hall in Belfast, where he is based. ''Facebook can't say, 'We are not a publisher; we are just a platform.' I have been hearing that from them for years, and I never believed it.''   Legal scholars say the volume of litigation against the companies has spiked but the number of lawsuits or the size of the payments is difficult to quantify. Companies quickly settle any case that passes the preliminary stages in order to avoid negative precedents or publicity.   Mr. Tweed certainly saw an opportunity. Soon after his Dublin visit, he gave up his partnership at a major British law firm to found a new one dedicated to suing companies like Facebook and Twitter.   Social media companies have faced allegations about enabling Russia's interference in elections in the United States and Europe, fueling outbursts of ethnic violence in countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar, broadcasting a gang rape in Brazil and, most recently, allowing the transfer of user information to the voter-targeting company Cambridge Analytica.   Amid the public backlash, the British information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has told Facebook, ''It's not just a platform anymore; there are some legal and social responsibilities, too.''   President Trump recently signed the first American law to regulate social media companies as publishers, imposing new civil liability and criminal penalties for content that facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking.   Germany is now requiring social media companies to remove any hate speech within 24 hours after their notification of its posting, forcing teams of Facebook employees to evaluate the content almost as editors do. A new European Union regulation to protect online privacy that goes into effect this Friday is providing new opportunities for lawyers to sue. Congress is weighing legislation to require internet companies to disclose the buyers of political advertising, just as traditional news media outlets have to do.   Defenders of the current laws argue that the big social media companies could never have emerged without the legal immunity; revoking it now, they say, would destroy their business models and end a golden era of freedom of expression.   But compliance with the varied demands of different jurisdictions -- whether about hate speech in Germany or privacy in Britain -- is already weakening arguments that the companies could never feasibly regulate their content, legal experts say. Even their staunchest supporters now agree that their protected status as platforms is more vulnerable than ever.   ''We are going to look back at the mid-2010s as the high-water mark of free speech online, and it is only downhill from here,'' said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a champion of those legal protections.   If a wave is building, Mr. Tweed is positioned at the weakest point in the breakwall. European regulators and lawmakers have been far tougher on the technology companies than has Washington, where the industry flexes more lobbying muscle. And Mr. Tweed practices out of offices in the especially favorable jurisdictions of Belfast, London and Dublin.   Irish law is much stricter against defamation than that of either the United States or Britain, while British law is much stricter about protecting personal privacy. In 2013, Northern Ireland rejected a measure passed by the British Parliament to deter foreign plaintiffs from so-called libel tourism, making the Belfast courts uniquely welcoming to Mr. Tweed and his American and international clients.   In the past, he has filed lawsuits in Belfast courts against The National Enquirer on behalf of Ms. Spears and the singer and actress Jennifer Lopez (over false reports of marriage trouble for one and of a drug scandal linked to the other). In London, he sued the MailOnline website on behalf of the actor couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis (over paparazzi pictures of their baby on a beach in Santa Monica, Calif.). And in Dublin, he has sued the German magazine Heat on behalf of Mr. Timberlake and his wife, Jessica Biel (over false suggestions of trouble in their marriage).   Like most of his celebrity cases, all those claims were settled out of court.   With a mane of wavy blond hair, open-collared shirts and a manner other Belfast lawyers describe as ''impish,'' Mr. Tweed often says he feels as much at home in Los Angeles as in Belfast. But in recent years, he said, he has found a growing number of less famous clients also seeking to protect their reputations from embarrassment or insults on social media, or from threats to post the information.   ''A threat used to be somebody leaving a pig's head in a bed,'' Mr. Tweed said. ''Now it is 'I am going to put this on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or Periscope!' ''   Many of his new clients are rich businessmen or officials from the Middle East and Africa hoping to exploit the British and Irish court systems. One of them, the exiled Palestinian strongman Mohammed Dahlan, now based in the United Arab Emirates, is suing the online publication Middle East Eye, as well as Facebook and Twitter, over allegations that he participated in an attempted coup in Turkey.   Over the past year, Mr. Tweed said, he has also handled more than 20 cases involving so-called revenge porn -- the posting on social media of sexually explicit images of a former lover, one of the most politically sensitive issues for the companies. He declined to disclose how many had ended in financial settlements, citing confidentiality agreements.   Then, in January, another Belfast lawyer reached a settlement with Facebook in a case about the posting online in 2014 of naked photographs of a 14-year-old girl, which reappeared repeatedly even after her family had asked Facebook to remove them. Facebook agreed to a financial payment, which typically would include a confidentiality agreement. Her lawyer, nevertheless, told local journalists in a brief statement that the settlement ''moves the goal posts.''   ''It now puts the onus on the provider to look at how they respond to indecent, abusive and other such images put on their platform,'' the lawyer, Pearse MacDermott, said at the time. ''Had these images been put in a newspaper or on TV, there would be serious repercussions.''   Mr. Tweed, under no confidentiality agreement, spoke out about the significance of the case and now represents the victim. In a February debate over revenge porn televised on the Irish national broadcaster, Mr. Tweed squared off against Niamh Sweeney, Facebook's policy chief for Ireland. Ms. Sweeney said that one way Facebook was trying to address the issue was by inviting individuals to preemptively submit naked or other embarrassing pictures of themselves so the company's software could block efforts to post the images. (A pilot program is underway in Australia.)   Absurd, Mr. Tweed countered in a later interview. How could Facebook ask individuals to volunteer their own compromising pictures? ''Are you gonna?'' he asked.   Responding to widespread criticism over the Russian use of Facebook to influence the American election, the company recently announced it would block foreign advertising related to a coming Irish referendum on abortion.   Mr. Tweed responded to that by attacking Facebook from the opposite direction, for censoring too much. He has taken on at least three clients who complain that Facebook wrongly blocked them, either because the clients were Irish or, in one case, an aggregator of mainstream news reports whose entire site was blocked because it carried some articles on the referendum.   ''If a traditional media company was doing this, there would be all hell to pay for censorship,'' Mr. Tweed said. ''This is just another example of Facebook the publisher.''   The social media companies, he argued, have a responsibility to block offensive content without censoring legitimate debate, regardless of the costs, just like traditional publishers. ''If they can't do it, they should get out of the kitchen.''    "
A License to Discriminate,"Facebook is embroiled in another vast privacy scandal. The company revealed on Tuesday that it had allowed Huawei and three other Chinese companies, in addition to Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, access to data on Facebook users, their friends and their friends' friends. These arrangements extended to data on religion, work and education history, and political preferences. Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of 87 million Facebook users; this latest scandal may affect many times that number of users. Sweeping privacy violations have the strange effect of revealing that the tracking of consumers by marketers affects everyone while hiding how that tracking hurts some people far more than others. People who value their privacy come from all demographic groups, but the impact of consumer tracking varies greatly by race, class and power. When you're the ""right"" race, gender and sexual orientation, when you've got the right schools and jobs on your profile, marketers use tracking to flatter and include you. When you're not, tracking is more likely to be used to exclude or exploit you. This disparate impact is a civil rights issue, and it should be treated like one by Congress.  This problem predates Facebook. It's apparent in marketing lists prepared by data brokers, the old guard in the consumer tracking industry. Lists of the wealthy use titles like ""Established Elite"" or ""American Royalty"" to highlight their strengths. The less fortunate are categorized by their vulnerabilities: ""Ethnic Second-City Strugglers,"" ""Rural and Barely Making It"" or ""Hard Times,"" a list made up of ""an underclass of the working poor and destitute seniors without family support."" In one case, information from a data broker was used to defraud a 92-year-old Army veteran and steal his life savings. It's one thing to receive junk mail or phone calls because you're on one of those lists. But the sophisticated, real-time ad targeting developed by Facebook and other companies takes this marketing to another level. Tech companies can now target -- or exclude -- you entirely in secret, and often at the precise moment when you are most vulnerable. Facebook does not ask its users to identify their race. But the company figures it out anyway, monitoring users' activity to tag them with ethnic ""affinities."" As shown by two damningexposés, Facebook allowed housing advertisers to block users from seeing their ads if those users had a black, Latino or Asian-American ""affinity."" Until recently, Google and Bing searches for ""I need money for groceries"" or ""I need money for rent"" would return prominent ads for predatory payday loans. Google blocked payday loan ads in 2016 under pressure from civil rights groups. Microsoft followed in 2017. While Facebook temporarily blocked ""affinity marketing,"" it's unclear if it allows other discriminatory targeting. If you watched the royal wedding, you may have seen Amazon show off its new face-scanning software, Rekognition, by identifying celebrity wedding guests as they arrived at Windsor Castle. People are far more likely to encounter Rekognition when businesses and the police use it to secretly scan their faces to look for shoplifters. Poor people and people of color understand this distinction. Low-income adults, African-Americans and Latinos are significantly more likely than the wealthy and non-Hispanic whites to report being very concerned about what information is collected about them, or how it is used. More recently, after pressure from civil rights groups, Facebook is reportedly arranging for an outside auditor to study how its platform may harm underrepresented communities and people of color. Among the few available tools for vulnerable groups are the notices requiring personal consent before a company collects your sensitive data, which many have criticized as ineffective. It's true that click-through consent screens, alone, are not enough to protect your privacy. But for Black Lives Matter protesters, victims of domestic violence and blue-collar retirees, the ability to click No is profoundly important. Congress needs to act. In other key areas of American economic life, from employment to housing to credit, Congress has built general protections for everyone -- a minimum wage, mortgage insurance, disclosure rules for loans -- but it has also recognized that those are not enough. Instead, in each of these areas, Congress has also seen it necessary to pass special protections for racial minorities and other vulnerable groups. Federal privacy law is blind to race. Legally, creating a list of Ethnic Second-City Strugglers is as innocuous as creating a list of people who like ""PAW Patrol."" This is a mistake. The tracking of people's race, religion, sexual orientation or health problems should be closely regulated, and in some cases banned. If you think this sounds extreme, consider that one data broker offered a list of ""AIDS and H.I.V. Infection Sufferers"" -- 1,000 names for $79. The European Union's new consumer privacy law creates protections for data that reveal those characteristics, along with information on a person's membership in a labor union, a nod to the sensitivity of income and class. The European law thus implicitly recognizes that privacy is a matter of civil rights. The United States Congress should, too. Alvaro M.

"Fed, Der Spiegel, Jeremy Corbyn: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) Good morning.  The U.S. says it's leaving Syria, an attorney general sues Facebook and Der Spiegel fires a writer for deception. Here's the latest:  President Trump orders a full withdrawal from Syria All 2,000 U.S. ground troops were ordered out of Syria, suddenly ending a military campaign that largely vanquished the Islamic State but ceding a strategically vital country to Russia and Iran. ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" the president said in a Twitter post. The White House did not provide a timetable or other specifics for the pullout.  Lawmakers and Pentagon officials argued that the move would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops in Syria, and who could now be vulnerable to an attack by Turkey.  Analysis: Mr. Trump believes that U.S. forces cannot alter the strategic balance in the Middle East and should not be there -- a view that Barack Obama fundamentally shared, our national security correspondent writes. Another angle: The abrupt withdrawal is seen by analysts as an abandonment of key U.S. allies in Syria and a boon for the Islamic State, which still controls territory in the country's southeast. Facebook is sued over Cambridge Analytica The lawsuit brought by the attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, is a first step by a state attorney general to punish the social media giant for privacy violations. The New York Times and other news organizations reported in March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm based in London, had improperly obtained the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users. In Mr. Racine's lawsuit, he said that roughly half of Washington's residents had been exposed by Cambridge Analytica's data harvesting. He also said Facebook had misled people about the security of their data. Another angle: If being overwhelmed by the scale of all these online privacy scandals seems familiar, it should. It's a lot like climate change. What you can do: If you've had enough, here are six steps you can take to break up with Facebook for good. U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates The widely expected quarter-point increase signaled confidence in the health of the U.S. economy. The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the choppy global economy and the recent sell-off in stocks had gotten the Fed's attention, but he called the move ""appropriate."" U.S. stocks erased early gains after the announcement, which also indicated that rates would continue to be raised next year. Markets were well prepared for a rate increase, but policymakers had also been expected to calm jittery investors by emphasizing that further increases in 2019 would depend on sustained economic growth. What it means for you: Rising interest rates have consequences for savers and spenders alike. Der Spiegel fires an award-winning journalist The German magazine said the writer, Claas Relotius, had engaged in fabrication ""on a grand scale,""  weaving invented quotations and characters into more than a dozen major articles. Mr. Relotius, 33, had written for Der Spiegel since 2011. He admitted to making up parts of at least 14 articles, the magazine said, adding that the figure could rise. The details: In one article, about Fergus Falls, Minn., Mr. Relotius told of a coal plant employee who did not exist, related an anecdote about a restaurant employee to whom he gave a fictional illness and a misnamed son, and described the view of a power plant from a cafe whose windows provided no such view, according to two residents of the town who researched his claims. More fabrications: Other articles with false or manipulated material included several that were nominated for prizes, including stories about Iraqi children kidnapped by the Islamic State, a prisoner at Guantánamo Bay and Syrian orphans forced to work in a Turkish sweatshop. Here's what else is happening Catholic Church: The Church in Illinois withheld the names of at least 500 priests accused of sexual abuse of minors, the state's attorney general said. And Pope Francis accepted the resignation of a Los Angeles bishop after an investigation into an accusation of misconduct with a minor. Italy budget: The country reached a deal with the E.U. after months of defiance, agreeing to drastically reduce its debt to avoid financial penalties. Covering COP24: When our reporter traveled to the heart of Polish coal country for the U.N. climate talks, he discovered that the setting was an apt one. Diplomatic crisis: China detained a third Canadian, escalating tensions with the U.S. over the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive. ""I can English understand"": Switzerland's new economics minister is facing widespread criticism of his language skills. ""Stupid woman"": Did Britain's Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, call Prime Minister Theresa May names in the House of Commons? Amateur lip readers are poring over a video clip, and lawmakers are demanding an apology. Russian whistle-blower: Alexander Perepilichny, who died jogging near his home in a London suburb six years ago, probably died of natural causes, a British coroner ruled. Christmas surprise: A man in Wales opened his front door and found 14 years' worth of presents for his young daughter, given by his recently deceased neighbor. The things they carried: A photographer documented the journey of migrants who crossed the Evros River between Turkey and Greece. He discovered that many of them perish, dying in limbo, and are never identified. Genoa bridge: The Italian city will get a new bridge by Renzo Piano, its most famous architect, to replace a viaduct that collapsed last summer. Petty crime: Last week, our reporter asked London residents to share their experiences with minor crimes. The Twitter post caught fire; here are some of the responses. No parking: Oslo, Norway, is eliminating 700 street parking spots in its city center by the end of the year as part of a plan to make the area more pedestrian-friendly. If Brexit were a restaurant: It might look like Bluebird London, which serves English food and Long Island burrata in Manhattan, our restaurant critic writes. Secret Prague: A new wave of off-the-radar art spaces are opening in former factories, military barracks and other historic structures in the Czech capital.

Be an ethical tech consumer with these tips. 5 cheap(ish) necessities for cold-weather running. Back Story  Clare Macdonald, a reader from Keene, N.H., asked us when the first electric lights were used on a Christmas tree. It was in 1882, just three years after Thomas Edison filed a patent for his light bulb. The tree became a fixture in the experiment-filled home of an executive at his company. Eighty walnut-size red, white and blue bulbs covered the tree, which sat on a revolving box. A newspaper article described it: ""As the tree turned, the colors alternated, all the lamps going out and being relit at every revolution. The result was a continuous twinkling of dancing colors, red, white, blue, white, red, blue, all evening."" President Grover Cleveland popularized electric Christmas lights in the 1890s by installing them on the White House tree. But it was not until (relatively) inexpensive strings of Christmas lights began to be sold a few years later that the tradition really caught on. Albert Sun wrote today's Back Story.

Facebook Security Breach Exposes Accounts of 50 Million Users,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook, already facing scrutiny over how it handles the private information of its users, said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users. The breach, which was discovered this week, was the largest in the company's 14-year history. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook's code to gain access to user accounts and potentially take control of them. The news could not have come at a worse time for Facebook. It has been buffeted over the last year by scandal, from revelations that a British analytics firm got access to the private information of up to 87 million users to worries that disinformation on Facebook has affected elections and even led to deaths in several countries. Senior executives have testified several times this year in congressional hearings where some lawmakers suggested that the government will need to step in if the social network is unable to get tighter control of its service. On Friday, regulators and lawmakers quickly seized on the breach to renew calls for more oversight.  ""This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,"" Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia and one of Facebook's most vocal critics in Congress, said in a statement. ""A full investigation should be swiftly conducted and made public so that we can understand more about what happened."" In the conference call on Friday, Guy Rosen, a vice president of product management at Facebook, declined to say whether the attack could have been coordinated by hackers supported by a nation-state. Three software flaws in Facebook's systems allowed hackers to break into user accounts, including those of the top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, according to two people familiar with the investigation but not allowed to discuss it publicly. Once in, the attackers could have gained access to apps like Spotify, Instagram and hundreds of others that give users a way to log into their systems through Facebook. [Read more about what you can do to secure your Facebook account.] The software bugs were particularly awkward for a company that takes pride in its engineering: The first two were introduced by an online tool meant to improve the privacy of users. The third was introduced in July 2017 by a tool meant to easily upload birthday videos. Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerabilities and notified law enforcement officials. Company officials do not know the identity or the origin of the attackers, nor have they fully assessed the scope of the attack or if particular users were targeted. The investigation is still in its beginning stages. ""We're taking it really seriously,"" Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. ""I'm glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place."" Critics say the attack is the latest sign that Facebook has yet to come to terms with its problems. ""Breaches don't just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security,"" Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. ""The cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers."" Facebook has been roundly criticized for being slow to acknowledge a vast disinformation campaign run by Russian operatives on its platform and other social media outlets before the 2016 presidential election. Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, testified in a Senate hearing that month about what the company was trying to do to prevent the same thing from happening in midterm elections in November. In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified about revelations that Cambridge Analytica, the British analytics firm that worked with the Trump presidential campaign, siphoned personal information of millions of Facebook users. Outside the United States, the impact of disinformation appearing on Facebook and the popular messaging service it owns, WhatsApp, has been severe. In countries such as Myanmar and India, false rumors spread on social media are believed to have led to widespread killing. Facebook said the attackers had exploited two bugs in the site's ""View As"" feature, which allows users to check on what information other people can see about them. The feature was built to give users move control over their privacy. The company said those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook's video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens -- digital keys that allow access to an account. It is not clear when the attack happened, but it appears to have occurred after the video-uploading program was introduced, Facebook said. The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised. The hackers also tried to harvest people's private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook's systems, Mr. Rosen said. The company could not determine the extent of the attackers' access to third-party accounts, he said. Facebook has been reshuffling its security teams since Alex Stamos, its chief security officer, left in August for a teaching position at Stanford University. Instead of acting as a stand-alone group, security team members now work more closely with product teams across the company. The move, the company said, is an effort to embed security across every step of Facebook product development. Part of that effort has been to gird Facebook against attacks on its network in preparation for the midterm elections. Facebook has spent months setting up new systems to pre-empt such attacks, and has already dealt with a number of incidents believed to be connected to elections in Mexico, Brazil and other countries. Still, the recently discovered breach was a reminder that it is exceptionally difficult to entirely secure a system that has more than 2.2 billion users all over the world and that connects with thousands of third-party services. ""This has really shown us that because today's digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform -- especially one as popular and widely reaching as Facebook -- can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation,"" said April Doss, chairwoman of cybersecurity at the law firm Saul Ewing. As the news of Facebook's data breach spread quickly across Twitter, Google searches and other online sites, there was one place where it remained difficult to find some detailed reports: Facebook. Users who posted breaking stories about the breach from The Guardian, The Associated Press and other outlets were prompted with a notice that their posts had been taken down. So many people were posting the stories, they looked like suspicious activity to the systems that Facebook uses to block abuse of its network. ""We removed this post because it looked like spam to us,"" the notice said. Follow Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @sheeraf.

Regulating Privacy,"To the Editor: ''Big Tech's Hand Grows Stronger in Privacy Push'' (front page, April 24) suggests that new privacy rules ''may instead serve to strengthen Facebook's and Google's hegemony.''     It's difficult to imagine a more complete hegemony. Google and Facebook control eight of the top 10 internet services -- search, email, online video, web browser software, advertising networks, social networks and more. They are among the five largest corporations in the world. They face no meaningful competition. And their power came about through the unregulated collection and use of personal data.   Privacy laws restore user control over their personal data. They encourage the development of innovative services that rely on less data and are less vulnerable to data breach, less likely to extend monopoly controls to adjoining markets, and less likely to undermine democratic institutions.   Privacy laws also establish accountability for companies that have become ever more secretive even as they demand more of our personal information.   Let us at least concede that privacy rules are a step in the right direction, and long overdue.   MARC ROTENBERG, WASHINGTON   The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and editor of ''The Privacy Law Sourcebook.''    "
Apple to Close iPhone Security Hole That Law Enforcement Uses to Crack Devices,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple has long positioned the iPhone as a secure device that only its owner can open. That has led to battles with law enforcement officials who want to get information off them, including a well-publicized showdown with the F.B.I. in 2016 after Apple refused to help open the locked iPhone of a mass killer. The F.B.I. eventually paid a third party to get into the phone, circumventing the need for Apple's help. Since then, law enforcement agencies across the country have increasingly employed that strategy to get into locked iPhones they hope will hold the key to cracking cases. Now Apple is closing the technological loophole that let authorities hack into iPhones, angering police and other officials and reigniting a debate over whether the government has a right to get into the personal devices that are at the center of modern life.  Apple said it was planning an iPhone software update that would effectively disable the phone's charging and data port -- the opening where users plug in headphones, power cables and adapters -- an hour after the phone is locked. While a phone can still be charged, a person would first need to enter the phone's password to transfer data to or from the device using the port. Such a change would hinder law enforcement officials, who have typically been opening locked iPhones by connecting another device running special software to the port, often days or even months after the smartphone was last unlocked. News of Apple's planned software update has begun spreading through security blogs and law enforcement circles -- and many in investigative agencies are infuriated. ""If we go back to the situation where we again don't have access, now we know directly all the evidence we've lost and all the kids we can't put into a position of safety,"" said Chuck Cohen, who leads an Indiana State Police task force on internet crimes against children. The Indiana State Police said it unlocked 96 iPhones for various cases this year, each time with a warrant, using a $15,000 device it bought in March from a company called Grayshift. But privacy advocates said Apple would be right to fix a security flaw that has become easier and cheaper to exploit. ""This is a really big vulnerability in Apple's phones,"" said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, ""could very easily leak out into the world."" In an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. ""We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don't design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,"" he said. Apple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world's smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software by default in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant. The friction came into public view after the F.B.I. could not access the iPhone of a gunman who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015. A federal judge ordered Apple to figure out how to open the phone, prompting Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, to respond with a blistering 1,100-word letter that said the company refused to compromise its users' privacy. ""The implications of the government's demands are chilling,"" he wrote. The two sides fought in court for a month. Then the F.B.I. abruptly announced that it had found an undisclosed group to get into the phone, paying at least $1.3 million because the hacking techniques were not common then. An inspector general's report this year suggested the F.B.I. should have exhausted more options before it took Apple to court. Since then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan's Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves. Apple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode. Apple blocked that technique in 2010 by disabling iPhones after a certain number of incorrect attempts. But the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said. Cellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment. Opening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said. Law enforcement agencies that have purchased a GrayKey device include the Drug Enforcement Administration, which bought an advanced model this year for $30,000, according to public records. Maryland's state police have one, as do police departments in Portland, Ore., and Rochester, Minn., according to records. Hillar Moore, the district attorney in Baton Rouge, La., said his office had paid Cellebrite thousands of dollars to unlock iPhones in five cases since 2017, including an investigation into the hazing-related death of a fraternity pledge at Louisiana State University. He said the phones had yielded crucial information, and he was upset that Apple planned to close such a useful investigative avenue. ""They are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,"" he said. Michael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds -- he declined to specify which -- to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year. In the first 10 months of 2017, the Manhattan district attorney's office said it had recovered and obtained warrants or consent to search 702 locked smartphones, two-thirds of which were iPhones. Smartphones running Google's Android software have been generally easier to access, partly because many older devices lack encryption. The encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple's iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers. The tussle over encrypted iPhones and opening them to help law enforcement is unlikely to simmer down. Federal officials have renewed a push for legislation that would require tech companies like Apple to provide the police with a backdoor into phones, though they were recently found to be overstating the number of devices they could not access. Apple probably won't make it any easier for the police if not forced by Congress, given that it has made the privacy and security of iPhones a central selling point. But the company has complied with local laws that conflict with its privacy push. In China, for instance, Apple recently began storing its Chinese customers' data on Chinese-run servers because of a new law there. Apple's latest move is part of a longer cat-and-mouse game between tech companies and law enforcement, said Michelle Richardson, an analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which supports protections for online privacy. ""People always expected there would be this back-and-forth -- that government would be able to hack into these devices, and then Apple would plug the hole and hackers would find another way in,"" she said.

"Once a Hacker, Now a Security Buff","Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Runa Sandvik has slowly persuaded everyone in her life to download Signal, the encrypted messaging app often hailed as the gold standard for privacy: family, friends, co-workers -- even Uber drivers.    She always personalizes her appeals: To her friends, she says, ''It's free!'' To reporters, she points out that it will protect their sources. Whoever her subjects happen to be, Ms. Sandvik wants to help them fit information security into their lives without having to think about it.   ''I have personally always said that my job is to help you do your job securely,'' Ms. Sandvik said, ''so that you don't have to think about all of this stuff. It's just done. It's taken care of. It's safe by default.''    Ms. Sandvik, on the other hand, is the senior director of information security for The New York Times. She spends a lot of time thinking about all of this stuff.   She has written about encryption tools and a dark web email service for Forbes. The URL of her personal website is encrypted.cc. She once threw a CryptoParty with Edward Snowden in Hawaii.   And today, she is known for spearheading security improvements at The Times, including two-factor authentication for reporters, which requires an additional verification method after entering a password; a confidential page for tips from sources; secure communication methods; protection for Times subscriber accounts; and more.   It all started in Norway, when Ms. Sandvik got her first computer at age 15. She became obsessed with the endless puzzles and challenges within: how the computer worked, how it didn't work, and especially how to break its functions and make it do things it wasn't supposed to do. ''The interest for me at that point, early on, was just to soak up as much info as I could, just learn how things work, learn how things fall apart,'' she said. This led her to the hacker space.   It wasn't until she started work for the Tor Project, a nonprofit digital privacy group that often trains journalists, that she changed the way she thought about what computers could do for people.   She recalled beginning to ask herself, ''What are ways that I can take what I know about information security, and about hacking -- the ways you would go after a reporter, for example -- and use that to support and defend and empower the people, as opposed to just figuring out how to break stuff?''   Since coming to The Times in March 2016, she has continued to ask herself that question and to weave her background into the way the newsroom functions. ''One of the first things I noticed about Runa when I started working with her was how much she cares for what she does and for the mission of The Times,'' said Bill McKinley, her boss and the executive director of information security at The Times. When they meet with reporters for new projects, he said, ''she lights up.''   And what she does is increasingly crucial.   Cyberattacks -- and cyberattacks against journalists, specifically -- are on the rise, Ms. Sandvik said.   ''If you had asked me a year ago, I probably would've said no, the only difference is that we're paying more attention now,'' she said. ''In the past year, that has certainly changed. I think that we are seeing not necessarily new types of attacks, but a type of persistence and an escalation that we haven't seen before.''   Those attacks can include trolling, threats and harassment, as well as persistent and innovative phishing emails that can look as if they come from other colleagues within the newsroom or even friends outside of work. And once a hacker gets a journalist's user names and passwords, ''there's nothing that you can do to get that data back,'' she said.   A project Ms. Sandvik worked on that readers may recognize is The Times's tips line, a page that allows people to send confidential tips to Times journalists. When the F.B.I. raided Michael D. Cohen's office, for example, it was a tip to The Times's investigations desk, via encrypted email, that allowed us to break the story first. More recently, a story emerged from a tip from Deloitte employees about their petition to management to stop working with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.   The Times still gets more than 50 tips a day. ''It's changed how the newsroom works,'' said Gabriel Dance, the deputy investigations editor. And even for less flashy projects, like tweaks in communication methods for journalists, Ms. Sandvik's work doesn't go unnoticed.   ''She's had to help us think really creatively about how to stay secure while also staying flexible to working in a newsroom,'' he said. ''It's the coaching she gives to investigative reporters on how best to protect themselves and protect their sources.''   Around the newsroom, she's also known for her stealthy fake phishing emails (modeled to appear to come from colleagues but, upon closer examination, actually sent from an external email address), often requesting employees' information and aiming to see who falls for it. For the small number who open attachments or enter their user names and passwords, Ms. Sandvik and her team reach out to them for follow-up training.   Outside The Times, she is well regarded in the information security community, Mr. McKinley said. She frequently attends conferences, speaks at events and hosts CryptoParties, or events that aim to educate people about digital security in an accessible way (two weeks ago, she co-hosted a Times-sponsored CryptoParty). Her friends see her as a tough stalwart of a male-dominated industry.   ''Sometimes men get the idea that they can bully this tiny Norwegian woman, and that they can push her around,'' said Eva Galperin, a friend of Ms. Sandvik's who also works in information security, as the director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ''And she will not move.''   The two often trade war stories and tips on instituting new security features in the workplace. One of her favorite stories about Ms. Sandvik took place during Def Con, a convention for hackers and security experts, when Ms. Sandvik and her husband presented their research on how to hack and disable a sniper rifle. ''It was the very first time I had ever seen coverage of a man and a woman doing security research together, and the woman got all the credit and the man was a footnote,'' Ms. Galperin laughed. ''I can tell you, that almost never happens.''   As for Ms. Sandvik, she knows her industry is dominated by men, but she said it had never really gotten in her way.   ''It's kind of interesting that security is in her title,'' Mr. Dance said, ''because she is like a security blanket. She makes us feel more comfortable that no matter what file or source or situation we find ourselves in, we can go to Runa.''

Calls for Data Privacy Are Growing Among Internet Users in China,"SHANGHAI -- China's biggest online payment company offers its hundreds of millions of users a breakdown on their spending each year, showing everything from their environmental impact to their ranking among shoppers in their area. Many spenders -- not shy, and occasionally even a bit boastful about their personal finances -- in turn share the details on social media. This year, the marketing stunt has run into a problem: China's growing sense of personal privacy.    Ant Financial, an affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, apologized to users on Thursday after prompting an outcry by automatically enrolling in its social credit program those who wanted to see the breakdown. The program, called Sesame Credit, tracks personal relationships and behavior patterns to help determine lending decisions.    That Sesame Credit program is part of a broader push in China to track how people go about their day, one that could feed into the Chinese government's ambitious -- and, some people would say, Orwellian -- effort to use technology to keep a closer watch on its citizens.   The episode was a rare, public rebuttal of a prevailing trend in China. The country's largest internet companies, and the government itself, have gathered ever more data on internet users. While Chinese culture does not emphasize personal privacy and Chinese internet users have grown accustomed to surveillance and censorship, the anger represents a nascent, but growing, demand for increased privacy and data protections online.   Fueled in part by widespread internet fraud and personal information theft, the call for privacy, if it continues, could become a major challenge to China's internet titans, and eventually to the cyber-authoritarian aspirations of the Chinese government itself.   China has long had high levels of surveillance, from ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras in its big cities to the monitoring of much of its citizens' online communications. But such efforts have proliferated as new technologies like facial recognition have begun to be rolled out and artificial intelligence has made crunching vast amounts of data much easier.   For now, it is far from clear that this rising discomfort will give way to policy changes. Many Chinese people, even as they express concerns about how companies use their data online, offer little criticism of Beijing's desire to use that data to help compile a broad social tracking system that rewards what it regards as good citizens and punishes others.   Still, recent signs indicate Chinese consumers are beginning to express some of the same privacy concerns long found in the United States and elsewhere.   This week, one of China's most visible business leaders bemoaned what he said was a lack of privacy in China in general, and specifically on the country's most widely used mobile chat service, WeChat.   ''There's no privacy and information security these days,'' Li Shufu, the chairman of Geely Holding Group and Volvo Cars, said at a New Year's forum. ''When you walk on the road, there are surveillance cameras everywhere.''   ''Pony Ma must be reading our WeChat messages every single day,'' he added, referring to the founder of Tencent, the Chinese internet giant that runs the social media and chat app, which has almost one billion users.   In a statement, Tencent said that the company did not store the chat history of users and that it would never use chat history for big data analytics. The comments were met with widespread disbelief: WeChat users have been arrested over what they've said on the app, conversations have turned up as evidence in court proceedings, and activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations.   ''It has become a default setting for me now to assume that we have no privacy in the face of Alibaba and Tencent,'' said Li Luyao, a college student in Beijing.   Mr. Li said he did not believe Tencent's assurances that it was not storing chat logs, and he expressed anger at Ant Financial for resorting to what he called ''old tricks.''   In its end-of-year feature, Ant Financial had customers click through a screen with a line in small font saying the user agreed to the terms of service, which were hidden. A toggle was on by default to indicate that the user agreed, and enrolled them in the Sesame Credit program.   Ant Financial said in the terms of service that it reserved the right to share the data it collected with third parties -- including government agencies assembling a state-sanctioned social credit system -- and could not be held responsible for what happened after it shared the information.   In its statement, Ant Financial said users should have had to actively change the toggle to indicate they agreed, and added that it would remove all of those who had been inadvertently added to the credit system.   User complaints went beyond the narrow concern over how they joined, to broader questions regarding what they were asked to join.   ''The tone of the agreement makes me feel so uncomfortable because every sentence literally goes, 'If this happens, we are not responsible, if that happens, we are not responsible,''' said Zhou Yang, a 25-year old investment professional in Shanghai. ''They sound like sneaky unscrupulous merchants who will sell your data and don't want to be responsible for anything, and you have to agree to all of it.''   Ms. Zhou's fears about data sales underscore more widespread worries about controlling personal information. China's official media have reported an increasing number of cases of internet fraud, and personal data is widely available for sale through online marketplaces. A 2017 survey by China's state-run Beijing Youth Daily found that leaking personal data was the No. 1 concern among consumers.   The issue has filtered to the top of the Chinese leadership. Even as Beijing continues to assemble one of the most sophisticated and wide-scale surveillance systems in the world, politicians have called for better privacy protections. Laws  have been beefed up to better protect consumer data. And it has had an impact overseas, too: Ant Financial's deal to buy MoneyGram, the money-transfer company, collapsed amid concerns in the United States over a Chinese company having access to a large amount of financial data.   In part, the Sesame Credit moves by Ant Financial might have been trying to get around newer, stricter laws that would prevent them from sharing user data unless they had explicit permission, said Zhai Zhenyi, a lawyer at Yingke, a China-based law firm.   ''Problems like telecom fraud and malicious marketing have severely vexed the general public, so people's consciousness about their rights is awakening,'' he said. ''This is a very good thing to see.''   That consciousness may not extend to government collection of data, even though China's biggest internet companies often provide user information to Beijing.   Ant Financial's credit system resembles one the government itself plans to soon implement.   Beijing has said it will introduce in 2020 its own social credit system that is expected to give and take away privileges based on spending habits, online and real-world behavior, and social relationships. Foreign travel, speedy internet, school access, and social benefits could all be granted or denied based on a person's score. The government system will most likely be at least partly dependent on data collected by companies like Alibaba and Tencent.   It is unclear how many Chinese are truly against such programs.   Mr. Li, the Beijing college student, said that many of his friends still shared the shopping breakdowns -- which now include a number indicating a user's Sesame Credit score.   Such is the power and ubiquity of Alibaba and Tencent in China, he added, that customers would find voting with their feet and quitting the services difficult.   ''Being angry doesn't do us any good,'' he said. ''Maybe you can stop using Alipay if you are angry, but there's no way you could stop using WeChat.''   Follow Paul Mozur on Twitter: @paulmozur.

Uber Settles Data Breach Investigation for $148 Million,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber will pay $148 million to settle a nationwide investigation into a 2016 data breach, in which a hacker managed to gain access to information belonging to 57 million riders and drivers. The breach included names and driver's license numbers for 600,000 drivers.  The investigation, led by state attorneys general across the United States, focused on whether Uber had violated data breach notification laws by not informing consumers that their information had been compromised. Rather than disclosing the breach when it occurred, Uber paid the hacker $100,000 through its bug bounty program, which financially rewards hackers for discovering and disclosing software flaws. The ride-hailing company persuaded him to delete the data and stay quiet about it with a nondisclosure agreement. The incident became public a year later when Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, announced it as a ""failure"" and fired the two employees who had signed off on the payment. ""Uber's decision to cover up this breach was a blatant violation of the public's trust,"" Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, said in a statement. ""The company failed to safeguard user data and notify authorities when it was exposed."" Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said the settlement was part of a larger effort inside Uber to remake the company's image. He said the company had recently hired a chief privacy officer and a chief trust and security officer. ""We know that earning the trust of our customers and the regulators we work with globally is no easy feat. After all, trust is hard to gain and easy to lose,"" Mr. West said. He added that the breach was disclosed to the public during his first day on the job. ""Rather than settling into my new work space and walking the floor to meet my new colleagues, I spent the day calling various state and federal regulators,"" Mr. West said. The Federal Trade Commission settled its investigation into the data breach in April. The trade commission now requires Uber to submit to regular privacy audits as part of a 2017 settlement, which was revised this year to address the most recent breach. The $148 million settlement announced Wednesday will be divided among all 50 states and the District of Columbia. &#34;Companies in California and throughout the nation are entrusted with customers' valuable private information,"" Mr. Becerra said. ""This settlement broadcasts to all of them that we will hold them accountable to protect that data."" Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger  PHOTO: An Uber logo on a car in Times Square.

Did Facebook Learn Anything From the Cambridge Analytica Debacle?,"It's been barely six months since Mark Zuckerberg appeared before Congress and promised lawmakers and the American public that he and Facebook, the company he founded and leads today, would do better. ""This episode has clearly hurt us,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""We have to do a lot of work about building trust back."" The episode he was referring to was the revelation in March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm connected to the Trump campaign, had harvested the sensitive data of as many as 87 million Facebook users without their explicit permission. That scandal rocked Facebook, sending the company's stock price spiraling. Mr. Zuckerberg himself lost nearly $11 billion.   Since Mr. Zuckerberg's testimony, lawmakers have done little to nothing to better regulate technology platforms like Facebook and hold them more accountable for suspect practices. But there's also little evidence that Facebook, and Mr. Zuckerberg, has taken his pledge to Congress as seriously as once hoped either: Facebook announced late last month the biggest data breach in its history, affecting nearly 50 million user accounts. In the same week, the news site Gizmodo published an investigation that found Facebook gave advertisers access to contact information harvested from the address books on their users' cellphones.  Equally worrisome from Gizmodo's report: Facebook is also allowing advertisers to target phone numbers that users have provided solely for security reasons. Security experts generally advise users to add two-factor authentication to their accounts, which sometimes takes the form of providing a phone number to receive text messages containing log-in codes. It's ironic -- two-factor authentication is supposed to better safeguard privacy and security, but these phone numbers are winding up in the hands of advertisers. While the Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook in a firestorm of controversy, this time the company effectively got a free pass from a nation fixated on Brett Kavanaugh and his turbulent Supreme Court confirmation. Still, with consequential midterms less than a month away, this latest string of Facebook privacy failures is a discouraging reminder of how much potential there is for things to go terribly wrong -- again --  during those elections. It's not just about user privacy, it's a sign of how well Facebook is poised to handle sophisticated foreign disinformation campaigns, and where its priorities lie.  The seriousness of Facebook's most recent data breach ranks it among one of the most egregious in the history of Silicon Valley. A weakness in Facebook's code allowed hackers to gain access into other people's accounts, and potentially control not only the Facebook profiles but any services that those users logged into using Facebook -- Instagram, Spotify and Tinder, for example. The breach originated from three bugs in Facebook's code. At least one was introduced over a year ago; it's still not clear when the other two became part of the code. Information security is a difficult problem: A company might do the right thing every time and still be successfully attacked. But one of the reasons Facebook's breach is so concerning is the company's footprint in the lives of so many people -- 2.2 billion and counting. Facebook has sought to find ways into as many aspects of people&#39;s lives as possible, becoming the recipient of a glut of data and the implicit trust of its users. The company has been careless with that trust -- and is still being careless.  Speaking before Congress and in other public statements, Mr. Zuckerberg has been upfront about being caught unaware of the influence his company can have in ordinary people's lives, whether that influence is in determining election outcomes or sparking real-life violence in places like Sri Lanka and Libya. And perhaps nobody fully understands that power -- academics and experts are still piecing together the puzzle of how advertising systems honed on personal information can enable foreign propaganda campaigns, and to what extent this phenomenon affects democratic elections. It may be a long time before it all becomes clear. (In the meantime, falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford are going viral on Facebook). In response to such concerns, Facebook has set up a ""war room"" in its headquarters to monitor potential foreign influence campaigns during elections. But the latest disclosures are far from reassuring. In late September, the war room was still under construction. With less than a month to go before the American midterms, is Facebook really ready for its next big test?

"An Eye for Photography, but a Google Suite for Events; Tech We're using","How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Whitney Richardson, an events manager for The Times in London, discussed the tech she's using. Q. What tech do you use to put together events? A. Over the past year, I have really expanded my use of the entire Google suite -- and I use its tools for basically everything, especially the Google Drive app on my phone.   From my phone, I can share files with multiple clients with Google folders and I can manage my budget in Google sheets. I've used Google forms to quickly collect feedback from attendees of events I produced. For presentations, I use Google slides (and begin brainstorming while on the commute to work). I can video chat with a group of people in different countries using Google video chat and sync all appointments and meetings to my calendar.  For me, it's a one-stop shop. What do you like about the tools, and what could be better? I appreciate being able to store all of my documents in one place and being able to walk into meetings with just my phone and still have my files at my fingertips without logging in to multiple accounts. I've gone to high-level meetings with just my phone, and people seem genuinely surprised that I am able to quickly refer to key data points or notes without having a laptop or a notebook in front of me. I look forward to the day when we have an American version of the popular Chinese app WeChat, where I can really sync all of my day-to-day apps in one place. With all of the recent data security breaches we have had in the past few years (Equifax, Facebook), I also want the assurance of having online services that are impenetrable to hackers. You were previously a photo editor at The Times. Plenty of photographers are experimenting with new ways to take pictures using drones and virtual reality. What do you think will stick around? We are in a renaissance period of photography, when technology is ultimately changing the way humans relate to imagery. Photos are no longer used just as a way to capture a moment. They are an actual form of communication. A while ago, I read an interview with Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, who said he realized early on that people were willing to forgo quality in an image for the ability to quickly share it with their networks. In my opinion, the tools that will stick around are the ones that make capturing and sharing visual information as seamless as possible.  I've also been able to find new photographers to hire around the world on Instagram, and love following emerging photographers of color who are using the platform to define and promote their visual aesthetic. I'm currently obsessed with work coming from Nadine Ijewere (@nadineijewere), Yagazie Emezi (@yagazieemezi), Tyler Mitchell (@tylersphotos) and Renell Medrano (@renellaice). I absolutely love what our photojournalists have been doing with drone video and photography. A few months ago, I worked with my colleague Josh Haner on a story about plans to make the Hoover Dam into a giant battery. Josh was able to capture stunning drone footage over the Hoover Dam, which really allowed viewers to see the massive scale of the structure in a way that made the story come to life. I am also excited to see where augmented reality and holographic video is headed in the news business. Our recent story on Ashley Graham, which we published during Fashion Week, took my breath away, but it took 100 cameras to record her runway walk in 3-D. This then goes back to the issue of scalability and making these tools readily available for journalists to use for alternative story forms. How can we create tools that make stories like this not a one-off, that more journalists can access to really lift The Times's report over all? What do you wish would go away? I want portable 360-degree video cameras to take a break until we can figure out how to scale them without completely compromising image resolution. I don't think they have found that sweet spot just yet. Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? In my daily life, I cannot live without my Bose wireless noise-canceling headphones. I hesitated getting them for a while, but my husband got them for me as a gift and I will never go back to normal earphones. (No more cords!)  I also have several portable mirror sets with LED bulbs, which I pack when I am traveling to help with makeup application and general skin care. And when my husband and I travel, we love using Airbnb. We have actually gone on a vacation planned around an Airbnb location because we were interested in the living space and wanted to experience it. Like most new businesses in the gig economy, it is shaking up the hotel industry in a good way, I think, and allowing people alternative ways to experience new cities in unexpected ways. You're new to London. How do the British use tech differently from Americans (or not)?  The one striking difference I have noticed between living in London and New York is not exactly tech -- it's the efficiency of the bus and train system in London. The Times has done a ton of coverage of New York's crumbling trains, and there are no clear signs of improvement. The subway and bus system in London runs on time, and there are all sorts of updated indicators on platforms and by certain bus stops for when your transport will arrive (and they are accurate). It has made commuting on public transportation much more enjoyable.

Uber Hires Security Chief To Fix Team,"Last November, Uber's new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, penned an apologetic note to riders and drivers explaining that hackers had obtained 57 million personal records from the ride-hailing company -- and rather than disclosing the breach immediately, the company had paid the hackers $100,000 to keep quiet.  Mr. Khosrowshahi, who said the breach and payouts happened before he arrived, fired Uber's chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, for his handling of the matter.    On Tuesday, Uber announced that they had found Mr. Sullivan's replacement: Matt Olsen, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency and director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Mr. Olsen was most recently the president and chief revenue officer at IronNet Cybersecurity, a consultancy he co-founded with Gen. Keith Alexander, the agency's former director.   Mr. Olsen joins Uber as it is trying to repair the reputation of its security team. In addition to the data breach, Uber's practice of routinely surveilling its competitors physically and online came under scrutiny in federal court, when Uber was being sued for trade secret theft by Waymo, the autonomous-driving car company owned by Alphabet.   ''I know Uber made some substantial changes in terms of eliminating, quite decisively, some of the activities that were done more in secret and saying, that's just not part of who we are going forward,'' Mr. Olsen said. ''That was my reaction when I learned about some of these activities: 'That just doesn't make sense to me.'''   Increasing transparency and unifying the security team -- which is split into two groups, one focused on online security and one on physical security threats facing riders and drivers -- will be top priorities, Mr. Olsen said.   ''I think they understand the need to be transparent and ethical, and vigilant in complying not just with the laws and regulations that apply, but the norms and standards that Uber customers and stakeholders expect of the company,'' he said.   The challenge, Mr. Olsen said, will be earning trust as Uber seeks to establish itself as safe, in the physical world as well as online. The company serves millions of riders each day and handles a wealth of personal data, making it a rich target for attackers.   Mr. Olsen said his history in the intelligence community would help him counter the complex threats Uber faces. ''For any large organization, whether you're talking N.S.A. or a company like Uber, having a plan and having practiced and exercised how to respond to a breach is critically important,'' he said.

Some Free Apps to Help You Pay for That Latte,"Kristin Wong is a freelance writer and the author of ''Get Money.'' Let's say you want to earn some extra pocket cash, but you're short on free time (and energy). Your phone might be a good place to start. There are quite a few apps designed to help you earn some extra dough, either in the form of gift cards or standard cold, hard cash. There is a trade-off, however. Nearly any kind of reward app, even the legitimate ones, will track at least some of your personal data.    Paul Bischoff, a privacy advocate at Comparitech.com, says that these apps typically collect data for marketing purposes. ''Some types of data these apps can collect about you include websites visited, real-time location, online purchases, other apps you use, your entire contact list and search queries,'' he said. Watch out for apps that collect background data -- you can find that information in the app's privacy policy when you sign up. Of course, privacy policies are often lengthy and hard to understand, so it helps to know what you're looking for.    What to Look for in an App's Privacy Policy Before You Install   By signing up for almost any app, you agree to share some personal information. That's not to say your information isn't safe, but it's a good reminder to always make sure you read the fine print before downloading. So what exactly should you look for in an app's privacy policy?   1. What They Do With Your Data: Find out what kind of data is collected, how that data is used, how long the company retains it and whom the company shares it with, Mr. Bischoff said. ''Giving up your privacy to a data-collection company should not be done lightly,'' he warned. ''Both iOS and Android alert users when an app asks for a new permission.'' That might be permission to access your location, photos or contacts, for example. ''Think about whether that permission is really necessary for the app to work or if it's just using that permission to mine more personal data,'' he said.   2. How They Make Money: ''From a consumer's standpoint, it's important to understand what the monetization model is for the company that makes these apps,'' added Kowsik Guruswamy, chief technology officer at Menlo Security. ''That alone can be very revealing in how the companies plan to use their data.'' For example, an app might make money through sponsorships with the brands it partners with or it might offer customers paid upgrades. However, it's also likely it makes money selling your data to advertisers or other third parties, which is why it's important to note what kind of data it tracks and how it uses it.   3. What Other Users Have to Say: Beyond reading the fine print, you can also research the app's reputation via online reviews. Pay special attention to reviews that address privacy issues. ''While many apps offer legitimate means to make money -- taking surveys, snapping photos of local businesses, lock screen ads and reviewing products -- be wary of apps that seem too good to be true,'' Mr. Bischoff said. ''Sometimes an app combines a legitimate cash-for-task model with background data collection, so watch out for that, too.''   Moneymaking Apps That Make the Grade   We looked at dozens of apps that promise to help you make money from the comfort of your smartphone, and most of them aren't worth your time. Some, however, do what they promise, even if the trade-off is a good bit of your personal data.   If you're willing to trade, the following (free) apps are well established and can legitimately help you earn cash back. No, you won't fund your retirement or put a down payment on your home, but you can earn a few bucks to pay for your latte -- or dare we suggest avocado toast?   Swagbucks   [Video: Swagbucks Watch on YouTube.]   If you don't mind searching the web, answering surveys or watching videos, you can earn a few ''Swagbucks,'' which you can then trade in for gift cards at places like Amazon, Starbucks and Home Depot.   ''I typically cash out the Swagbucks for gift cards that I use on Amazon to buy household goods,'' said Cherie Lowe, a personal finance writer and author of the book ''Slaying the Debt Dragon.'' Ms. Lowe has used the app for nearly eight years, earning around $3,000 worth of gift cards over all. ''I did save up enough to get $600 to put toward a laptop at the Apple store at one point in time,'' she added.   You can earn one Swagbuck for every dollar you spend at certain online retailers, too. According to the Swagbucks website, this is the equivalent of earning 1 percent cash back. With online surveys, you typically earn 40 to 200 Swagbucks (100 Swagbucks = $1), according to the site. You can also earn a few Swagbucks for watching videos, and the app will tell you how long you can expect to spend watching. You'll spend about half an hour and earn a few points.   When it comes to privacy, Mr. Guruswamy says apps like Swagbucks often use cookies to track your information. ''So by using Swagbucks, not only is the user giving away a lot of their personal information, they are also opening themselves to being monitored and tracked by all of the Swagbucks affiliates,'' he said. ''The bottom line is that you have to read the fine print.'' You can check out the privacy policy here.   Shopkick   [Video: What is Shopkick? Watch on YouTube.]   Shopkick rewards you for shopping at stores you probably visit anyway: CVS, Marshalls and Best Buy are a few of its partner retailers.   ''Shopkick I primarily use in Target,'' Ms. Lowe said. ''Because why not get rewarded when you're there? I like that you can cash out your rewards at as little as $2 in gift cards, too. Every little bit helps. I typically stockpile and cash out around Christmas to supplement our budget.''   Once you download the app, you earn points, or ''kicks,'' every time you spend at partner retailers. You can earn kicks without spending, too, by checking into stores or scanning certain items. While you won't get cash back directly, you can trade the points for gift cards to dozens of partner retailers. In short, Shopkick essentially works like any other rewards shopping site except there's no need to hop through a portal to earn your points. Just spend with your card as you normally would.   Of course, you have to link your credit or debit card to earn points with your spending, so if you're worried about your privacy with this app, keep that in mind. With so many data breaches lately, you might be apprehensive to connect your card to the app. While it does collect data about your transactions (which is necessary to automatically earn ''kicks''), it doesn't store your actual credit card information. ''If a user has a linked credit or debit card associated with his or her Shopkick account, that information solely and securely remains with Visa or Mastercard,'' said Bill Demas, the app's chief executive officer. Read the privacy policy here.   Ibotta   [Video: How to Use Ibotta: Live Life Rewarded Watch on YouTube.]   Ibotta is a couponing app, but instead of getting a discount on your purchases, you get cash-back rebates. You check the app for offers -- $1 cash back on a pizza brand, for example -- and then either scan your receipt or link the app to your store loyalty cards so your savings are automatic. Ibotta accepts receipts only from participating stores and retailers, but most of the big players are listed: Whole Foods, Walmart, Ralph's, Kroger, HEB. Some offers will apply to only one retailer; others might be valid at several.   ''I use Ibotta regularly and have made $253 so far,'' said Jessica Landon, an avid Ibotta user who's been using the app for about a year and a half. ''I usually look up offers before I head in the store, then upload and scan the products right when I get in my car so I don't forget.'' She said staples like produce usually earned only about 25 cents cash back, but it can add up. ''Buying beer for my husband usually gets me larger amounts. Diapers is another item that can earn you cash back faster.''   In its privacy policy, Ibotta is clear about the information it collects, which includes your contact information, search queries, transaction information and location, and why it collects it. Ibotta also places cookies on your device to ''recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience,'' according to the privacy policy.   UserTesting   [Video: UserTesting Quick Tour Watch on YouTube.]   With UserTesting, you get paid to offer feedback on a website. The pay is $10 per test, and it involves visiting a website, completing some tasks, then recording your feedback about the user experience. While you're visiting the app, UserTesting uses software to record your mouse movements, clicks and your voice. The tasks take about 10 to 20 minutes to complete.   To use the software, you will need an internet connection and a microphone and to be able to download their testing software. If you want to take mobile tests, you'll need an iPhone, an iPad, an Android phone or an Android tablet. You're paid via PayPal.   Privacy-wise, you want to be extra careful with apps that track your behavior in this way. Of course, UserTesting needs to track your experience, as that's the entire point of the service.   According to its privacy policy, when you participate in a test, the app will ''capture video or photographic recordings of your face, audio recordings of your voice, screen recordings of your actions on the device on which you downloaded the Screen Recorder, and video or audio recordings of any other sights or sounds that are captured by your device camera or microphone during a Usability Test.'' To protect the data you share, they use SSL technology to encrypt your information.    "
Taking Practical Steps To Protect Your Data From Harvesters,"Revelations that a voter-profiling company that worked Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign harvested private information from 50 million Facebook profiles have many people wondering: What, if anything, can they do to protect their data connected to the social network? Here's the harsh truth: Not much, short of ceasing to browse the web entirely or deleting your Facebook account.     Yet there are some best practices you can employ to help safeguard your data, such as installing software to block web tracking technologies and carefully vetting the apps that you use on Facebook.   But it also helps to understand what exactly happened with those 50 million profiles in order to determine how you can better protect your data. Here's what you need to know.   So what happened?   An academic researcher at Cambridge University built an app called thisisyourdigitallife, which offered to pay Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to share that data for academic use. About 270,000 people participated in the study -- enough to extract information on tens of millions of Facebooks users.   How did Cambridge Analytica get data on 50 million people when only 270,000 people had agreed to hand over their information to a third party? Facebook said people who downloaded the app gave consent for the app to collect limited information about their friends whose privacy settings were set to allow it.   That information was eventually paid for by Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling company that worked with the Trump campaign.   O.K., so what do I do now?   There is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook. Here's a run down of what you should do:    Audit your Facebook apps. If you used Facebook to sign in to a third-party website, game or app, those services may continue to access your personal data. On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account. From there, you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing. Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use. (Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users.)    Audit your Facebook privacy settings. If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends, now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly. For example, you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts, or that only you can see your friends list.    Read privacy policies. When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, don't use the program.    Install a tracker blocker. There are add-ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites. But be aware that in some cases, they will make parts of websites work improperly. In our tests, Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google's Chrome browser.   Here's a primer on how tracking works, to give you a sense of why blockers are important: When you engage with an app on Facebook, it may plant a tracker in your web browser, like a cookie, that collects information from you. Even when you close out of the app, the tracker can continue to follow your activities, like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates, according to Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.   ''It doesn't go away after you've stopped looking at the ad,'' he said.    Install an ad blocker. Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether. Ad blockers are also add-ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer. Mobile ads are fully functioning programs, and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data. Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites -- and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks. A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin.    Clear your browsing data. Periodically, you can clear your cookies and browsing history. Apple, Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer. That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers, though they will probably reappear over time.    Be wary of unknown brands. Even if you read the privacy policies, you still may have to take them with a grain of salt. In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app, the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use, not commercial purposes. So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations. (Then again, the researcher came from Cambridge University, one of the world's top schools -- so who can you really trust?)   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Europe Can Lead On Privacy,"Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission from 2013 to 2017, is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. We have a responsibility to protect your information,'' Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, declared recently in a full-page newspaper advertisement. ''If we can't, we don't deserve it.'' It is nice to see Facebook taking some responsibility for the exploitation of the personal information of 50 million of its users in the service of a political campaign. But Mr. Zuckerberg's comments suggest he still doesn't get it: What matters is not whether internet companies ''deserve'' our private information but why we as consumers do not have meaningful ways to protect that data from being siphoned for sale in the first place.     The American government has done little to help us in this regard. The Federal Trade Commission merely requires internet companies to have a privacy policy available for consumers to see. A company can change that policy whenever it wants as long as it says it is doing so. As a result, internet companies have been taking our personal property -- our private information -- while hiding this fact behind lengthy and coercive legalese and cumbersome ''opt out'' processes.   The European Union, however, is handling the problem differently. Starting in May, its General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect in its 28 member nations. The regulation is powerful in its simplicity: It ensures that consumers own their private information and thus have the right to control its usage and that internet companies have an obligation to give consumers the tools to exercise that control.   The European rules, for instance, require companies to provide a plain-language description of their information-gathering practices, including how the data is used, as well as have users explicitly ''opt in'' to having their information collected. The rules also give consumers the right to see what information about them is being held, and the ability to have that information erased.   Why don't we have similar protections in the United States? We almost did. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission imposed similar requirements on the companies that provide internet service, forcing them to offer an explicit ''opt in'' for having personal data collected, and to protect the information that was collected.   This didn't last. Internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T and companies that use their connections, like Facebook and Google, lobbied members of Congress. Congress passed a law this year, signed by President Trump, that not only repealed the protections but also prohibited the F.C.C. from ever again imposing such safeguards. The same coalition of corporate interests succeeded in discouraging California from passing a state privacy law similar to the 2016 F.C.C. requirements.   Fortunately, the European Union's law should indirectly help Americans somewhat. In only a few weeks, Facebook, Google and all the other internet companies that collect our private information will have to allow European customers the protections these companies have fought to deny Americans. In an interconnected world where digital code doesn't respect the geographical or national borders, this will surely have a positive global impact.   Internet companies are preparing for a future in which regardless of where a website is based, if it is visited by even a single European Union citizen and if it seeks to collect that person's data, it must provide that person the protections of the General Data Protection Regulation. Hopefully, this experience will show these companies that protecting privacy is simply the responsible thing to do, not the end of their business.   The United States government has a lot of explaining to do. Why is it that American internet companies such as Facebook and Google are required to provide privacy protections when doing business with European consumers but are free to not provide such protections for Americans? Why is it that Americans' best privacy hope is the secondary effect of interconnected networks rather than privacy protections designed for Americans? Why shouldn't Americans also be given meaningful tools to protect their privacy?   Congress is now considering bipartisan legislation that responds to the problem of Russian targeted political advertising on social media by adding the requirement, long applied to broadcast advertising, that those websites disclose who is paying for their advertisements. But as well intentioned as that step may be, it addresses only a symptom of the problem of the extensive surveillance of Americans, not the root of the problem.   The New World must learn from the Old World. The internet economy has made our personal data a corporate commodity. The United States government must return control of that information to its owners.

Don't Follow Europe on Privacy,"Alison Cool is a professor of anthropology and information science at the University of Colorado, Boulder. There is a growing realization that our data is under attack. From breaches at Equifax to Cambridge Analytica's misuse of the profile information of more than 87 million Facebook users, it seems as if none of our personal data is safe. And more and more about us is being captured, stored and processed by smart devices like thermostats, baby monitors, WiFi-connected streetlights and traffic sensors. In the United States, people who are concerned are looking to Europe. They see Europe's ''right to be forgotten,'' by which citizens can force companies to erase some of their personal data, as a step toward regaining ownership of their online selves. And on May 25, the European Union will bring into force the most sweeping regulation ever of what can be done with people's data.     This law, the General Data Protection Regulation, will give citizens greater control over their data while requiring those who process personal data in the European Union or about its citizens to take responsibility for its protection. The G.D.P.R. will give Europeans the right to data portability (allowing people, for example, to take their data from one social network to another) and the right not to be subject to decisions based on automated data processing (prohibiting, for example, the use of an algorithm to reject applicants for jobs or loans). Advocates seem to believe that the new law could replace a corporate-controlled internet with a digital democracy.   There's just one problem: No one understands the G.D.P.R.   The law is staggeringly complex. After three years of intense lobbying and contentious negotiation, the European Parliament published a draft, which then received some 4,000 amendment proposals, a reflection of the divergent interests at stake. Corporations, governments and academic institutions all process personal data, but they use it for different purposes.   There's another reason for the regulation's complexity and ambiguity: What are often framed as legal and technical questions are also questions of values. The European Union's 28 member states have different historical experiences and contemporary attitudes about data collection. Germans, recalling the Nazis' deadly efficient use of information, are suspicious of government or corporate collection of personal data; people in Nordic countries, on the other hand, link the collection and organization of data to the functioning of strong social welfare systems.   Thus, the regulation is intentionally ambiguous, representing a series of compromises. It promises to ease restrictions on data flows while allowing citizens to control their personal data, and to spur European economic growth while protecting the right to privacy. It skirts over possible differences between current and future technologies by using broad principles.   But those broad principles don't always accord with current data practices. The regulation requires those who process personal data to demonstrate accountability in part by limiting data collection and processing to what is necessary for a specific purpose, forbidding other uses. That may sound good, but machine learning, for example -- one of the most active areas of research in artificial intelligence, used for targeted advertising, self-driving cars and more -- uses data to train computer systems to make decisions that cannot be specified in advance, derived from the original data or explained after the fact.   In 2017, the year after the regulation was approved, I interviewed scientists, data managers, legal scholars, lawyers, ethicists and activists in Sweden. I learned that many scientists and data managers who will be subject to the law find it incomprehensible. They doubted that absolute compliance was even possible.   One expert at Sweden's national bioinformatics platform said: ''We often wonder, like, what does the law say about this? Nobody knows.'' Or as a scientist in charge of computing and storage facilities at a major university put it, the G.D.P.R. says, more or less, ''that adequate safety should be in place, and so on. Right -- what does that mean?''   Many of the law's broad principles, though they avoid references to specific technologies, are nevertheless based on already outdated assumptions about technology. ''I think it's very clear that they imagined some company that has your data physically stored somewhere, and you have the right to take it out,'' a law professor told me of the G.D.P.R.'s approach to data portability. But in the era of big data and cloud services, data rarely exists in only one place.   What the regulation really means is likely to be decided in European courts, which is sure to be a drawn-out and confusing process.   Still, the G.D.P.R. is not a lost cause. We do need rules about data. But legal frameworks, particularly when they are long, complex and ambiguous, can't be the only or even the primary resource guiding the day-to-day work of data protection.   If the ultimate goal is to change what people do with our data, we need more research that looks carefully at how personal data is collected and by whom, and how those people make decisions about data protection. Policymakers should use such studies as a basis for developing empirically grounded, practical rules.   In the end, pragmatic guidelines that make sense to people who work with data might do a lot more to protect our personal data than a law that promises to change the internet but can't explain how.

Facebook Fined in U.K. Over Cambridge Analytica Leak,"LONDON -- Facebook was hit with the maximum possible fine in Britain for allowing the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the information of millions of people without their consent, in what amounts to the social network's first financial penalty since the data leak was revealed. The fine of 500,000 pounds, or about $660,000, represents a tiny sum for Facebook, which brings in billions of dollars in revenue every year. But it is the largest fine that can be levied by the British Information Commissioner's Office, an independent government agency that enforces the country's data-protection laws.  The agency has been investigating the potential misuse of personal data by political campaigns since May 2017. The examination took on new urgency after The New York Times and other organizations reported in March that Cambridge Analytica, which was based in London, had improperly gathered the data of up to 87 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to President Trump's campaign, used the information to build psychographic profiles of American voters. In an initial report of its investigation on Tuesday, the Information Commissioner's Office said it had concluded that ""Facebook contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information. It also found that the company failed to be transparent about how people's data was harvested by others."" The fine is the first punitive action against Facebook since the reports about Cambridge Analytica surfaced. Since the revelations, Facebook has grappled with regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has appeared before Congress to answer questions about his company earlier this year and also met with European lawmakers. In the United States, Facebook faces multiple inquiries by federal agencies. The Justice Department and the F.B.I. each recently broadened their inquiries into Cambridge Analytica by also focusing on Facebook. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started an investigation into Facebook's statements on the matter, and the Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether the company violated a privacy agreement with the agency. Facebook will have a chance to respond to the Information Commissioner Office's initial report. A full version of the report, thought to be coming on Wednesday, is expected to detail the ways in which data gleaned from social media companies is increasingly being used to target voters by political campaigns. Facebook did not answer a request for comment, and sent a written statement. In it, Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said the Silicon Valley company was working with the British agency on its investigation and was reviewing the report. ""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" Ms. Egan said in the statement. The report from the Information Commissioner's Office was the result of the closely fought campaign in Britain to leave the European Union. The report faulted both sides of the Brexit campaign for misusing online data to reach highly categorized segments of voters, and called for stricter policies to ensure the internet is not misused in future elections. With its findings, British authorities also took aim at Cambridge Analytica and its British affiliate, the SCL Group. The Information Commissioner's Office said it was pursuing a criminal prosecution of SCL Elections Ltd., the company from which Cambridge Analytica was spun out, for not properly dealing with the agency's enforcement actions. Another company linked to Cambridge Analytica, Aggregate IQ, also faces punishment for its involvement. The Information Commissioner's Office said the investigation was continuing, and the agency said it was waiting for responses from Facebook. The agency said it also sent out ""warning letters"" to 11 political parties, compelling them to agree to audits of their own data practices. The chairman of a British parliamentary committee that is also investigating Facebook praised the findings of the data commissioner. ""Facebook users will be rightly concerned that the company left their data far too vulnerable to being collected without their consent by developers working on behalf of companies like Cambridge Analytica,"" said Damian Collins, the chairman of the panel conducting the investigation in the House of Commons. ""The number of Facebook users affected by this kind of data scraping may be far greater than has currently been acknowledged.""

Reining In a Digital ID System,"MUMBAI, India -- In a landmark ruling on Wednesday, India's Supreme Court placed strict limits on the government's national biometric identity system while also finding that the sweeping program did not fundamentally violate the privacy rights of the country's 1.3 billion residents. A five-justice panel of the court decided by 4-1 to approve the use of the program, called Aadhaar, for matters involving the public purse, such as the distribution of food rations and other government benefits and the collection of income taxes.    But the panel struck down Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to require the digital ID for other purposes, including verifying the identity of students taking exams, and established new protections meant to prevent the government from misusing the data in the name of national security.    The justices also threw out a powerful provision in the 2016 Aadhaar Act that had allowed private companies like banks and cellphone companies -- sometimes at the government's behest -- to use the ID to verify customer identities. That was at least a temporary blow to the dreams of technology billionaires, like Nandan Nilekani and Vinod Khosla, who saw the system as crucial to a new generation of digital businesses like online vehicle insurance and pre-employment background checks.   Aadhaar, a Hindi word meaning ''foundation,'' was conceived as a difficult-to-forge ID that would reduce fraud and improve the delivery of government welfare programs. The intention was to scan the fingerprints, irises and faces of every Indian and then use those unique biometric attributes to check identity when someone picked up subsidized rice or joined a government work program.   In its 1,448-page decision -- broken up into two concurring opinions and a stinging dissent -- the court relied on precedents from around the world to set broad parameters for how the ID system could be used in India, a country that is adding tens of millions of new internet users a year but has few laws governing data protection.   Writing for the majority, Justice A.K. Sikri said that, with the court's restrictions, ''we find that the Aadhaar Act has struck a fair balance between the right of privacy of the individual with right to life of the same individual as a beneficiary.''   But the court also urged the government to further clarify those rights through a new national data protection law that is currently being debated.   The ruling on Wednesday affects a vast swath of Indian life, from who can collect benefits like food assistance and pensions to how mobile phone providers create new accounts. Some states, such as Andhra Pradesh, had planned to integrate the ID system into far-reaching surveillance programs, something that will now be difficult, given the court's restrictions on how the data can be used.   The decision could also have influence beyond India's borders, as other countries, including Britain and the Philippines, try to balance privacy against the needs of government in their own national identity and surveillance programs.   ''India is a great case study,'' said C.V. Madhukar, who leads the digital identity efforts of the Omidyar Network, an investment firm based in California. ''The Supreme Court's thinking on this so far can provide guidance to many countries in Africa and the developing world, even the United States.''   Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Indian National Congress, which began the Aadhaar program nearly a decade ago when it was in power, both claimed the ruling as a victory.   Rahul Gandhi, who is challenging Mr. Modi in the 2019 national elections, said the court had rejected the current government's use of Aadhaar as ''a tool of oppression and surveillance.''   However, Mr. Modi's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said the court had recognized the vast savings to the taxpayers from the program, which he estimated at $12 billion a year, from weeding out fake or duplicate recipients of government benefits.   ''Technology as a tool of governance, as an instrument of conferring benefits to people, as an instrument of revenue collection, I think is a concept which nobody now really can deny,'' he said. ''We were entering uncharted areas, and one of the purposes of judicial review is what is the direction in which you can move and how much.''   Despite its original goal of improving government services and creating a simple universal ID, the Aadhaar program quickly became controversial.   Tens of millions of the initial enrollments were done by poorly trained or corrupt agents who recorded incorrect biometric or other personal data like birth dates. Sloppy security practices by state and local governments led to more than 200 data breaches of sensitive information, including Aadhaar numbers.   After Mr. Modi's government made participation in Aadhaar mandatory for recipients of government benefits, millions of the poorest Indians were denied vital food rations when distribution shops had trouble reading fingerprints from work-worn hands or could not connect to the central server through India's unreliable cellphone networks.   At least 25 Indians died of starvation after Aadhaar-related verification problems, according to a tally by one professor, Reetika Khera, who has conducted extensive field research on the program. Some local governments, such as New Delhi's, stopped using the system for food programs.   Proponents argued that such problems were just teething pains. They said that a digital ID would be transformational in a country where hundreds of millions of poor people have long lacked a reliable, universally accepted way of proving who they are. For private companies like cellphone providers, Aadhaar turned a paper-intensive, two-day process of verifying a new customer's identity into a 30-second fingerprint scan.   The court, which held 38 days of hearings in the spring on more than 30 challenges to the law, noted the security lapses in its decision and acknowledged that some Indians were losing important benefits because of the reliance on digital identification. But the court said it trusted the government to resolve the problems.   Shyam Divan, the veteran lawyer who kicked off the oral arguments for the plaintiffs challenging the law, said in an interview that the court had ''contained'' the government's efforts to use Aadhaar to build a surveillance state. ''And they have completely knocked out the private sector from this,'' he said.   Aadhaar's opponents also took heart in a dissent written by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, who wrote the lead opinion last year in a related case that was the first to establish a fundamental right to privacy for Indians. In his dissent, Mr. Chandrachud embraced most of the challengers' arguments and said that the Aadhaar Act was unconstitutional.   Srikanth Nadhamuni, the chief executive of Khosla Labs, which set up a business to offer private Aadhaar authentication services, said that the court's ban on the commercial use of the digital ID was disappointing and that he hoped lawmakers would find a way to restore it in the coming data-protection legislation.   ''There are a lot of small companies who need verification done,'' he said, adding that the cost of performing such verification via an Aadhaar scan was 10 rupees, or about 14 cents, compared with 1,000 rupees for traditional paper verification.   For ordinary Indians, who had faced ever-increasing demands for their digital ID cards, the court's limits could bring some peace.   Sat Pal, a taxi driver in New Delhi, said he had been asked to produce his Aadhaar everywhere, including to get his driver's license and vehicle registration.   ''Lately they started demanding it at school admission,'' he said. ''I went to my bank to ask for a checkbook. They demanded Aadhaar. I asked them why. They said you have to produce it. So it became a tool for harassing people. Now it will be a big relief.''   Follow Vindu Goel on Twitter: @vindugoel.    "
New Law Will Let Consumers 'Freeze' Credit Files Without Charge; Your Money Adviser,"Americans will soon have the right to freeze their credit files free of charge. On May 24, President Trump signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which has received attention for loosening restrictions placed on banks after the financial crisis. The legislation, however, also made some changes to the federal law dictating consumer credit rules. One helpful change, which consumer advocates had been seeking for years, will allow consumers to ""freeze"" their credit files at the three major credit reporting bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- without charge. Consumers can also ""thaw"" their files, temporarily or permanently, without a fee.  ""It's a good thing,"" said Susan Grant, director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. Credit experts often recommend a credit freeze, also called a security freeze, as a way to protect personal information from credit fraud and identity theft. A freeze means that no one can get access to your credit files to fraudulently open a new account in your name. It also means that you can't apply for new credit, either, unless you lift the freeze using a special personal identification number. Currently, many consumers must pay to freeze -- and to thaw -- their credit files, unless they have already been a victim of identity theft. Fees vary by state. Some states prohibit them, while others allow charges of $5 to $10. (U.S. PIRG offers a map on its website showing fees by state.) Because consumers must contact all three credit bureaus separately and pay fees to each to establish a freeze, the move can potentially cost $30. The freeze change ""has the potential to save consumers a lot of money,"" said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Lawmakers, however, missed opportunities to make freezes more convenient, Mr. Stephens said. For instance, a freeze at one bureau can't be automatically applied at the other two major bureaus. Consumers must still contact all three individually, so the process can be ""very cumbersome,"" he said. The three credit bureaus all offer a service akin to a credit freeze, called a credit ""lock."" The lock has the same effect as a freeze, but is marketed as being more convenient since consumers can typically lock or unlock their credit files using a smartphone app. But there may be drawbacks, including monthly fees in some cases. Equifax has been offering free credit locks ""for life"" as part of its response to the huge data breach it suffered last year. TransUnion's online menu has several, somewhat confusing options, including a free credit lock service called TrueIdentity. Another offering, Credit Lock Plus, charges about $20 a month and includes lock capability for both TransUnion and Equifax credit reports. Experian, according to its website, charges as much as $20 a month for a service that includes credit locks. Anna Laitin, director of financial policy with Consumers Union, said the group generally recommended freezes rather than locks, since rules for freezes are established by law but those for locks, a service designed by the credit bureaus, may change. ""Consumers will know what they're getting with a freeze,"" she said. John Ulzheimer, an author and a consumer credit expert, said another benefit of the new law was that fraud alerts -- a step below a freeze, in which the credit bureau has to verify your identity before releasing information -- would remain in place for a year. Currently, alerts expire after 90 days, unless they are renewed. Here are some questions and answers about credit freezes: When will free credit freezes be available? The consumer credit rules in the new law take effect 120 days after the law was enacted, so most likely sometime in September. Equifax's freezes were already free through June 30, as part of the company's response to last year's data breach. On Thursday, a spokesman, Wyatt Jefferies, said in an email, ""Equifax is extending free credit freezes until the law takes effect."" TransUnion and Experian didn't immediately respond to inquiries about when they will end freeze fees. How do I place a freeze on my credit file? You can do it by phone or by filling out a form on the website of each of the three credit bureaus. You'll receive a personal identification number that you must use to lift the freeze if you want to apply for a loan or a credit card. Does the new law offer freeze protection to children? Yes. The law allows parents or guardians of children under 16 to freeze a child's credit file. If a child doesn't have a credit file -- which is often the case -- the law directs the bureaus to create one, and then freeze it. (Currently, options for freezing a child's credit vary by state and credit bureau.) Eva Velasquez, president and chief executive at the Identity Theft Resource Center, advised parents who freeze a child's credit file to carefully safeguard the PIN, and plan ahead for removing the freeze when the time comes.

New Status Symbol at a Hacker Convention: Real Names,"LAS VEGAS -- Ask any hacker who's been around long enough, and there's a good chance you'll hear an archetypal story, tinged with regret, about the first time his or her real identity was publicly disclosed. After enjoying years of online anonymity, the hacker known as Grifter was unmasked by a less-than-scrupulous spouse. ''Hey, Neil!'' his wife called out at him, absent-mindedly, from across a crowded room, while accompanying him (for the very first time) at a hacking conference. ''My beautiful wife, she outed me in front of the entire hacker community,'' he said with a laugh.    Dead Addict's version of the story involves an employer who pushed him to apply for a patent -- for which he was required to provide his full legal name. ''The people who later doxxed me,'' he said, using a term for publishing private information about someone, usually with malicious intent, ''pointed to that patent.''    Nico Sell managed to stay ''ungoogleable,'' she said, until around 2012, when, acting as chief executive of a secure-messaging company, Wickr, she felt she needed to become more of a public figure -- if reluctantly. ''My co-founders and I, we all drew straws,'' she said, ''and that was that.''   I met Grifter, whose real name is Neil Wyler; Dead Addict, who, citing privacy concerns, spoke with me on the condition that I not share his real name; Nico Sell, which, while undeniably the name she uses publicly, may or may not be her legal name; and dozens of other self-described hackers in August at Defcon, an annual hacking convention -- one of the world's largest -- held in Las Vegas.   A lion's share of the media attention devoted to hacking is often directed at deeply anonymous (and nefarious) hackers like Guccifer 2.0, a shadowy online avatar -- alleged to have been controlled by Russian military intelligence officers -- that revealed documents stolen from the Democratic National Committee in 2016. And, to be sure, a number of Defcon attendees, citing various concerns about privacy, still protect their identities. Many conceal their real names, instead using only pseudonyms or hacker aliases. Some wear fake beards, masks or other colorful disguises.   But new pressures, especially for those who attend Defcon, seem to be reshaping the community's attitudes toward privacy and anonymity. Many longtime hackers, like Ms. Sell and Mr. Wyler, have been drawn into the open by corporate demands, or have traded their anonymity for public roles as high-level cybersecurity experts. Others alluded to the ways in which a widespread professionalization and gamification of the hacking world -- as evidenced by so-called bug bounty programs offered by companies like Facebook and Google, which pay (often handsomely) for hackers to hunt for and disclose cybersecurity gaps on their many platforms -- have legitimized certain elements of the culture.   ''It's probably fair to say that fewer and fewer people are hiding behind their handles,'' said Melanie Ensign, a longtime Defcon attendee who works on security and privacy at Uber. ''A lot of hackers who have been around for a while -- they have families and mortgages now. At some point, you have to join the real world, and the real world does not run on anonymity.''   ''This is a profession for a lot of people now,'' she added. ''And you can't fill out a W-9 with your hacker handle.''   Defcon has grown exponentially since its founding in 1993, when Jeff Moss -- or, as many of his hacker friends know him, The Dark Tangent, or simply D.T. -- gathered about 100 of his hacker friends for a hastily assembled party. By contrast, this year's convention, the 26th, drew some 27,000 attendees, including students, security researchers, government officials and children as young as 8.   It's difficult to characterize the conference without being reductive. One could describe all of its 28 constituent ''villages'' (including the Voting Machine Hacking Village, where attendees deconstructed and scrutinized the vulnerabilities of electronic voting machines, and the Lockpick Village, where visitors could tinker with locks and learn about hardware and physical security), offer a complete list of this year's presentations (including one by Rob Joyce, a senior cybersecurity official at the National Security Agency), catalog its many contests and events (like the Tin Foil Hat Contest and Hacker Karaoke) and still not get at its essence.   The ethos of Defcon is perhaps best embodied by a gentleman I encountered in a hallway toward the end of the conference. He was wearing an odd contraption on his back, with wires and antennas protruding from its frame and with a blinking black box at its center. An agribusiness giant, he said, had recently heralded the impenetrability of the security systems built into one of its new computing components. He had obtained a version of it -- how, he wouldn't say -- and, having now subjected it to the ever-probing Defcon crowds, had disproved the company's claims. ''Turns out it's not very secure after all,'' he said with a grin, before vanishing around a corner.   Mr. Moss, perhaps the epitome of a hacker who has jettisoned anonymity and entered the public sphere, has had an evolving relationship with aliases. Like many of his early online friends, he was interested in hacking and phone phreaking (the manipulation of telecommunications systems) -- ''stuff that wasn't really legal,'' he said. Aliases provided cover for such activity. And every once in a while, he explained -- if a friend let slip your name, or if you outgrew a juvenile, silly alias -- you'd have to burn your identity and come up with a new name.   ''In my case, I had a couple previous identities,'' he said, ''but when I changed to The Dark Tangent, I was making a clear break from my past. I'd learned how to manage identities; I'd learned how the scene worked.''   He also remembers when everything changed. During the dot-com boom, many hackers transitioned to ''real jobs,'' he said, ''and so they had to have real names, too.''   ''My address book doubled in size,'' he said with a laugh. And in time, as Defcon's popularity ballooned, his list of formal appointments grew, too: membership at the Council on Foreign Relations, a seat on President Obama's Homeland Security Advisory Council.   ''The thing I worry about today,'' he added, taking a more serious tone, ''is that people don't get do-overs.'' Young people now have to contend with the real-name policy on Facebook, he said, along with the ever-hovering threats of facial-recognition software and aggregated data. ''How are you going to learn to navigate in this world if you never get to make a mistake -- and if every mistake you do make follows you forever?''   Philippe Harewood, who is 30, represents a relatively new class of hackers. He is currently ranked second on Facebook's public list of individuals who have responsibly disclosed security vulnerabilities for the site in 2018. And while he maintains an alias on Twitter (phwd), a vast majority of his hacking work is done under his real name -- which is publicized on and by Facebook. He also maintains a blog (again, under his real name) where he analyzes and discusses his exploits.   For Mr. Harewood, maintaining his alias is partly about creating a personal brand -- a retro nod, in a sense, to the era when using a hacker handle was a more essential element of the trade. But it also has practical advantages. ''People want to reach out all the time,'' he said. ''And I'm still not all that comfortable communicating with people on my Facebook profile, under my real name.''   ''In a way,'' he said, ''it just helps me filter my communications.''   In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook expanded its existing bug bounty with a program that specifically targets data abuse. And just this week the company again widened the scope to help address vulnerabilities in third-party apps. Such efforts -- coupled with the rise in recent years of companies like Bugcrowd and HackerOne, which mediate between hackers and companies interested in testing their online vulnerabilities -- have created a broader marketplace for hackers interested in pursuing legitimate forms of compensation.   Like Mr. Harewood, 11-year-old Emmett Brewer, who garnered national media attention at this year's Defcon by hacking a mock-up of the Florida state election results website in 10 minutes, also alluded to the marketing appeal of his alias, p0wnyb0y.   ''I came up with it a couple years ago, when I first got included in a news article,'' he said. ''I think an alias helps you get more recognition -- sort of like how The Dark Tangent has his.''   ''P0wnyb0y is shorter and catchier than my name,'' he added. ''And it just seems a lot cooler.''   Emmett said his involvement with Defcon -- he has attended for several years, accompanied by his father -- has left him skeptical about the degree to which his peers share things online. ''My friends put everything up on the internet,'' he said, ''but I'm more mindful.'' Still, he said he wasn't invested in keeping his real name separate from his alias. ''I don't see it as the end of the world'' if people can easily link the two, he said. ''But some other people take that stuff more seriously.''   (About his hacking the simulated election results: ''The goal was to modify with the candidates' votes -- to delete them or add new ones,'' he said. ''I changed everyone else's votes to zero, added my name, then gave myself billions of votes.'')   That's not to say, though, that the younger generations of hackers are all comfortable operating so openly. Ms. Sell's daughter, who spoke with me on the condition that I refer to her by her hacking handle, CyFi, was especially guarded about her identity.   ''When I was 9, I discovered a class of zero-day vulnerabilities,'' said CyFi, who is now 17, referring to software bugs that developers are unaware of. She ultimately disclosed the bugs, she added, ''but I didn't want to risk being sued by all those companies -- so hiding my identity was the best way to go.''   As with Emmett, CyFi is wary of her generation's penchant for oversharing online. ''My friends have definitely been frustrated with my lack of social media,'' she said. ''But the less data there is about you out in the world, the less people can try to mess with you.''   One of the most intriguing aspects of Defcon is the relationship between the hacker community and the attendees from the federal government, the complexities of which have ebbed and flowed over time. For many years, the tension resulted in a cat-and-mouse game called ''Spot the Fed.''   ''In the early days, if a fed got spotted, it was pretty consequential,'' Mr. Moss said. ''Later on, they were outing each other,'' he said with a laugh -- because they wanted the T-shirt granted to both the fed and the person who outed them.   Linton Wells II, a former principal deputy to the assistant secretary of defense for networks and information integration, began attending Defcon around 2003. He now volunteers as a ''goon'' -- the term for the volunteers (roughly 450 this year) who help organize and run the conference.   Mr. Wells said that governmental officials who attend Defcon fall into one of three categories. ''One was the people who openly announced they were feds -- either speakers who announced their affiliations, or there was a Meet the Fed panel,'' he said. ''There were others who wouldn't deny it if you asked them, but who didn't go out of their way to advertise it. And then there were those who were either officially or unofficially undercover.''   The relationship hasn't always been contentious, he added, noting that, in 2012, Keith Alexander, who was then director of the N.S.A., ''came out here and spoke in a T-shirt and bluejeans.'' Less than a year later, though, after the Edward Snowden leak, things soured. ''For the next couple years,'' Mr. Wells said, ''the feds were -- well, if not uninvited, then at least tacitly not particularly welcome.''   Joe Grand, who for many years operated under his alias, Kingpin, understands the complexities of the relationship as well as anyone. Twenty years ago, in May 1998, Mr. Grand was one of seven computer hackers who testified before a congressional panel that included Senators John Glenn, Joseph Lieberman and Fred Thompson. The hackers, members of a collective called L0pht (pronounced ''loft''), had recently boasted that they could shut down the internet in 30 minutes, and lawmakers had taken notice.   ''Due to the sensitivity of the work done at the L0pht,'' Senator Thompson explained in his opening remarks -- haltingly, as if for effect -- ''they'll be using their hacker names of Mudge, Weld, Brian Oblivion, Kingpin, Space Rogue, Tan and Stefan.'' Chuckles echoed through the room. Until then, staff members had told the L0pht hackers, the only witnesses to testify while using aliases had been members of the witness protection program. ''I hope my grandkids don't ask me who my witnesses were today,'' Senator Thompson added, to another chorus of laughter.   ''It probably helped their agenda -- by having these kids show up with fake names,'' said Mr. Grand, who sat for an interview at Defcon. ''It probably made it that much more intriguing.''   ''But using our handles,'' he added, ''was our natural way of communicating. And having that protection, it felt good. We were putting ourselves out there as hackers communicating with the government -- which, at the time, was not something you did.''   As with many longtime hackers, Mr. Grand -- who became widely known after appearing on a Discovery Channel show called ''Prototype This!'' -- has grown more comfortable operating in the open. But he still appreciates the value of anonymity. ''Hiding behind a fake name doesn't mean you're doing something malicious, and it doesn't mean you're a bad person,'' he said. ''It means you're trying to protect your privacy.''   ''And, in this day and age, you need to,'' he added, ''because everywhere you look, your privacy is being stripped away.''   Keren Elazari, a cybersecurity expert whose 2014 TED talk has been viewed millions of times, expressed a similar sentiment -- that hackers, by fighting to maintain their anonymity, can help push back against the trends of eroding online privacy. But she also described what she calls a ''maturing of the industry and the community.''   ''More and more people who started hacking in the '90s are now becoming icons and thought leaders -- and, most importantly, role models for the younger generations of hackers,'' she said.   To help guide younger generations, elder hackers can often still use nicknames, she added. ''But sometimes it makes it more powerful when they can speak up in their own voices.''    "
"Google Play Fails to Vet Apps for Children, Consumer Groups Say","A group of 22 children's and consumer organizations is calling for a federal investigation into Google's marketing of children's apps in its Google Play store, just the latest in a series of rebukes by experts about how the company handles technology aimed at youngsters. Google has promoted the ''Family'' section of its Play store as a place where parents can find age-appropriate apps for children. But in a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission filed on Wednesday, the advocacy groups said the company's endorsement of the apps was misleading. The groups said that some apps in that section contained content unsuitable for children, showed ads for casino games for adults or pushed youngsters into watching video ads and making in-app purchases.     The groups also said some apps appeared to violate the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law that prohibits sites and apps for children from collecting phone numbers, precise location, photographs, persistent tracking identifiers and other personal information from children under 13 without verifiable consent from a parent. The complaint cited an investigation by The New York Times in September that found some children's apps collected precise location information and tracking identifiers without verifiable parental permission.   Google has come under mounting scrutiny for its promotion of children's apps in its Play store. In April, cybersecurity researchers reported that more than half of about 6,000 free Android children's apps they tested shared personal data in ways that may violate the children's privacy law. In September, the attorney general of New Mexico filed a lawsuit against Google and other companies over children's apps. The complaint said that Google had violated a state law on unfair practices by marketing certain children's apps as family-friendly even when the company knew the apps failed to comply with its own policies on children's apps.   In early October, two Democratic senators called for a federal investigation to examine how app stores like Google Play vet the apps they categorize as child-friendly and ensure they comply with the privacy law. And on Wednesday morning those senators -- Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Ed Markey of Massachusetts -- along with Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, sent another letter to the chairman of the F.T.C. pressing for ''a comprehensive investigation into the Google Play store and its compliance'' with children's privacy and advertising rules.   ''There are massive, at-scale problems with Android apps for children,'' said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a children's advocacy group in Boston that led the latest complaint along with the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit in Washington. ''Google is failing to do the proper vetting of apps in the family section,'' he said.   Google said that it removed thousands of apps from its Designed for Families program this year when it found policy violations, and had begun to take action on the apps cited in the consumer groups' complaint.   ''Parents want their children to be safe online, and we work hard to protect them,'' said Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman. ''Apps in our Designed for Families program have to comply with strict policies on content, privacy and advertising, and we take action on any policy violations that we find.''   A few years ago, Google introduced Designed for Families, a program that enables developers of Android apps to ''showcase trusted, high-quality and age-appropriate content for the whole family.'' To be eligible for the program, Google says developers must meet criteria like ensuring that their apps comply with the federal privacy law and contain age-appropriate content and ads for children.   But the groups' complaint and the New Mexico attorney general's lawsuit argue that Google misled consumers by promoting the apps as trustworthy while failing to enforce its own requirements for the Designed for Families program.   Among other criticisms, the complaint says that Dentist Games for Kids, an app for children 8 and under in the Play store, showed ads for adult casino games with names like Blackjack 21: Blackjackist and Double Wins Slots -- Free Vegas Casino. It also says some apps include risky or inappropriate content, citing Ear Doctor Clinic Kids Games, an app that ''tells children to use scissors to cut the hair around and inside an infected ear,'' the complaint said. (On Wednesday morning, the app was not available in the Play store.)   The Times had similar findings when testing several children's apps in the Play store this week. One app, Smart Games for Kids for Free, a free animated game for children 8 and under that has been downloaded more than a million times, asked for access to a player's smartphone photos, media, files and location without seeking parental permission.   The app also showed ads for casino games, ''cheap international calling'' and the Spotify streaming music service, which does not allow children under 13 to have accounts. It also nearly continuously displayed an ad for in-app purchases.   Devgame Kids, a developer in Estonia that is behind the children's app, did not immediately return an email seeking comment   Mr. Stein, the Google spokesman, said: ''We take these issues very seriously and continue to work hard to remove any content that is inappropriately aimed at children from our platform.''

8 States Impose New Rules on Equifax After Data Breach,"Equifax agreed to a number of data security rules under a consent order with eight state financial regulators that was announced on Wednesday, the latest regulatory response to the breach that allowed hackers to steal sensitive personal information on more than 147 million people.  The order describes specific steps the credit bureau must take, including conducting security audits at least once a year, developing written data protection policies and guides, more closely monitoring its outside technology vendors, and improving its software patch management controls. Equifax has said that the attackers gained access to its systems last year through a known software flaw that was inadvertently left unfixed for months. If Equifax falls short on any of its new promises, regulators in the states -- Alabama, California, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina and Texas -- will be able to take punitive action. Equifax said that ""a good number"" of the measures it agreed to in the order had already been completed. ""The findings, with a very few exceptions, are not new findings and are already part of our remediation plans,"" Equifax said in a written statement. Equifax has spent nearly $243 million so far on the fallout from the data breach, including its spending on legal costs, new security tools and credit monitoring services it offered for free after the break-in was revealed in September. The company's chief executive and several other top officials were forced out in the aftermath. Government regulators and law enforcement officials are still looking into Equifax's data safeguards. The company remains under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others. But the new consent order would also allow states to take action if Equifax were to fall short of what they deem proper security measures. ""In an era of weakened federal government oversight, strong state regulation is essential in order to safeguard our markets, ensure strong consumer protections and hold regulated entities accountable,"" said Maria T. Vullo, New York's superintendent of financial services. California's business oversight commissioner, Jan Lynn Owen, was more blunt. ""The breach never should have happened,"" she said. ""This order will help ensure it doesn't happen again."" PHOTO: Equifax has spent nearly $243 million so far on the fallout from a data breach of sensitive personal information.

"Russia Tried to Undermine Confidence in Voting Systems, Senators Say","WASHINGTON -- Russia was preparing to undermine confidence in the United States' voting process when its hackers surveilled around 20 state election systems in the run-up to the 2016 elections, the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in a brief report released on Tuesday. But the committee said it saw no evidence that the Russians had ultimately changed vote tallies or voter registration information. In a few states, however, Russian hackers were ""in a position to, at a minimum, alter or delete voter registration data,"" the committee said.  ""These activities began at least as early as 2014, continued through Election Day 2016, and included traditional information-gathering efforts as well as operations likely aimed at preparing to discredit the integrity of the U.S. voting process and election results,"" the senators wrote. The Intelligence Committee has been investigating Russia's election interference campaign for well over a year now. The findings and earlier recommendations related to election security amount to its first public conclusions based on that work. Many of the committee's findings have already been disclosed publicly, but they add new detail to the scope of the Russian efforts in states across the country and the continuing vulnerabilities of those systems. The senators found that the Russians targeted at least 18 states, and said that there is evidence that they also went after three others, scanning them for vulnerabilities. In six states, they went further, trying to gain access to voting websites, and in ""a small number of states"" actually breached election computer defenses. In those instances the intruders had the ability to change registration data but appeared unable to change votes, the report stated. The senators cautioned that other Russian attacks and breaches could have gone undetected. The report, which was unclassified, faulted the Department of Homeland Security for an initially slow response to the Russian meddling, but it added that cooperation with the states had greatly improved. The department said this week that 17 states have gotten or soon will get so-called risk and vulnerability assessments of their election systems, a weekslong evaluation that is the government's most thorough cybersecurity check. Before November 2016, only one state had been assessed. The department conducts less intensive weekly ""cyberhygiene"" scans of election systems in 33 states. And it has granted federal security clearances to about 30 state election officials, removing at least some of the barriers to sharing information about future threats to election security. Lawmakers also succeeded in getting $380 million in a large spending bill in March for grants to states to improve their election infrastructure and bolster election security. The committee released a list of recommendations in late March to help secure American voting systems ahead of the midterm elections. Those recommendations included the adoption of voting machines with paper ballot backups to replace paperless or otherwise outdated ones, instituting routine vote audits and updating software systems. The senators also urged the Trump administration at the time to send a clearer message that it would not tolerate attacks on any election systems or the democratic process. In a public hearing the next day, senators pressed homeland security officials to move faster in enforcing key security measures such as the granting of security clearances to state election officials. The senators also sounded concerns on Tuesday about the shrinking number of voting-machine makers. The three largest vendors of voting equipment dominate the industry, and both the companies and their subcontractors that serve local election agencies are largely unregulated. That makes them and other vendors ""an enticing target for malicious cyberactors,"" the Intelligence Committee wrote. A National Security Agency analysis leaked last June concluded that Russian military intelligence launched a cyberattack on at least one maker of electronic voting equipment during the 2016 campaign, and sent so-called spear-phishing emails days before the general election to 122 local government officials, apparently customers of the manufacturer. The emails concealed a computer script that, when clicked on, ""very likely"" downloaded a program from an external server that gave the intruders prolonged access to election computers or allowed them to search for valuable data. The agency said the Russians appeared to have targeted managers of voter-registration computer systems, and that it was unclear whether any of those systems were compromised. Separately, Alaska officials disclosed on Monday that one of the state's election-related servers had been breached on Election Day 2016 by a hacker who apparently was unconnected to the Russians. The data on the server was not confidential and could not be changed, and the computer itself was unable to make outgoing connections via the internet, so the hacker was unable to rove elsewhere in the election network. The breach was first reported the day after the 2016 election by the website Cyberwar News, but it went largely unnoticed until state officials revealed it this week. The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to write and release additional reports on American intelligence agencies' assessment of the Russian efforts, the Obama administration's response, the Russians' use of social media, and lastly, possible coordination or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Senators have conceded that consensus on that final report may be difficult to reach. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the committee's chairman, told reporters on Tuesday that the next report, on the intelligence assessment, could be out as early as next week.

Handful Of Steps To Protect Your Data,"Facebook said its engineers discovered a security weakness this week that could let attackers hijack people's accounts. The vulnerability, which the company said had been fixed, affected nearly 50 million accounts.  Facebook said in a web post that the security issue was related to the ''View As'' feature, which allows people to see a preview of what their profile looks like to other people, like specific friends. Hackers exploited a weakness in the tool to gain access to digital keys that let people access Facebook from a personal device without having to re-enter a password. The keys could then be used to take over people's accounts, the company said.    The social networking giant said that it had reset all the access keys for affected users and that those users would have to log back into their accounts. In other words, there is not much you have to do. But there are some precautions you should take to protect yourself from the attack.   Do a Device Audit   The best way to determine whether someone has gained improper access to your account is to do an audit of the devices that you have used to log into Facebook. On Facebook's Security and Login page, under the tab labeled ''Where You're Logged in,'' you can see a list of devices that are signed into your account, as well as their locations. If you see an unfamiliar gadget or a device signed in at an odd location, you can click the ''Remove'' button to boot the device out of your account.   Change Your Password   Facebook says that because it has fixed the vulnerability, there is no need to change your account password. But to be extra safe, you probably should anyway -- especially if you use a weak password or saw any suspicious devices logged into your accounts.   If you decide to change your password, choose a complex one -- and do not reuse a password you have used on a different site. Try creating long and complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters, like: My favorite number is Green4782#.   To keep your passwords organized and easy to access, consider using a password-management app like 1Password or LastPass. These tools let you keep all your passwords in a digital vault that can be opened with one master password, and they can also automatically generate complex passwords.   Turn on Two-Factor Authentication   Like many sites, Facebook offers a security feature called two-factor authentication. It involves text messaging a unique code to your phone that you must type in after entering your password. This way, even if someone gained access to your password, it would be difficult to log in without that code. Even though Facebook fixed this week's security vulnerability, every user should have this feature turned on.    "
Facebook's Zuckerberg Said to Agree to Testify Before Congress Over Data Privacy,"WASHINGTON -- For 10 days, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has been under increasing pressure from lawmakers and regulators to answer questions about the improper harvesting of data of 50 million Facebook users by a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. Now Mr. Zuckerberg plans to go to Washington to explain himself.  The chief executive has agreed to testify in at least one congressional hearing over the social network's handling of customer data, according to people familiar with the decision. Specifically, he plans to appear next month before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements were not public. Mr. Zuckerberg may make other appearances; he has also been asked to testify before the Senate and House Judiciary and Commerce Committees. His appearing on Capitol Hill could create a spectacle that is replayed online and on television for years to come, especially amid a backlash against the power of tech behemoths. Late last year, executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter showed up at congressional hearings to discuss Russian meddling online in the 2016 presidential election, putting faces to the tech platforms during criticism of their misuse. Congressional testimony by Silicon Valley chief executives is rare, and their appearances have each set off a media circus. In 2013, Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, addressed senators about his company's tax practices. In 2011, Google's chairman at the time, Eric Schmidt, spoke about the company's search practices in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in 1998, Bill Gates, who was Microsoft's chief executive, defended his company against lawmakers' assertions that he was building a monopoly -- an argument he eventually lost in court. ""The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,"" said Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. CNN earlier reported that Mr. Zuckerberg had decided to testify in front of Congress. He has been under pressure to appear before Congress since reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained and used the data of 50 million Facebook users. The revelations immediately sparked a furor on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators in Britain and the United States calling for Mr. Zuckerberg to discuss what happened. Those calls haven't subsided, even though the chief executive issued a public statement last week outlining the steps that Facebook was taking to prevent improper harvesting of the data of its 2.2. billion users. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users. Politicians including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, have also pressed for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear on Capitol Hill. Mr. Zuckerberg has turned down some requests to go before lawmakers. He declined to appear this week before the British Parliament and answer questions about data privacy. Facebook staff have held marathon meetings and phone calls with staff from congressional committees over the past week, according to Facebook employees and others briefed on the matter. Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, and Molly Cutler, its associate general counsel, have met with staff from the House and Senate Commerce, Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, they said. Mr. Zuckerberg initially resisted speaking to Congress, and had asked if a senior Facebook executive could be sent to represent the company in his name, two Facebook employees familiar with the conversations said. After the public outcry over Facebook's data and privacy settings, Mr. Zuckerberg was persuaded that he needed to appear, they said. In recent days, he told Facebook employees that he had come to understand he would have to testify. In an interview with CNN last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said that he would be ""happy to"" testify in front of Congress and that ""it's the right thing to do."" He added of Cambridge Analytica, ""This was a major breach of trust, and I'm really sorry that this happened."" Google and Twitter have also been called to testify before Congress on data privacy. The companies didn't respond to requests for comment. Lawmakers have been frustrated in the past by Mr. Zuckerberg's absence from hearings. Last year, Facebook sent its general counsel, Colin Stretch, to join lawyers from Twitter and Google to testify about social media's role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 election. Lawmakers noted the absence of senior executives, including Mr. Zuckerberg, and repeatedly challenged Facebook to send its leaders to answer questions. In a recent interview, Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said Mr. Zuckerberg needed to directly answer questions from Congress about what kind of user data was being gathered and shared, because Facebook has been too vague about its practices. He said the attorneys for Facebook, Google and Twitter who testified about the 2016 election had ""dodged questions."" ""They didn't say a damn thing, which was what they were paid to do,"" Mr. Kennedy said. ""I'd encourage Mr. Zuckerberg to do the common-sense thing and roll up his sleeves and take a meaningful amount of time talking to us about this.""

Facebook Introduces Central Page for Privacy and Security Settings,"Facebook said it would roll out a centralized system for its users to control their privacy and security settings in response to an outcry over the way it has handled personal data. The system, which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks, will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform. From the new page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them, such as their political preferences or interests, and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them. Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information.  Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism. ""The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,"" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. ""We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed."" The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said. Last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings. ""One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data,"" he told The New York Times last week. ""Whenever there's an issue where someone's data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn't have allowed it to, that's rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar. Late Wednesday, Facebook also said that it was halting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers. These are business-to-business companies that can collect a vast range of details about individual consumers such as their shopping habits, health concerns, income range and preferred credit card. The social network had previously allowed advertisers to use consumer details from data brokers like Experian, Acxiom and Oracle's Datalogix unit to help target ads to Facebook users. But Facebook said it was now mothballing that option, called ""Partner Categories."" ""We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,"" Graham Mudd, a product marketing director at Facebook, said in a statement. ""This product enables third-party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook,"" he added. ""While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook."" In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission opened an inquiry into data brokers and subsequently recommended that Congress consider enacting a law ""to make data broker practices more visible to consumers and to give consumers greater control over the immense amounts of personal information about them collected and shared by data brokers."" How much of a difference these actions may make to Facebook's data privacy practices was unclear. Some privacy advocates noted, for instance, that the company's new centralized privacy and security settings page has been tried in the past. ""The platform made similar promises many times before,"" said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Mr. Zuckerberg said in The Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would ""add privacy controls that are much simpler to use."" Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Ms. Tufekci said. ""The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its C.E.O.,"" she said.

A Tough Task for Facebook: European-Type Privacy for All,"Next month,  a comprehensive new data protection law goes into effect in the European Union, placing greater requirements on how companies like Facebook and Google handle users' personal information. It also strengthens individuals' rights to control the collection and use of their data.  Last week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said his company would offer its users all over the world the same privacy controls required under the European law.    What would that look like for Facebook users? That is still a work in progress.  A Facebook spokeswoman said the company would provide more details about its plans in the coming weeks. In the meantime, here are some of the general requirements and rights under the new European law.  Although some of the practical steps that companies must take are still being worked out, several European privacy and consumer advocates, who had pushed for the new law, offered their thoughts on what Facebook might need to do to extend the protections to its users worldwide. Minimizing Data Collection The European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, requires companies to collect and store only the minimum amount of user data needed to provide a specific, stated service. That means a flashlight app should not be asking users for access to their photos or contacts. Anna Fielder, a senior policy adviser at Britain-based Privacy International, said she thought the new law would require the social network to change certain advertising and other settings to make privacy, and not sharing, the default. Currently, the company makes certain user profile details public by default. And the default advertising settings allow targeted ads based on a user's relationship status, employer, job title, education and use of websites and apps. Facebook currently has controls that allow users to choose who can see their posts. There is also a ""privacy checkup"" feature where users can adjust their sharing settings. In a statement in response to questions, Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said, ""We need to do more to keep people informed and in control."" He noted that the company had recently introduced a new ""privacy shortcuts"" menu that centralized major privacy, security and ad settings. ""These are just a few small steps and there's more to come,"" he said. Obtaining Users' Consent The European law requires companies like Facebook and Google to use clear and plain language to explain how they will use their users' personal details. The companies must also provide information about what other kinds of entities users' data will be shared with. Digital platforms must also obtain consent from individuals for many uses of their data.  When companies want to use individuals' data for a new purpose, they must explain that new purpose and obtain users' permission.  And companies must get special permission from users to collect and use sensitive details like health information, unless that data is clearly related to the purpose of the service, such as a diabetes management app. That means Facebook will probably need to rework its data policy and terms of service, said Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad, director of digital policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, a nonprofit group in Oslo. He added that he thought the law would also require Facebook to give users more ""real choices, not take it or leave.""  The current data policy requires people who sign up for the social network to allow Facebook to, among other things, track them on many other apps and websites. Mr. Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said that Facebook was updating its terms of service and data policy to ensure that it complied with the new European law.  Those updates cover users worldwide, with legal variations in some places. Algorithmic Decision-Making The European law gives individuals the right not to be subject to completely automated  decisionswhich significantly affect them. These decisions could include credit algorithms that use an individual's data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan.   Privacy International said the clause on automated decisions could allow consumers to challenge Facebook practices like political advertising, which can be sent to users based on algorithms, because the ads are meant to sway users' votes. Facebook currently has a section called ""Your Ad Preferences"" that allows users to opt out of seeing ads based on their relationship status, employer,  education, interests, and use of websites and apps. Users can also hide ads related to three topics -- alcohol, pets and parenting -- or suggest a topic they would rather not see ads about.  Accessing Data About You The European law gives people the right obtain a copy of the records that companies hold about them. Facebook already allows users to download a copy of their information  -- such as the messages they have sent on the service and the status updates they have posted. At the end of March, the company announced new tools to let its users see and delete information such as their friend requests and their Facebook searches. But if Facebook wants to offer European-level privacy protection to all, it would also need to provide its users with the data that Facebook itself collected or created about them, including any categories, descriptions or behavior scores Facebook assigned to them, European privacy experts said. And it should provide users who seek their own records with any data that Facebook has obtained from tracking them around the web as well as any data that Facebook obtained about them from third parties, like data brokers, they said. ""You exercise your access rights and you have the right to know everything about you,"" said Giovanni Buttarelli,the European data protection supervisor who oversees an independent European Union authority that advises on privacy-related laws and policies.

Mark Zuckerberg's Own Data Disclosed After Senate Hearing: His Notes,"A photographer captured two pages of Mark Zuckerberg's notes for his appearance at a Senate hearing on Tuesday. Once highlighted on Twitter, the image was retweeted thousands of times. To many commenters, the paradox was clear. On a day Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, faced lawmakers' questions about whether his company adequately protected users' data, he experienced a disclosure of his own.    The talking points gave a detailed view of Facebook's extensive preparations for the appearance before Congress of its billionaire founder. While some of the notes matched what he said on Tuesday, others reminded him what not to say or anticipated questions that were not raised. Mr. Zuckerberg will appear Wednesday for another day of testimony.    One section of the notes suggested responses in case Mr. Zuckerberg was asked if he would step down. He was not asked that question, but the suggested reply indicated he planned to stay.   ''Resign?'' read the notes, which were written in an abbreviated form. ''Founded Facebook. My decisions. I made mistakes. Big challenge, but we've faced problems before, going to solve this one. Already taking action.''   The notes also included what Mr. Zuckerberg should say if asked whether Facebook should be broken up. ''U.S. tech companies key asset for America,'' was the suggested reply. ''Breakup strengthens Chinese companies.''   Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked if Facebook was a monopoly. But he did not press Mr. Zuckerberg on whether the company should be divided, and the answer citing Chinese competition was not used.   ''You don't think you have a monopoly?'' Mr. Graham asked.   ''It certainly doesn't feel like that to me,'' Mr. Zuckerberg replied.   Mr. Zuckerberg's notes also guide a response to recent criticism from Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, who has described his own company as a far more robust defender of consumer privacy.   ''Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people,'' read the notes. But Mr. Cook's comments were not raised during the hearing, and the response was not used.   Another section warns Mr. Zuckerberg about comments to avoid. In response to any questions about European Union privacy and data protections, the notes instructed that he should not say Facebook already complies with a data privacy law that goes into effect in May.   The image was photographed by Andrew Harnik of The Associated Press and was included in a tweet from Stefan Becket, a senior news editor at CBSNews.com, that was shared widely.   ''I took 70 photos of Zuck today,'' Mr. Harnik wrote in response. ''Leave it to the writers to love the photograph of pages of text.''   Mr. Harnik said he didn't think the photo constituted the sharing of private information.   ''He left it on the desk surrounded by probably upwards of 100 film and still cameras pointed at the desk from every direction,'' he tweeted. ''I do not think that constitutes an invasion of privacy.''   Photos of notes during official events have a long history of revealing more information than those who held them intended.   In 1975, a photograph of then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the Helsinki Accords showed him reading a document with the heading ''TOP SECRET SENSITIVE EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY CONTAINS CODE WORD.''   The document, which discussed diplomatic relations between France and North Vietnam based on a C.I.A. source with access to the French Foreign Ministry, undermined ties between Washington and Paris, Lawrence Martin-Bittman, a Boston University scholar, wrote in 1981.   More recently, President Trump was photographed during a meeting with parents, students and teachers who lost loved ones in the Parkland, Fla., school shooting holding notes that included the line, ''I hear you.'' The image raised questions about his ability to empathize with people who were grieving.    "
"Why Silicon Valley Lobbyists Love Big, Broad Privacy Bills; Op-Ed Contributor","Mark Zuckerberg promises that Facebook can do better to protect our privacy. Three times during his testimony before Congress on Tuesday, he used the same example: Face recognition technology, he explained, should require ""special consent"" from users. He left out a key fact: This week, lobbyists paid by Facebook are working with Illinois lawmakers backed by Facebook to gut the state's face recognition privacy law, the strongest in the nation. This should make us very skeptical about any callsfor a broad, European-style privacy law that would apply across technologies and platforms. We cannot underestimate the tech sector's power in Congress and in state legislatures. If the United States tries to pass broad rules for personal data, that effort may well be co-opted by Silicon Valley, and we'll miss our best shot at meaningful privacy protections.  In 1995, the E.U. passed broad privacy laws that applied to almost all personal data. The United States has taken a different path. Companies that collect consumer data can't defraud or mislead their customers, and the Federal Trade Commission is a watchdog for those standards. Beyond those foundational protections, Congress has historically protected our data through ""sectoral"" laws that set specific rules for specific industries. Thus, records on the videos you watch, your credit report, health history, and other kinds of data are all protected by slightly different rules. This is far from a perfect system, and a flood of tech sector lobbying has made it worse. Since 2009, Facebook has increased its spending on lobbying fiftyfold. And the $11.5 million it spent in 2017 still ranked it third behind Amazon and Alphabet. Lobbying works. Congress hasn't passed a single new major privacy law since a 2009 update to federal health privacy rules. Take a second to think of technologies popularized in the last nine years: drones, self-driving cars, Amazon Echo, Google Home, among others. If it blossomed after 2009, chances are, it is not regulated by any federal privacy law. What does that flood of lobbying look like? From 2011 to 2014, as a staffer for Senator Al Franken, then chairman of the Senate privacy subcommittee, I worked to pass a bill to force companies to ask for users' permission before collecting or sharing records of their movements. The bill would have outlawed so-called ""stalking apps"" that let abusers secretly track their victims' locations through their smartphones. Industry lobbyists outnumbered our supporters 54 to 2. Yet in 2012, thanks to a small coalition of privacy, women's rights, and anti-stalking groups, we managed to pass the bill out of the Judiciary Committee. That's when the lobbying really started. When I called a meeting of industry stakeholders, I had to move it from our 12-person conference table to the full Judiciary Committee hearing room, which seats four or five times that. The bill stalled. It was never again brought up for a vote. Passing a strong industry-specific privacy law is tough. But at least it's possible. When the Obama administration tried to pass an omnibus privacy bill, the law's original framework was promising. It stressed that consumers needed control of their information, transparency about how it was used, and accountability when it was abused. In 2015, after Silicon Valley weighed in, the bill that the White House put forward was so toothless that almost every major consumer privacy group opposed it. Around the time our anti-stalking bill stalled, I remember a lobbyist telling me that we should really consider setting our bill aside until Congress could pass a comprehensive privacy law. Now I know why. It could be that the Cambridge Analytica scandal will pave the way for previously impossible, European-style reforms. Facebook's actions tell a different story. Even as it yells mea culpa, Facebook is calculating that it can kneecap new privacy rules with impunity. Facebook is spending its lobbying money not only to gut the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act but also to stop a new California consumer privacy ballot initiative. Those calculations are right -- if we make this a broad debate about ""personal data."" Let's make this a debate about people and pass laws to address the threats they actually face. Let's talk about the people who are still stalked every year through their smartphones. Or how retailers secretly use face recognition to spot shoplifters, even though the technology misfires more often when trying to identify African-Americans and women. Let's make this a debate about how Facebook tracked people to determine if they had an ""affinity"" for African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians, and then let advertisers block those people from seeing real estate ads. It's one thing to pit internet companies against the idea of ""privacy."" It's another to show a lawmaker the real people in her district who will be hurt by her failure to act. In 1967, Justice Potter Stewart declared that the Fourth Amendment ""protects people, not places."" It's time to recognize that privacy protects people, not data. Alvaro M.

I Downloaded the Information That Facebook Has on Me. Yikes.; Tech Fix,"When I downloaded a copy of my Facebook data last week, I didn't expect to see much. My profile is sparse, I rarely post anything on the site, and I seldom click on ads. (I'm what some call a Facebook ""lurker."") But when I opened my file, it was like opening Pandora's box. With a few clicks, I learned that about 500 advertisers -- many that I had never heard of, like Bad Dad, a motorcycle parts store, and Space Jesus, an electronica band -- had my contact information, which could include my email address, phone number and full name. Facebook also had my entire phone book, including the number to ring my apartment buzzer. The social network had even kept a permanent record of the roughly 100 people I had deleted from my friends list over the last 14 years, including my exes. There was so much that Facebook knew about me -- more than I wanted to know. But after looking at the totality of what the Silicon Valley company had obtained about yours truly, I decided to try to better understand how and why my data was collected and stored. I also sought to find out how much of my data could be removed.  How Facebook collects and treats personal information was central this week when Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, answered questions in Congress about data privacy and his responsibilities to users. During his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg repeatedly said Facebook has a tool for downloading your data that ""allows people to see and take out all the information they've put into Facebook."" (Those who want to download their own Facebook data can use this link.) But that's an overstatement. Most basic information, like my birthday, could not be deleted. More important, the pieces of data that I found objectionable, like the record of people I had unfriended, could not be removed from Facebook, either. ""They don't delete anything, and that's a general policy,"" said Gabriel Weinberg, the founder of DuckDuckGo, which offers internet privacy tools. He added that data was kept around to eventually help brands serve targeted ads. Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: ""When you delete something, we remove it so it's not visible or accessible on Facebook."" She added: ""You can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers."" Digging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here's what I learned. Facebook Retains More Data Than We Think When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the ""index"" file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features. One surprising part of my index file was a section called Contact Info. This contained the 764 names and phone numbers of everyone in my iPhone's address book. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that Facebook had stored my entire phone book because I had uploaded it when setting up Facebook's messaging app, Messenger. This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily -- and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria. This felt unnecessary, though Facebook holds on to your phone book partly to keep it synchronized with your contacts list on Messenger and to help find people who newly sign up for the messaging service. I opted to turn off synchronizing and deleted all my phone book entries. My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later -- something I barely remember doing. Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year. Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn't try to purge this information. But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of ""Removed Friends,"" a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the ""Unfriend"" button. Why should Facebook remember the people I've cut off from my life? Facebook's explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature ""On This Day,"" which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I'd rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good. The Ad Industry Has Eyes Everywhere What Facebook retained about me isn't remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network. Lower down, there was a section titled ""Advertisers with your contact info,"" followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy -- one was called ""Microphone Check,"" which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria's Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP. Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people's Facebook profiles to serve them ads. Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include: [#x25a0] Buying information from a data provider like Acxiom, which has amassed one of the world's largest commercial databases on consumers. Brands can buy different types of customer data sets from a provider, like contact information for people who belong to a certain demographic, and take that information to Facebook to serve targeted ads, said Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis. Last month, Facebook announced that it was limiting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers like Acxiom. [#x25a0] Using tracking technologies like web cookies and invisible pixels that load in your web browser to collect information about your browsing activities. There are many different trackers on the web, and Facebook offers 10 different trackers to help brands harvest your information, according to Ghostery, which offers privacy tools that block ads and trackers. The advertisers can take some pieces of data that they have collected with trackers and upload them into the Custom Audiences tool to serve ads to you on Facebook. [#x25a0] Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook. The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality. I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond. What About Google? Let's be clear: Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what information tech companies have collected on me. Knowing this, I also downloaded copies of my Google data with a tool called Google Takeout. The data sets were exponentially larger than my Facebook data. For my personal email account alone, Google's archive of my data measured eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. By comparison, my Facebook data was about 650 megabytes, the equivalent of about 160 hours of music. Here was the biggest surprise in what Google collected on me: In a folder labeled Ads, Google kept a history of many news articles I had read, like a Newsweek story about Apple employees walking into glass walls and a New York Times story about the editor of our Modern Love column. I didn't click on ads for either of these stories, but the search giant logged them because the sites had loaded ads served by Google. In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile. Yet that offered little solace. Be warned: Once you see the vast amount of data that has been collected about you, you won't be able to unsee it.Related Articles  "
Facebook Users' Worries About Use of Their Data; Letters,"To the Editor: Re ""Remember Those Friends You Deleted Long Ago? Facebook Does"" (front page, April 12): Brian X.

And it's been shown that our smartphones can track us even when GPS is turned off. We must move beyond Facebook to address privacy. LYNN BENT, PORTOLA VALLEY, CALIF.

"After Cambridge Analytica, Privacy Experts Get to Say 'I Told You So'","PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Doc Searls met with a group of fellow internet privacy experts one recent afternoon here at the Computer History Museum. On a whiteboard were the words ""OUTRAGE"" and ""MAKE HAY"" -- capitalized, underlined and surrounded by lines jutting in all directions like a cartoon ""BOOM!"" For the first time in years, their field of expertise was front and center. Facebook had just come under intense scrutiny over how the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of up to 87 million its users. Seated in a wide circle of folding chairs, members of the group excitedly discussed what they could do next.  ""A lot of geeks in the world are looking at Facebook as a redwood that's starting to fall,"" said Mr. Searls, whose given name is David and who created ProjectVRM, a program at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society that seeks to empower internet users to protect personal privacy. ""They're saying, 'O.K., it's barn-raising time.' "" The scandal swirling around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica has begun to usher in a new era for this once-ignored community of privacy researchers and developers. After years of largely disregarding their warnings about exactly what companies like Facebook were doing -- that is, collecting enormous amounts of information on its users and making it available to third parties with little to no oversight -- the general public suddenly seemed to care about what they were saying. The outcry over data privacy has been so strong that it pushed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, into testifying on Capitol Hill this week over the company's failures to protect users' information. Protesters rallied outside the Capitol during his testimony. Someone even arrived at a hearing dressed as a Russian troll. In their own lives, privacy experts are now fielding a spike in calls from their relatives asking them for advice about protecting their personal data. Engineers are discussing new privacy projects with them. Even teenagers are paying attention to what they have to say. For many developers, this is the right time to push ahead with testing more privacy solutions, including more advanced advertising blockers; peer-to-peer browsers that decentralize the internet; new encryption techniques; and data unions that let users pool their data and sell it themselves. Others want to treat tech giants more as information fiduciaries, which have a legal responsibility to protect user data. And for the first time, many privacy experts think internet users will be more willing to put up with a little more inconvenience in return for a lot more privacy. ""This is the first blink of awakening of the world to a danger that's been present for a long time, which is that we are exposed,"" Mr. Searls said. ""Cambridge Analytica is old, old news to privacy folks."" John Scott-Railton, who researches digital rights and privacy at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, said he recently thought back to all the PowerPoint presentations and papers he had given and seen that cautioned about how third parties might access and abuse user data. ""It didn't stick until now,"" he said. ""Now it's changed, or at least people nod along when we talk about it."" Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, recalled the organization's years of efforts to get Facebook to monitor how third parties were using data. Yet few paid attention at the time, even though the group specifically called out Facebook's quizzes in 2009. (Cambridge Analytica used a third-party quiz app from an independent researcher to harvest Facebook users' data.) The social network has said it will investigate many third-party apps that have had access to large amounts of users information. Nonetheless, the A.C.L.U. is pushing for users to have tighter control over what Facebook apps can do and arguing that Facebook ought to audit its developers. The organization also believes that more privacy protections should be enshrined in law. ""We're having the conversation now that we should have had over a decade ago,"" Ms. Singh Guliani said. Some privacy experts are prepared for disappointment. There have been privacy scandals before that did not lead to sea changes. For example, Google once collected private Wi-Fi information as it was building out Google Maps. The ensuing outrage did not have a lasting effect on the Silicon Valley company's vast data collection effort. But this Facebook scandal seems to be enduring even in the new frenetic news cycle. ""This has kept the national attention for what: three or four weeks now?"" said Allie Bohm, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit in Washington that promotes an open internet. ""It really feels like, hey, we could get some stuff done."" One reason it has always been hard to get consumers interested in security and privacy is that the harms were vague and hard to understand. With Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the harms are identifiable and frightening, said Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher specializing in privacy and a former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission. ""Much like a car accident, the harms on social media are low-probablility events with extremely variable outcomes,"" he said. "" 'So what if my boss saw me doing a keg stand?' But all of a sudden the 'so what if' becomes more serious -- 'I get denied insurance or my information is used by a nation state actor to manipulate me.' "" Cambridge Analytica's work, which included using Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, tapped into an anxiety many Americans already had over the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. ""This one stuck because it was Trump, and we're looking for someone to blame,"" said Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer who runs the Schneier on Security blog and wrote ""Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World."" ""If Hellmann's mayonnaise did this, we'd be impressed."" Privacy experts said this shift in public opinion was what they had been waiting for, because it is the only way to bring about change. Facebook will not willingly change its policies without pressure from shareholders or regulators, they added. Historically, public opinion is ""the crucible"" for era-defining industry change, said Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a forthcoming book about tech platforms and power. ""If you go back to the rapaciousness and lawlessness of Gilded Age capitalism, it was the slow burn of public opinion that gradually gathered force and ultimately became the driving force that provided cover for dramatic new legislative and regulatory efforts,"" she said. ""Public opinion gave the Gilded Age a beginning, a middle and an end."" For Rohit Ghai, president of the cybersecurity firm RSA, whose SecurID technology has become an industry standard for companies protecting access to their internal systems, the change is evident even inside his home in San Jose, Calif. He previously tried to talk to his 13-year-old daughter about data privacy and social media -- even providing examples of how much the tech companies know about people and what they can do with that information. She shrugged him off. Then the Cambridge Analytica revelations happened. For once, Mr. Ghai said, his teenager came to talk to him. ""She just asked me about Mark Zuckerberg,"" he said. ""That's a sign."" Follow Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @NellieBowles  PHOTO: Facebook's offices in Menlo Park, Calif.

"How Facebook and Google Could Benefit From the G.D.P.R., Europe's New Privacy Law","SAN FRANCISCO -- In Europe and the United States, the conventional wisdom is that regulation is needed to force Silicon Valley's digital giants to respect people's online privacy. But new rules may instead serve to strengthen Facebook's and Google's hegemony and extend their lead on the internet. That could begin playing out next month, when Europe enacts sweeping new regulations that prioritize people's data privacy. The new laws, which require tech companies to ask for users' consent for their data, are likely to hand Google and Facebook an advantage. That's because wary consumers are more prone to trust recognized names with their information than unfamiliar newcomers. And the laws may deter start-ups that do not have the resources to comply with the rules from competing with the big companies. In recent years, other regulatory attempts at strengthening online privacy rules have also had little effect at chipping away at the power of the largest tech companies, ultimately aiding internet giants rather than hurting them.  ""Regulations help incumbents,"" said Avi Goldfarb, a marketing professor at the University of Toronto who has studied the effect of privacy regulations on competition. Mr. Goldfarb was the co-author of a 2013 report that said privacy regulation could be anti-competitive because the cost of getting permission from users for their data was typically much higher for a younger company than for an established firm. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] That Facebook and Google may emerge stronger from all of this can seem like a distant prospect. The Silicon Valley companies have been under scrutiny for months for the way they collect and use people's data, with Facebook reeling from revelations that the political research firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal information of up to 87 million of its users. That led Congress to drag Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to Washington this month for a grilling. Google, too, has grappled with questions about its online video service YouTube as it tries to duck lawmakers who fear that the search giant's data-collection machinery is as robust as Facebook's, if not more so. At the same time, countries like Brazil and Argentina are exploring European-style privacy regulations that will further test the companies' advertising-based business models. United States lawmakers also showed more openness to regulating Silicon Valley during Mr. Zuckerberg's testimony this month. Yet past attempts at privacy regulation have done little to mitigate the power of tech firms. Consider what happened in Europe after earlier attempts at checking the power of Facebook, Google and others. In 2014, Europe's highest court ruled that people had the ""right to be forgotten"" online, meaning they could ask Google and other digital companies to delete search results about them. Since then, Google has instead become a chief arbiter of what information is kept online in Europe because the company itself is responsible for determining the fate of each deletion request. Another 2011 European law requiring websites to alert visitors to ""cookie"" trackers that collect data on browsing history has largely turned into a distracting annoyance rather than changing how companies operate. People often accept the tracking to get rid of the pop-up warning without reading details about the tracking. Today, the uproar over data privacy has also done little to diminish the businesses or usage of Facebook and Google. Mr. Zuckerberg said this month that the Cambridge Analytica scandal had nomeaningful effect on Facebook's business, which is expected to show sales growth when the company reports quarterly earnings this week. Alphabet, Google's parent company, said on Monday that its revenue rose 26 percent for its most recent quarter as its ad business continued to grow. Spokeswomen for Facebook and Google declined to comment. In Europe, the coming data privacy laws are known as the General Data Protection Regulation. These rules will restrict how tech companies collect, store and use personal data from people across the region. The laws, which take effect on May 25, require companies to explain how they plan to use people's personal information in simple, unambiguous language and detail what other entities will gain access to that data. Companies can no longer hide behind convoluted and often ignored user agreements, but must obtain consent with a full understanding of the user where their data may go. Lawyers, consultants and businesses preparing for the privacy laws said that reining in the large technology companies was not the primary goal of the European legislation. Some privacy advocates also bristle at the idea that these new restrictions would help already powerful internet companies, noting that is a well-worn argument employed by tech giants to try to prevent future regulation. But Nicolas Colin, a co-founder and director at the Family, a Paris-based start-up accelerator, argued that ""people tend to give that permission to companies they trust."" He said that ""stricter rules strengthen companies because they have that key asset that is trust."" The European privacy laws may crimp targeted advertising by limiting the flow of personal data, but firms like Google and Facebook still have an advantage because advertisers are likely to turn to services with reach and enormous audiences -- akin to buying an ad during the Super Bowl. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly users, and Google's YouTube has 1.5 billion monthly users. Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor who was involved in the creation of privacy rules, said much of the impact would be determined by regulators who enact the law and who will be up against well-funded teams of lobbyists and lawyers. Google and Facebook will be overseen by the Irish data authority because their European headquarters are in Ireland. Mr. Buttarelli noted that Europe had staff of about 2,500 across all the countries working on the issue. ""That's peanuts compared to the lobbyists in Brussels and Strasbourg,"" he said, referring to the cities where the European Commission and Parliament operate. [Read about the Irish data protection commissioner,who is eager to test her newfound power.] He said large technology companies had advantages but would also be under a microscope. Enforcement of the law is skewed to companies that handle the most personal data. ""There are pros and cons to being a tech giant,"" he said. ""We want to treat small and medium-sized businesses differently."" Yonatan Zunger, a former Google privacy engineer now working at human resources start-up Humu, said Europe was holding Google and Facebook to ""a much higher bar"" when it came to gaining consent from users. These companies now cannot make data sharing a condition of using their products because consent needs to be freely given, whereas smaller companies are not held to that same standard, he said. Still, there are already signs the big companies are adjusting to the new privacy norms. [Read more about how to parse the flood of G.D.P.R.-related privacy notices in your inbox.] Facebook last week rolled out a new consent form asking users globally -- not just Europeans -- to accept its targeted advertising and to allow features like face recognition. It has also limited access to data brokers such as Acxiom, in a concession to privacy advocates. Google, which spent years preparing for the new rules, has stopped scanning Gmail messages for keywords used to target advertising. And it recently introduced a new marketing product for publishers that shows ads based on the context of other articles or content on a website, instead of relying on personal information. In response, privacy critics have challenged Facebook's new consent forms, saying they are intended to continue encouraging users to share information widely. And Google came under fire for an updated European user consent policy that has open-ended language, which critics said violated a tenet of European privacy rules that requires companies to ask for user consent in specific and explicit ways. ""I'm worried that a lot of people have invested a lot of hope in G.D.P.R., and I'm not sure it's going to deliver,"" said Ben Scott, a senior adviser to the Open Technology Institute at New America, a think tank based in Washington. ""It will all depend on how it's going to be enforced.""

Facebook's Privacy Changes Leave Developers Steaming,"SAN FRANCISCO -- For years, Cubeyou made a business out of personal data on Facebook. The company had unfettered access to Facebook users' information, which it gathered up through quizzes and later sold as reports to clients. But three weeks ago, Cubeyou's relationship with Facebook soured. The mighty social network, which was dealing with a backlash over how it had not done enough to protect user privacy, cut off Cubeyou after a CNBC report said that the small data analytics company had misled people into believing its quizzes would be used for nonprofit academic research. Instead, the report said, the data was sold to marketers. Federico Treu, Cubeyou's chief executive, told The New York Times that his company had done nothing wrong, and that it had followed Facebook's rules in disclosing that it was using profile data for both academic and business purposes. He said Cubeyou was just collateral damage as Facebook has overzealously scrambled to show that it cares about data privacy. ""Facebook threw us under the bus,"" said Mr. Treu, who added that he intended to boycott a Facebook event for developers this week. ""Facebook became what it was because of us developers. Now they want to blame us for everything that has happened to them.""  Facebook's relationship with its vast community of developers has reached a tense moment once more. Since news broke in late March that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of millions of Facebook users, the social network has made a series of changes to limit how much of its users' information can be obtained by third parties. Those shifts have had an unintended domino effect on many of the companies and programmers that relied on Facebook's spigot of data for their businesses. Some, like Cubeyou, said they have been unfairly blocked from accessing Facebook users. Tinder, the dating app, discovered that its users were no longer able to log into the app using their Facebook accounts. Pod, a calendar syncing app, found that its users could no longer see Facebook events within their calendars. And Job Fusion, a jobs app that allowed users to see where their Facebook friends worked, announced that it was not longer able to offer its services within Facebook. The fallout has cast a shadow over Facebook's annual meeting with developers, which was scheduled to start on Tuesday in San Jose, Calif. The event, which includes a speech from Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, is typically a major attraction for developers. But this year, half a dozen developers who had previously attended the conference told The Times that they did not plan to go because they objected to Facebook's policy changes. Others who planned to be there said they intended to challenge Facebook's leaders over the changes. Facebook said it expected roughly 5,000 people -- a record high -- to be at the developer conference, which is known as F8. But the company also said it has tweaked the event with an eye toward data privacy. For example, the social network canceled the announcement of a Facebook smart home speaker to challenge Amazon's Echo and Google's Home amid worries that the device would raise more questions about the amount of data the company collects. (At the event, Mr. Zuckerberg may also have to address the departure of Jan Koum, a founder of the messaging service WhatsApp and a member of the Facebook board, who said on Monday that he was leaving the company.) Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice president of product partnerships, said developers are ""incredible partners"" for the company, but also added that it must ""strike the right balance between creating compelling social experiences, protecting people's data, and supporting an innovative developer ecosystem."" Bhaskar Chakravorti, senior associate dean at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said Facebook had to walk a fine line. ""They have taken a blunt instrument approach, which is the right thing to do from a public relations standpoint,"" he said. ""But now they need to reach out to developers and smooth things over."" For much of its history, Facebook has had a rocky relationship with developers. It has sometimes adopted policies to attract developers, including by opening access to its vast troves of user data. Developers, in turn, created apps that became emblematic of the Facebook experience -- apps such as Farmville, a farming simulation game played with friends on the social network, which was made by the gaming company Zynga. But developers are often at the mercy of any changes that Facebook decides to make. When Facebook clamped down on viral apps several years ago, it became harder for companies like Zynga to spread their games across the social media site. Zynga has since turned toward making mobile games and its fortunes have plummeted. Facebook announced a series of privacy changes in early April. Under the new measures, developers can only see a Facebook user's name, profile photo and email address; previously, the could see more information, like users' Facebook posts. Facebook is also cutting off developers' access to user accounts if someone has not used their apps for three months or longer. That policy is intended to prevent developers from collecting information in the background for months or years after people stop using their apps. [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] Facebook also announced that it was investigating apps that had gained access to large amounts of its data in the past, and said it was conducting an audit of any company that it believed has shown suspicious activity. Cubeyou got caught up in the dragnet in early April. At the time, CNBC reported that the company, which is based in Redwood City, Calif., had collected users' Facebook information for academic purposes and then sold the data to commercial firms without informing users. Facebook said it was conducting an audit of Cubeyou to determine if there was any wrongdoing. Mr. Treu said Cubeyou fully complies with Facebook's requirements of disclosing the data it collects and what that data is used for. He added that Cubeyou strips out any personally identifiable information that it gets from Facebook. Cubeyou is simply being singled out as part of ""a witch hunt"" by Facebook, he said.

"What the G.D.P.R., Europe's Tough New Data Law, Means for You, and for the Internet","LONDON -- In a couple of weeks, Europe will introduce some of the toughest online privacy rules in the world. The changes are aimed at giving internet users more control over what's collected and shared about them, and they punish companies that don't comply. Here's what it means for you. What Are the New Rules? On May 25, a new law called the General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect across the European Union.  The law strengthens individual privacy rights and, more important, it has teeth. Companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue -- equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook. The internet's grand bargain has long been trading privacy for convenience. Businesses offer free services like email, entertainment and search, and in return they collect data and sell advertising. But recent privacy scandals involving Facebook and the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica highlight the downsides of that trade-off. The system is opaque and ripe for abuse. Europe is attempting to push back. It's too early to know how effective the law will be, but it is being closely watched by governments globally. Will the Internet Look Different? Not really. Supporters of the law say it will bring sweeping changes to how companies operate online, but in reality, the effect on your internet experience will be minimal. An American visiting Europe, for example, isn't likely to see a difference. If you live in one of the European Union's 28 member states, there is one change you may welcome -- you are likely to see fewer of those shoe or appliance ads that follow you around the internet after you do some online shopping. As e-commerce became commonplace, a cottage industry sprang up to track people around the web and nudge them back to online stores to complete a purchase. Advertisers call these ads ""fine tuned,"" but most people consider them creepy, said Johnny Ryan, a researcher at PageFair, which makes tools to help companies work around ad-blocking software. Mr. Ryan said the new rules would make it harder for ad-targeting companies to collect and sell information. The new law requires companies to be transparent about how your data is handled, and to get your permission before starting to use it. It raises the legal bar that businesses must clear to target ads based on personal information like your relationship status, job or education, or your use of websites and apps. That means online advertising in Europe could become broader, returning to styles more akin to magazines and television, where marketers have a less detailed sense of the audience. What Are Your Rights? Even if you don't notice big changes, the new law provides important privacy rights worth knowing about. For instance, you can ask companies what information they hold about you, and then request that it be deleted. This applies not just to tech companies, but also to banks, retailers, grocery stores or any other organization storing your information. You can even ask your employer. And if you suspect your information is being misused or collected unnecessarily, you can complain to your national data protection regulator, which must investigate. Of course, an individual going up against a giant corporation like Google or Facebook isn't in a fair fight. The law has 11 chapters and 99 sub-articles, and just initiating a case can take as many as 20 steps, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry trade group. But the new rules allow people to band together and file class-action style complaints, a legal approach that hasn't been as common in Europe as in the United States. Eager to exploit the new law, privacy groups are planning to file cases on behalf of groups of individuals. The hope is that a few successful lawsuits will have a ripple effect and lead companies to tighten up how they handle personal data. The new law also ensures that you cannot be locked in to any service. Companies must make it possible for you to download your data and move it to a competitor. That could mean moving financial information from one bank to another, or transferring Spotify playlists to a rival streaming service. What's With All These Privacy Notices? In the weeks before the law goes into force, internet users have been receiving a stream of privacy policy updates in their inboxes -- grocery store loyalty programs, train services, even apps that parents use for youth soccer all have to set out what data they gather from you, and how they handle it. The law requires that the terms and conditions be written in plain, understandable language, not legalese. Companies must also give you options to block information from being gathered. But the deluge of emails is leading to concerns that users are agreeing without taking a closer look. [Read more about how to parse the flood of G.D.P.R.-related privacy notices in your inbox.] A similar reaction came after the European Union required companies, starting in 2011, to put warnings on websites alerting users that they were being tracked. The rules have led to so many pop-up disclosure boxes that people often consent just to make the warnings disappear. Companies argue that they are being careful to comply with General Data Protection Regulation, but Giovanni Buttarelli, who oversees an independent European Union agency that advises on privacy-related policies, has been unimpressed. He has criticized the wave of privacy policy emails as being posed in a ""take it or leave it"" manner that leaves users thinking they have to accept the terms in order to keep using a service, rather than letting people choose what information to share. Mr. Buttarelli said the messages may violate the ""spirit"" of the law. Will It Make a Difference? It's too soon to tell. That may be an unsatisfactory answer, but the long-term effects of the new law won't be known for years. Much will depend on how strictly national regulators enforce the rules, and how they use their tight budgets. Data-protection agencies in each European Union country will be in charge of policing the companies that have European headquarters within its borders. That oversight structure is leading to concerns that officials in countries such as Ireland, where Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and many other data-heavy companies are based, will be overmatched. [Read about the Irish data protection commissioner, who is eager to test her newfound power.] A lot of responsibility also falls on you to keep tabs on how companies use your data. The General Data Protection Regulation provides ways to take action if your information is being misused. But the question is whether people care enough, or if trading privacy for convenience remains a worthwhile deal. Follow Adam Satariano on Twitter: @satariano.

Silicon Valley Faces Regulatory Fight on Its Home Turf,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- The staging ground for one of the biggest regulatory fights facing the technology industry is far removed from Washington or Brussels, tucked into an alley next to a wine and cheese shop about 30 miles from Silicon Valley. A barely furnished real estate office in an upscale Oakland neighborhood is the headquarters for backers of a proposed California ballot measure that would provide consumers with increased privacy rights, including the ability to demand that companies do not sell their personal data. If the initiative, called The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, passes, privacy advocates say it will be one of the most meaningful checks in the United States on the growing power of internet behemoths. The proposed ballot measure is the passion project of an unlikely trio: a real estate developer, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst and a financial industry executive. They say they have no political aspirations. They're not techies and they aren't your run-of-the-mill privacy zealots. Instead, they say they are like many internet consumers -- a little freaked out about tech firms gobbling up people's personal data.  ""People want some basic rights,"" said Alastair Mactaggart, the 51-year-old real estate developer who has put more than $2 million of his own money to get the measure off the ground. ""People are resentful but accepting because there isn't any sense of control about their data."" The California measure has three major components: It gives consumers the right to ask companies to disclose what data they have collected on them; the right to demand that they not sell the data or share with third parties for business purposes; and the right to sue or fine companies that violate the law. Google, Facebook, major telecommunications companies and California's Chamber of Commerce have already come out against the initiative, saying it is flawed and a threat to the economic model supporting the internet. They've created an organization to fight the measure with a decidedly populist name, ""The Committee to Protect California Jobs."" Political consultants have told the initiative's backers that they should prepare for the opposition campaign to spend $100 million. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the opposition, declined to put a number on the campaign spending, but acknowledged that there is a lot at stake. ""It's California,"" he said. ""It's expensive."" California's privacy initiative hasn't been certified yet by state officials for the November election, but it is expected to appear on the ballot. The measure's backers said they have submitted over 600,000 signatures, far eclipsing the 366,000 minimum requirement. Mr. Mactaggart said he first became concerned about data privacy when he asked a Google engineer at a cocktail party if he should be worried about all the information companies were collecting about users. The engineer's response surprised him: Mr. Mactaggart was right to be worried. Mr. Mactaggart said he then reached out to Rick Arney, a finance industry executive who had worked in the California State Senate as a legislative analyst 20 years ago. Their children go to the same school, and Mr. Mactaggart knew that Mr. Arney was a supporter of ballot measures as a way for ordinary citizens to get something done outside of the political system. ""One of the reasons why it's brought as a ballot initiative is that there is consensus that Silicon Valley owns Sacramento,"" said Chris Hoofnagle, an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and an adviser for the initiative. ""There's no prospect of any consequential consumer privacy legislation."" But there was a small problem: neither Mr. Mactaggart nor Mr. Arney was a privacy expert or policy wonk. So they hired Mary Stone Ross, another neighborhood friend, who worked at the Central Intelligence Agency and had been legal counsel for the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, to oversee the effort. They spent months talking to technologists, academics and lawyers. They conducted polls and focus groups to understand what people wanted. After considering various options, they decided against taking a hard-line approach. Companies can still use personal data for their own purposes to sell advertising or improve products. They would be restricted, however, from selling or disclosing that data to someone else for ""business purposes"" upon a consumer's request. The proposed ballot measure is the latest challenge facing Silicon Valley's web giants. There is a backlash to the data collection practices that underpin how they make money. In the rest of the world, the clamor for regulation is building. The most notable effort is coming from Europe, which is preparing to enact later this month a stringent set of laws that will restrict how tech companies collect, store and use personal data from people across the region. In the United States, the California ballot initiative is part of a wave of activity aimed at reining in the sprawl of personal data across the internet in the wake of revelations that the voter profiling firm Cambridge Analytica gained access to the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users. Last month, Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced a bill that sought to establish online protections for consumers by forcing companies to get consent to share or sell personal data. Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, also introduced a privacy bill in April. Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo, a privacy-minded search engine, and a supporter of the California initiative, said he wished the measure had gone further -- but any progress is good. ""You have to start somewhere,"" he said. Mr. Hoofnagle said, however, that the measure's financial punishments for violators give the law teeth that previous attempts at privacy regulation lacked. It also takes a broader view of what constitutes personal information beyond real names and Social Security numbers -- including biometric data and numbers that identify the devices people use. Opponents of the measure say that those broad definitions of personal data are excessive and that companies can adopt their own privacy rules faster and more effectively. ""Something that takes such a sledgehammer approach to regulating data is extraordinarily concerning,"" said Robert Callahan, a vice president of state government affairs at the Internet Association, an industry trade group. ""We think the initiative is filled with flaws and it will have really dangerous consequences for the California economy."" Google, Facebook, Verizon, Comcast and AT&T each made $200,000 contributions to the committee opposing the proposed ballot measure. After Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, testified on Capitol Hill about data privacy last month, the company said it was leaving the group even though it still had concerns about the measure and didn't take back its initial contribution. Verizon also pulled out of the coalition earlier this month, saying it wanted to deal with privacy on a national level rather than a state-by-state approach. The initiative's backers said they were raising money for their campaign using a crowdfunding approach. But to get their message out and raise awareness of the measure, they are advertising on -- where else? -- Facebook. Reflecting on his transformation from wealthy real estate developer to privacy activist, Mr. Mactaggart said that after devoting two years and millions of dollars, he's more certain than ever that this initiative is important and necessary -- a point brought home during a focus group session that took place in Sunnyvale, a city in the heart of Silicon Valley, with a room full of engineers. ""Of all the focus groups we did around the state, that was the one most vehement about the need for this,"" Mr. Mactaggart said. ""That was really one of the catalyzing moments for me when I was like, 'Oh, we're onto something here.'""

Getting a Flood of G.D.P.R.-Related Privacy Policy Updates? Read Them; Tech Fix,"You have probably noticed a flood of emails and alerts from companies in the last few weeks informing you about changes to their privacy policies. Don't ignore them. Yes, there is a lot of legalese to wade through. But resist the temptation to immediately delete those emails or close the alerts right away. They may contain important information about managing your digital privacy at a time when it's become clear that our online data is far from safe. All those privacy messages are appearing now because a law called the General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect across the European Union on Friday. The law has been heralded as the world's strongest protector of digital privacy rights. And while it was designed for Europeans, the borderless nature of the online world has virtually every commercial entity that touches the web making changes to its sites and apps to comply. The data regulation law centers on two main principles. The first is that companies need your consent to collect your data. The second is that you should be required to share only data that is necessary to make their services work.  [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] Danny O'Brien, a director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, offered this analogy: ""A birthday cake company needs your name to put on the birthday cake. If it isn't essential information, you can deny them consent to use that data and you still have to get the service."" If companies don't comply with the new rules, they can be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue. But you should expect businesses that rely on advertising revenue to work hard to persuade as many of us as possible to give our consent for them to collect as much data as possible. Companies can do that by making it easy for people to give permission, and immensely complicated to opt out. So to ensure you benefit from the new law, it helps to examine the revamped privacy policies we are all getting. Here is what to look for. Companies Want 'Consent' Let's start with those pesky emails and notifications. Don't gloss over them -- some sites are using the emails not only to inform you of their updated privacy policies, but also to ""ask"" for your consent. For example, Quora, the questions-and-answers site, sent an email this week saying that its privacy policy had been updated. Toward the end of the note, it tucked in a message that ""your continued use of the service will be considered acceptance of our updated terms."" A Quora spokeswoman said the company complied with the new data law by seeking affirmative consent from users as required. The company said the email explaining the particular changes in its privacy policy did not require consent, but that it would update the language in its email to be less ambiguous. The language has since been updated. Other sites are using pop-up notifications to seek consent. The clothing retailer Taylor Stitch, for example, recently started showing a banner ad that explains how cookies are used for web tracking. The note added that by closing the banner ad or interacting with its website, you were agreeing with the site's data collection terms. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Here's the problem: Companies clearly know that we rarely (if ever) read privacy policies. They also know that we find notifications to be annoying, because they pop up just as we are in the middle of another task. But if we ignore them, we may be unintentionally giving consent to more of our data being shared than we actually want to give out. ""That pop-up fatigue is definitely something I'm worried about, now that these pop-ups are really more important than ever,"" said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher who follows privacy issues for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Find the New Privacy Controls If you skipped reading the emails and notifications, you may have missed out on the new privacy controls that internet companies recently introduced. These typically are not very easy to find, but they are worth exploring because there may be new methods to minimize the amount of data you share. Consider Twitter. The social media company's recent privacy-related email mentioned that people can now more clearly see and control how their data is shared with its business partners. Here's how: Near the very bottom of Twitter's settings menu, there is now a button called Your Twitter data. Here, you can see the number of advertisers that are trying to target you based on your interests. You can also opt out of this so-called interest-based advertising. When I used the tool, I found out that more than 600 advertisers had my contact information, and I chose to no longer share data with the ads program. Facebook, which has been under scrutiny for the improper harvesting of user data by the political profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, has also updated its privacy controls. One of Facebook's newer tools is called Privacy Checkup, which can be found in a menu called Privacy Shortcuts. When you run the checkup with the Facebook app, it quickly walks you through the people you share your posts with by default, the information you show on your profile and the apps that you share your data with. Also inside the Facebook app's settings menu is a button labeled Ads. This brings you to your ad preferences, where you can see which advertisers have your contact information and you can control the types of ads that can be shown to you. For example, you can opt out of being shown ads based on information like your relationship status, employer, job title and education history. You can also opt out of being shown ads based on your activity on other Facebook-owned products like the messaging app WhatsApp or the virtual reality system Oculus. Those are just two examples of big social networking sites. What tech products do you use the most? Take a moment to poke around in your privacy settings to see if there are any new restrictions you can put on your data. You Can Always Leave A big part of the new data law is that it requires companies to offer ways for you to pull your data out and take it to a new service. Google, Facebook and Twitter each offer the ability to download your own data, and some of those capabilities have been expanded ahead of the new data law's going into effect. Be aware that other internet products you use should soon be offering similar tools to pull out your data. If you disagree with a company's new data collection policy, try downloading your information to see if you can exercise your right of taking your data to a better product. But beware: Not all data-portability tools are created equal. I documented my experience downloading my data from Google and Facebook and found that Google's data porting tool, called Takeout, was superior to Facebook's. Google gave greater transparency into the information that was gathered, and it gave more options for the data I could move to competing products. And if porting your data doesn't work out, keep in mind that you can delete your account. The new data law requires companies to offer ways for European users to permanently delete their accounts and all their data along with it. Companies may choose not to offer the same option for people outside Europe, but it won't hurt to try. PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Minh Uong/The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Related Articles  "
"G.D.P.R., a New Privacy Law, Makes Europe World's Leading Tech Watchdog","LONDON -- The notices are flooding people's inboxes en masse, from large technology companies, including Facebook and Uber, and even from parent teacher associations, children's soccer clubs and yoga instructors. ""Here is an update to our privacy policy,"" they say. All are acting because the European Union on Friday enacts the world's toughest rules to protect people's online data. And with the internet's borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe. In Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook and other tech companies have been working for months to comply with the new rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. The law, which lets people request their online data and restricts how businesses obtain and handle the information, has set off a panic among small businesses and local organizations that have an internet presence. Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe's lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley's power.  ""We want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,"" said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in São Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was ""pushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward."" Europe is determined to cement its role as the world's foremost tech watchdog -- and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union's 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies. The region's proactive stance is a sharp divergence from the United States, which has taken little action over the years in regulating the tech industry. Most recently, the Trump administration has sought to cut taxes and roll back regulation, while pursuing an increasingly protectionist tack to shield tech companies from competition from China. ""The E.U. is more advanced than the U.S. in protecting consumer privacy, and what happens there could be a harbinger of the future,"" said Michael Kearns, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the data collection techniques of companies including Facebook and Google. Europe's new privacy measures, called G.D.P.R. for short, let people reduce the trail of information left when browsing social media, reading the news or shopping online. Individuals will be able to request the data that companies hold on them, and demand it be deleted. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] Businesses must also more clearly detail how someone's data is being handled, while clearing a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. Companies face fines if they do not comply, with tech giants risking penalties greater than $1 billion. Privacy groups preparing class action-style complaints under the new law may put even more legal pressure on companies. European authorities have actively encouraged other countries to adopt similar laws to G.D.P.R. Officials have been dispatched around the world to preach the tougher rules. Data protections are becoming part of trade deals, with the region ready to limit access to its market of 500 million consumers if countries do not rise to meet Europe's standards. ""If we can export this to the world, I will be happy,"" said Vera Jourova, the European commissioner in charge of consumer protection and privacy who helped draft G.D.P.R. She said she planned to travel to Japan and South Korea in the next few weeks for talks about data protection. Regulating technology, she added, is a ""global challenge."" [Read more about how to parse the flood of G.D.P.R.-related privacy notices in your inbox.] Europe's influence can be seen in Brazil, which has sought advice from Brussels on its own privacy legislation. The bill closely mirrors Europe's new regulations, including a requirement to get people's consent before collecting personal data and special protections for information on political affiliation, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or health. Brazil has an incentive to draft tougher privacy laws: One provision of G.D.P.R. limits the data that companies can transfer outside the European Union unless that data goes to a country that meets Europe's standards. ""There is almost a reproduction of the European market in our bill,"" said Mr. Castro, a member of Brazil's internet steering committee. European officials have also been advising Brazilian authorities. Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor, is set to deliver a recorded video message at a policy event in Brazil next week. And last month, a senior data protection official in the European Commission testified before the Brazilian Senate committee drafting the country's legislation. ""Many countries are interested in signing a trade agreement with the European Union, and then privacy becomes an important precondition,"" said Mr. Buttarelli. Europe's fingerprints can be seen elsewhere in the world, too. Japan last year passed a data protection law creating a new independent online privacy board, and Tokyo and Brussels are finalizing the details of a data transfer deal. South Korea is considering new privacy rules, while Israel has adopted updated requirements for disclosures of data breaches -- both share elements with the European rules. Europe's influence is not going unnoticed by America's tech giants, which have long complained that Brussels unfairly focuses on them. The new privacy rules are part of a ""strong European tradition"" of policing industries to protect the environment or public health, even if it does ""constrain business,"" said Margrethe Vestager, Europe's top antitrust official. To meet G.D.P.R.'s requirements, Facebook and Google have deployed large teams to overhaul how they give users access to their own privacy settings and to redesign certain products that may have sucked up too much user data. Facebook said it had roughly 1,000 people working on the initiative globally, including engineers, product managers and lawyers. In Brussels, the Silicon Valley companies are fast adding lobbyists to influence other European regulations before they spread. Google and Microsoft are already among the five biggest spenders on lobbying in the European Union, with budgets of about 4.5 million euros, or $5.3 million, each, according to LobbyFacts.eu, which tracks such spending. Facebook, whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was in Brussels this week, doubled its lobbying budget last year to roughly [#x20ac]2.5 million, the watchdog site said. Dean C. Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group representing Apple, Facebook, Google and other companies, said his group was adding staff in Brussels because Europe was ""driving and directing policy."" ""In the absence of another approach, it's easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done,"" said Mr. Garfield. On Thursday, a group of Democratic senators announced a resolution to match G.D.P.R., a sign of how United States policy may change if control of Congress shifts in November. Whether Europe's tough approach is actually crimping the global tech giants is unclear. The region's regulators have hit American companies with hefty fines over antitrust violations, the mishandling of user data and the payment of taxes, but Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have continued to grow and add customers. Challenges remain over how G.D.P.R. will be enforced. National regulators across Europe will be charged with policing the regulations, but many have woefully fewer resources than the companies they will be overseeing. The data protection office in Ireland, for instance, where many tech giants have their regional headquarters, has a budget of just [#x20ac]7.5 million, or $8.8 million, but will be responsible for regulating some of the world's biggest tech firms. That raises concerns that the companies will be able to avoid tough penalties. Even if Europe persuades other countries to adopt its policies, it will be hard to ensure the laws work, said Omer Tene, a vice president at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group that tracks global privacy regulation. ""It's one thing to have rules on the books,"" said Mr. Tene. ""It's quite another thing to implement these rules on the ground."" Follow Adam Satariano on Twitter: @satariano.

U.S. News Outlets Block European Readers Over New Privacy Rules,"LONDON -- American news outlets including The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and The Arizona Daily Star abruptly blocked access to their websites from Europe on Friday, choosing to black out readers rather than comply with a strict new data privacy law in the European Union that limits what information can be collected about people online. The new rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, strike at a core element of businesses that offer free content online but that make money by collecting and sharing user data to sell targeted advertising. The shutdowns came as a surprise to readers of the publications, because companies had two years to prepare for the new regulations.  The most notable blackouts were by news organizations tied to the American media company Tronc. In addition to The Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, newspapers including The New York Daily News, The Orlando Sentinel and The Baltimore Sun were also unavailable to readers in Europe. (Tronc announced in February that it was selling The Los Angeles Times.) ""We are engaged on the issue and committed to looking at options that support our full range of digital offerings to the E.U. market,"" the Tronc-owned newspapers said on their websites. ""We continue to identify technical compliance solutions that will provide all readers with our award-winning journalism."" The decision illustrated that some companies would prefer to lose European customers than risk being hit with the stiff penalties allowed under the new law: fines can reach 4 percent of global revenue. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] A Tronc spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment Friday morning. Several other outlets chose to restrict access for readers in Europe, including newspapers belonging to Lee Enterprises, like The Arizona Daily Star and St. Louis Post Dispatch. The websites of many other American news organizations, including The New York Times, USA Today and The Washington Post, were accessible from Europe. Some acknowledged the new privacy rules with large disclaimers and other information to explain what information was being gathered when a reader visits the site. ""Welcome to USA Today Network's European Union Experience,"" the news organization posted at the top of its website, explaining that the company would not collect personally identifiable information or other data commonly used to sell online advertising. Andrea Jelinek, chairwoman of the new European Data Protection Board, which will coordinate enforcement of the new law, criticized the blackout and said that companies had been given a long time to prepare. For weeks, businesses as varied as Uber, bike shops and restaurants have been sending notes to alert people to updated privacy policies as a result of the law, known as G.D.P.R. ""It didn't just fall from heaven,"" Ms. Jelinek said in a statement. ""Everyone has had plenty of time to prepare."" News organizations were not alone in erecting barriers for European users. The American television broadcaster A&E Networks cut off the websites of its A&E, History and Lifetime channels. The digital advertising company Drawbridge, the social media tracker Klout and the save-it-for-later reading app Instapaper also stepped back. Europe's new privacy measures allow people to limit the information they leave behind when browsing social media, reading the news or shopping online. Businesses must detail how someone's data is being handled, and clear a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. [Here's  how to parse the flood of G.D.P.R.-related privacy notices in your inbox.] The law had been seen as focusing on Silicon Valley tech giants like Facebook and Google, but publishers and advertising companies have warned that it will harm their businesses in particular because it restricts how information is packaged and shared to sell advertising. It is common for websites to use tracking software to gather information about visitors in order to better target ads. Digital advertising is an important source of income for many news organizations, particularly as print readership and advertising fall, but policymakers in Europe argue the practices have become intrusive and ripe for abuse, with personal information shared far beyond what most people realize. Julia Shullman, the chief privacy counsel for the digital advertising firm AppNexus, said an ""unintended consequence"" of G.D.P.R. was thatGoogle would become more powerful. To compete with the online search giant, publishers and advertisers have bought, sold and traded data with different sources, a bespoke approach that is now severely restricted under the European Union's new rules. Many companies will now partner with the bigger company, Ms. Shullman said. ""At least in the short term, it pushes publishers to these large platforms that dominate the market already,"" Ms. Shullman said in an interview. Many groups in Europe, however, are not ready to cede power to behemoths like Google and Facebook. On Friday, the privacy lawyer Max Schrems filed some of the first legal complaints using G.D.P.R., alleging the two companiesare violating the law with their terms of service. The law requires ""informed"" consent from users, but Mr. Schrems, who has successfully sued Facebook in the past and leads the nonprofit group None Of Your Business, said the companies were using ""forced"" consent because users must accept a blanket privacy policy in order to continue using the service. The complaints were filed in Austria, Belgium, France and Germany, and will now be reviewed by the European data protection authorities. Follow Adam Satariano on Twitter: @satariano.

The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law,"The new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn. The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union called the legislation ""overly strict."" The Developers Alliance, a trade group representing Facebook, Google, Intel and dozens of app makers, said it could cost businesses in Europe more than 550 billion euros, or about $640 billion, in annual lost revenue. And DigitalEurope, another tech trade group, said the legislation's prohibitive approach ""seriously undermines the development of Europe's digital economy."" These industry alarms are not over the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., a tough privacy law that went into effect in the European Union on Friday. Instead, the cause is an even stricter privacy law that's pending -- the tech industry's next regulatory battleground in Europe. It is called the ePrivacy Regulation, and it specifically protects the confidentiality of electronic communications. The law was approved by the European Parliament last fall and is under review by the Council of the European Union, a group of government officials representing the 28 member countries. Bloc officials had originally intended for the law to go into effect this month, but Council negotiations have been slowed by internal disagreements.  If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people's explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications. Now, some of the same companies and trade associations that a few years ago tried to defang G.D.P.R. have set their sights on derailing the ePrivacy legislation. Apart from heavily lobbying government officials in Europe, trade groups are funding doomsday financial forecasts and creating worst-case scenario video campaigns warning people of the rule's potential drawbacks. ""Most of the lobbying is unreasonable and very low regarding facts,"" said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a member of the European Parliament from Germany who steered the G.D.P.R. legislation through Parliament. He pointed to industry ""campaigns saying, 'With ePrivacy, the internet is going dark, and independent media, as well as digital growth, will be lost.'"" Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy. ""With one click you can manipulate hundreds of thousands or millions of people, whether you know their names or not,"" said Birgit Sippel, a European Parliament member from Germany who drafted the ePrivacy legislation. ""That is why protecting privacy is becoming more important, especially in the digital environment."" [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive -- which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls -- by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps. The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users' electronic communications: obtaining consumers' explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected. ""Do you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?"" Ms. Sippel asked. ""Consumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data."" But tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy's consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down. ""Europe will become a digital backwater,"" said Daniel Dalton, a member of the European Parliament from Britain. Mr. Dalton, who pushed for amendments on the ePrivacy bill, said he had met with Google, Microsoft, video game companies and trade groups to discuss their objections to the legislation. ""Every stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,"" he said. Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation. Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels. How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue. Trade groups have also created doomsday videos on ePrivacy. In one, an ominous voice warns that free online services won't be able to survive financially if they can't use people's personal data to target them with ads. The inevitable result, the narrator says, is ""an app-less future consumers never saw coming."" [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law's final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm. The Council's decisions are so critical for ePrivacy that the Computer and Communications Industry Association -- which represents Amazon, Google, Netflix and others -- traveled to Bulgaria in October to meet government ministers there as that country was preparing to take over the Council presidency. The bill's supporters said the Council had not made much headway on ePrivacy since then. Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country's officials were committed to the bill's progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country's representatives had met with on ePrivacy. The ""Bulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,"" she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business. With support from Google, the computer industry group also financed a research study last year saying that ePrivacy's data restrictions could cut revenue for the online news and online advertising industries, diminishing venture capital funding for cloud computing. Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would ""add meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation."" And this month, the Developers Alliance published its own sponsored economic research that forecast the ePrivacy Regulation would slash profits dependent on electronic communication by 30 percent across all sectors in the European Union. The group called on government officials to ""take these findings into account when discussing this critical file."" Michela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill's restrictions on handling user content and metadata: ""That is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities"" for many industries that rely on data. Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort. ""In my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,"" she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. ""So, for the time being, they haven't found a common position."" Follow Natasha Singer on Twitter: @natashanyt.

The Privacy Lawyer Giving Big Tech an $8.8 Billion Headache; The Shift,"At midnight last Friday, the European Union's long-awaited new data-protection rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, officially kicked in. Forty-eight minutes later, Facebook and Google got their first taste of how troublesome the new European privacy regime could be. At 12:48 a.m. Brussels time, an Austrian privacy advocacy group filed the first of its four complaints against the Silicon Valley tech giants. The nonprofit organization NOYB -- short for ""none of your business"" -- claimed that Google and Facebook, along with two of Facebook's subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, failed to give European users specific control over the use of their data, in violation of the new rules. The complaints, which were filed in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria, ask regulators to impose fines of as much as $4.3 billion on Google's parent company, Alphabet, and $1.5 billion each on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp -- roughly 4 percent of each company's 2017 revenue, the maximum penalty allowed under the G.D.P.R. Even for cash-flush tech giants, those would be painful checks to write.  The architect of NOYB's campaign is Max Schrems, 30, an Austrian lawyer who has made a career of hounding American tech giants over their data-collection practices. Several years ago, when he was still in law school, Mr. Schrems took on Facebook with a series of legal complaints, claiming the social network was violating European data protection laws. Later, Mr. Schrems successfully challenged the ""Safe Harbor"" policies that let tech companies store data about Europeans in the United States. That case sent shock waves through the tech industry, and made him a hero among digital privacy hawks. Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower and activist, declared that Mr. Schrems had ""changed the world for the better."" I spoke with Mr. Schrems on Monday, several days after the start of his new privacy crusade. He said that while the timing of his latest volley was mainly symbolic -- the organization had been preparing complaints against Facebook and Google for months -- its substance was very real. ""It was important to point that out the first day, that this is not compliant,"" Mr. Schrems told me. Facebook and Google, he said, have ""fundamentally tried to ignore or redefine"" the new European laws by forcing users to consent to wide-ranging data collection, without telling them exactly how their data would be used. ""All of these cases should be absolutely won,"" he added. Tech companies never thought that Europe's data collection rules would be painless. But they may not have anticipated the chaos that unfurled last week, as lawyers rushed to tease apart the law's complications and companies barraged people with messages about their new, G.D.P.R.-compliant privacy policies. As other countries also look to establish their own European-style privacy regulations, the potential impact of the G.D.P.R. across the globe has turned a feeding frenzy of ambitious lawyers, lobbyists and activists into a kind of crowdsourced rule-making process that will ultimately determine how the new rules are enforced. There has already been fallout from the G.D.P.R. in the digital media and advertising industries, where the new rules caused several American publications to shut themselves off to European users and the market for certain invasive types of digital advertising dried up. Faced with the prospect of stiff penalties, a few smaller American tech companies threw up their hands and stopped serving Europe altogether. As global companies, Facebook and Google don't have the option of cutting off the Continent. In statements, both companies defended their data collection practices, saying they fully complied with the new European regulations. ""We have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the G.D.P.R.,"" Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said in a statement. ""We have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information."" A Google spokesman, Al Verney, said, ""We build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation."" At the core of Mr. Schrems's complaints is the question of whether tech companies are giving people realistic choices about how their data is collected and used. Like many companies, Facebook and Google, which developed the Android mobile operating system, prompted users last week to accept new terms of service that explained their data collection particulars. Facebook members who declined to accept the new terms were unable to log into their accounts. Android users who didn't agree to the new terms were, in effect, locked out of their phones. Mr. Schrems said these all-or-nothing privacy policies violated the G.D.P.R.'s requirement that consent be particularized and ""freely given."" To comply with the law, he said, large tech platforms need to give privacy-conscious users the option of sharing certain types of data but not others. Realistically, Mr. Schrems said, ""you're not going to walk away from all your friends on Facebook."" Opponents of the G.D.P.R. have said the law could end up backfiring by making it harder for smaller companies, which don't tend to have huge teams of European legal experts at their disposal, to compete with the American tech giants. It could mean that European users are required to pay more for certain internet services, to offset reduced advertising revenue. (The Washington Post is already offering an ad- and tracking-free ""premium E.U. subscription"" that costs 50 percent more than a regular subscription.) In a worst-case scenario, it could turn Europe into a kind of technological dead zone, a place where influential American tech companies simply refuse to tread. Mr. Schrems shrugged off these concerns. The European market is too lucrative for companies like Google and Facebook to abandon, he said. And he doesn't believe that social networks and search engines would suffer unduly if they were forced to be more judicious about how they collected fine-grain data about people for the purposes of selling more ads. ""You can still make a lot of money without microtargeting,"" he said. Mr. Schrems's quest is far from finished. Regulators could decide not to pursue investigations, expensive litigation could drag on for years, and Silicon Valley companies are furiously adding lobbyists to try to influence the nascent rule-making process. But if these types of complaints succeed -- and it's not entirely crazy to think that they could, given the current antipathy toward American tech giants and the satisfaction that European officials might take in kneecapping a few of them -- it could be a watershed moment for large tech companies. ""Massive fines in this case would have pretty significant repercussions,"" said Courtney M. Bowman, a lawyer at the firm Proskauer Rose who specializes in international privacy law. ""It would be a strong signal from the E.U. authorities that this isn't just a law that's on the books that isn't going to be enforced,"" she said. Whether or not Facebook and Google end up paying billion-dollar fines, it's clear that the G.D.P.R. has already introduced a new, scary variable into Silicon Valley's privacy calculations. If tech giants know that privacy wonks like Mr. Schrems are watching their moves carefully, probing for openings to file complaints against them -- and now, they undoubtedly do -- they will need to think twice before adding new, privacy-invading features. ""It's about who has control over information in an information age,"" Mr. Schrems said. ""Who has power over all this stuff?""

New Pressure on Google and YouTube Over Children's Data,"In the context of a growing national debate on tech and privacy, Google has come under increased scrutiny for how it may be tracking and targeting children for advertising. Two House members sent a letter this week to the company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, expressing concern that the collection practices of YouTube, a Google subsidiary, may not comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as Coppa. The letter on Monday -- from David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Jeff Fortenberry, Republican of Nebraska -- followed up on a complaint filed in April by more than 20 advocacy groups. The groups sought an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces Coppa.  In addition to the complaint and the lawmakers' letter, Google is facing pressure from the New Mexico attorney general on how it may collect children's location data. The state official named the tech giant as a defendant in a lawsuit filed last week against the developer of Fun Kid Racing and other gaming apps, along with advertisers involved with them, claiming that they were sharing children's data without their parents' permission. YouTube has said its practices are in line with Coppa, which requires companies to obtain explicit, verifiable permission from parents before collecting personal information from children under 13 or targeting them with ads tied to their online behavior. ""There's more interest in children's privacy than there has been in a long time, and that's related to the broader privacy conversations that we're having,"" said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, who was involved with the April complaint and the new push by lawmakers. ""Whether that leads to Google being held to account is yet to be seen."" YouTube's terms of service state that its main app and website are meant only for viewers 13 and older, which means that the site does not have to comply with Coppa. The company directs those under 13 to the YouTube Kids app, which pulls its videos from the main site. Google's website says YouTube Kids prohibits ""interest-based advertising"" and ads with ""tracking pixels."" But advocates have contended that YouTube is aware that plenty of children watch videos on the main site, and Representatives Cicilline and Fortenberry are pressing Google to provide details of how it may collect data from children's videos on the site. ""In light of the kind of content that is on YouTube focused on attracting young users, it raises serious questions about what efforts are being made to make sure that information is not being collected about children and mined and sold,"" Mr. Cicilline said. Google, the biggest seller of online advertising, said its policies did not allow advertisers to deliver personalized ads to children under 13 or collect their personal information. [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] ""We're committed to protecting children online with a combination of family-friendly products and strict policies,"" a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. Several of the most-viewed channels on YouTube are aimed at children, including ChuChu TV and Ryan ToysReview, according to Social Blade, which compiles social media data. The channels, according to the site, have attracted billions of views. That's good for ad revenue, which YouTube splits with video makers. Mr. Golin said he was disappointed that the Federal Trade Commission, which met with children's rights advocates in May after they filed their complaint, hadn't acted on the issue. Lawmakers and the New Mexico attorney general ""are really stepping up and putting pressure on the companies that should be coming from the F.T.C.,"" he added. Still, Mr. Golin said he was optimistic that the congressmen could glean information from Google. ""These are not questions we've ever gotten answers to, and it would be great to get on the record what Google and YouTube actually know about this,"" he said. The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment. The letter from the two lawmakers concludes with a series of pointed questions that ask Google to explain how it determines the age of its users, whether or not it collects the same personal data from children and adults and why YouTube includes channels that are ""clearly child-directed."" Mr. Cicilline and Mr. Fortenberry gave Google a deadline of Oct. 17 to reply. Follow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter: @Sapna.

Law Enforcement Officials Confront Tech Companies' Power,"WASHINGTON -- Top Justice Department officials met with 14 state attorneys general on Tuesday to weigh whether they have the right tools to confront privacy and competition concerns surrounding Facebook, Google and other tech companies that have amassed extraordinary amounts of data about their consumers and advertising markets. Americans increasingly recognize that tech companies wield tremendous power and deserve greater scrutiny, the law enforcement officials said, and they discussed whether traditional approaches to antitrust issues were still suitable for modern disputes over privacy and the tech business model.  Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, cautioned against comparisons to landmark antitrust cases. ""Most would agree, this is not Standard Oil, this is not even Microsoft,"" he said. But, he added, ""all of those situations inform you."" The Justice Department called the conversation productive, though no decisions were made or announced. The meeting, largely a forum for officials to share ideas, sharply contrasted with Monday's chaos at the Justice Department over the confusion of whether Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, would leave the job. He had told senior White House advisers that he was considering quitting after a New York Times article revealed that he had discussed secretly recording President Trump to expose the chaos inside the administration and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. Mr. Rosenstein has denied the report. He attended Tuesday's meeting, sitting alongside Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the acting associate attorney general, Jesse Panuccio, the department's No. 3 official. The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, and the acting head of the civil rights division, John M. Gore, also attended. Three major issues were broached: the tech business model, which is based on accumulating consumer data; privacy; and user terms and conditions, according to people in the room. Google came up more than other companies, according to a person in the room who was not authorized to publicly describe the discussion and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A few attorneys general expressed concern about Google's ability to track, in a granular way, the everyday routines of people. Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, was set to meet with lawmakers in Washington on Friday, including Republicans who plan to ask him about the company's competitive practices; its work with countries accused of human rights abuses, like China and Russia; and whether its workers and search engine magnify biases. ""Google has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,"" the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said in a statement. Technology companies mine consumer behavior online for data, which they then sell on an open marketplace much in the same way that a company might sell oil. A handful of large companies control and sell the vast majority of that data. The conversation was originally billed by the Justice Department as a way to address free speech issues, as well as competitive concerns. Before it was announced, Mr. Trump, whose Twitter account is perhaps his core communications platform, amplified claims that tech and social media companies try to suppress conservative voices and opinions. But the law enforcement officials touched only briefly on whether the companies were politically biased or suppressing the free flow of ideas.

Ex-Google Employee Urges Lawmakers to Take On Company,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is facing increased scrutiny by lawmakers in Washington over its size and influence. Now, a research scientist who recently resigned from the company in protest is urging them on. In a harshly worded letter sent this week, the former employee, Jack Poulson, criticized Google's handling of a project to build a version of its search engine that would be acceptable to the government of China. He said the project was a ''catastrophic failure of the internal privacy review process.''    He said lawmakers should increase transparency and oversight of the company and technology industry, saying that there is a ''broad pattern of unaccountable decision making.''    Dr. Poulson left the company after news articles revealed the existence of the project last month. It was first reported on by the Intercept news site.   Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified on Wednesday before a congressional committee about the company's approach to data protection. Executives from Apple, AT&T, Amazon, Twitter and Charter Communications also appeared at the hearing.   Dr. Poulson said the Chinese project, called Dragonfly, had several ''disturbing components.'' A prototype, he said, would allow a partner company in China to view a person's search history based on his or her phone number. He said the project also censored an extensive list of subjects that included information about air quality and China's president, Xi Jinping.   He also pointed lawmakers to commitments Google made as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Google, among other requirements, must submit to regular privacy audits and follow a comprehensive privacy program under the settlement. The privacy program includes reviews of all Google products for privacy issues before they are released.   Google's privacy reviewers are assigned to analyze Google code and make sure it does not violate user privacy. But after Dragonfly became public, several reviewers said they had signed off on sections of code for Dragonfly without fully understanding the project or its privacy implications, according to two people familiar with the process. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships at the company.   The reviewers, they said, felt that pertinent information about Dragonfly's code had been withheld from them, and raised questions about the review process that went unanswered.   In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Enright said Google was not close to releasing a search product in China.   ''If we were, in fact, to finalize a plan to launch a search product in China, my team would be actively engaged,'' he said. ''Our privacy and security controls would be followed, and any such project or product would follow and be consistent with our values in privacy and data protection.''   Google on Monday released a framework for privacy legislation that describes to lawmakers how the company views its role in data protection.   ''Innovative uses of data shouldn't be presumptively unlawful just because they are unprecedented, but organizations must account for and mitigate potential harms,'' the framework says. ''This includes taking particular care with sensitive information that can pose a significant risk. To enable organizations to develop effective mitigations, regulators should be clear about what constitutes a harm.''   In a blog post, Mr. Enright said the company supported comprehensive regulation on privacy. Google has also recently increased its privacy efforts, forming a team dedicated to privacy and data protection.   Google left China in 2010, denouncing government censorship. That year the company also said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company's corporate infrastructure.   ''It should be pretty obvious that they should be asked what changed between 2010 and today,'' said Cynthia Wong, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.   Interested in All Things Tech?

Oath Agrees to $5 Million Settlement Over Children's Privacy Online,"Oath, the owner of AOL and Yahoo, has agreed to pay about $5 million to settle charges from the New York attorney general that the media company's online advertising business was violating a federal children's privacy law. AOL, through its ad exchange, helped place targeted display ads on hundreds of websites that it knew were directed to children under 13, such as Roblox.com and Sweetyhigh.com, according to a settlement that the attorney general's office plans to announce on Tuesday. The attorney general's office said that the ads were placed by using personal data, like cookies and geolocation information, in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which is known as Coppa.  The penalty that the Verizon-owned Oath agreed to pay is the largest a company has paid for a case tied to Coppa. A spokesman for Oath, which did not admit or deny the attorney general's findings, said, ""We are pleased to see this matter resolved and remain wholly committed to protecting children's privacy online."" ""Coppa is meant to protect young children from being tracked and targeted by advertisers online,"" said Barbara D. Underwood, New York's attorney general. ""AOL flagrantly violated the law -- and children's privacy -- and will now pay the largest-ever penalty under Coppa."" The settlement is the latest evidence of the scrutiny internet giants are facing over how they collect and use data from children for online advertising. Google was criticized this year by New Mexico's attorney general for how it may collect children's location data, while other privacy advocates have pressed for more transparency about how children may be tracked and targeted for ads on YouTube, which is owned by Google. In an age when online privacy has become a significant public concern, Coppa is one of the few federal regulations in place. It requires companies to obtain explicit, verifiable permission from parents before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from children under 13 or targeting them with ads tied to their online behavior. Personal information includes cookies that track a user across websites and geolocation data, which is then used to send specific ads to specific people. Advertisers are typically willing to pay more for ads tailored to individuals and their online behavior rather than placing ads on specific websites in the hopes that they might be seen by people interested in their products. Ad exchanges, which connect websites and potential advertisers through real-time bidding processes as pages load, must comply with Coppa when they know they are working with children's sites. Technically, AOL's policies prohibited the use of its display ad exchange to auction ad space on children's sites, but the company did business there anyway, according to the settlement documents, which examined AOL's practices between October 2015 and February 2017. Its auctions of ad space on those sites regularly collected personal information from users, like they would on any website, then shared that with bidders, resulting in targeted advertisements. An account manager for AOL in New York repeatedly told one client, called Playwire Media, that the company's ad exchange could be used to sell ad space while complying with Coppa, which wasn't the case, according to the settlement documents. Based on the statements, Playwire, which represented sites like Roblox.com, Neopets.com and Tweentribune.com, used the exchange to place more than a billion ads on space that was supposed to be covered by Coppa. AOL, through Advertising.com, also bought space on websites from other ad exchanges that had been flagged as Coppa-covered. However, according to the settlement, the company treated this ad space the same as it would any normal ad space, meaning that it allowed ad targeting. The company has since introduced technology that recognizes when space is deemed to be covered by Coppa and adjusts its practices accordingly, according to the settlement. Oath, as part of the settlement, said it would create a Coppa compliance program, which will be overseen by a specific executive or officer, and provide annual training on Coppa compliance to account managers and other employees that work with ads on children's sites. It will also destroy personal information that it has collected from children. Separately, a Wall Street Journal article on Oath's advertising business said on Sunday that the unit has failed to meet ambitious revenue targets through digital ad sales on Yahoo and AOL properties.

Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy,"After a yearlong string of news reports that have called Facebook's data-sharing practices into question, federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users. It is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were leveled by the Federal Trade Commission, the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices.  That agreement, called a consent decree, provides a road map for how the F.T.C. is likely to scrutinize Facebook over the coming months. Why did the F.T.C. accuse Facebook of deceptive privacy practices in the first place?  In 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users' online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis.  Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, apologized with what an article in The New York Times described as a ""symphony of contrition."" In a Facebook post that year, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote: ""I'm not proud of the way we've handled this situation and I know we can do better."" At the end of 2009, a coalition of nonprofit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook's handling of user data.  The groups filed a complaint saying that Facebook had repeatedly disregarded users' expectations and diminished their privacy. The complaint argued that the company had violated a federal law prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices.  In 2011, the F.T.C. filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy. What were the F.T.C.'s charges against Facebook? The F.T.C.'s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them: [#x25a0] Facebook shared users' personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said. [#x25a0] Facebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all of their personal data -- even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said. [#x25a0] In 2009, the agency said, Facebook changed its information-handling practices, making certain personal details -- like users' friends lists -- public, overriding the choices of people who wanted to keep that data private. The policy change, the F.T.C.'s complaint said, exposed users' profile information, including ""potentially controversial political views or other sensitive information,"" to third parties. [#x25a0] The agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its ""Verified Apps program,"" but the company did not do so. What did the F.T.C. require Facebook to do? In November 2011, Facebook agreed to settle charges that it had deceived consumers by ""telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,"" the F.T.C. said in a statement at the time. The agreement, which became final in 2012, prohibited Facebook from misleading consumers about their data privacy and security. The social network committed to getting the explicit consent of users before making changes that overrode their privacy preferences. The agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users' information and to manage the risks of existing and new products.  It also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify that the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company's users. Why is the federal consent agreement relevant now? In March 2018, The New York Times reported that a voter-profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or permission.  The voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook. Although only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users' friends -- consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported. Privacy experts, law professors and at least one former F.T.C. official have argued that Facebook's failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users' friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook's failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users' data and the data of users' friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said. They said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users' friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said. They also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions -- steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree. ""The consent decree requires Facebook to always be vigilant to possible privacy problems and try to solve them,"" saidDavid C. Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C. who oversaw the investigation that led to the consent decree. ""Cambridge Analytica made clear that Facebook was not auditing third-party apps.""  On March 26, the F.T.C. said it was conducting an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment last week on the progress of the investigation.   Since then, Facebook has made other admissions about privacy problems that experts said could potentially violate the consent agreement or trigger new federal charges of deceptive privacy practices. [#x25a0] In June, the company said a software bug made public the posts of up to 14 million users who thought the posts were private.  [#x25a0] Also in June, The New York Times reported that Facebook had allowed device makers like Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft and Samsung access to the data of users' friends without their explicit consent, even after the company said that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. [#x25a0] In September, the company said a security breach had exposed the personal data of nearly 50 million users.  [#x25a0] In October, Facebook said Russian firms had scraped user data, including ""matching photos from individuals' personal social media accounts in order to identify them.""  [#x25a0] In December, Facebook said a software bug had given apps access to a larger set of users' photos than usual. [#x25a0] Also in December, The New York Times reported that Facebook had shared user data with Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies without users' knowledge or permission. In addition to the F.T.C., Facebook is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and several government agencies in Europe over Cambridge Analytica's harvesting of user data. What does Facebook say? Facebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree. ""We are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people's privacy settings,"" Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. ""We have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people's information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services."" Ms. Aldous said the company's privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms -- including a privacy governance team and security teams that ""ensure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed, and escalated for decisions when necessary."" Facebook said it disagreed with The Times's characterization of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies.  The social network said device makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users' Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps. ""None of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the F.TC.,"" Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, director of developer platforms and programs at Facebook, wrote in a company news releaselast week.

America Needs a Privacy Law; letter,"To the Editor: ""The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s,"" by Margaret O'Mara (Op-Ed, Dec. 6), points to several critical moments in the development of American privacy laws, but there is much in this history that needs clarifying if the next steps on privacy are smart ones.  Ms. O'Mara is correct that the proposal for a National Data Center and growing concern about the misuse of personal data by the government culminated in the Privacy Act of 1974. But a deal with the Ford White House stripped the final bill of private-sector coverage and a dedicated federal agency. The country has lived with the consequences.  Coverage in the private sector is uneven or exists not at all. The absence of a privacy agency is still a gaping hole in American law. The Europeans, building on the United States' experience and facing similar challenges, managed to develop a privacy regime that is both more coherent and more effective.  Back then, Congress well understood the need to limit the collection of personal data. And Congress did not view privacy protection and the free flow of information as a trade-off. In the same year that Congress enacted the Privacy Act, it also strengthened the Freedom of Information Act. There is still much that Congress can do to strengthen privacy protections for Americans. Enacting federal baseline legislation and establishing a data protection agency would be a good start.

Marriott Hacking Exposes Data of Up to 500 Million Guests,"The hotel chain asked guests checking in for a treasure trove of personal information: credit cards, addresses and sometimes passport numbers. On Friday, consumers learned the risk. Marriott International revealed that hackers had breached its Starwood reservation system and had stolen the personal data of up to 500 million guests. The assault started as far back as 2014, and was one of the largest known thefts of personal records, second only to a 2013 breach of Yahoo that affected three billion user accounts and larger than a 2017 episode involving the credit bureau Equifax. The intrusion was a reminder that after years of headline-grabbing attacks, the computer networks of big companies are still vulnerable.  The Starwood attack happened roughly the same time as a number of other breaches at American health insurers and government agencies, including the United States Office of Personnel Management, in what security research firms and government officials described as an effort to compile a vast database of personal information on potential espionage targets. Experts don't know if the Starwood attack was connected to those other episodes. But Starwood's data has not popped up on the so-called dark web, according to Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm, and Coalition, a cyber insurance provider, which suggested that the hotel attackers weren't looking to sell what they took. ""Usually when stolen data doesn't appear, it's a state actor collecting it for intelligence purposes,"" said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. The breach hit customers who made reservations for the Marriott-owned Starwood hotel brands from 2014 to September 2018. The properties include Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels, St. Regis, Four Points, Aloft, Le Méridien, Tribute, Design Hotels, Element and the Luxury Collection. Marriott hotels, including Residence Inn and the Ritz-Carlton, operate on a separate reservation system. The company has plans to merge that system with Starwood's. The names, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, email addresses and encrypted credit card details of hotel customers were stolen. The travel histories and passport numbers of a smaller group of guests were also taken. Marriott said it had set up a dedicated website and call center to deal with guests and said it would try to reach affected customers on Friday to inform them of the breach. The site was having problems staying online shortly after the attack was announced. The company is offering one year of free enrollment in a service called Web Watcher to people who live in the United States, Canada and Britain. Marriott described it as a service that keeps an eye on websites where thieves swap and sell personal information and then alerts people if anyone is selling their information. ""We deeply regret this incident,"" Arne Sorenson, Marriott's president and chief executive, said in a statement. ""We fell short of what our guests deserve and what we expect of ourselves."" The intrusion went unnoticed for four years by Starwood, which was acquired by Marriott in 2016 for $13.6 billion. It was uncovered in early September, when a security tool alerted Marriott officials to an unauthorized attempt to access Starwood's guest reservation database. The alert prompted Marriott to work with outside security experts, who discovered that the hackers had grabbed a foothold in Starwood's systems starting in 2014. On Nov. 19, digital forensics experts uncovered the full scope of the attack. It was the second major security breach Starwood has reported. Its cash register systems were penetrated in 2015. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement that it was aware of the breach and was tracking the situation. It added that any suspected instances of identity theft should be reported to the F.B.I.'s Internet Crime Complaint Center at www.ic3.gov. In recent years, cybersecurity experts said, the hospitality industry has become a rich target for nation-state hackers looking to track the travel movements and preferences of heads of states, diplomats, chief executives and other people of interest to espionage agencies. Going after hotel customer lists has been part of a broader effort to obtain giant databases of information. So big, in fact, that they would be of little use to run-of-the-mill hackers. But to a government, they would be very useful. That information could be fed, for example, into an analysis program run bya country's state security apparatus, Mr. Lewis said. Using ""big data"" technology similar to what marketers use in targeted advertising, the country could try to pinpoint the comings and going of intelligence agents from other nations. Did they stay, for example, in the same hotel as a potential source for that country? The breach could get expensive for Marriott. Verizon cut what it paid to acquire Yahoo by $350 million after the internet company reported its breach in 2016. And Equifax reported recovery costs of $400 million from its 2017 incident, which affected 148 million people. Despite months of due diligence, finding out there was a major network attack long after a deal closes is ""everybody's worst-case scenario,"" said Jake Olcott, vice president at BitSight, a computer security ratings company in Boston. Several lawsuits were filed against Marriott on Friday, and investigations were announced by New York's attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, and European regulators. In Europe, where companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue under data protection laws, companies must alert government authorities within 72 hours of a known breach. Given the volume and sensitivity of personal data taken, and the length of the breach, Marriott ""has the potential to trigger the first hefty G.D.P.R. fine,"" said Enza Iannopollo, a security analyst with Forrester Research, referring to the European data protection law enacted this year. Marriott told shareholders that it did not expect the breach would affect the company's long-term financial prospects. The company's share price was down more than 5 percent on Friday. Marriott has also been dealing with strikes by thousands of workers in nine cities, as well as customer complaints about problems with rewards programs after efforts to merge data from Starwood's rewards program into Marriott's left the records of millions of customers in limbo. Lawmakers said the episode was yet another example of why the United States needs data privacy laws that punish companies for failing to keep customers' information private. ""It is past time we enact data security laws that ensure companies account for security costs rather than making their consumers shoulder the burden and harms resulting from these lapses,"" Senator Mark R. Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said in a statement. Privacy advocates said there was no excuse for a breach to go unnoticed for four years. ""They can say all they want that they take security seriously, but they don't if you can be hacked over a four-year period without noticing,"" said Gus Hosein, executive director of Privacy International, a group that supports strong data protection laws.

"Iranians Accused in Cyberattacks, Including One That Hobbled Atlanta","Two Iranians were behind the ransomware attack that crippled Atlanta's government for days this year, the Justice Department said in an indictment unsealed on Wednesday, detailing a sophisticated scheme of attacks on hospitals, government agencies and other organizations. The men, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, chose targets with complex yet vulnerable systems -- organizations that could afford to pay ransoms and needed to urgently restore their systems back online, prosecutors said.  In the case of Atlanta, one of the most sustained and consequential cyberattacks ever launched against a major American city, the pair broke into the city's computer systems and held their data hostage for about $51,000 worth of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, prosecutors said. ""They deliberately engaged in an extreme form of 21st-century digital blackmail, attacking and extorting vulnerable victims like hospitals and schools, victims they knew would be willing and able to pay,"" Brian Benczkowski, the head of the criminal division of the Justice Department, said in a news conference on Wednesday. The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on two other Iranians, accusing them of changing the Bitcoin obtained by the hackers into Iranian rial. Mr. Savandi and Mr. Mansouri, who are wanted by the F.B.I., created the malicious software SamSam Ransomware, prosecutors said, and began to gain access to their victims' computers in January 2016. The software is well known to cybersecurity experts. Atlanta officials said at the time that they would not pay the ransom, even as the attack ground court, parking and employment systems to a halt. For days, police officers wrote reports by hand, warrants were not validated, applications for city jobs sat unprocessed and government workers were unable to access basic administrative systems. ""Victims are encouraged not to pay the ransom,"" said Amy Hess, a top F.B.I. cybercrime official. She added that there is no guarantee that the victims will get their data back. Mr. Savandi and Mr. Mansouri collected more than $6 million in extortion payments, law enforcement officials said. The cities and businesses targeted lost more than $30 million as they scrambled to fix computer systems and recovered data, according to court documents. Many of the victims were public agencies with missions that involve lifesaving and other critical functions. Among them were Allscripts Healthcare; Laboratory Corporation of America; the city of Newark; the University of Calgary; the Port of San Diego; the Colorado Department of Transportation; and hospitals and health care groups in Los Angeles, Kansas, Maryland and Nebraska. In the case of Mr. Savandi and Mr. Mansouri, the Justice Department indictment indicated that they belonged to the SamSam group, which is well known to cybersecurity researchers. The group was also known for meticulously encrypting its victims' data, manually from file to file; changing file names to ""I'm sorry""; demanding high ransom payments in Bitcoin; and giving victims only a week to pay before they made their data permanently inaccessible, according to major security firms like Symantec, the Crypsis Group and others. Cybersecurity researchers said they were surprised to learn that the SamSam group was based in Iran. Other than the group's name -- Samsam Kandi is the name of a tiny Iranian village -- no indicators showed that the group was based in Iran. ""They weren't using any of the Iranian infrastructure or typical Iranian tools and, until now, ransomware was not a typical Iranian attack method,"" said Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, a threat intelligence firm based in Boston. The defendants had used Bitcoin exchanges to launder their ransomware profits. People in countries with heavily sanctioned governments like North Korea and Iran are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency to bypass sanctions, Mr. Liska said. Though officials were careful to note that the suspects were not affiliated with the government of Iran, American officials and private-sector cybersecurity experts have been closely monitoring internet traffic out of Iran after President Trump's decision to pull out of the deal over its nuclear program last May. Within 24 hours, monitors in the United States and Israel picked up a notable shift in Iranian state hacking activity, including renewed attacks on diplomats and foreign affairs offices of American allies, as well as employees at major telecommunication companies.

E-Voting Is Insecure,"To the Editor: Re ''An Election Grid Rife With Flaws Shows Them All'' (front page, Nov. 18):     Despite the sense of security provided by some new technologies, e-voting remains a vulnerability in our election process. Computer scientists have maintained this position for a decade.   Existing security vulnerabilities associated with e-voting include installing malware, server penetration, denial-of-service attacks and disruption attacks, not to mention the continuing challenge to authenticate e-voters reliably.   Hackers can easily intercept data from an e-ballot en route to an election office and are able to change votes without a trace. Email ballots add risk to the election office, as attachments from unknown senders may contain malware.   Existing e-voting technologies force voters to give up the right to a secret ballot. Tampering with a mailed paper ballot, while a crime, affects one ballot. Once a hacker is able to infect a computer owned by a voter, or by the election offices, there is potential for large-scale, devastating electoral disruption.   We cannot secure online voting with today's technology. Paper ballots remain the best method for maintaining election security.

How Lax Enforcement Breeds Impostors Online,"When Hilary Mason, a data scientist and entrepreneur, discovered that dozens of automated ''bot'' accounts had sprung up to impersonate her on Twitter, she immediately set out to stop them. She filed dozens of complaints with Twitter, repeatedly submitting copies of her driver's license to prove her identity. She reached out to friends who worked at the company. But days later, many of the fake accounts remained active, even though virtually identical ones had been shut down.    Millions of accounts impersonating real people roam social media platforms, promoting commercial products and celebrities, attacking political candidates and sowing discord. They spread fake images and misinformation about the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla. They were central to Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump, according to a federal grand jury indictment on Friday. And American intelligence officials believe they will figure in Russian efforts to shape the coming midterm elections, too.   Yet social media companies often fail to vigorously enforce their own policies against impersonation, an examination by The New York Times found, enabling the spread of fake news and propaganda -- and allowing a global black market in social identities to thrive on their platforms.    Facebook and Twitter require proof of identity to shut down an impostor account but none to set one up. And even as social media accounts evolve into something akin to virtual passports -- for shopping, political activity and even gaining access to government services -- technology companies have devised their own rules and standards, with little oversight or regulation from Washington.   ''These companies have, in a lot of ways, assigned themselves to be validators of your identity,'' said Jillian York, an official at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates digital privacy protections. ''But the vast majority of users have no access to any due process, no access to any kind of customer service -- and no means of appealing any kind of decision.''   Some impostor accounts are set up as pranks. Millions of them are controlled by private companies that sell fake followers and other forms of social media engagement to celebrities, professional athletes and authors. Many others are deployed in systematic information warfare campaigns waged by governments.   In congressional hearings last week, some lawmakers questioned whether social media businesses were doing enough.   ''I think the companies themselves were slow to recognize this threat,'' said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. ''I think they've still got more work to do.''   Leaders of some social media companies have said they are trying hard to grapple with impersonation. In an earnings call this month, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, said the company was expanding what it calls ''information quality'' efforts, including ways of elevating credible and authentic content on the platform.   Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote in a Facebook post in January that the company had nearly doubled the number of workers who review content for fake news and abuse, including impersonation.   Facebook's terms of service prohibit impersonation and require that account holders generally use their real names. Twitter, however, allows parody accounts and pseudonyms, and only forbids impersonation when that account portrays another user ''in a misleading or deceptive manner.'' The company does not proactively review accounts for impersonation.   That policy can leave real users mystified or enraged. In December, Firoozeh Dumas, an Iranian-American memoirist who lives in Germany, repeatedly reported to Twitter at least four accounts impersonating hers. ''They have my photos, they tweet things from my books,'' she said. ''One of them seems to be selling things.''   Yet each time Ms. Dumas reported them, emails show, Twitter's support team told her the accounts did not meet its definition of abusive impersonation.   A Times investigation last month found that many real accounts are copied and turned into automated ''bots'' sold by companies like Devumi, a firm now based in Colorado that is under investigation by attorneys general in Florida and New York. (Through a spokesman, Devumi has denied selling fake accounts.)   One victim was Erin Barnes, a publicist and writer in Colorado. A bot sold by Devumi used not only her name and portrait, but also a background photograph of her husband and young daughter. ''It makes my skin crawl,'' Ms. Barnes said.   The account was suspended only recently, after Ms. Barnes -- alerted by The Times -- reported it to Twitter. ''If you're using somebody's photos and name together, then that's impersonation,'' she complained.   Twitter appears to be tracking Devumi's network of bots. Since the Times investigation was published, dozens of Devumi's most prominent clients -- actors, reality TV stars, authors, business executives and others seeking to buy followers and retweets -- have lost more than three million followers. Close to 55,000 impostor accounts sold by Devumi have been restricted or suspended.   Twitter has declined to say whether Devumi's bots violate its impersonation policy, or how many of its employees are focused on rooting out impersonation. The company's first line of defense against impersonation is the countermeasures that flag accounts that run afoul of Twitter policies on spam -- violations that can be easier for the platform to identify and stop at large scale.   But impostor accounts are still relatively easy to find on Twitter. The Times identified hundreds more of them through Twitter's own automated ''who to follow'' feature: When a user views a known impostor account, Twitter routinely recommends other impostor accounts to follow.   One real Twitter account, belonging to Jasmine Artis, a health care worker from North Carolina, was cloned dozens of times. At least 75 of those impostor accounts still exist -- though some have recently been restricted -- each using her picture, her name and a brief bio that refers to the school she was attending when her account was copied. Most of the clones have made only a handful of posts, some in Russian or Japanese. Ms. Artis said she had not been aware of the accounts.   Even Twitter's ''verified'' users, many of them well known, are being impersonated. There are active fake accounts impersonating the Democratic senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and the journalist April D. Ryan. None appeared to be obvious parodies. Instead, each posted content that mimicked what the real account might tweet.   Both Facebook and Twitter rely in part on their users to report impostors and abuse. But the companies' enforcement decisions can seem arbitrary. In January, Antonia Caliboso, a social worker in Seattle, discovered an impostor Facebook account using her name, biographical information and a photo, all lifted from a 2013 news release about a fellowship she had won.   Ms. Caliboso and dozens of her friends reported the fake account to Facebook over a period of weeks. But Facebook representatives repeatedly told her the account did not violate the company's impersonation policies, she said. Eventually, to protect herself, Ms. Caliboso deleted her real account.   ''I can't risk that a client or employer -- past, present or future -- might find that profile,'' she said.   Last week, Facebook reversed its position: The account was shut down, according to an email Ms. Caliboso received on Feb. 10, ''because it goes against our community standard on identity and privacy.''   Social media companies succeed in the marketplace by amassing as many active users as possible, so most make it relatively easy to create new accounts. Neither Facebook nor Twitter requires proof of identity to open a new account, but both require it when reporting impostors. Decisions about whether to take down or suspend an account are automated wherever possible, or farmed out to teams of low-level employees and contractors around the world.   As a result, on most social media platforms it is far easier to build a bot than to kill one.   ''The reason that they're so bad at this is that it conflicts with their business model,'' said Zeynep Tufekci, a sociologist and technology expert at the University of North Carolina. ''They try to come up with one set of rules that applies to two billion people, and then simplify it so that a contractor in a warehouse in the Philippines can go click-click-click and apply the policy.''   Ms. Mason, the data scientist, eventually took matters into her own hands. After she filed dozens of impersonation reports to Twitter in 2015, the company suspended many of the impostors, but left dozens untouched.   So she created more than 100 bots of her own, using as many variations of her name as she could think of. Each linked back to her real account, with the message ''the real hmason is over there.'' Eventually, Ms. Mason's homegrown bots, and Twitter's own efforts, seemed to overwhelm the impostors, she said, and the surge in fake accounts stopped.   ''With Twitter, it was easy'' to make bots, Ms. Mason said. ''I was shocked by how easy it was.''    "
How The Times Analyzed Location Tracking Companies,"To examine the practices of the location tracking industry, The New York Times tested apps on the Google Android and Apple iOS platforms, and evaluated data from a company that analyzed thousands of mobile apps. Testing Individual Apps Reporters tested both the Android and iOS versions of 10 apps: nine that had been flagged by academics researching Android devices or by people in the mobile location industry, as well as The Times's own app. Tests were done between July and November. Reporters downloaded and tested each app individually, deleting it before moving on to the next. A technical analysis tool captured all the information sent and received by the phones. Computer security research tools helped reveal many of the transmissions.  Reporters granted permission to collect location data to each app that requested it. The Times recorded all interactions with the app over two five-minute sessions, including pop-up messages and other prompts related to data use when the apps asked for location details. The Times analyzed the location transmissions from each app by looking for the latitude and longitude where testing was conducted, as well as known Wi-Fi IDs, which can be used to triangulate location. Reporters tallied only the transmissions precise enough to place the device in the correct building. A Times reporter identified each internet server address that received precise location data, using an online forensics company, DomainTools. Reporters examined the websites, marketing materials and privacy policies of the companies receiving precise location data. Companies that deal only in services such as fraud prevention were separated out. Reporters then counted the transmissions of precise location data to advertising, marketing and analysis companies. The Times app did not request precise location data and did not send it. It sent location data to several companies based on an IP address that placed the device elsewhere within the city. Evaluating App Code To get a broader look at the use of location-collection technology in apps, The Times used data from MightySignal, a firm that scans the code in thousands of Android and iOS apps. Frequently, location data companies make packages of code that collect phones' whereabouts. Developers who add this code to their apps can get paid for location-targeted ads, or earn money for providing the location data, or get free mapping or other services for their apps. The Times asked MightySignal to look for packages of code made by the more than 25 location-collection companies that the firm tracks. The Times excluded code packages that collect location primarily for mapping, as opposed to the sale or use of the data. The Times restricted results to apps that MightySignal had scanned within the previous six months. Many little-used apps on Android include location-gathering code, so The Times filtered out apps with fewer than 5,000 downloads. Because Apple does not provide download figures for its apps, the iOS apps were not sorted by user base. Tallying Location Companies Times reporters examined each company identified in the testing. Those that said they didn't handle precise location data at all, despite having received it, were not counted as part of the location-tracking industry. In these cases, apps may have sent the data to multiple companies and relied on the recipients to delete it if they didn't want it. The Times also did not count companies that were merely processing the data for the app -- for security, for example, or to tell the app maker about its own users. Many location companies receive data from app makers rather than from the apps themselves, a means of sharing that can't be detected through testing. So reporters also relied on other sources to identify location companies, including outsideanalysis of the marketplace, privacydisclosures required under a new European law and interviews with dozens of people affiliated with the industry. Apps Tested The apps included in the test are listed below, along with comment from the companies. Many other apps share data in similar ways; this list should not be used as a guide to problematic apps. With the exception of one children's app, each app below collected location data on both Android and iOS when a user gave permission. WeatherBug WeatherBug told users in the permissions process that data would be used for advertising. GroundTruth, the company behind the app, said it provided multiple prompts to inform the user of location data practices, gathered multiple consent authorizations and supplied a detailed privacy policy. The Weather Channel IBM, which owns the Weather Channel apps, said, ""The Weather Company has always been transparent with use of location data, providing this information where users most expect to see it -- in Privacy Settings and our Privacy Policy."" theScore The company said its notification to users about location sharing -- that it would help ""recommend local teams and players that are relevant to you"" -- was intended to be only a ""quick introduction to certain key product features"" and that the full uses of the data were described in its privacy policy. GasBuddy GasBuddy notified users of its iOS app early in the installation process that data could be used to ""analyze industry trends"" and advertising. It later added the same language to its Android app. DC Metro and BusThe iOS version mentioned that data could be used for advertising. The app's developer said that companies providing the location-gathering code had indicated that the data was collected anonymously and used only for ads, and that he was reviewing the arrangements. Tube Map - London Underground The company, Mapway, did not respond to requests for comment. Perfect365 The company said it could not discuss any data practices because of nondisclosure agreements. SnipSnap Coupon App SnipSnap declined to comment. Masha and the Bear: Free Animal Games for Kids The company said that it was stopping the sharing of location from its games. The game collected precise location data only on Android, not on iOS, where it was named Masha and the Bear: Vet Games. -- Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Aaron Krolik, Adam Satariano and Natasha Singer  "
Grindr Sets Off Privacy Firestorm After Sharing Users' H.I.V.-Status Data,"Grindr, the social network aimed at gay, bisexual and transgender men, is facing a firestorm of criticism for sharing users' H.I.V. status, sexual tastes and other intimate personal details with outside software vendors. The data sharing, made public by European researchers on Saturday and reported by BuzzFeed on Monday, set off an outcry from many users. By Monday night, the company said it would stop sharing H.I.V. data with outside companies.    The criticism of the company continued on Tuesday, with officials in Europe and the United States joining in. A consumer group in Norway filed a formal complaint with the country's data protection agency, accusing the company of breaching European and Norwegian laws. Two United States senators sent a letter to Grindr's chief executive, asking whether the app had asked users to opt in before it shared their most personal details with third parties.    In a statement on Monday, the company said that sharing user data with outside companies was a standard industry practice and that Grindr had ''policies in place to further protect our users' privacy from disclosure.''   On Tuesday, in response to questions about the Norwegian group's accusations, a Grindr spokesman said: ''We welcome the questions about our policies and always look for opportunities to improve. ''   An increasing number of online users in the United States, along with some members of Congress, are  questioning the tech industry's largely unfettered collection and data-mining of consumers' personal details. The Grindr controversy also highlights the widening regulatory gap between the United States, which lacks a comprehensive federal consumer privacy law, and Europe, where privacy is viewed as a fundamental human right, with laws to back it up.   Grindr, which is owned by the Kunlun Group, a company based in Hong Kong, has more than 3.6 million active users. The Norwegian Consumer Council, a nonprofit group in Oslo that first raised concerns about the company's practices, said the dating app had shared users' H.I.V. status with two software companies, Apptimize and Localytics. Although the app encrypted the H.I.V. status data, the analysis found that Grindr had shared other highly sensitive details -- including users' romantic aims and self-identified tribes like ''leather'' or ''bear'' -- with an ad-targeting company without encryption.   In a complaint to the Norwegian data protection agency, the group said Grindr had violated a European data protection law that requires special protections for processing sensitive data including details about health and sex. The group said Grindr had also violated a provision in the law that requires companies to obtain informed consent before using people's data for new purposes.   In its statement, Grindr said that it worked with software vendors to improve its platform and that, in doing so, it may share details about users' H.I.V. status or location. The company reminded users that ''Grindr is a public forum'' and that they should know that data they included in their profiles, including their H.I.V. status, would become public.   ''As a result, you should carefully consider what information to include in your profile,'' the statement said.   But consumer advocates said Grindr had used intimate personal details for purposes that the app's users had never signed up for or even knew about.   ''It's totally invisible to the user, which is why they feel betrayed and a loss of control when sensitive data about them is shipped to some third party,'' said Justin Brookman, the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. ''I hope this will get app developers and other companies to rethink their promiscuous data-sharing practices.''    "
Uber to Pay $148 Million Over Data Breach,"Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber will pay $148 million to settle a nationwide investigation into a 2016 data breach, in which a hacker managed to gain access to information belonging to 57 million riders and drivers. The breach included names and driver's license numbers for 600,000 drivers.  The investigation, led by state attorneys general across the United States, focused on whether Uber had violated data breach notification laws by not informing consumers that their information had been compromised.    Rather than disclosing the breach when it occurred, Uber paid the hacker $100,000 through its bug bounty program, which financially rewards hackers for discovering and disclosing software flaws. The ride-hailing company persuaded him to delete the data and stay quiet about it with a nondisclosure agreement.   The incident became public a year later when Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, announced it as a ''failure'' and fired the two employees who had signed off on the payment.   ''Uber's decision to cover up this breach was a blatant violation of the public's trust,'' Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, said in a statement. ''The company failed to safeguard user data and notify authorities when it was exposed.''   Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said the settlement was part of a larger effort inside Uber to remake the company's image. He said the company had recently hired a chief privacy officer and a chief trust and security officer.   ''We know that earning the trust of our customers and the regulators we work with globally is no easy feat. After all, trust is hard to gain and easy to lose,'' Mr. West said.   He added that the breach was disclosed to the public during his first day on the job. ''Rather than settling into my new work space and walking the floor to meet my new colleagues, I spent the day calling various state and federal regulators,'' Mr. West said.   The Federal Trade Commission settled its investigation into the data breach in April. The trade commission now requires Uber to submit to regular privacy audits as part of a 2017 settlement, which was revised this year to address the most recent breach.   The $148 million settlement announced Wednesday will be divided among all 50 states and the District of Columbia.   ""Companies in California and throughout the nation are entrusted with customers' valuable private information,'' Mr. Becerra said. ''This settlement broadcasts to all of them that we will hold them accountable to protect that data.''   Interested in All Things Tech?

"Hack Was Smaller Than Feared, but Mined More Precious Data","Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter: @MikeIsaac. SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook said Friday that an attack on its computer systems that was announced two weeks ago had affected 30 million users, about 20 million fewer than it estimated earlier. But the personal information that was exposed was far more intimate than originally thought, adding to Facebook's challenges as it investigates what was probably the most substantial breach of its network in the company's 14-year history.    Detailed information was stolen from the Facebook profiles of about 14 million of the 30 million users. The data was as specific as the last 15 people or things they had searched for on Facebook and the last 10 physical locations they had ''checked into.''    Other personal details were also exposed, like gender, religious affiliation, telephone number, email addresses and the types of computing devices used to reach Facebook.   Users' names and contact information like telephone numbers were stolen from an additional 15 million profiles, Facebook said. The security tokens of about one million other people were stolen, but hackers did not get their profile information, the company said.   The hackers did not gain access to account passwords or credit card information, Facebook said.   ''We have been working around the clock to investigate the security issue we discovered and fixed two weeks ago so we can help people understand what information the attackers may have accessed,'' Guy Rosen, vice president of product management, wrote in a blog post on Friday.   While Facebook has cautioned that the attack was not as large as it had originally anticipated -- it forced 90 million users to log out so the security of their profiles would reset -- the details of what was stolen worried security experts. The data can be used for all sorts of schemes by sophisticated hackers.   ''Hackers have some sort of a goal,'' said Oren J. Falkowitz, chief executive of the cybersecurity company Area 1 Security and a former National Security Agency official. ''It's not that their motivation is to attack Facebook, but to use Facebook as a lily pad to conduct other attacks.''   An attacker may use that information to conduct sophisticated ''phishing attacks,'' a method used to get into financial accounts, health records or other important personal databases, Mr. Falkowitz said.   ''Once you've become a target, it never ends,'' he said.   The breach was disclosed at the worst possible time for Facebook, which is grappling with a series of crises that have shaken user trust in the world's largest social network.   Over the last year, Facebook has faced repeated criticism that it hasn't been doing enough to protect the personal information of its more than two billion regular users.   In March, Facebook was hit by revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that had worked for the Trump campaign, had gained access to the private information of up to 87 million users.   The company is also dealing with concerns that disinformation on its platforms has affected elections and has even led to deaths in several countries. On Thursday, Facebook disclosed that it had removed hundreds of accounts and pages used to spread disinformation in the United States. While Russian agents had used Facebook and other social media to incite conflict before the 2016 election, domestic sources of false or misleading posts have jumped into the fray, the company said.   Disinformation has had dire results outside the United States. In Sri Lanka, Myanmar and other countries, hundreds of people have been killed, partly because of the rampant spread of misinformation across social networks and other internet sites.   Former employees have also taken to criticizing Facebook. Brian Acton, a co-founder of the Facebook-owned smartphone application WhatsApp, has called for people to delete their Facebook accounts.   The breach could affect users' willingness to use Facebook products. On Monday, Facebook debuted Portal, the company's first hardware device built from the ground up, for high-definition video calls. The product asks users to install a camera in their living rooms.   Facebook first found hints of suspicious activity across its network in early September when security engineers noticed a flurry of activity around the ''View As'' feature, a way for users to check on what information other people can see about them. It was built to give users move control over their privacy.   More than a week later, Facebook determined that the activity was an attack on its systems, focused on three interconnected vulnerabilities in the company's software.   Those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook's video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens -- digital keys that allow access to an account.   Facebook fixed the bugs and alerted users on Sept. 28 that the accounts of about 50 million users had been compromised.   In the days since, Facebook has scrambled to figure out how things went wrong, who could be responsible for the attack and what the attackers planned to do with the information.   In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Rosen declined to answer who might be responsible for the attack or how the information could be used.   Facebook engineers are working closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the hack. F.B.I. officials have asked Facebook not to share details on the suspected identities of the attackers for fear of compromising the investigation.    "
Facebook's Woes Rise as Hackers Expose Data of 50 Million Users,"Follow Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @sheeraf. SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook, already facing scrutiny over how it handles the private information of its users, said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users. The breach, which was discovered this week, was the largest in the company's 14-year history. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook's code to gain access to user accounts and potentially take control of them.    The news could not have come at a worse time for Facebook. It has been buffeted over the last year by scandal, from revelations that a British analytics firm got access to the private information of up to 87 million users to worries that disinformation on Facebook has affected elections and even led to deaths in several countries.   Senior executives have testified several times this year in congressional hearings where some lawmakers suggested that the government will need to step in if the social network is unable to get tighter control of its service. On Friday, regulators and lawmakers quickly seized on the breach to renew calls for more oversight.    ''This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,'' Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia and one of Facebook's most vocal critics in Congress, said in a statement. ''A full investigation should be swiftly conducted and made public so that we can understand more about what happened.''   In the conference call on Friday, Guy Rosen, a vice president of product management at Facebook, declined to say whether the attack could have been coordinated by hackers supported by a nation-state.   Three software flaws in Facebook's systems allowed hackers to break into user accounts, including those of the top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, according to two people familiar with the investigation but not allowed to discuss it publicly. Once in, the attackers could have gained access to apps like Spotify, Instagram and hundreds of others that give users a way to log into their systems through Facebook.   [Read more about what you can do to secure your Facebook account.]   The software bugs were particularly awkward for a company that takes pride in its engineering: The first two were introduced by an online tool meant to improve the privacy of users. The third was introduced in July 2017 by a tool meant to easily upload birthday videos.   Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerabilities and notified law enforcement officials. Company officials do not know the identity or the origin of the attackers, nor have they fully assessed the scope of the attack or if particular users were targeted. The investigation is still in its beginning stages.   ''We're taking it really seriously,'' Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. ''I'm glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place.''   Critics say the attack is the latest sign that Facebook has yet to come to terms with its problems.   ''Breaches don't just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security,'' Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. ''The cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers.''   Facebook has been roundly criticized for being slow to acknowledge a vast disinformation campaign run by Russian operatives on its platform and other social media outlets before the 2016 presidential election.   Ms. Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, testified in a Senate hearing that month about what the company was trying to do to prevent the same thing from happening in midterm elections in November.   In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified about revelations that Cambridge Analytica, the British analytics firm that worked with the Trump presidential campaign, siphoned personal information of millions of Facebook users.   Outside the United States, the impact of disinformation appearing on Facebook and the popular messaging service it owns, WhatsApp, has been severe. In countries such as Myanmar and India, false rumors spread on social media are believed to have led to widespread killing.   Facebook said the attackers had exploited two bugs in the site's ''View As'' feature, which allows users to check on what information other people can see about them. The feature was built to give users move control over their privacy.   The company said those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook's video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens -- digital keys that allow access to an account.   It is not clear when the attack happened, but it appears to have occurred after the video-uploading program was introduced, Facebook said. The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised.   The hackers also tried to harvest people's private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook's systems, Mr. Rosen said. The company could not determine the extent of the attackers' access to third-party accounts, he said.   Facebook has been reshuffling its security teams since Alex Stamos, its chief security officer, left in August for a teaching position at Stanford University. Instead of acting as a stand-alone group, security team members now work more closely with product teams across the company. The move, the company said, is an effort to embed security across every step of Facebook product development.   Part of that effort has been to gird Facebook against attacks on its network in preparation for the midterm elections. Facebook has spent months setting up new systems to pre-empt such attacks, and has already dealt with a number of incidents believed to be connected to elections in Mexico, Brazil and other countries.   Still, the recently discovered breach was a reminder that it is exceptionally difficult to entirely secure a system that has more than 2.2 billion users all over the world and that connects with thousands of third-party services.   ''This has really shown us that because today's digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform -- especially one as popular and widely reaching as Facebook -- can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation,'' said April Doss, chairwoman of cybersecurity at the law firm Saul Ewing.   As the news of Facebook's data breach spread quickly across Twitter, Google searches and other online sites, there was one place where it remained difficult to find some detailed reports: Facebook.   Users who posted breaking stories about the breach from The Guardian, The Associated Press and other outlets were prompted with a notice that their posts had been taken down. So many people were posting the stories, they looked like suspicious activity to the systems that Facebook uses to block abuse of its network.   ''We removed this post because it looked like spam to us,'' the notice said.    "
"Fact Check: What Mark Zuckerberg Said About Facebook, Privacy and Russia; Fact Check","Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, is testifying before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday to answer questions about the social network's failure to protect the data of millions of its users and its role in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  Here are some of Mr. Zuckerberg's claims, as well as some claims from the lawmakers, which we fact checked. The page will be updated throughout the hearings.   Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, used information that had been harvested from as many as 87 million Facebook users several years ago to build psychological profiles of voters. Facebook did announce changes in 2014 to limit the access that new apps had to data about its users, but it was not until 2015 that the company rolled out the changes to affect all of the apps on the platform.  Facebook has long maintained that it did not learn about how Russian agents had used its platform to influence the presidential election until the summer of 2017. While Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief information officer, warned the company that Russian hackers may have been active on the platform in the summer of 2016, he has said he was looking at cybersecurity breaches, not disinformation campaigns tied to the elections. Tuesday was the first time that Mr. Zuckerberg cited 2016 as the date when the company identified new operations linked to the election. Facebook requires people to register for accounts with their real names. But the fact is that fake accounts and false pages have persisted on the social network.  Russian agents set up accounts on Facebook with false identities before the 2016 presidential election. And just this week, Facebook removed a popular Black Lives Matter page after it was discovered to be inauthentic. Former employees of Cambridge Analytica have told The New York Times that they were using Facebook as early as 2014. Mr. Zuckerberg later said he had misspoken. During the hearing, Mr. Zuckerberg was shown the terms of service of the quiz app that Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, used to gather data from Facebook users. The fine print may have told users that their data could be used for commercial purposes, according to a draft of the app's terms of service that was reviewed by The Times, and which was shown to Mr. Zuckerberg by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut.  In other words, it appears that Facebook may not have regularly checked to make sure that apps complied with its rules.  The final wording of the terms of service for Mr. Kogan's app is now most likely unknowable. Facebook executives said they deleted the app in December 2015 after they found out about the data harvesting. Facebook users who downloaded Mr. Kogan's quiz app did consent to sharing their own and their friends' information by agreeing to the app's terms and conditions. But their friends were not aware that their information had been shared and did not knowingly grant permission.  And notices in fine print are often ignored or misunderstood. Several people who used the app told The Times that they were not aware that it had harvested their data. Studies and surveys have shown that most people click agree to terms and conditions without actually reading them. More than a million people downloaded the 2012 Obama campaign's app, which gained access to the data of supporters and their friends. Facebook users who downloaded the Obama campaign app were aware of its aims: supporting and campaigning for a political candidate.  Those who downloaded the app from Mr. Kogan, however, believed they were taking a personality quiz for academic purposes and did not know that their data would end up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. How successful Facebook has been at finding and eliminating terrorist propaganda from its platform is still up for debate. Facebook and other social media companies were chastised by the British Parliament in a 2017 report for ""failing to remove illegal content when asked to do so -- including dangerous terrorist recruitment material, promotion of sexual abuse of children and incitement to racial hatred."" The report called the companies' lack of enforcement shameful.  Last week, the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit that combats extremist groups, also said it had found accountsof some extremists that remained active on Facebook. A former Facebook employee told Gizmodo in 2016 that people working at the social network prevented stories about right-wing conferences and candidates from trending on Facebook.  Other former employees disputed this suggestion and Gizmodo said it was ""unable to determine if left-wing news topics or sources were similarly suppressed."" Facebook denied the allegations at the time, but the episode underscored the question of whether the social network was a media entity. While Facebook recently introduced a tool that allows people to download data that Facebook has collected on them, the tool appears to be incomplete. Some people have noticed that some data are missing, such as a long-forgotten feature of Facebook that lets you ""poke"" people. Facebook now allows users to opt-out of certain categories of data, including deciding what is shared with advertisers. But certain basic data will always be shared with the company unless a Facebook account is permanently deleted by the user. While Facebook doesn't collect the content of phone calls, it has been collecting call records and SMS data from Android devices that have the Facebook app installed.  Android users who recently downloaded the data that Facebook stores about them were surprised to learn that the company had information on their entire call history, going back years. Facebook recently explained in a blog post that users can opt out of Facebook collecting this data.

There May Soon Be Three Internets. America's Won't Necessarily Be the Best.,"In September, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive and Alphabet chairman, said that in the next 10 to 15 years, the internet would most likely be split in two -- one internet led by China and one internet led by the United States.  Mr. Schmidt, speaking at a private event hosted by a venture capital firm, did not seem to seriously entertain the possibility that the internet would remain global. He's correct to rule out that possibility -- if anything, the flaw in Mr. Schmidt's thinking is that he too quickly dismisses the European internet that is coalescing around the European Union's ever-heightening regulation of technology platforms. All signs point to a future with three internets. The received wisdom was once that a unified, unbounded web promoted democracy through the free flow of information. Things don't seem quite so simple anymore. China's tight control of the internet within its borders continues to tamp down talk of democracy, and an increasingly sophisticated system of digital surveillance plays a major role in human rights abuses, such as the persecution of the Uighurs. We've also seen the dark side to connecting people to one another -- as illustrated by how misinformation on social media played a significant role in the violence in Myanmar.   There's a world of difference between the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, known commonly as G.D.P.R., and China's technologically enforced censorship regime, often dubbed ""the Great Firewall."" But all three spheres -- Europe, America and China -- are generating sets of rules, regulations and norms that are beginning to rub up against one another. What's more, the actual physical location of data has increasingly become separated by region, with data confined to data centers inside the borders of countries with data localization laws.  The information superhighway cracks apart more easily when so much of it depends on privately owned infrastructure. An error at Amazon Web Services created losses of service across theweb in 2017; a storm disrupting a data center in Northern Virginia created similar failures in 2012. These were unintentional blackouts; the corporate custodians of the internet have it within their power to do far more. Of course, nobody wants to turn off the internet completely -- that wouldn't make anyone money. But when a single company with huge market share chooses to comply with a law -- or more worryingly, a mere suggestion from the authorities -- a large chunk of the internet ends up falling in line.  The power of a handful of platforms and services combined with the dismal state of international cooperation across the world pushes us closer and closer to a splintered internet. Meanwhile, American companies that once implicitly pushed democratic values abroad are more reticent to take a stand.  In 2010, Google shut down its operations in China after it was revealed that the Chinese government had been hacking the Gmail accounts of dissidents and surveilling them through the search engine. ""At some point you have to stand back and challenge this and say, this goes beyond the line of what we're comfortable with, and adopt that for moral reasons,"" said Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, in an interview with Der Spiegel at the time. But eight years later, Google is working on a search engine for China known as Dragonfly. Its launch will be conditional on the approval of Chinese officials and will therefore comply with stringent censorship requirements. An internal memo written by one of the engineers on the project described surveillance capabilities built into the engine -- namely by requiring users to log in and then tracking their browsing histories. This data will be accessible by an unnamed Chinese partner, presumably the government.  Google says all features are speculative and no decision has been made on whether to launch Dragonfly, but a leaked transcript of a meeting inside Google later acquired by The Intercept, a news site, contradicts that line. In the transcript, Google's head of search, Ben Gomes, is quoted as saying that it hoped to launch within six to nine months, although the unstable American-China relationship makes it difficult to predict when or even whether the Chinese government will give the go-ahead. ""There is a huge binary difference between being launched and not launched,"" said Mr. Gomes. ""And so we want to be careful that we don't miss that window if it ever comes.""  Internet censorship and surveillance were once hallmarks of oppressive governments -- with Egypt, Iran and China being prime examples. It's since become clear that secretive digital surveillance isn't just the domain of anti-democratic forces. The Snowden revelations in 2013 knocked the United States off its high horse, and may have pushed the technology industry into an increasingly agnostic outlook on human rights. Its relationship with the government isn't improving, either, when the industry is being hammered by the Trump administration's continuing trade wars. (This month, Vice President Mike Pence condemned Dragonfly as part of a longer, confrontational speech accusing China of ""economic aggression."")  As governments push toward a splintered internet, American corporations do little to counteract Balkanization and instead do whatever is necessary to expand their operations. If the future of the internet is a tripartite cold war, Silicon Valley wants to be making money in all three of those worlds. Part of the rationalization is that whether or not American companies get in on the action, a homegrown company will readily enact the kind of censorship and surveillance that its government requires. (Indeed, if Google launches in China, it has an uphill battle to fight against Baidu, the entrenched, government-endorsed Chinese search engine.)  What this future will bring for Europe and the United States is not clear. Mr. Gomes's leaked speech from inside Google sounded almost dystopian at times. ""This is a world none of us have ever lived in before,"" Mr. Gomes told employees. ""All I am saying, we have built a set of hacks, and we have kept them."" He seemed to hint at scenarios the tech sector had never imagined before. The world may be a very different place since the election of Donald Trump, but it's still hard to imagine that what's deployed in China will ever be deployed at home. Yet even the best possible version of the disaggregated web has serious -- though still uncertain -- implications for a global future: What sorts of ideas and speech will become bounded by borders? What will an increasingly disconnected world do to the spread of innovation and to scientific progress? What will consumer protections around privacy and security look like as the internets diverge? And would the partitioning of the internet precipitate a slowing, or even a reversal, of globalization?  A chillier relationship with Europe and increasing hostilities with China spur on the trend toward Balkanization -- and vice versa, creating a feedback loop. If things continue along this path, the next decade may see the internet relegated to little more than just another front on the new cold war.

Race Is On to Protect Data From Next Leap in Computers. And China Has the Lead.,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The world's leading technology companies, from Google to Alibaba in China, are racing to build the first quantum computer, a machine that would be far more powerful than today's computers. This device could break the encryption that protects digital information, putting at risk everything from the billions of dollars spent on e-commerce to national secrets stored in government databases. An answer? Encryption that relies on the same concepts from the world of physics. Just as some scientists are working on quantum computers, others are working on quantum security techniques that could thwart the code-breaking abilities of these machines of the future. It is a race with national security implications, and while building quantum computers is still anyone's game, China has a clear lead in quantum encryption. As it has with other cutting-edge technologies, like artificial intelligence, the Chinese government has made different kinds of quantum research a priority.  ""China has a very deliberate strategy to own this technology,"" said Duncan Earl, a former researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who is president and chief technology officer of Qubitekk, a company that is exploring quantum encryption. ""If we think we can wait five or 10 years before jumping on this technology, it is going to be too late."" Quantum computing is based on quantum mechanics, the science that explains the strange behavior exhibited by extremely small particles of matter. With traditional computers, transistors store ""bits"" of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do. When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful. Like quantum computing, quantum encryption relies on the nonintuitive behavior of very small objects. The codes that keep data secret are sent by photons, the tiniest particle of light. With the right equipment it is easy to tell if they have been tampered with, not unlike the seal on an aspirin bottle. If carried out properly, the technique could be unbreakable. There is no guarantee that a viable quantum encryption network could be built over long distances. But if it does happen, China's willingness to experiment and put government, academic and commercial resources behind the effort could have a big payoff. The country has invested tens of millions of dollars building networks that can transmit data using quantum encryption. Last year, a Chinese satellite named Micius, after an ancient philosopher, managed a video call between Beijing and Vienna using quantum encryption. A dedicated quantum communication network between Beijing and Shanghai was also put into operation last year, after four years of planning and construction. For now, quantum encryption works only over a limited distance. The satellite link between Beijing and Vienna stretched this limit to a record 4,630 miles. On the ground, using optical fiber lines, the ceiling is about 150 miles. Among China's investments in quantum encryption, the Micius satellite has received the most attention. The University of Science and Technology of China, the government-backed university that helped launch Micius, led the construction of the ground network, which spans about 1,200 miles -- perhaps a hint of aspirations for drastic improvement. The governments of Anhui and Shandong Provinces, through which the fiber-optic network passes, together invested $80 million in the project. Like all major infrastructure projects in China, the plans have had high-level support from the Chinese government. This main line is being extended to other cities and regions. The goal by 2030 is a Chinese-built network for sharing quantum encryption keys across the globe. Some security experts question the effectiveness of quantum encryption. Because it is so new, it has not been put through anywhere close to the rigorous testing that would give it a stamp of approval from skeptical cryptographers. But Chao-Yang Lu, a professor of physics at the University of Science and Technology of China, said the Beijing-Shanghai quantum network was a significant upgrade. With communications sent by traditional means, eavesdroppers can intercept the data stream at every point along a fiber-optic line. A government could tap that line just about anywhere. Quantum encryption cut the number of vulnerable spots in the Beijing-Shanghai line to just a few dozen across 1,200 miles, Professor Lu said. ""We admit that it's an intermediate solution,"" he said. ""It's not the final solution. But it's already a huge improvement in terms of security."" In the United States, the government and industry have viewed quantum encryption as little more than a science experiment. Instead, researchers have focused on using ordinary mathematics to build new forms of encryption that can stand up to a quantum computer. This technology would not require new infrastructure. But now, spurred by activity in China and recent advances in quantum research, some in the United States are playing catch-up. Qubitekk, a Southern California start-up, is working to secure power grids in Tennessee using the technology. A second start-up, Quantum Xchange, is building a quantum encryption network in the Northeast, hoping to serve Wall Street banks and other businesses. Researchers at Stony Brook University on Long Island are preparing a third venture. Small start-ups like Qubitekk are unlikely to match the millions of dollars in infrastructure already created in China for quantum encryption. But many experts believe the more important work will happen in research labs, and the Department of Energy is funding a test network in Chicago that could eclipse the kind of systems deployed in China. The Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories are working with Qubitekk to secure power grids with quantum technology, and Quantum Xchange is moving equipment into 60 Hudson Street, the old Western Union telegraph hub, which now serves as an internet hub for Lower Manhattan. Quantum Xchange is building a quantum encryption link between Manhattan and Newark, with plans to connect big banks operating in the two cities. Eventually, it hopes to extend this network up and down the East Coast. At places like the University of Chicago, researchers hope to go a step further, exploring what are called quantum repeaters -- devices that could extend the range of quantum encryption. ""We're not there yet,"" said David Awschalom, a professor at the University of Chicago who oversees much of the university's quantum research. ""But I am confident this will happen in the next couple of years."" Quantum communication techniques require new hardware. This includes vast networks of fiber lines -- and perhaps satellites -- as well as specialized devices capable of detecting individual photons of light. As Qubitekk worked on quantum encryption networks, it could not obtain the special light detectors it needed to do the work. The start-up originally bought detectors from a small manufacturer in New Jersey, Princeton Lightwave. But in April, this lone American manufacturer handed the detector business over to a company in China, RMY, and Qubitekk's supply line ran dry. RMY has promised hardware to Qubitekk but recently told it that, because of production issues, additional detectors won't be available until March. Small companies in Europe are selling somewhat similar detectors, and labs across the globe are developing a more advanced type of hardware. But for now, supplies, particularly in the United States, are slim. Follow Cade Metz and Raymond Zhong on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @zhonggg.

Cybersecurity Firm Finds Way to Alter WhatsApp Messages,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A cybersecurity company said it had discovered a flaw in WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service with 1.5 billion users, that allows scammers to alter the content or change the identity of the sender of a previously delivered message. By creating a hacked version of the WhatsApp application, scammers can change a ""quote"" -- a feature that allows people within a chat to display a past message and reply to it -- to give the impression that someone sent a message they did not actually send, according to the company, Check Point Software Technologies.  WhatsApp acknowledged that it was possible for someone to manipulate the quote feature, but the company disagreed that it was a flaw. WhatsApp said the system was working as it had intended, because the trade-offs to prevent such a deception by verifying every message on the platform would create an enormous privacy risk or bog down the service. The company said it worked to find and remove anyone using a fake WhatsApp application to spoof the service. ""We carefully reviewed this issue and it's the equivalent of altering an email,"" Carl Woog, a spokesman for WhatsApp, said in a statement. What Check Point discovered had nothing to do with the security of WhatsApp's so-called end-to-end encryption, which ensures only the sender and recipient can read messages, he said. WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users on its platform, making it the world's most widely used messaging app. It has gained popularity for the simplicity and security of its service, providing encryption so that even the company does not know the content of its users' messages. Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. But it has come under fire in recent months for the spread of misinformation on its platform. In India, false rumors about child kidnappers circulating through WhatsApp led to mob violence. In Brazil, false stories about deadly reactions to vaccines for the yellow fever spread over the messaging service. Mr. Woog of WhatsApp said the company was taking ""the challenge of misinformation seriously,"" putting limits on how widely a message can be shared to different groups and attaching labels when a message has been forwarded. However, WhatsApp said the issue raised by Check Point was unrelated to its efforts to curb misinformation. Oded Vanunu, head of vulnerability research at Check Point, said the ability to alter messages gave attackers a powerful tool to spread misinformation from what appeared to be a trusted source. It is especially problematic in group chats, which can include up to 256 people. Multiple messages can come in at once and it can be easy to lose track of what someone has said, he said. ""The public relies on the integrity of the message,"" said Mr. Vanunu. ""WhatsApp needs to adjust to prevent this simple manipulation."" For now, the issue appears limited to a discussion among security experts. Both WhatsApp and Check Point Software said they had not seen regular users creating fake quote messages in chats. Check Point said it also discovered a way within group chats to send a message to a specific individual within the discussion. That individual is tricked into believing that the whole group saw the message and responds accordingly. WhatsApp played down the concerns raised by Check Point, saying most people know the person who they are messaging on the service. The company said 90 percent of all messages on the service are sent in one-on-one conversations, and the majority of groups are six people or less -- making it less likely that an unknown person can infiltrate a conversation to trick other users. A person can check the validity of a quote message by clicking on it. Doing so will take you back to the point in the chat when the message was sent unless the message was deleted or the person was not a participant in the chat when the message was sent. WhatsApp said the potential fixes to this issue were not worth trying. One solution would be to create transcripts of every message exchange to verify the accuracy of every quote. Creating such a transcript is a significant privacy risk because those accounts of what people wrote to each other must be stored somewhere, the company said.

Our Cellphones Aren't Safe,"America's cellular network is as vital to society as the highway system and power grids. Vulnerabilities in the mobile phone infrastructure threaten not only personal privacy and security, but also the country's. According to intelligence reports, spies are eavesdropping on President Trump's cellphone conversations and using fake cellular towers in Washington to intercept phone calls. Cellular communication infrastructure, the system at the heart of modern communication, commerce and governance, is woefully insecure. And we are doing nothing to fix it. This should be at the top of our cybersecurity agenda, yet policymakers and industry leaders have been nearly silent on the issue. While government officials are looking the other way, an increasing number of companies are selling products that allow buyers to take advantage of these vulnerabilities.     Spying tools, which are becoming increasingly affordable, include cell-site simulators (commonly known by the brand name Stingray), which trick cellphones into connecting with them without the cellphone owners' knowledge. Sophisticated programs can exploit vulnerabilities in the backbone of the global telephone system (known as Signaling System 7, or SS7) to track mobile users, intercept calls and text messages, and disrupt mobile communications.   These attacks have real financial consequences. In 2017, for example, criminals took advantage of SS7 weaknesses to carry out financial fraud by redirecting and intercepting text messages containing one-time passwords for bank customers in Germany. The criminals then used the passwords to steal money from the victims' accounts.   How did we get here, and why is our cellular infrastructure so insecure?   The international mobile communications system is built on top of several layers of technology, parts of which are more than 40 years old. Some of these old technologies are insecure, others have never had a proper audit and many simply haven't received the attention needed to secure them properly. The protocols that form the underpinnings of the mobile system weren't built with security in mind.   SS7, invented in 1975, is still the protocol that allows telephone networks all over the world to talk to one another. It was built on the assumption that anyone who can connect to the network is a trusted network operator. When it was created, there were only 10 companies using SS7. Today, there are hundreds of companies all over the world connected to SS7, making it far more likely that credentials to the system will be leaked or sold. Anyone who can connect to the SS7 network can use it to track your location or eavesdrop on your phone calls. A more recent alternative to SS7 called Diameter  suffers from many of the same problems.   Another protocol, GSM, invented in 1991, allows your cellphone to communicate with a cell tower to make and receive calls and transmit data. The older generation of GSM, known as 2G, doesn't verify that the tower that your phone connects to is authentic, making it easy for anyone to use a cell-site simulator and impersonate a cell tower to obtain your location or eavesdrop on your communications.   Larger carriers have already begun dismantling their 2G systems, which is a good start, since later generations of GSM such as 3G, 4G and 5G solve many of its problems. Yet our phones all still support 2G and most have no way to disable it, making them susceptible to attacks. What's more, research has shown that 3G, 4G, and even 5G have vulnerabilities  that may allow new generations of cell-site simulators to continue working.   Nobody could have envisioned how deeply ingrained cellular technology would become in our society, or how easy and lucrative exploiting it would be. Companies from China, Russia, Israel and elsewhere are making cell-site simulators and providing access to the SS7 network at prices affordable even to the smallest criminal organizations. It is increasingly easy to build a cell-site simulator at home, for no more than the cost of a fast-food meal. Spies all over the world -- as well as drug cartels -- have realized the power of these technologies.   So far, industry and policymakers have largely dragged their feet when it comes to blocking cell-site simulators and SS7 attacks. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the few lawmakers vocal about this issue, sent a letter in August encouraging the Department of Justice to ''be forthright with federal courts about the disruptive nature of cell-site simulators.'' No response has ever been published.   The lack of action could be because it is a big task -- there are hundreds of companies and international bodies involved in the cellular network. The other reason could be that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have a vested interest in exploiting these same vulnerabilities. But law enforcement has other effective tools that are unavailable to criminals and spies. For example, the police can work directly with phone companies, serving warrants and Title III wiretap orders. In the end, eliminating these vulnerabilities is just as valuable for law enforcement as it is for everyone else.   As it stands, there is no government agency that has the power, funding and mission to fix the problems. Large companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Google and Apple have not been public about their efforts, if any exist.   This needs to change. To start, companies need to stop supporting insecure technologies such as 2G, and government needs a mandate to buy devices solely from companies that have disabled 2G. Similarly, companies need to work with cybersecurity experts on a security standard for SS7. Government should buy services only from companies that can demonstrate that their networks meet this standard.   Finally, this problem can't be solved by domestic regulation alone. The cellular communications system is international, and it will take an international effort to secure it.   We wouldn't tolerate gaping potholes in our highways or sparking power lines. Securing our mobile infrastructure is just as imperative. Policymakers and industries around the world must work together to achieve this common goal.

Homeland Security Chief Warns Adversaries Against Election Meddling,"WASHINGTON -- Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, recently warned dozens of foreign diplomats -- including the Russian ambassador -- that the United States would retaliate if adversaries abroad meddled in its coming elections. ""To those who would try to attack our democracy, to affect our elections, to affect the elections of other countries, to undermine national sovereignty, I have a word of warning: Don't,"" Ms. Nielsen told an estimated 80 foreign envoys and other officials during a speech last week, according to a person in attendance. Two other people with knowledge of the event confirmed the comments. All three spoke on the condition of anonymity because the remarks were given at a closed-door meeting.  It was an unusually stern warning by Ms. Nielsen, and was among the harshest threats of retaliation by a member of President Trump's cabinet. Ms. Nielsen is one of the most outspoken advocates of the administration's policies, and has resisted being drawn into the controversy over Russian meddling during the 2016 election that put Mr. Trump in office. Ms. Nielsen told the dignitaries gathered at Blair House, the presidential guesthouse, that election tampering would be detected and meddling states would suffer consequences, according to the person in attendance. The New York Times obtained a list of people who attended, including ambassadors from across the world. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman confirmed the speech at Blair House but declined to provide details. Ms. Nielsen's speech came a week after Mr. Trump said ""it certainly looks like the Russians were behind"" a nerve-gas attack in Salisbury, England, that poisoned a former Russian spy and his daughter. Two dozen countries, including the United States, have since expelled Russian officials in a punishing diplomatic purge. But otherwise, Mr. Trump has mocked the notion of election meddling by Moscow, at times calling it a ""hoax,"" concocted by Democrats and Hillary Clinton, his opponent in the race, after they lost. American intelligence agencies, however, have concluded that Russia did interfere in 2016 and intends to continue during midterm elections in November. The Department of Homeland Security is working with state and local election officials to protect electoral systems from cyberattacks. Congress last week approved spending $380 million for states and localities to step up its online security efforts during the 2018 midterm campaign. During a Senate hearing last week on election security, Ms. Nielsen said the department was speeding up security clearances to give state and local officials classified threat briefings. So far, about 20 state election officials have received full security clearances while others have received interim clearances. She also said the department had given in-depth vulnerability assessments of voting systems to 15 of 19 states that so far had requested them. The remaining states will get that assistance before Election Day, Ms. Nielsen said. One department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Ms. Nielsen's speech underscored her intent to prevent digital intrusions by foreign nations on critical infrastructure systems such as banks, electric utilities and election systems. Election systems were designated as critical infrastructure by Jeh Johnson, the former homeland security secretary to President Barack Obama. The designation guarantees that states are given priority assistance when they request help and greater access to information on online vulnerabilities. The federal assistance is voluntary.

F.B.I.'s Urgent Request: Reboot Your Router to Stop Russia-Linked Malware,"Hoping to thwart a sophisticated malware system linked to Russia that has infected hundreds of thousands of internet routers, the F.B.I. has made an urgent request to anybody with one of the devices: Turn it off, and then turn it back on. The malware is capable of blocking web traffic, collecting information that passes through home and office routers, and disabling the devices entirely, the bureau announced on Friday.  A global network of hundreds of thousands of routers is already under the control of the Sofacy Group, the Justice Department said last week. That group, which is also known as A.P.T. 28 and Fancy Bear and believed to be directed by Russia's military intelligence agency, hacked the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 presidential election, according to American and European intelligence agencies. The F.B.I. has several recommendations for any owner of a small office or home office router. The simplest thing to do is reboot the device, which will temporarily disrupt the malware if it is present. Users are also advised to upgrade the device's firmware and to select a new secure password. If any remote-management settings are in place, the F.B.I. suggests disabling them. An analysis by Talos, the threat intelligence division for the tech giant Cisco, estimated that at least 500,000 routers in at least 54 countries had been infected by the malware, which the F.B.I. and cybersecurity researchers are calling VPNFilter. Among the affected networking equipment it found during its research were devices from manufacturers including Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear and TP-Link. To disrupt the Sofacy network, the Justice Department sought and received permission to seize the web domain toknowall.com, which it said was a critical part of the malware's ""command-and-control infrastructure."" Now that the domain is under F.B.I. control, any attempts by the malware to reinfect a compromised router will be bounced to an F.B.I. server that can record the I.P. address of the affected device. ""This court-ordered seizure will assist in the identification of victim devices and disrupts the ability of these hackers to steal personal and other sensitive information and carry out disruptive cyberattacks,"" Scott W. Brady, United States attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said in the Justice Department statement. The analysis by Talos noted significant similarities between VPNFilter's computer code and ""versions of the BlackEnergy malware -- which was responsible for multiple large-scale attacks that targeted devices in Ukraine."" In Talos's assessment, the threats posed by VPNFilter extend far beyond the personal problems created by stolen passwords: Under the right circumstances, an attack could have a global reach. ""The malware has a destructive capability that can render an infected device unusable,"" it said, ""which can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide.""

"Apple to Plug IPhone Port, Hiding Data From Police","Follow Jack Nicas on Twitter: @jacknicas. SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple has long positioned the iPhone as a secure device that only its owner can open. That has led to battles with law enforcement officials who want to get information off them, including a well-publicized showdown with the F.B.I. in 2016 after Apple refused to help open the locked iPhone of a mass killer. The F.B.I. eventually paid a third party to get into the phone, circumventing the need for Apple's help. Since then, law enforcement agencies across the country have increasingly employed that strategy to get into locked iPhones they hope will hold the key to cracking cases.    Now Apple is closing the technological loophole that let authorities hack into iPhones, angering police and other officials and reigniting a debate over whether the government has a right to get into the personal devices that are at the center of modern life.    Apple said it was planning an iPhone software update that would effectively disable the phone's charging and data port -- the opening where users plug in headphones, power cables and adapters -- an hour after the phone is locked. While a phone can still be charged, a person would first need to enter the phone's password to transfer data to or from the device using the port.   Such a change would hinder law enforcement officials, who have typically been opening locked iPhones by connecting another device running special software to the port, often days or even months after the smartphone was last unlocked. News of Apple's planned software update has begun spreading through security blogs and law enforcement circles -- and many in investigative agencies are infuriated.   ''If we go back to the situation where we again don't have access, now we know directly all the evidence we've lost and all the kids we can't put into a position of safety,'' said Chuck Cohen, who leads an Indiana State Police task force on internet crimes against children. The Indiana State Police said it unlocked 96 iPhones for various cases this year, each time with a warrant, using a $15,000 device it bought in March from a company called Grayshift.   But privacy advocates said Apple would be right to fix a security flaw that has become easier and cheaper to exploit. ''This is a really big vulnerability in Apple's phones,'' said Matthew D. Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. A Grayshift device sitting on a desk at a police station, he said, ''could very easily leak out into the world.''   In an email, an Apple spokesman, Fred Sainz, said the company is constantly strengthening security protections and fixes any vulnerability it finds in its phones, partly because criminals could also exploit the same flaws that law enforcement agencies use. ''We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don't design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs,'' he said.   Apple and Google, which make the software in nearly all of the world's smartphones, began encrypting their mobile software by default in 2014. Encryption scrambles data to make it unreadable until accessed with a special key, often a password. That frustrated police and prosecutors who could not pull data from smartphones, even with a warrant.   The friction came into public view after the F.B.I. could not access the iPhone of a gunman who, along with his wife, killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., in late 2015. A federal judge ordered Apple to figure out how to open the phone, prompting Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, to respond with a blistering 1,100-word letter that said the company refused to compromise its users' privacy. ''The implications of the government's demands are chilling,'' he wrote.   The two sides fought in court for a month. Then the F.B.I. abruptly announced that it had found an undisclosed group to get into the phone, paying at least $1.3 million because the hacking techniques were not common then. An inspector general's report this year suggested the F.B.I. should have exhausted more options before it took Apple to court.   Since then, two main companies have helped law enforcement hack into iPhones: Cellebrite, an Israeli forensics firm purchased by Japan's Sun Corporation in 2006, and Grayshift, which was founded by a former Apple engineer in 2016. Law enforcement officials said they generally send iPhones to Cellebrite to unlock, with each phone costing several thousand dollars to open. In March, Grayshift began selling a $15,000 GrayKey device that the police can use to unlock iPhones themselves.   Apple has closed loopholes in the past. For years, the police used software to break into phones by simply trying every possible passcode. Apple blocked that technique in 2010 by disabling iPhones after a certain number of incorrect attempts. But the Grayshift and Cellebrite software appear to be able to disable that Apple technology, allowing their devices to test thousands of passcodes, Mr. Green said.   Cellebrite declined to comment. Grayshift did not respond to requests for comment.   Opening locked iPhones through these methods has become more common, law enforcement officials said. Federal authorities, as well as large state and local police departments, typically have access to the tools, while smaller local agencies enlist the state or federal authorities to help on high-profile cases, they said.   Law enforcement agencies that have purchased a GrayKey device include the Drug Enforcement Administration, which bought an advanced model this year for $30,000, according to public records. Maryland's state police have one, as do police departments in Portland, Ore., and Rochester, Minn., according to records.   Hillar Moore, the district attorney in Baton Rouge, La., said his office had paid Cellebrite thousands of dollars to unlock iPhones in five cases since 2017, including an investigation into the hazing-related death of a fraternity pledge at Louisiana State University. He said the phones had yielded crucial information, and he was upset that Apple planned to close such a useful investigative avenue.   ''They are blatantly protecting criminal activity, and only under the guise of privacy for their clients,'' he said.   Michael Sachs, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said his office uses workarounds -- he declined to specify which -- to access locked iPhones several times a week. That has helped solve a series of cases in recent months, including by getting into an iPhone to find videos of a suspect sexually assaulting a child. The man was convicted this year.   In the first 10 months of 2017, the Manhattan district attorney's office said it had recovered and obtained warrants or consent to search 702 locked smartphones, two-thirds of which were iPhones. Smartphones running Google's Android software have been generally easier to access, partly because many older devices lack encryption.   The encryption on smartphones applies only to data stored solely on the phone. Companies like Apple and Google regularly give law enforcement officials access to the data that consumers back up on their servers, such as via Apple's iCloud service. Apple said that since 2013, it has responded to more than 55,000 requests from the United States government seeking information about more than 208,000 devices, accounts or financial identifiers.   The tussle over encrypted iPhones and opening them to help law enforcement is unlikely to simmer down. Federal officials have renewed a push for legislation that would require tech companies like Apple to provide the police with a backdoor into phones, though they were recently found to be overstating the number of devices they could not access.   Apple probably won't make it any easier for the police if not forced by Congress, given that it has made the privacy and security of iPhones a central selling point. But the company has complied with local laws that conflict with its privacy push. In China, for instance, Apple recently began storing its Chinese customers' data on Chinese-run servers because of a new law there.   Apple's latest move is part of a longer cat-and-mouse game between tech companies and law enforcement, said Michelle Richardson, an analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which supports protections for online privacy.   ''People always expected there would be this back-and-forth -- that government would be able to hack into these devices, and then Apple would plug the hole and hackers would find another way in,'' she said.

The S.E.C. Dusts Off a Never-Used Cyber Enforcement Tool; Another View,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines -- and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Five years ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring investment firms to pay attention to identity theft. It never enforced it -- until late last month. In a cease-and-desist order against Voya Financial Advisors, the investment advisory unit of Voya Financial, the commission used the ""Identity Theft Red Flags Rule"" to censure the firm for allowing hackers to access social security numbers, account balances and even details of client investment accounts.  The S.E.C.'s action should set off alarm bells for every financial firm and board of directors under the agency's watch. Most companies are probably not in compliance with the rule and, given the agency's increased focus on cybersecurity, they should move quickly to address any issues. The rule -- originally part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul -- calls for investment firms to maintain an up-to-date program for preventing identity theft, which should provide ""red flags"" or other warning signs when hackers might be trying to steal customer information. The rule also requires that a firm's board of directors or senior leadership team administer the program. The S.E.C.'s charges in the Voya case were so egregious that it might explain why the agency finally dusted off the rule. In fact, Voya's violation was deemed ""willful"" by the commission. For six days in 2016, cybercriminals called the firm's helpline and impersonated Voya's independent investment representatives -- the staff members who make up the largest segment of the firm's work force. Even though Voya's system flagged some of the telephone numbers used by the hackers as potentially fraudulent, the callers were able to convince Voya's helpline staff to reset their passwords and provide new ones over the phone, according to the S.E.C. The intruders used the new passwords to gain access to the personal information of 5,600 customers and create new online customer profiles. The hackers were able to change customer phone numbers and addresses so account statements and confirmations would be rerouted without triggering a fraud alert. In several instances, hackers used ""@yopmail.com,"" a disposable email service that lets users create temporary email address, to review incoming emails and then destroy everything, without automated verification messages being sent to the real customer. Surprisingly, Voya had an identity theft program in place for nearly a decade before the incident, but the program languished. It was never updated and fell far below the requirements of the regulation. It was not approved by the firm's board of directors or senior leaders, as is required, and was ignored by Voya's security team. In the settlement -- in which Voya did not admit or deny the charges -- the S.E.C. ordered the company to clean up a long list of data security issues. The agency for the first time also mandated a consultant to monitor the company's compliance with the red flags rule. It's likely that few companies and even fewer boards are aware of the rule. Many are familiar with the S.E.C.'s general data safe security regulation and its guidance to public companies about disclosing cybersecurity risks and data breaches. But the red flags rule -- for all its timeliness and importance -- has been ignored. Over the past few years, the S.E.C. has made cybersecurity a priority. Earlier this year, it updated its guidance to public companies, telling them to reduce cybersecurity risk factors and improve data breach disclosures. And in April, the S.E.C. pursued its first-ever cybersecurity enforcement action against Yahoo after the company failed to disclose for more than two years that hackers had made off with the personal information of more than 500 million users. Altaba, the company that has since purchased Yahoo, was fined $35 million for the tardy disclosure. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that the S.E.C. is toughening its stance on data security issues. Although the S.E.C. only hit Voya with a symbolic $1 million fine, it's doubtful that the agency will be as forgiving in the future. The penalty could be a mere starting point, with future fines quickly escalating. The choice for investment firms and their boards is clear: Shore up identity theft programs or risk increasingly serious consequences.

How the U.S. Is Fighting Russian Election Interference,"WASHINGTON -- Senior Trump administration officials warned on Thursday that Russia is trying to interfere in November's midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election and vowed to combat Moscow's aggression. The high-profile alarm sounded at the daily White House briefing was striking for the officials' unequivocal warnings, a departure from President Trump's fumbling acknowledgments that Moscow undertook an influence campaign in 2016 to exploit partisan divisions in the American electorate and sow discord. ""This is a threat we need to take extremely seriously and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus,"" said the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.  Here is what you need to know about Russia's interference and American efforts to fight it. How is Russia interfering with American elections? Russia is trying to spread propaganda on hot-button issues using social media, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has said, highlighting what he called persistent and pervasive efforts. Moscow's strategy, he said, is to exacerbate sociopolitical divisions. Mr. Coats again singled out Russia on Thursday, saying its disinformation campaign is ongoing. ""We continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States,"" Mr. Coats said at the White House. Mr. Wray also cited attempts to manipulate news stories, spread disinformation and escalate divisive issues. Intelligence and law enforcement officials are also looking out for voter suppression efforts, illegal campaign financing, hacks targeting elected officials and voting infrastructure, he said. Which threats are most pervasive? The target of most Russian activity, intelligence officials say, is social media and other digital avenues for spreading disinformation. Facebook said this week that it had shut down 32 pages and accounts suspected of having ties to Russia. As for computer security, experts see political campaigns as vulnerable, particularly in state and local elections, where campaigns frequently lack the money and expertise to forestall attacks. Microsoft detected spear-phishing attacks, apparently by Russian intelligence, targeting computers of two 2018 election candidates, a senior company official said last month; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat seeking re-election, said last week that her Senate office computer network was one of them. ""I hope I'm wrong. But I think we'll see attacks on campaigns in which the Russians in particular have already stolen information,"" said Eric Rosenbach, an intelligence veteran and cybersecurity expert at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Nationally, the two major political parties stepped up security after the 2016 breach of computers at the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Voting machines, often described as old, insecure and lacking a paper trail, are more secure than widely understood. Four in five Americans vote on machines that incorporate paper ballots or backups. Many state voter-registration databases also have been hardened against outside attack since 2016. While it is possible to hack voting devices to rig an election, experts say, intruding into enough of them to change the outcome would be extremely difficult. How are ballots being secured? Election officials and the Department of Homeland Security set up a council to coordinate the response to threats, and the department offers security scans, equipment and other services to election officials nationwide. Top state election officials are gaining security clearances to see and assess threats, and in February, all 50 states and more than 1,000 localities opened a center to exchange data. Virtually every state has taken steps to lock down its election processes. A public-private committee has also approved a new standard for voting equipment that will significantly improve security. More voting machines than ever have verifiable paper backups, and nearly all should have them by 2020, said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. States also are adopting more advanced auditing techniques for vote counts. What are intelligence agencies doing? The most important work the intelligence community has done, according to current and former officials, is to penetrate foreign networks and spy on Russian groups conducting the attacks. The agencies have also monitored networks in the United States to try to detect information campaigns as they begin. ""They are gathering intelligence,"" said Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department official who is now a partner at Perkins Coie. ""They are trying to figure out what our adversaries are planning and what is being done. That includes penetrating foreign networks and other kinds of spying they do. And they are doing surveillance on U.S. networks to detect influence of all kinds."" Intelligence agencies are working more closely with technology companies, though some firms have said too little intelligence has been shared, hampering Silicon Valley's efforts to detect threats and warn Americans. Mr. Coats has said the intelligence agencies and White House consider threats to the electoral system a top priority. Mr. Coats has called not just on technology companies to boost protections but also to make sure Americans take steps to verify the information they consume. ""It is essential that we all apply critical thinking to all sorts of information,"" he said. Mr. Coats's appearance at the White House was important for informing the public, said Laura Rosenberger, a former Obama administration official and the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. ""Building resiliency in the population is really important to inoculate against the effect of some of this,"" she said. What else should the agencies be doing? Cybersecurity experts praised Thursday's briefing as an important step to bringing high-level focus to the fight against interference. But they said that to deter Russia, Moscow needs to believe that the United States will impose costs beyond the sanctions and other punishments it has doled out, and that requires Mr. Trump to make clear he will act against interference. ""If you are going to stop what is going on, that could require a presidential-level decision,"" Mr. Sussman said.

IBM Takes Cybersecurity Training on the Road,"Two years ago, IBM opened one of the nation's first commercial cybersecurity ranges in Cambridge, Mass., to let companies practice responding to simulated cyberattacks. It describes the experience as ""a game of Clue mixed with a Disney roller-coaster ride."" In a windowless bunker packed with a data center, wall-to-wall monitors, atmospheric controls, dozens of work stations and a functional TV studio, participants have about four hours to investigate and respond to a fictional data breach. It's like an escape room for security nerds. The experience proved so popular -- about 2,000 people, including chief executives and entire corporate boards, have played IBM's game, which has an eight-month waiting list -- that IBM decided to build a second range. But this time, it's going mobile.  The move is a reflection of the extent to which the threat of cyberattacks has captured the attention of organizations of all kinds, including the technology companies Facebook and Google, banks, military installations and those who run industrial control systems, like electricity and water providers. Tampering was a major issue in the election of President Trump, of course, and is cause for concern as the midterm elections approach. While companies are scrambling to get up to speed, they can't always send an entire team away for a few days of training on how to spot and respond to a cyberattack. Starting Monday the company is introducing its mobile cyber command center, tucked into a heavily customized semitrailer truck. What IBM calls its ""cyber tactical operations center"" will make stops at college campuses and security-focused events before heading to Europe for a lengthy tour. Officially, the trailer is intended for cybersecurity education and as a mobile response unit. Unofficially, it's also a playground packed with tech bling where geeks can experiment with ways to combat cyberattacks that have yet to be imagined. ""People have put all kinds of cool things into trailers, but nobody has ever put a cyber command center into one before,"" said Caleb Barlow, a vice president at IBM Security, where he leads the companys X-Force Threat Intelligence organization and created the Cambridge range. Touch screens displaying real-time threat monitoring -- preferably with as many blinking charts and scary graphics as possible -- are a must in any cyber war room. For the truck, IBM bought a 12-foot-long exterior screen that it said was one of the largest high-definition displays ever mounted to a vehicle. It also crammed in 20,000 feet of networking cable, two satellite dishes with cellular links, a generator-fueled power plant and a light tower with the intensity of 60 car headlights. Its data center, stuffed with server racks and multimedia controls, fits into a space the size of a large refrigerator. ""This is toward the upper end of the most complicated trailers we've ever built,"" said Mike Galvin, a sales manager for Featherlite, a manufacturer in Cresco, Iowa, that makes specialty trailers for emergency responders, mobile medical clinics and Nascar teams. On the road, the truck looks like any other shipping trailer hauling goods. But when it parks, it unfolds and triples its size. Beneath an extended canopy, IBM can unfurl a command post with 22 Mac-equipped work stations and a six-seat conference room. The main training room closely resembles IBM's Cambridge range, with touch-screen monitors on three walls showing charts, video clips and forensic material like snippets of malicious computer code. From a tablet, IBM's employees can adjust the room's displays. A tap on the tablet's ""breaking news"" button shifts the room's lighting from a soothing blue to urgent red. ""It helps us get the cortisol going,"" Mr. Barlow said. ""People react unconsciously to the visual cues."" Cyber ranges take their inspiration from the military. Just as soldiers train in simulated environments for the conditions they might face in battle, cyber defenders regularly practice on virtual networks. A growing number of companies participate in cyber war games and stage mock attacks to test their defenses. But few have the resources to build their own training arenas -- a gap that security vendors are eager to fill. The companies Cyberbit and SimSpace make custom virtual ranges, and the military contractor Raytheon opened a 30,000-square-foot ""live fire"" range in 2015 for its customers. Sean McKee, a senior cyber threat manager for TD Bank, visited IBM's Cambridge range this year and was intrigued enough to plan a two-day training exercise there in December for 40 TD Bank employees. The bank tests its crisis management plans at least once a year, incorporating everyone from front-line responders to its top executives, but its capabilities are less immersive than IBM's, Mr. McKee said. In IBM's training game, if an executive bungles a media interview, the range's TV screens show the company's stock price plunging as customers fire off angry Tweets. (Clips from Equifax's widely criticized response to a data breach that exposed sensitive information on more than 145 million people are prominently featured in IBM's presentation.) ""People immediately get to see the results of their actions,"" Mr. McKee said. ""It gives them a sense that there are other forces at play here and the decisions you make in a moment of crisis are going to have a lasting impact on your organization."" Cybersecurity has become one of corporate America's most pressing challenges, especially for companies that hold money or sensitive personal details. At least $445 billion was lost last year to cybercrime, a global economic study found, and an estimated 11 billion records have been stolen in data breaches, according to data compiled by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Regulators, lawmakers and corporate customers have responded with more stringent requirements that companies improve their defenses and practice their crisis-response plans for handling significant attacks. ""We've had growing demand from boards and C-suites, and it's hard to get those people out to Cambridge,"" Mr. Barlow said. ""This is a way to bring training to them."" At the debut in Brooklyn, IBM plans to show off its new mobile system at a customer conference. Next week, it will head to the National Mall in Washington for a training event tied to efforts to prevent election hacking, and in November, it's going to the Rochester Institute of Technology for a national penetration testing competition for college students. IBM is still figuring out exactly what it will do with its new toy. The truck is a fully functional command center, Mr. Barlow said. It could, in theory, be sent to large events -- IBM works on cybersecurity for the United States Open and Wimbledon tennis tournaments -- to handle real-time threat response. But its main purpose will be training. IBM plans to re-create its Cambridge mock-attack scenarios and build custom exercises for companies looking to test their skills. Mr. McKee, a former Canadian army officer, said that his bank, like many, had responded to escalating threats by increasing the pace and complexity of its training exercises. TD Bank's session in December at the Cambridge range will mix technical challenges for the bank's security incident response team with legal, public relations and privacy trials for its top executives. ""I always run these exercises with the caveat that this is not a test,"" he said. ""A test is pass or fail. If you have certain areas where you go down in a flaming ball of fire, that's a success. You found a critical vulnerability in your response."" PHOTO: IBM on Monday is introducing its mobile cybercommand center, tucked into a heavily customized truck.

"U.S. Condemns Russia for Cyberattack, Showing Split in Stance on Putin","WASHINGTON -- The United States on Thursday joined Britain in formally blaming Russia for a huge cyberattack last June that was aimed at Ukraine but crippled computers worldwide, a highly public naming-and-shaming exercise that could further fray relations with Moscow. The White House threatened unspecified ""international consequences"" for the attack, which it said ""was part of the Kremlin's ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict.""  The statement, issued by the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the attack, known by the name NotPetya, was ""reckless and indiscriminate"" and spread rapidly, ""causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the Americas."" NotPetya, which had the characteristics of a ransomware attack, had been widely identified by cybersecurity experts as coming from Russia, so the attribution was no surprise. But the decision of the United States and Britain to nearly simultaneously condemn the Russian military is noteworthy. It underscores the dichotomy between the administration's consistently tough stance toward Russia on issues involving Ukraine and President Trump's continued reluctance to criticize President Vladimir V. Putin over anything else. In December, the White House approved the sale of lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military for its battle against Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine. Yet Mr. Trump continues to soft-pedal allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, even after the nation's intelligence agencies concluded that it did -- an assessment that intelligence chiefs reiterated in Senate testimony this week. Administration officials declined to say what steps the United States would take against Russia. But they could include both sanctions against Russian officials involved in the attack and covert measures -- any of which would be likely to fray an already fragile relationship. The administration's public statement echoed one in mid-December when it publicly blamed North Korea for a damaging ransomware attack known as Wannacry. In that case, however, the United States did not follow up with stiff penalties, in part because North Korea was already under heavy sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. ""President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea, to change their behavior,"" the homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said at the time. ""So we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure."" Punishing other nations for cyberattacks has proven exceedingly difficult, particularly when the players are as sophisticated as North Korea and Russia. The Russian government flatly denied the allegations that it carried out the attack. ""We think they have no basis and no foundation, and this is nothing else but the continuation of the Russo-phobic campaign,"" the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. The administration had planned to issue the statement a day earlier to coincide with that of the British, according to a senior official, but delayed it after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The White House statement made no mention of an embarrassing related fact: The NotPetya attacks took advantage of vulnerabilities identified by the National Security Agency and then made public by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. The Shadow Brokers, which some officials believe to be a front for Russian intelligence, obtained many of the N.S.A.'s most valuable hacking tools, either by breaking into the agency's computer networks or with the help of an insider. The group has posted much of the stolen malware on the web; North Korea's hackers probably used the tools in their attack. In a ransomware attack, the victim's files are encrypted, locking them out of their own computer systems, until they pay a ransom. Cybersecurity researchers estimate that criminals made more than $1 billion through these attacks last year, with victims ranging from the chief executives of major companies to small businesses and private individuals. While the motive for many ransomware attacks is financial, Russia's involvement suggests it was part of a broader strategy to destabilize Ukraine that dates back to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The NotPetya attack originated in Ukraine, according to security researchers, apparently timed to strike a day before a holiday marking the 1996 adoption of Ukraine's first constitution. It eventually spread to 64 countries, including Poland, Germany, Italy, and Russia itself. The administration's action came as intelligence agencies warned that Russia was already meddling in the American midterm elections, using bots and other fake accounts on social media to spread disinformation. ""We expect Russia to continue using propaganda, social media, false-flag personas, sympathetic spokespeople and other means of influence to try to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States,"" Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee at its annual hearing on worldwide threats. ""There should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,"" Mr. Coats added.

How Local Governments Can Prevent Cyberattacks; Op-Ed Contributor,"The recent cyberattack on Atlanta, in which the municipal government's computers and related services were held hostage by a ransomware attack, is a reminder that local governments are particularly vulnerable to these and other cyberthreats. Local governments of all sizes and locations now own and operate a wide and growing array of internet-connected technology systems: employee-issued laptops, motion sensors on light poles and under pavement, mapping and informational systems inside police cars, online citizen-engagement tools and much more. Most local governments in the United States don't have a strong grasp of the policies and procedures they should implement to protect their technology systems from attacks. This is especially concerning because the threat of a cyberattack is the most important cybersecurity problem they face, according to a survey conducted by the organization I work for, the International City/County Management Association, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.  Forty-four percent of local governments report that they regularly face cyberattacks, on either an hourly or daily basis. More troubling is the high percentage of governments that do not know how often they are attacked (28 percent) or breached (41 percent). Further, a majority of local governments do not catalog or count attacks (54 percent). This is not just an American problem. Last month, at a conference in Tel Aviv, Tamir Pardo, the former head of Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, said that most local government leaders around the world do not fully understand how serious a threat cyberattacks are and have not imaginatively assessed the consequences of inaction. He described cyberthreats as ""soft nuclear weapons"" that one day may be used to start and finish a war without firing a shot. So what should local governments do to improve their cybersecurity apparatus to help prevent or mitigate damage from future attacks like the one experienced in Atlanta, or from those contemplated by Mr. Pardo? First, local leaders must create a culture of cybersecurity that imagines worst-case scenarios and explores a range of solutions to mitigate threats to the ecosystem of local government technology. This should involve prioritizing funding for cybersecurity, establishing stronger cybersecurity policies and training employees in cybersecurity protocols. Success will require collaboration with local elected officials, internet-technology and cybersecurity staff members, department managers and end users. Cybersecurity is more than just the I.T. department's problem. It must now also be a top priority along the entire chain of elected and appointed officials in and around local governments. Preventing and mitigating the effects of future attacks will require intergovernmental cooperation, because localities work together across state lines and collaborate with the federal government on crucial tasks like running elections, managing transportation and sharing intelligence. Most technological advances are transforming local governments for the better, moving them from inefficient and costly paper systems to digital systems that allow for better analysis and understanding of policy decisions. The science of analytics and big data promises even greater leaps for local governments in evidence-based policymaking. These exciting developments may one day radically alter the ways that traditional local government services are financed, operated and managed. But we cannot get lost in the excitement. We must actively prepare for cyberthreats of the sort that have been demonstrated in places like Atlanta. If smart cities and communities are the brightly lit days of the increasingly connected world of local government technology, cyberattacks are the dark and stormy nights. We don't need to halt technological deployments and evolution, but we do need to recognize that cybersecurity is an essential counterpart. Tad McGalliard is the director of research and policy at the International City/County Management Association.  PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Ariel Davis FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) "
Facebook Curbs Coming (Thank the E.U.),"Next month, a comprehensive new data protection law goes into effect in the European Union, placing greater requirements on how companies like Facebook and Google handle users' personal information. It also strengthens individuals' rights to control the collection and use of their data. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said his company would offer its users all over the world the same privacy controls required under the European law.     What would that look like for Facebook users? That is still a work in progress. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company would provide more details about its plans in the coming weeks.   In the meantime, here are some of the general requirements and rights under the new European law. Although some of the practical steps that companies must take are still being worked out, several European privacy and consumer advocates, who had pushed for the new law, offered their thoughts on what Facebook might need to do to extend the protections to its users worldwide.   Minimizing Data Collection   The European law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, requires companies to collect and store only the minimum amount of user data needed to provide a specific, stated service. That means a flashlight app should not be asking users for access to their photos or contacts.   Anna Fielder, a senior policy adviser at Britain-based Privacy International, said she thought the new law would require the social network to change certain advertising and other settings to make privacy, and not sharing, the default. Currently, the company makes certain user profile details public by default. And the default advertising settings allow targeted ads based on a user's relationship status, employer, job title, education and use of websites and apps.   Facebook currently has controls that allow users to choose who can see their posts. There is also a ''privacy checkup'' feature where users can adjust their sharing settings.   In a statement in response to questions, Rob Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said, ''We need to do more to keep people informed and in control.'' He noted that the company had recently introduced a new ''privacy shortcuts'' menu that centralized major privacy, security and ad settings. ''These are just a few small steps and there's more to come,'' he said.   Obtaining Users' Consent   The European law requires companies like Facebook and Google to use clear and plain language to explain how they will use their users' personal details. The companies must also provide information about what other kinds of entities users' data will be shared with. Digital platforms must also obtain consent from individuals for many uses of their data.   When companies want to use individuals' data for a new purpose, they must explain that new purpose and obtain users' permission. And companies must get special permission from users to collect and use sensitive details like health information, unless that data is clearly related to the purpose of the service, such as a diabetes management app.   That means Facebook will probably need to rework its data policy and terms of service, said Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad, director of digital policy at the Norwegian Consumer Council, a nonprofit group in Oslo. He added that he thought the law would also require Facebook to give users more ''real choices, not take it or leave.'' The current data policy requires people who sign up for the social network to allow Facebook to, among other things, track them on many other apps and websites.   Mr. Sherman, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, said that Facebook was updating its terms of service and data policy to ensure that it complied with the new European law. Those updates cover users worldwide, with legal variations in some places.   Algorithmic Decision-Making   The European law gives individuals the right not to be subject to completely automated decisions which significantly affect them. These decisions could include credit algorithms that use an individual's data to decide whether a bank should grant him or her a loan.   Privacy International said the clause on automated decisions could allow consumers to challenge Facebook practices like political advertising, which can be sent to users based on algorithms, because the ads are meant to sway users' votes.   Facebook currently has a section called ''Your Ad Preferences'' that allows users to opt out of seeing ads based on their relationship status, employer, education, interests, and use of websites and apps. Users can also hide ads related to three topics -- alcohol, pets and parenting -- or suggest a topic they would rather not see ads about.   Accessing Data About You   The European law gives people the right obtain a copy of the records that companies hold about them.   Facebook already allows users to download a copy of their information -- such as the messages they have sent on the service and the status updates they have posted.   At the end of March, the company announced new tools to let its users see and delete information such as their friend requests and their Facebook searches.   But if Facebook wants to offer European-level privacy protection to all, it would also need to provide its users with the data that Facebook itself collected or created about them, including any categories, descriptions or behavior scores Facebook assigned to them, European privacy experts said. And it should provide users who seek their own records with any data that Facebook has obtained from tracking them around the web as well as any data that Facebook obtained about them from third parties, like data brokers, they said.   ''You exercise your access rights and you have the right to know everything about you,'' said Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor who oversees an independent European Union authority that advises on privacy-related laws and policies.    "
Mark Zuckerberg Has a Lot of Homework to Do,"Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg -- or perhaps more accurately, members of his staff -- are going to be very busy getting through a stack of homework. Over two days of Congressional hearings this week in which Mr. Zuckerberg was barraged with questions by lawmakers over data privacy, election interference and more, the 33-year-old billionaire was often not able to provide an immediate answer. His standard response in those situations, a variation of ''my team will get back to you,'' was repeated so often it became an internet meme.    Here are all the things that Mr. Zuckerberg has committed to getting back to Congress on. Yes, it's a long list.   To Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa ...    Improper transfer of data to third parties   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on whether his team finds any new examples in which user data was improperly transferred to a third party in breach of Facebook's terms of service. He also said he would get back to Mr. Grassley on how many outside developers his team has audited to make sure they are following Facebook's rules.   To Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California ...   Number of fake accounts   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would follow up with Ms. Feinstein on the exact number of fake accounts Facebook has removed from the social network.   To Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington ...   Role with Cambridge Analytica and Donald J. Trump's campaign   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Ms. Cantwell on whether Facebook employees ever worked with Cambridge Analytica to help the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.   To Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi ...   Data on minors and tracking of browsing activity   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would circle back to Mr. Wicker on whether Facebook collects call and text history on minors, and whether or not Facebook tracks a user's internet browsing activity even when they have logged off Facebook.   To Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont ...   Russian misinformation operations   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would tell Mr. Leahy whether a number of specific pages were part of Russian misinformation operations during the 2016 elections.   To Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina ...   Tech regulation   Mr. Zuckerberg's to-do item was answering how to have a broad discussion on where the tech industry should be regulated.   To Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri ...   Data collection from logged-off devices   The Facebook chief said he would get back to Mr. Leahy on whether the company collects data from devices that are not currently logged in to the social network.   To Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut ...   Support for legislation   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would follow up with Mr. Blumenthal on whether Facebook would support a number of pieces of legislation. (It was unclear which legislation.)   To Senator Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts ...   Privacy bill of rights for minors   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get his team to ''flesh out the details'' with Mr. Markey on a potential privacy bill of rights for minors on the internet.   To Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico ...   Support for the Honest Ads Act   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Mr. Udall on whether he, personally, would return to Congress to support the Honest Ads Act. (Mr. Zuckerberg added that he didn't visit Washington often and that he would likely direct his team to focus on support of the act.)   To Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas ...   Investigating unauthorized data access   The Facebook chief said he would circle back on whether Facebook's new bounty program on data sharing will also investigate unauthorized access to data.   To Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada ...   Nevadans whose data was harvested; keeping of user data   Mr. Zuckerberg had two to-do items with Mr. Heller, including answering how many people in the state of Nevada were part of the 87 million people who may have had their data harvested by the political research firm Cambridge Analytica and how long Facebook keeps a user's data after they have deleted their accounts.   To Representative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey ...   Changing default settings   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would return with answers for Mr. Pallone on whether Facebook would change its default settings to minimize collection and use of user data.   To Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan ...   Political ad rejection   The Facebook chief said he would follow up on the circumstances behind the company's rejection of a political ad from a candidate for Michigan state senate.   To Representative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York ...   Artificial intelligence tools   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to Mr. Engel on artificial intelligence tools and other procedures being deployed to identify fake accounts that spread misinformation.   To Representative Gene Green, Democrat of Texas ...   Application of European data protection rules   Mr. Zuckerberg's homework for Mr. Green was answering how Facebook would apply the European Union's coming General Data Protection Regulation privacy rules to users in the United States.   To Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana ...   Data for security; Facebook censorship   Mr. Zuckerberg told Mr. Scalise he would come back with details about data that is mined for security purposes and whether it is sold, as well as whether Facebook employees responsible for the perceived censorship of the pro-Trump video personalities Diamond and Silk faced repercussions.   To Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington ...   Content reviewers' treatment of users   The Facebook chief said he would offer Ms. Rodgers more detail on how Facebook is ensuring fair treatment of users by content reviewers.   To Representative G.K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina ...   Racial diversity in technology   Mr. Zuckerberg said he would circle back on an idea to convene a meeting of chief executives of technology firms to boost racial diversity in the industry. He added that he would get back to Mr. Butterfield with data on employee retention broken out by race.   To Representative Morgan Griffith, Republican of Virginia ...   More rural broadband   Mr. Zuckerberg promised to look into the progress on extending broadband into rural areas.   To Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan ...   Numbers of Facebook buttons; response to regulators   Facebook's chief said he would follow up with the number of Facebook ''like'' buttons and ''share buttons'' on non-Facebook pages. He also said he would get back to the Congresswoman on the time frame within which Facebook would respond to regulators' requests for transparency.   To Representative Ben LujÁn, Democrat of New Mexico ...   Data points on non-Facebook users   Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to circle back on the average number of data points that Facebook keeps on non-Facebook users. Mr. Zuckerberg also said he did not know that number for Facebook users.   To Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey ...   Supporting online privacy legislation   Mr. Lance, who is co-sponsoring a online privacy bill with Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, asked Mr. Zuckerberg whether Facebook will support the legislation after reviewing it. Mr. Zuckerberg said he would get back to him.   To Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois ...   Law enforcement requests   And finally, Mr. Zuckerberg said he could get back to Mr. Kinzinger about how Facebook handles requests made by law enforcement in foreign countries, particularly Russia.

"Privacy Issue Rises to Fore, Vindicating Data Experts","Follow Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @NellieBowles PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Doc Searls met with a group of fellow internet privacy experts one recent afternoon here at the Computer History Museum. On a whiteboard were the words ''OUTRAGE'' and ''MAKE HAY'' -- capitalized, underlined and surrounded by lines jutting in all directions like a cartoon ''BOOM!'' For the first time in years, their field of expertise was front and center. Facebook had just come under intense scrutiny over how the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly harvested the information of up to 87 million its users.    Seated in a wide circle of folding chairs, members of the group excitedly discussed what they could do next.    ''A lot of geeks in the world are looking at Facebook as a redwood that's starting to fall,'' said Mr. Searls, whose given name is David and who created ProjectVRM, a program at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society that seeks to empower internet users to protect personal privacy. ''They're saying, 'O.K., it's barn-raising time.' ''   The scandal swirling around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica has begun to usher in a new era for this once-ignored community of privacy researchers and developers. After years of largely disregarding their warnings about exactly what companies like Facebook were doing -- that is, collecting enormous amounts of information on its users and making it available to third parties with little to no oversight -- the general public suddenly seemed to care about what they were saying.   The outcry over data privacy has been so strong that it pushed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, into testifying on Capitol Hill this week over the company's failures to protect users' information. Protesters rallied outside the Capitol during his testimony. Someone even arrived at a hearing dressed as a Russian troll.   In their own lives, privacy experts are now fielding a spike in calls from their relatives asking them for advice about protecting their personal data. Engineers are discussing new privacy projects with them. Even teenagers are paying attention to what they have to say.   For many developers, this is the right time to push ahead with testing more privacy solutions, including more advanced advertising blockers; peer-to-peer browsers that decentralize the internet; new encryption techniques; and data unions that let users pool their data and sell it themselves. Others want to treat tech giants more as information fiduciaries, which have a legal responsibility to protect user data.   And for the first time, many privacy experts think internet users will be more willing to put up with a little more inconvenience in return for a lot more privacy.   ''This is the first blink of awakening of the world to a danger that's been present for a long time, which is that we are exposed,'' Mr. Searls said. ''Cambridge Analytica is old, old news to privacy folks.''   John Scott-Railton, who researches digital rights and privacy at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, said he recently thought back to all the PowerPoint presentations and papers he had given and seen that cautioned about how third parties might access and abuse user data.   ''It didn't stick until now,'' he said. ''Now it's changed, or at least people nod along when we talk about it.''   Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, recalled  the organization's years of efforts to get Facebook to monitor how third parties were using data. Yet few paid attention at the time, even though the group specifically called out Facebook's quizzes in 2009. (Cambridge Analytica used a third-party quiz app from an independent researcher to harvest Facebook users' data.)   The social network has said it will investigate many third-party apps that have had access to large amounts of users information. Nonetheless, the A.C.L.U. is pushing for users to have tighter control over what Facebook apps can do and arguing that Facebook ought to audit its developers. The organization also believes that more privacy protections should be enshrined in law.   ''We're having the conversation now that we should have had over a decade ago,'' Ms. Singh Guliani said.   Some privacy experts are prepared for disappointment. There have been privacy scandals before that did not lead to sea changes. For example, Google once collected private Wi-Fi information as it was building out Google Maps. The ensuing outrage did not have a lasting effect on the Silicon Valley company's vast data collection effort.   But this Facebook scandal seems to be enduring even in the new frenetic news cycle.   ''This has kept the national attention for what: three or four weeks now?'' said Allie Bohm, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit in Washington that promotes an open internet. ''It really feels like, hey, we could get some stuff done.''   One reason it has always been hard to get consumers interested in security and privacy is that the harms were vague and hard to understand. With Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, the harms are identifiable and frightening, said Ashkan Soltani, an independent researcher specializing in privacy and a former chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission.   ''Much like a car accident, the harms on social media are low-probablility events with extremely variable outcomes,'' he said. '' 'So what if my boss saw me doing a keg stand?' But all of a sudden the 'so what if' becomes more serious -- 'I get denied insurance or my information is used by a nation state actor to manipulate me.' ''   Cambridge Analytica's work, which included using Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, tapped into an anxiety many Americans already had over the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.   ''This one stuck because it was Trump, and we're looking for someone to blame,'' said Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer who runs the Schneier on Security blog and wrote ''Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.'' ''If Hellmann's mayonnaise did this, we'd be impressed.''   Privacy experts said this shift in public opinion was what they had been waiting for, because it is the only way to bring about change. Facebook will not willingly change its policies without pressure from shareholders or regulators, they added.   Historically, public opinion is ''the crucible'' for era-defining industry change, said Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a forthcoming book about tech platforms and power.   ''If you go back to the rapaciousness and lawlessness of Gilded Age capitalism, it was the slow burn of public opinion that gradually gathered force and ultimately became the driving force that provided cover for dramatic new legislative and regulatory efforts,'' she said. ''Public opinion gave the Gilded Age a beginning, a middle and an end.''   For Rohit Ghai, president of the cybersecurity firm RSA, whose SecurID technology has become an industry standard for companies protecting access to their internal systems, the change is evident even inside his home in San Jose, Calif.   He previously tried to talk to his 13-year-old daughter about data privacy and social media -- even providing examples of how much the tech companies know about people and what they can do with that information. She shrugged him off.   Then the Cambridge Analytica revelations happened. For once, Mr. Ghai said, his teenager came to talk to him.   ''She just asked me about Mark Zuckerberg,'' he said. ''That's a sign.''    "
Audit Approved of Facebook's Policies,"An auditing firm responsible for monitoring Facebook for federal regulators told them last year that the company had sufficient privacy protections in place, even after the social media giant lost control of a huge trove of user data that was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The assertion, by PwC, came in a report submitted to the Federal Trade Commission in early 2017. The report, a redacted copy of which is available on the commission's website, is one of several periodic reviews of Facebook's compliance with a 2011 federal consent decree, which required Facebook to take wide-ranging steps to prevent the abuse of users' information and to inform them how it was being shared with other companies.     The accounting firm, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, effectively gave Facebook a clean bill of health. ''Facebook's privacy controls were operating with sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect the privacy'' of users, said the assessment, which stretched from February 2015 to February 2017.   But during that period, Facebook was aware that a researcher based in Britain, Aleksandr Kogan, had provided Cambridge Analytica with private Facebook data from millions of users. Cambridge, which later worked for the Trump campaign, used the information to build psychological profiles of American voters before the 2016 election. Some details of Mr. Kogan's work -- though not the full scope of the data he had obtained -- were revealed in an article in The Guardian in late 2015.   Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged to lawmakers this month that the company had not informed users that Cambridge had acquired their data. In testimony before the Senate, he said the company had previously accepted Cambridge's assurances that it wasn't using Mr. Kogan's data and had deleted it.   ''We considered it a closed case,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said. ''In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake.''   An investigation by The New York Times, The Observer and The Guardian last month found that Cambridge had obtained the private data of more than 50 million users without their consent. Facebook has since estimated that as many as 87 million users were affected.   Like its competitors, PwC closely protects the inner workings of its review process. The public versions of the reports it submits to the F.T.C. redact both the names of the employees who performed the work and the tests the firm used to assess Facebook's privacy measures. It is not clear whether Facebook informed its auditors of the leak, or whether PwC knew about it.   In a statement, Facebook's deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said the company remained ''strongly committed to protecting people's information'' and appreciated ''the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.''   A spokeswoman for PwC declined to comment.   The firm's vetting of Facebook's privacy practices revives questions about how diligently federal officials were overseeing Facebook. Last month, The Times reported that the F.T.C.  was investigating whether Facebook had violated the consent decree.   ''Clearly, the F.T.C. needs to be more forthcoming with the contents of those reports,'' said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which advocates more stringent privacy protections. ''There is still too much that is not known about Facebook's business practices during that critical time period.''   The 2011 decree -- triggered in part by a complaint EPIC and other consumer groups filed -- followed a two-year investigation that found Facebook had routinely ignored its users' privacy preferences and shared their data without their permission. Besides demanding that Facebook give users more control over their data, the decree required the company to assess potential privacy risks. Facebook has acknowledged that it did not sufficiently police how third parties with access to its data, like Mr. Kogan, used the information.   F.T.C. officials hailed the consent decree as a new and powerful model for regulating tech giants like Facebook and Google, which in recent years have built immensely lucrative advertising businesses rooted in the vast quantities of data they collect from people who use their free services.   But critics of the agreement said it reflected the essential weakness of relying on an outside firm to evaluate Facebook's compliance with the order. The F.T.C. is a relatively small agency, where even major investigations are handled by teams of just a few people. Instead of retaining a large staff of technology and data experts to monitor businesses, the agency makes companies hire outside accounting and consulting firms. These are paid by companies like Facebook and periodically report back to the F.T.C.   According to the assessment documents, Facebook chooses which policies and procedures PwC reviews.   ''A conversation has to be had about how the F.T.C. handles these assessments,'' said Joseph Jerome, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, which is funded in part by Facebook and other tech companies. ''Facebook decides how they are being assessed. It really stacks the deck in their favor.''    "
"Europe's Data Rules Get Teeth, And Users Get More Rights","Follow Adam Satariano on Twitter: @satariano. LONDON -- In a couple of weeks, Europe will introduce some of the toughest online privacy rules in the world. The changes are aimed at giving internet users more control over what's collected and shared about them, and they punish companies that don't comply. Here's what it means for you.     What Are the New Rules?   On May 25, a new law called the General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect across the European Union.   The law strengthens individual privacy rights and, more important, it has teeth. Companies can be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue -- equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook.   The internet's grand bargain has long been trading privacy for convenience. Businesses offer free services like email, entertainment and search, and in return they collect data and sell advertising.   But recent privacy scandals involving Facebook and the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica highlight the downsides of that trade-off. The system is opaque and ripe for abuse.   Europe is attempting to push back.   It's too early to know how effective the law will be, but it is being closely watched by governments globally.   Will the Internet Look Different?   Not really.   Supporters of the law say it will bring sweeping changes to how companies operate online, but in reality, the effect on your internet experience will be minimal. An American visiting Europe, for example, isn't likely to see a difference.   If you live in one of the European Union's 28 member states, there is one change you may welcome -- you are likely to see fewer of those shoe or appliance ads that follow you around the internet after you do some online shopping.   As e-commerce became commonplace, a cottage industry sprang up to track people around the web and nudge them back to online stores to complete a purchase. Advertisers call these ads ''fine tuned,'' but most people consider them creepy, said Johnny Ryan, a researcher at PageFair, an ad-blocking service.   Mr. Ryan said the new rules would make it harder for ad-targeting companies to collect and sell information.   The new law requires companies to be transparent about how your data is handled, and to get your permission before starting to use it. It raises the legal bar that businesses must clear to target ads based on personal information like your relationship status, job or education, or your use of websites and apps.   That means online advertising in Europe could become broader, returning to styles more akin to magazines and television, where marketers have a less detailed sense of the audience.   What Are Your Rights?   Even if you don't notice big changes, the new law provides important privacy rights worth knowing about.   For instance, you can ask companies what information they hold about you, and then request that it be deleted. This applies not just to tech companies, but also to banks, retailers, grocery stores or any other organization storing your information. You can even ask your employer.   And if you suspect your information is being misused or collected unnecessarily, you can complain to your national data protection regulator, which must investigate.   Of course, an individual going up against a giant corporation like Google or Facebook isn't in a fair fight. The law has 11 chapters and 99 sub-articles, and just initiating a case can take as many as 20 steps, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry trade group.   But the new rules allow people to band together and file class-action style complaints, a legal approach that hasn't been as common in Europe as in the United States. Eager to exploit the new law, privacy groups are planning to file cases on behalf of groups of individuals. The hope is that a few successful lawsuits will have a ripple effect and lead companies to tighten up how they handle personal data.   The new law also ensures that you cannot be locked in to any service. Companies must make it possible for you to download your data and move it to a competitor. That could mean moving financial information from one bank to another, or transferring Spotify playlists to a rival streaming service.   What's With All These Privacy Notices?   In the weeks before the law goes into force, internet users have been receiving a stream of privacy policy updates in their inboxes -- grocery store loyalty programs, train services, even apps that parents use for youth soccer all have to set out what data they gather from you, and how they handle it.   The law requires that the terms and conditions be written in plain, understandable language, not legalese. Companies must also give you options to block information from being gathered.   But the deluge of emails is leading to concerns that users are agreeing without taking a closer look.   A similar reaction came after the European Union required companies, starting in 2011, to put warnings on websites alerting users that they were being tracked. The rules have led to so many pop-up disclosure boxes that people often consent just to make the warnings disappear.   Companies argue that they are being careful to comply with General Data Protection Regulation, but Giovanni Buttarelli, who oversees an independent European Union agency that advises on privacy-related policies, has been unimpressed.   He has criticized the wave of privacy policy emails as being posed in a ''take it or leave it'' manner that leaves users thinking they have to accept the terms in order to keep using a service, rather than letting people choose what information to share.   Mr. Buttarelli said the messages may violate the ''spirit'' of the law.   Will It Make a Difference?   It's too soon to tell.   That may be an unsatisfactory answer, but the long-term effects of the new law won't be known for years.   Much will depend on how strictly national regulators enforce the rules, and how they use their tight budgets. Data-protection agencies in each European Union country will be in charge of policing the companies that have European headquarters within its borders.   That oversight structure is leading to concerns that officials in countries such as Ireland, where Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and many other data-heavy companies are based, will be overmatched.   A lot of responsibility also falls on you to keep tabs on how companies use your data.   The General Data Protection Regulation provides ways to take action if your information is being misused. But the question is whether people care enough, or if trading privacy for convenience remains a worthwhile deal.    "
U.S. vs. Britain: How Much Of Your Data Can You Get?,"The European Union will put in place one of the toughest data privacy laws in the world this week. The law, among other things, gives people in Europe the right to obtain the personal data companies have on them. That is a sweeping right to data access that Americans don't have.    So we decided to conduct a privacy experiment: Request our data in both Britain and the United States, to get a sense of how easy it will be for people in Europe to access their personal information compared with people in the United States.   We conducted our experiment using a 20-year-old law in Britain that already entitles individuals to see the personal data held about them by companies in that country. We thought the test could serve as a trial run to see how the new European law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., might play out.    Natasha, a technology reporter in New York, and Prashant, an editor in London, requested their records in their respective countries from Amazon, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, their mobile providers and marketing analytics companies that profile users.   The results were not what we expected.    Expansive Data Points (in Britain) From Marketers   Prashant: Quantcast, an analytics service that categorizes and targets online users for marketing purposes, sent me a spreadsheet with about 200 entries tracking my activities . They contained an astonishing degree of detail about my life.   It showed that I had used OpenTable to make a dinner reservation in March at a ''casual'' Indian restaurant in London, that I had read a CNN article on President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, that I was looking to buy a new cellphone and was considering a trip to Stellenbosch, South Africa.   Then there were the 343 marketing classifications Quantcast had obtained about me from data brokers, companies that sell consumers' details for marketing purposes.   The categorizations had me pegged as a ''heavy spender'' on pet food (I have a cat), an owner of a flat-screen TV, and part of a ''likely nonsmoking household.'' My colleagues in London will be unsurprised to learn that among my ''interests'' are biscuits and chocolate.   But the report also suggested there was a 3 percent likelihood that I am a woman above the age of 65, and that I own a car. (I am, to be clear, a man in my 30s. I got my first driver's license a few months ago and do not own a car.)   Natasha: My spreadsheet from Quantcast contained just one single line of data: It showed that on Jan. 19 at 7:01 p.m., I read an article on Forbes.com about how Google was eliminating certain features for parents to control their children's web-browsing. The spreadsheet even listed the author of the article: Kevin Murnane.   As with all these companies, Prashant and I acted as much as possible like regular consumers when we initially requested our information. But after our requests, we followed up with the companies as reporters. When I contacted Quantcast to ask why I had received only one line of data, a spokesman said users' privacy settings could influence what details Quantcast collected. (I distrust online surveillance, and use various software tools to monitor tracking.)   The Quantcast spokesman added that the company responded to data access requests under European law. So sending me any data at all had been an error -- because consumers in the United States do not have a comprehensive right to obtain copies of the data held by American companies.   Amazon History (or Lack Thereof)   Prashant: A Kindle reader, a square cake pan, a carbon monoxide alarm.   Amazon sent lists of the items my wife and I had bought through the site, the credit cards we used to buy them, the addresses the items were shipped to and the devices we had used to access Amazon services.   But we had expected to receive a more substantial data trove from Amazon. So I wrote back to Amazon asking again for all of the details the company had on me, including our household's video-viewing data.   The company said it was ''investigating'' and would send the missing data when it was ready. There is still no sign of it. An Amazon spokesman added that the company was committed to complying with the new European privacy law.   Natasha: I used Amazon's self-service tool to download a copy of my purchase orders -- including batteries for the outmoded Blackberry phone that I was having trouble giving up in 2015. (I now own two iPhones.)   But I wanted the complete history of my account, such as my Amazon searches.   Amazon responded to my email request by telling me to call the company -- because it was ''not safe to get account details via email due to security reasons.'' Then I called Amazon customer service and was put on hold for 15 minutes while an agent scrambled to figure out a response.   Finally, the agent came back on the line only to tell me that Amazon was keeping records on me for business purposes -- but would not share them with me. ''It's all private,'' the agent said. ''I don't have access to that information to provide you unfortunately.''   Limited Data From Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn   Prashant and Natasha: LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook provide self-service tools for users to download certain information -- such as their posts and messages. Google offers a tool where users can download files of the Google searches they have made, as well as the sites Google has tracked them to, their YouTube history and Calendar data. We used these systems and obtained some of our information.   Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, recently told a Senate hearing that his company's download tool contains ''all of the information'' that users have ''put into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them.''   But Facebook actually collects much more data about its users. In addition to the updates and photos you submit to the site, for instance, Facebook collects data about users' activities on millions of non-Facebook sites that use tools like the service's Like button. And those tools allow the company to amass detailed information about users' web-browsing.   We were unable to obtain that kind of information, however.   We each asked Facebook for copies of our web-browsing data, as well as any data the company acquired about us from data brokers or other services. We made similar requests of Twitter and LinkedIn, which can also collect details about users' activities on other sites as well as personal details from third parties like employers or advertisers.   None provided us with copies of that raw information.   Instead, from LinkedIn, we each received emails directing us to use the company's self-service tool. Among other things, our LinkedIn downloads included the email addresses of our connections.   From Twitter, we received emails saying the company required copies of our government-issued I.D. cards before it would provide user details beyond those available from the company's self-service tool. Natasha, who regularly covers privacy, was hesitant to entrust Twitter with a copy of her I.D. card. Prashant sent his I.D. to Twitter and received data about a week later, soon after we contacted Twitter's press department. The new set of information included IP address logs, direct messages and every GIF he has ever posted (there were a lot).   Facebook told Natasha that its self-service data download tool ''has been reviewed by our data protection regulator'' and would allow her ''to access all of your Facebook data.'' The company told Prashant that the self-service tool would allow him to access only ''the Facebook information available to you'' and that the company ''isn't able to provide additional information.''   Matt Steinfeld, a Facebook spokesman, said the social network's ad preferences tool reflected information it received about users from data brokers and advertisers. The company recently said it was building a tool to show users a list of the apps and websites that Facebook receives data from when users visit them.   After we contacted LinkedIn's press department, we received emails the next day saying that the company was working on our requests. A LinkedIn spokeswoman said that users could automatically download ''the most commonly requested data'' and that the company did not currently plan to change its data request process.   Incomplete Responses   Prashant and Natasha: We were not just seeking our data for data's sake.   As we all become more aware of fraudulent news and online voter manipulation, researchers, journalists and consumers have been seeking all of their personal details from companies to try to understand how we might be manipulated. The incomplete responses from tech companies do not bode well for such research efforts.   Nor does it seem to bode well for the companies, which will soon be facing the new European privacy regulations.   After we wrote to our cellphone carriers to ask for our records, for instance, Natasha at least heard back from T-Mobile, who told her that it would release her phone records only if the company received a subpoena compelling it to do so.   Prashant did not hear back at all from Three, his mobile phone service. When he contacted the company as a reporter, Three said it could not give details on the particular case for privacy reasons, but added that it would typically send a letter asking for proof of identity before proceeding with a data request. Prashant and his wife, whose name the phone contract is in, never received such a letter.   A spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office in Britain told us that companies that failed to respond to data subject access requests could be in breach of the country's data protection law.   Under that law, penalties for noncompliance can reach 500,000 pounds, or more than $670,000. And noncompliance with the new European law could come with higher penalties: up to 4 percent of a company's global annual revenues, or 20 million euros, whichever is greater.   Even for a tech giant, that could get expensive.    "
"In Europe, New Battle On Privacy","Follow Natasha Singer on Twitter: @natashanyt. The new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn. The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union called the legislation ''overly strict.'' The Developers Alliance, a trade group representing Facebook, Google, Intel and dozens of app makers, said it could cost businesses in Europe more than 550 billion euros, or about $640 billion, in annual lost revenue. And DigitalEurope, another tech trade group, said the legislation's prohibitive approach ''seriously undermines the development of Europe's digital economy.''    These industry alarms are not over the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., a tough privacy law that went into effect in the European Union on Friday. Instead, the cause is an even stricter privacy law that's pending -- the tech industry's next regulatory battleground in Europe.   It is called the ePrivacy Regulation, and it specifically protects the confidentiality of electronic communications. The law was approved by the European Parliament last fall and is under review by the Council of the European Union, a group of government officials representing the 28 member countries. Bloc officials had originally intended for the law to go into effect this month, but Council negotiations have been slowed by internal disagreements.    If the current draft prevails, the law will require Skype, WhatsApp, iMessage, video games with player messaging and other electronic services that allow private interactions to obtain people's explicit permission before placing tracking codes on users' devices or collecting data about their communications.   Now, some of the same companies and trade associations that a few years ago tried to defang G.D.P.R. have set their sights on derailing the ePrivacy legislation. Apart from heavily lobbying government officials in Europe, trade groups are funding doomsday financial forecasts and creating worst-case scenario video campaigns warning people of the rule's potential drawbacks.   ''Most of the lobbying is unreasonable and very low regarding facts,'' said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a member of the European Parliament from Germany who steered the G.D.P.R. legislation through Parliament. He pointed to industry ''campaigns saying, 'With ePrivacy, the internet is going dark, and independent media, as well as digital growth, will be lost.'''   Industry and consumer advocates are essentially fighting over a contentious issue central to the post-Cambridge Analytica online economy: whether data-driven digital services represent more of a boon to consumers or the kind of surveillance that can threaten democracy.   ''With one click you can manipulate hundreds of thousands or millions of people, whether you know their names or not,'' said Birgit Sippel, a European Parliament member from Germany who drafted the ePrivacy legislation. ''That is why protecting privacy is becoming more important, especially in the digital environment.''   [Video: Birgit Sippel, a European Parliament member from Germany who drafted the ePrivacy legislation, defends the measure.  Watch on YouTube.]   The ePrivacy Regulation will replace and broaden an older European Union directive -- which covered traditional telecommunications like voice calls -- by also covering digital communications like text messaging and video chat apps.   The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users' electronic communications: obtaining consumers' explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected.   ''Do you really want that app to use your metadata? Do you really want them to read your content on a dating app?'' Ms. Sippel asked. ''Consumers need to get back control over what is happening with their lives and their data.''   But tech industry groups and their supporters argue that ePrivacy's consent requirement and other provisions are so onerous that they would hinder innovations like smart cars, which automatically transmit safety information back to the manufacturer. And requiring companies to provide equal communications services to people who opt out of data mining, they say, could cause sites or apps that rely on data-driven advertising to start charging fees or close down.   ''Europe will become a digital backwater,'' said Daniel Dalton, a member of the European Parliament from Britain. Mr. Dalton, who pushed for amendments on the ePrivacy bill, said he had met with Google, Microsoft, video game companies and trade groups to discuss their objections to the legislation.   ''Every stakeholder I have talked to from industry, from all sizes from the very biggest to the very smallest businesses, are unanimously opposed to this,'' he said.   Tech companies and trade groups have waged a furious, multipronged lobbying campaign to shut down, or at least weaken, the legislation.   Cisco, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, the American Chamber of Commerce, DigitalEurope and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Europe, a digital advertising industry group, have all lobbied officials at the European Commission about ePrivacy, according to a lobbying database created by Transparency International EU, a nonprofit research group in Brussels.   How much they are spending on the effort is unclear. While companies and trade groups that lobby European Commission officials must provide financial details on annual lobbying expenditures, they do not have to break out the spending by issue.   Trade groups have also created doomsday videos on ePrivacy. In one, an ominous voice warns that free online services won't be able to survive financially if they can't use people's personal data to target them with ads. The inevitable result, the narrator says, is ''an app-less future consumers never saw coming.''   [Video: A trade group video warning of an ""app-less future"" under the ePrivacy Regulation. Watch on YouTube.]   Industry associations have also lobbied the Council of the European Union, whose leadership rotates every six months. For the ePrivacy law to be enacted, the Council must first come to its own consensus on the bill before negotiating the law's final language in a three-way discussion with the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm.   The Council's decisions are so critical for ePrivacy that the Computer and Communications Industry Association -- which represents Amazon, Google, Netflix and others -- traveled to Bulgaria in October to meet government ministers there as that country was preparing to take over the Council presidency. The bill's supporters said the Council had not made much headway on ePrivacy since then.   Elitsa Zlateva, a spokeswoman for the permanent representation of Bulgaria to the European Union, said her country's officials were committed to the bill's progress. She declined to provide names of other trade groups that the country's representatives had met with on ePrivacy.   The ''Bulgarian presidency acts as an honest broker,'' she wrote in an email, and works to balance the interests of European member states, citizens and business.   With support from Google, the computer industry group also financed a research study last year saying that ePrivacy's data restrictions could cut revenue for the online news and online advertising industries, diminishing venture capital funding for cloud computing.   Christian Borggreen, vice president for the computer industry group in Europe, said he hoped that the ePrivacy Regulation would not conflict with the G.D.P.R. and that it would ''add meaningful privacy protection without unduly hurting digital innovation.''   And this month, the Developers Alliance published its own sponsored economic research that forecast the ePrivacy Regulation would slash profits dependent on electronic communication by 30 percent across all sectors in the European Union. The group called on government officials to ''take these findings into account when discussing this critical file.''   Michela Palladino, director of European policy and government relations at the Developers Alliance, said of the ePrivacy bill's restrictions on handling user content and metadata: ''That is something that is too extreme and will really cut potential business opportunities'' for many industries that rely on data.   Ms. Sippel said hewing to industry opinions was impeding progress on the ePrivacy effort.   ''In my view, we have some weak governments on the Council that are not willing to get into trouble with industry,'' she said, emphasizing that she was expressing her opinion and not stating an official parliamentary position. ''So, for the time being, they haven't found a common position.''    "
"Senators Urge Investigation of Smart TV Industry, Citing Privacy Concerns","Two Democratic senators have asked federal regulators to investigate the business practices of smart-television manufacturers amid worries that companies are tracking consumers' viewing behavior without their knowledge. In a letter on Thursday to Joseph Simons, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said they were concerned about ''consumer privacy issues raised by the proliferation of smart-TV technology.''    Companies are using new tools to identify and log what people are watching as part of an effort to profile consumers and direct ads to other devices in their homes. The letter cited a New York Times article, published last week, that detailed the practices of Samba TV, a San Francisco software company. Privacy advocates have criticized the company for not being transparent with consumers when it seeks permission to track their viewing on internet-connected TVs to sell ads.    ''Regrettably,'' the senators wrote, ''smart-TV users may not be aware of the extent to which their televisions are collecting sensitive information about their viewing habits.'' The letter went on to argue that Samba TV ''does not provide sufficient information about its privacy practices to ensure users can make truly informed decisions.''   Samba TV, which said it collected viewing data from 13.5 million homes in the United States, has struck deals to place its software on certain sets from Sony, Sharp, TCL, Philips and other brands. The company essentially pays television manufacturers to be included on their sets, saying its business model ''does subsidize a small piece of the television hardware,'' though it declined to provide further details.   When consumers set up a TV with built-in Samba software, they encounter a screen asking them to enable Samba Interactive TV. The opt-in language reads: ''Interact with your favorite shows. Get recommendations based on the content you love. Connect your devices for exclusive content and special offers. By cleverly recognizing onscreen content, Samba Interactive TV lets you engage with your TV in a whole new way.''   Most consumers agree to enable the software, which allows Samba to monitor their TV habits on a nearly second-by-second basis, identifying video games, HBO shows, political debates and more. The company may then use the data to direct ads to phones and laptops that share the TV's internet connection.   Mr. Markey and Mr. Blumenthal, who are members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said the opt-in language ''does not clearly convey how much sensitive information about a user will be collected or whether the data will be used for targeted advertisements across different devices.'' The senators noted that data privacy and disclosure rules had long applied to cable operators and satellite carriers but ''do not cover data companies using internet connectivity'' to track smart-TV viewing.   In a statement on Thursday, Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Samba TV, said that the company shared ''Senator Markey's concerns about data privacy.'' He added, ''There is more to be done here, and we will work with any member of Congress on this issue, as we have throughout the past few years.''   Mr. Daddi also said that the Federal Trade Commission had ''already reviewed our opt-in language and policy'' and that Samba TV had made revisions based on the agency's guidance. However, when asked previously about Samba TV, a spokeswoman for the commission said the agency does not ''endorse or bless companies' practices.''   Privacy concerns have landed companies, from TV manufacturers to outside data companies, in legal trouble. Vizio, for example, paid $2.2 million last year to settle claims by the Federal Trade Commission and the State of New Jersey that it was collecting and selling data from millions of smart TVs without the knowledge or consent of set owners. The company is working toward a settlement in a separate class-action lawsuit in California centered on the tracking software in its TVs.   The letter from the two senators does not necessarily mean the Federal Trade Commission will take action, but ''there has been a historical recognition that TV viewing can be pretty sensitive,'' said Justin Brookman, a former policy director at the commission who is the director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union.   Juliana Gruenwald, a spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission, confirmed receipt of the letter and declined to comment further.   The senators' letter draws attention to the challenging business of TV manufacturing, which provides an opening for data companies. Selling access to consumer data could help companies pad thin margins, particularly on smaller sets.   ''If you think of the cheap 32-inch, 40-inch, 50-inch TVs -- most of the TV manufacturers are lucky if they break even on those sets,'' said Paul Gagnon, an analyst for IHS Markit. Profits typically come from larger sets.   Tracking software has also appeared as part of expensive models. David Kitchen, a software engineer in London who described his frustration with Samba TV's tracking in last week's Times article, said he had paid about 1,000 pounds (about $1,300) for a Sony Bravia set that asked him to enable the software.   At the end of last year, about 45 percent of TV households in the United States, or 56 million homes, had at least one smart TV, according to IHS Markit data. Smart TVs accounted for 70 percent of all television shipments to North America last year, said the firm, which forecasts the share to rise to 78 percent this year.   ''In terms of practical things the F.T.C. could do, one is filing additional enforcement actions, which, in addition to curtailing individual companies' practices, can send a powerful 'clean up your act' message to industries,'' said Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University and a former technology adviser at the Federal Communications Commission.   The Federal Trade Commission could also do a ''sweep'' of the smart-TV industry, which would mean testing smart TVs from major manufacturers and potentially taking enforcement action based on its findings, he said.   Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has been pressing the Federal Trade Commission on smart TVs and privacy since 2015 and said he was hopeful that the senators' letter would prompt action.   ''A device is a device,'' Mr. Rotenberg said. ''A person should be able to plug it into the wall, connect into the internet and not worry that what happens next is going to be recorded.''    "
How Game Apps Collect Data on Children,"Before Kim Slingerland downloaded the Fun Kid Racing app for her then-5-year-old son, Shane, she checked to make sure it was in the family section of the Google Play store and rated as age-appropriate. The game, which lets children race cartoon cars with animal drivers, has been downloaded millions of times. Until last month, the app also shared users' data, sometimes including the precise location of devices, with more than a half-dozen advertising and online tracking companies. On Tuesday evening, New Mexico's attorney general filed a lawsuit claiming that the maker of Fun Kid Racing had violated a federal children's privacy law through dozens of Android apps that shared children's data.    ''I don't think it's right,'' said Ms. Slingerland, a mother of three in Alberta, Canada. ''I don't think that's any of their business, location or anything like that.''    The suit accuses the app maker, Tiny Lab Productions, along with online ad businesses run by Google, Twitter and three other companies, of flouting a law intended to prevent the personal data of children under 13 from falling into the hands of predators, hackers and manipulative marketers. The suit also contends that Google misled consumers by including the apps in the family section of its store.   [Read the full complaint]   An analysis by The New York Times found that children's apps by other developers were also collecting data. The review of 20 children's apps -- 10 each on Google Android and Apple iOS -- found examples on both platforms that sent data to tracking companies, potentially violating children's privacy law; the iOS apps sent less data over all.   These findings are consistent with those published this spring by academic researchers who analyzed nearly 6,000 free children's Android apps. They reported that more than half of the apps, including those by Tiny Lab, shared details with outside companies in ways that may have violated the law.   Although federal law doesn't provide many digital privacy protections for adults, there are safeguards for children under 13. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act protects them from being improperly tracked, including for advertising purposes. Without explicit, verifiable permission from parents, children's sites and apps are prohibited from collecting personal details including names, email addresses, geolocation data and tracking codes like ''cookies'' if they're used for targeted ads.   But the New Mexico lawsuit and the analyses of children's apps suggest that some app developers, ad tech companies and app stores are falling short in protecting children's privacy.   ''These sophisticated tech companies are not policing themselves,'' the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said. ''The children of this country ultimately pay the price.''   Jessica Rich, a former consumer protection director at the Federal Trade Commission, called the findings ''significant and disturbing.'' They suggest, she said, ''that the 'safe spaces' for kids in the apps stores aren't safe at all.''   A Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, said that developers are responsible for declaring whether their apps are primarily for children, and that apps in the store's family section ''must comply with more stringent policies.''   A Twitter spokesman said that the company's ad platform, MoPub, does not allow its services to be used to collect information from children's apps for targeted advertising and that it suspended the maker of Fun Kid Racing in September of 2017 for violating its policies.   Jonas Abromaitis, founder of the Lithuania-based Tiny Lab, said he believed he had followed the law and Google's requirements, because the app asked for users' ages and tracked those who identified as over 13. ''We thought we were doing everything the right way,'' he said.   A Market for Tracking   Dozens of companies now track consumers on their phones to build behavioral profiles that help tailor the ads they see. Two of the largest are AdMob and MoPub.   To make money, app developers generally have two options: publish free apps supported by ads, or charge users. But children don't have the money to make purchases, and under federal law they can't be tracked for ad targeting.   The app industry has had trouble adapting to children, said Dylan Collins, the chief executive of SuperAwesome, a technology firm that helps companies build apps for children without tracking them.   Mr. Collins said some top children's app makers had started charging parents for subscriptions or showing ads that didn't use tracking. But, he noted, small developers typically sell fewer subscriptions and don't always sell enough ads using only child-friendly ad networks. ''As a result, there's still a huge amount of data being collected on kids,'' he said.   In 2013 Apple introduced a children's section in its App Store. It told developers that, to be listed there, they could ''do no tracking across sites or across apps.'' Apple tells parents that it reviews each app in the section ''to make sure it does what it says it does.''   Google introduced a similar program, Designed for Families, in 2015. The company informed Android developers that apps that were ''primarily child-directed must participate'' in the program and that developers must confirm that their apps complied with the children's privacy law. Google has said it developed its family section to help parents find ''suitable, trusted, high-quality apps'' for their children.   'For Children' vs. 'for Families'   Mr. Abromaitis, the Tiny Lab founder, created Fun Kid Racing in 2013, after searching unsuccessfully for a racing game to play with his 3-year-old nephew. Other Tiny Lab apps include simple games with titles such as Run Cute Little Pony.   Still, Mr. Abromaitis said in an interview, the company's apps were directed at ''mixed audiences,'' with children under 13 forming only part of the market.   The distinction is important: Under privacy law, apps aimed at younger children are prohibited from tracking any users for ads without parental consent, but those intended for a general audience can ask players their age and track older users.   When Tiny Lab submitted apps to Google's store, it indicated they were for families, not just children, and Google accepted the apps.   In The Times's tests of Fun Kid Racing in July, the app asked that players select their birth year from a list. But with the default set between 2000 and 2001, a young child eager to get to the next screen could simply tap through quickly and be counted as a teenager. In the tests, the app didn't collect location data if the player identified as under 13.   In early June, emails show, the academic researchers who had done the earlier study informed Google that app developers ''seem to have an incentive to mischaracterize'' their children's apps as ''not primarily directed to children,'' freeing them to track users for targeted ads. They cited 84 apps from Tiny Lab as examples and said they had identified nearly 3,000 apps in all that appeared to be similarly mislabeled.   In July, a Google manager responded that the company had investigated the Tiny Lab apps and had found they had not violated the privacy law. Google, he said, did not consider ''these apps to be designed primarily for children, but for families in general.''   A month later, Google appeared to reverse course: The company told Mr. Abromaitis it had identified a Tiny Lab app that should be designated for children. Google gave Tiny Lab a week to change that app and any others like it. Tiny Lab labeled 10 of its apps for children and used ad networks in them designed for children's apps. Google approved the updates but flagged more apps at the end of August, Mr. Abromaitis said, so he made another round of changes.   Then, this week, after inquiries from The Times, Google terminated Tiny Lab's account and removed all of its apps from the Play store, citing multiple policy violations.   Asked about the earlier emails, Google said the statements were made in error and that it doesn't certify whether apps in the Play store comply with the children's privacy law.   Mr. Abromaitis said he hoped to work with Google to get back into the store.   Widespread Tracking of Children   The study this spring showed not only that more than half of children's apps on Android were sharing tracking ID numbers but also that 5 percent collected children's location or contact information without their parents' permission.   To evaluate tracking on iOS as well as Android, The Times conducted a small study, looking at 10 apps on each platform. The Times chose a mix of the most popular children's apps and smaller apps that had been flagged in the academics' research for sharing data, to test whether the apps had problems on iOS and whether they had been fixed on Android.   Although it is difficult to know whether companies are actually violating the federal rules, six of the Android apps shared data such as precise location, IP addresses and tracking IDs in ways that could be problematic. On iOS, five apps sent IDs to tracking companies in questionable ways.   In addition to Fun Kid Racing, the tests showed one other Android app sending precise location data to other companies: Masha and the Bear: Free Animal Games for Kids, an animated game app with millions of downloads. The iOS version sent advertising ID codes to a company that generally prohibits children's apps from using its network.   In an email, Indigo Kids, the Cyprus-based maker of the Masha app, said it was not responsible for harvesting children's information because third-party companies collected the data. ''We, as a company, do not collect or store any data of our users,'' the company said.   Other apps with data practices that could violate the children's privacy rules sent data to multiple tracking companies that don't allow children's apps, or sent the data with notes in the computer code incorrectly indicating that it hadn't come from children.   Several apps reviewed by The Times also sent the advertising ID to other companies but said this was for specific purposes allowed under the law, such as preventing an ad from being shown too many times.   Tom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, said that children's privacy in apps ''is something we take very seriously'' and that developers must follow strict guidelines about tracking in children's apps.   Enforcing the Law   Since the federal children's online privacy law was enacted in 1998, the Federal Trade Commission has brought nearly 30 cases alleging violations by companies including Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Yelp. All of those firms ultimately settled with the agency.   ''The F.T.C. has made enforcement of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act a high priority,'' said Juliana Gruenwald, an agency spokeswoman.   But the New Mexico lawsuit is different. The state is not just going after a single app maker or ad company; it's also implicating the ad platforms of Google and Twitter, and the vetting process of Google's app store.   ''Google knows that Tiny Lab's apps track children unlawfully,'' the complaint said. ''Google's bad acts are compounded because it represents to parents'' that Tiny Lab's apps comply with the children's privacy law and are ''safe for children.''   The case is particularly fraught for Google and Twitter, which are each already subject to federal settlements over consumer privacy or security violations. Those settlements prohibit the companies from misrepresenting their consumer data protections, and violations could trigger hefty fines.   ''I don't see any way that anything would change unless there are enforcement actions,'' said Serge Egelman, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped lead the study this spring.   New Mexico's attorney general said he hoped the F.T.C. and others in Washington would follow his lead. ''This is as much a black eye on the federal government as the tech space,'' Mr. Balderas said. ''I'm trying to get lawmakers at the federal level to wake up.''    "
Congressmen Turn Up Heat On Google Over Children,"Follow Sapna Maheshwari on Twitter: @Sapna. In the context of a growing national debate on tech and privacy, Google has come under increased scrutiny for how it may be tracking and targeting children for advertising. Two House members sent a letter this week to the company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, expressing concern that the collection practices of YouTube, a Google subsidiary, may not comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as Coppa.    The letter on Monday -- from David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Jeff Fortenberry, Republican of Nebraska -- followed up on a complaint filed in April by more than 20 advocacy groups. The groups sought an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces Coppa.    In addition to the complaint and the lawmakers' letter, Google is facing pressure from the New Mexico attorney general on how it may collect children's location data. The state official named the tech giant as a defendant in a lawsuit filed last week against the developer of Fun Kid Racing and other gaming apps, along with advertisers involved with them, claiming that they were sharing children's data without their parents' permission.   YouTube has said its practices are in line with Coppa, which requires companies to obtain explicit, verifiable permission from parents before collecting personal information from children under 13 or targeting them with ads tied to their online behavior.   ''There's more interest in children's privacy than there has been in a long time, and that's related to the broader privacy conversations that we're having,'' said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, who was involved with the April complaint and the new push by lawmakers. ''Whether that leads to Google being held to account is yet to be seen.''   YouTube's terms of service state that its main app and website are meant only for viewers 13 and older, which means that the site does not have to comply with Coppa. The company directs those under 13 to the YouTube Kids app, which pulls its videos from the main site.  Google's website says YouTube Kids prohibits ''interest-based advertising'' and ads with ''tracking pixels.''   But advocates have contended that YouTube is aware that plenty of children watch videos on the main site, and Representatives Cicilline and Fortenberry are pressing Google to provide details of how it may collect data from children's videos on the site.   ''In light of the kind of content that is on YouTube focused on attracting young users, it raises serious questions about what efforts are being made to make sure that information is not being collected about children and mined and sold,'' Mr. Cicilline said.   Google, the biggest seller of online advertising, said its policies did not allow advertisers to deliver personalized ads to children under 13 or collect their personal information.   [Video: A video from the Ryan ToysReview channel on YouTube.  Watch on YouTube.]   ''We're committed to protecting children online with a combination of family-friendly products and strict policies,'' a Google spokeswoman said in a statement.   Several of the most-viewed channels on YouTube are aimed at children, including ChuChu TV and Ryan ToysReview, according to Social Blade, which compiles social media data. The channels, according to the site, have attracted billions of views. That's good for ad revenue, which YouTube splits with video makers.   Mr. Golin said he was disappointed that the Federal Trade Commission, which met with children's rights advocates in May after they filed their complaint, hadn't acted on the issue. Lawmakers and the New Mexico attorney general ''are really stepping up and putting pressure on the companies that should be coming from the F.T.C.,'' he added.   Still, Mr. Golin said he was optimistic that the congressmen could glean information from Google.   ''These are not questions we've ever gotten answers to, and it would be great to get on the record what Google and YouTube actually know about this,'' he said.   The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment.   The letter from the two lawmakers concludes with a series of pointed questions that ask Google to explain how it determines the age of its users, whether or not it collects the same personal data from children and adults and why YouTube includes channels that are ''clearly child-directed.''   Mr. Cicilline and Mr. Fortenberry gave Google a deadline of Oct. 17 to reply.    "
Giving Up Data Privacy With a Sigh,"The diapers ad that shows up on your computer when you are expecting a child. The coupon on your smartphone for a fast-food chain you just walked past. The sneaker offer appearing in your mailbox after you sign up to run a race. For years, marketers and technology companies have crept further into the homes and habits of Americans, arguing all the while that there is a fair and voluntary exchange taking place. The more we know about you, the argument goes, the more we can show you products you actually want instead of ads that just annoy you. Consumers, they say, are happily trading very specific information about their lives in order to receive this kind of personalized advertising and marketing -- relevant ads, as the industry calls them.    Joseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the topic for years and vigorously disagrees with that interpretation. Research by Professor Turow and his colleagues has found that most Americans give up data for relevant ads not because of convenience, but resignation. Rather than participating in a rational exchange, he argues, consumers are giving up their personal information with ''a feeling of futility.''    ''People are very uncomfortable with surveillance, but they don't know what to do,'' Professor Turow said about the research, which involved a telephone survey of about 1,500 people across the country this year and in 2015. ''In the real world, not having a frequent shopper card at the supermarket means you're going to lose 15 to 20 percent on purchases. It's very difficult for people to give up Facebook if all their friends are on Facebook.''   He added, ''It's that calculus people have, rather than, geez, this is a rational decision I'm making because I know this is what I have to do.''   Professor Turow is among the academics, privacy advocates and regulators who have long been critical of how companies extricate vast amounts of personal information from consumers in the digital world. In 2018, it became harder for the tech and media industries to ignore those voices, with more consumers and lawmakers discovering how extensive, secretive and unstoppable data collection can be.   This year has seen a string of revelations about how Facebook mishandled data from its users, even sharing their private messages with large corporations like Spotify and Netflix. Tech executives have regularly appeared before Congress and been grilled about their companies' practices. European lawmakers passed a sweeping privacy law in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R. That was followed by a California state law on privacy, which its advocates hoped would serve as a model for the nation.   New questions emerged around how Google allows outside companies to scan and share data from consumers' Gmail accounts. Companies were found to be using our smartphones to watch our every step. The rise of internet-connected devices in the home has turned everything from televisions to children's thermometers into tools for targeted advertising. And that's just a sampling.   ''We know we've got work to do to regain people's trust,'' Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. ''Protecting people's information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that's where we've been focused for most of 2018.''   Google did not respond to a request for comment.   The topic didn't suddenly materialize this year -- The Wall Street Journal broke major ground on digital surveillance with its award-winning series ''What They Know'' in 2010.   But at that time Facebook was not yet public and Google was a fraction of its current size. Digital tracking has since become far more pervasive and intertwined with peoples' daily lives -- advertisements follow them from their computers to their phones and even their TVs -- and often, it can feel inescapable. Recently, Facebook told Gizmodo that even if people opt out of location sharing with the social network, it can still determine their location and use it for targeted advertising.   ''There are so many aspects of how companies deal with the public that obfuscates what actually goes on and so many attempts to placate people using jargon,'' Professor Turow said. ''I've spoken to lawyers who write privacy policies who admit -- they admit -- that they aren't written for the public.''   In their survey this year, researchers led by Professor Turow found that most Americans did not understand privacy policies on websites. More than half did not know the correct answer to this true-or-false statement: ''If a website has a privacy policy, that means the site won't share user information with other sites or companies without permission.'' (The statement is false.)   The researchers also found that most Americans did not know that companies can legally collect and keep personal data on 13-year-olds as if they are adults. Companies are able to do that because the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law, extends only to children who are 12 and under.   ''I would argue that's because people can't imagine that the law would allow this kind of attitude,'' Professor Turow said. The researchers conducted national surveys in 2015 and this year, working with two polling companies to interview a representative sample of Americans on their landlines and cellphones.   The findings are particularly notable as tech companies and marketers argue that individuals should be responsible for understanding and navigating all of these policies and their privacy settings. Some people may delete Facebook, but what about Instagram and WhatsApp? Avoiding Google for search purposes is one thing. Then try avoiding Gmail, YouTube and Waze.   Advertisers are watching closely as Americans question these services. They are the ones, after all, paying to use all this data to send messages to the right consumers. There is a stark difference between targeting consumers who are eagerly sharing their information for so-called relevance and targeting those who have given up, and who may not even understand how, exactly, their data is being collected and interpreted.   Still, little has been said publicly. While some ad agency executives have criticized Facebook in recent weeks, other executives have sought to neutralize those remarks. Last month, Rishad Tobaccowala, the chief growth officer of the advertising firm Publicis Groupe, questioned Facebook's moral compass in an interview with The New York Times. Shortly afterward, Facebook distributed more conciliatory comments from Arthur Sadoun, the chief executive of Publicis. Mr. Sadoun acknowledged the company's issues but added, ''We believe that the management is taking the right decisions that are going in the right direction.''   A similar reaction emerged after the chief executive of the agency Initiative said in a LinkedIn post that he would advise his clients to halt advertising on Facebook based on its ''egregious behavior'' involving consumer data. Michael Roth, the chief executive of the Interpublic Group, which owns Initiative, quickly told The Wall Street Journal that the company would continue to ''work closely with our media partners,'' including Facebook.   ''There's no question in my mind that Americans see privacy as an important issue,'' Professor Turow said. ''The question is: What do you do about it?""    "
Needed: A Privacy Law,"To the Editor: ''The End of Privacy Began in the 1960s,'' by Margaret O'Mara (Op-Ed, Dec. 6), points to several critical moments in the development of American privacy laws, but there is much in this history that needs clarifying if the next steps on privacy are smart ones.     Ms. O'Mara is correct that the proposal for a National Data Center and growing concern about the misuse of personal data by the government culminated in the Privacy Act of 1974. But a deal with the Ford White House stripped the final bill of private-sector coverage and a dedicated federal agency. The country has lived with the consequences.   Coverage in the private sector is uneven or exists not at all. The absence of a privacy agency is still a gaping hole in American law. The Europeans, building on the United States' experience and facing similar challenges, managed to develop a privacy regime that is both more coherent and more effective.   Back then, Congress well understood the need to limit the collection of personal data. And Congress did not view privacy protection and the free flow of information as a trade-off. In the same year that Congress enacted the Privacy Act, it also strengthened the Freedom of Information Act.   There is still much that Congress can do to strengthen privacy protections for Americans. Enacting federal baseline legislation and establishing a data protection agency would be a good start.

Madison Square Garden Has Used Face-Scanning Technology on Customers,"Madison Square Garden has quietly used facial-recognition technology to bolster security and identify those entering the building, according to multiple people familiar with the arena's security procedures. The technology uses cameras to capture images of people, and then an algorithm compares the images to a database of photographs to help identify the person and, when used for security purposes, to determine if the person is considered a problem. The technology, which is sometimes used for marketing and promotions, has raised concerns over personal privacy and the security of any data that is stored by the system. ""MSG continues to test and explore the use of new technologies to ensure we're employing the most effective security procedures to provide a safe and wonderful experience for our guests,"" the Garden said in a statement. A spokeswoman for the Garden declined to answer questions about the use of face-scanning technology.  It is unclear when the face-scanning system was installed. The people familiar with the Garden's use of the technology, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it, said they did not know how many events at the Garden in recent months have used it or how the data has been handled. ""In a lot of places we will see facial recognition framed positively as just an extension of video surveillance,"" said Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law Center. ""But the reality is it is a way to require, or in secret, have everyone in a crowd show their papers, essentially, to compare them to a big enough database."" The Garden -- home to the N.B.A.'s Knicks and the N.H.L.'s Rangers, and host to events like boxing matches, concerts and the Grammy Awards -- was already known for having tight security. There is always a heavy police presence in part because the arena is in the heart of Midtown Manhattan and is built above Pennsylvania Station, the nation's busiest rail terminal. Fans attending events go through security screening that can include metal detectors, bag searches and explosive-sniffing dogs. The use of facial recognition technology puts the arena in the vanguard of professional sports facilities. At least two other arenas have experimented with the technology, but teams and leagues are generally unwilling to discuss security protocols, so it is difficult to know for sure how widespread it is. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of the fans, players, team and arena staff at our games,"" said Mike Bass, a spokesman for the N.B.A. ""The league and our teams are exploring the use of all state-of-the-art technology, including facial recognition, to ensure that we have industry-best security measures to protect all those in our arenas."" The N.H.L. declined to comment. Although security is the most obvious use of the technology, some independent experts say it is less effective as a security measure for private businesses because they do not have access to various watch lists held by law enforcement agencies. In fact, some vendors and team officials said the customer engagement and marketing capabilities of facial recognition are even more valuable than added security for sports facilities. Law enforcement agencies have used facial recognition technology for many years, but some commercial entities have been wary. Walmart is among those that have experimented with it, to help identify shoplifters, drawing strong objections from privacy groups. The software can be used to determine who is allowed into a building, like vendors or workers at a specified employee entrance. Companies may eventually be able to use the technology to increase customer engagement. In the case of an arena, a sports fan might sign up for a loyalty program with a team and attach his image and a credit card to the account. He could then park without paying an attendant, walk in without having a ticket scanned and pay for merchandise and concessions without ever taking out his wallet. Even without fans signing up for anything, the cameras can give teams a much better sense of who is attending a game. Currently, teams might know who originally bought a ticket, but after the ticket enters the secondary market, teams do not necessarily know who is sitting in the seat. ""The days of having 40,000 to 60,000 people in the stadium and not knowing who they are, I think those days are going to disappear,"" said Charles Carroll, a senior vice president at IDEMIA, which manages the Transportation Security Administration's PreCheck program. IDEMIA has partnered with three sports venues on security, including Barclays Center in Brooklyn, to offer expedited lines to enter. Allen Ganz, a director of critical infrastructure at NEC Corporation of America, an industry leader in facial recognition, said his company's system could ""estimate anonymously the age and gender of people coming into the stadium."" An electronic advertising board connected to the system could even be changed depending upon the age and gender of who is standing in front of it. Ganz declined to disclose which sports arenas use NEC technology. Peter Trepp, the chief executive of FaceFirst, said ""very, very few"" stadiums and arenas were using facial recognition technology. In addition to Madison Square Garden, at least two other arenas are known to be experimenting with the technology. According to a Sacramento Kings spokeswoman, facial recognition is used to allow players and staff to enter the practice facility connected to the Golden 1 Center, but its use has not expanded to event attendees. The Dallas Mavericks have contracted with Suspect Technologies to experiment with facial recognition outside the team's locker room and throughout the American Airlines Center. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, however, said in an email the team needs to ""find the right application that creates so much value people want to use it."" He said that, for now, facial recognition doesn't improve his arena's ability to keep out unwanted patrons enough to justify its implementation. ""In the private sector, facial recognition is really only as good as the database it is compared against,"" said Michael Downing, the former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and chief security adviser for the Oak View Group. There is no federal law governing the use of facial recognition technology, though both Illinois and Texas have laws that restrict its use without informed consent. Facebook has been sued under Illinois law, a case that could challenge its business model, and according to the Center for Public Integrity, is lobbying against similar laws being passed in other states. ""We are in a kind of legal Wild West when it comes to this stuff,"" said Jay Stanley, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. While most sports fans may not have a legal right to know their face is being tracked, Stanley said he believed there is an ethical right to know. ""I should know if I am being subject to facial recognition if I am going into any business, including a stadium,"" he said. ""Even if you are just running my face against a list of people who have been banned from the premises and doing nothing else with it. I want to know. I have a right to know.""

Demands Grow for Facebook to Explain Its Privacy Policies,"A parade of regulators, politicians and law enforcement officials demanded to know more about Facebook's privacy practices on Monday, as the fallout from the company's relationship with a political data firm continued to spread. Early in the day, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed reports that it was investigating how Facebook handles information about its users. Soon after, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to testify about privacy standards next month. He also extended invitations to Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey.  And a group of 37 attorneys general sent Mr. Zuckerberg a letter asking for details about Facebook's privacy safeguards. But one group of people interested in Facebook -- investors -- had a muted reaction to the growing regulatory threat. Shares of Facebook fell sharply after the F.T.C. confirmed its investigation but ended the day up 0.4 percent as overall trading on Wall Street recovered from a big drop last week. The federal investigation and threats followed recent news that the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, gained access to the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users. The F.T.C. said it planned to determine whether the social media giant had violated a consent decree it signedin 2011 to protect users' privacy. The decree required Facebook to notify and receive explicit permission from users before sharing their personal information beyond the limits dictated by their privacy settings. Each violation of the agreement, which the agency reached with Facebook as part of a settlement over third-party apps, carries a penalty of up to $40,000 a day. The agency's acknowledgment of its investigation helped push Facebook's stock down as much as 6.5 percent on Monday morning before it recovered. Facebook said last week that it was anticipating an inquiry by the agency. The F.T.C. said in a statement on Monday that it ""takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook."" Lawmakers have repeatedly called for Mr. Zuckerberg to appear in hearings on Capitol Hill. Last week, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate commerce committees formally invited him to testify. ""I'm sure this is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, and I'm sure there are other Cambridge Analyticas out there,"" Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, said in an interview. ""Facebook isn't just a company. It is so powerful it is like a country."" Some lawmakers, such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat from Connecticut, asked the F.T.C. to look into whether Facebook should pay damages to users. ""The sphere of scrutiny must be broader than just the consent decree,"" he said in a statement. ""There is no excuse for delay."" Cambridge Analytica is facing intense criticism, too. On Monday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group in Washington, filed complaints seeking federal investigations into allegations that the company violated federal election law. In an article that detailed how Cambridge Analytica obtained information about millions of Facebook users, The New York Times reported this month that employees of the data research firm with European or Canadian citizenship had worked extensively for its American clients during the 2014 and 2016 elections, despite a warning from its own election lawyer. The employees worked on polling, message development, and the designing of target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals. The company said the work was permissible because none of the foreign employees had ""strategic"" or ""operational"" roles. But former employees contradicted that account, suggesting that the work violated laws in the United States that strictly limit what non-Americans can do for American political campaigns. Common Cause filed one complaint with the Justice Department, which has authority to investigate ""knowing and willful"" violations of campaign law. The group also filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which has day-to-day jurisdiction over enforcing election rules. ""It defies belief that even after their own attorney warned them that they would be violating the prohibition on performing certain election-related activities in U.S. elections that they did so anyway,"" said Paul S. Ryan, Common Cause's vice president for policy and litigation. In the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, lawyers appealed two lawsuits that challenged the social media company's privacy and user data policies. One lawsuit claims that Facebook violates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Wiretap Act) and state law equivalents because of the way it monitors its users on and off the platform. The second suit claims that Facebook has been capturing and selling the details of users' browsing of third-party health sites. Any site with a Facebook ""like"" button, including those of medical institutions such as the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, could be used to track users as they browsed outside Facebook, according to the lawsuit. Facebook also has been targeted by several shareholder lawsuits since the reports detailing Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook user information. Many users have threatened to deactivate or delete their accounts to protest Facebook's stewardship of their personal data. The #deletefacebook campaign, as it has been called, has even received support from a creator of WhatsApp, one of Facebook's most popular services, who sold his company to the social media giant for $19 billion in 2014. Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, removed the Facebook pages of both companies on Friday. While the Cambridge Analytica revelations have renewed regulatory interest in Facebook in the United States, pressure on the company in other countries has been building for years. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. And Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.

Facebook Should Consider a 'Why Me?' Button; DealBook,"""One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data."" That's what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive and co-founder, said just over a week ago after revelations that the data research firm Cambridge Analytica had gained access to the profiles of 50 million Facebook users. Over the past year, the downside of social media companies -- Facebook foremost among them -- has become glaringly apparent. They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives. They have failed to keep users' personal information private. And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be, well, creepy. Now the drumbeat for regulation of social media on both sides of the aisle -- and from many in Silicon Valley -- is getting louder by the day. ""I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,"" Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said recently.  Mr. Zuckerberg may be getting tired of other executives sniping at his company, but he needs to come up with a solution -- fast. For several weeks, I've been canvassing various technology executives, privacy advocates, academics and others to come up with some ideas about exactly what Facebook could do to fix itself. It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators, but Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this: a ""Why Me?"" button. (Google, Amazon and others might want to take note, too.) Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it. We provide it all sorts of information. But we have no idea how the information is being used, how our data is being harvested, how that data is being commingled and cross-referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers. (Facebook already has a button, relatively buried in a list of other items, that it calls ""Why Am I Seeing This Ad?"" It is, to some degree, a crippled version of what I'm suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook's properties.) To his credit, Mr. Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns. After acknowledging that protecting users' data is one of the company's biggest responsibilities, he went on to say, ""If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it's a photo or a video or a text message -- whether it's Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram -- and you're trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with."" But the solution Facebook offered last week -- putting all of your privacy settings on one screen and blocking some third parties from access to data -- is just a Band-Aid. It's a start, but it doesn't provide a road map for how your information is being used. That's where the ""Why Me?"" button could help. This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook's properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp. If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen, you could click the ""Why Me?"" button. Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you. The ""Why Me?"" explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser, but what keywords, demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted. It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser's request and where that information came from. Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook. The ""Why Me?"" section would show you when and where that information was collected. Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan? Facebook would tell how it knew that, too. Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it? The ""Why Me?"" section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross-referenced to identify you. Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided? It would tell you that, too. Most important, at every point in the ""explanation tree,"" the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data. Facebook, of course, could -- and probably should -- explain the trade-offs of such decisions. The ""Why Me?"" button could also be extended to content. When a friend or company shares a post, Facebook doesn't just display it to everyone listed as the poster's friend or follower. Facebook's algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters, usually related to the kind of content or how you've interacted with the friend in the past. The ""Why Me?"" button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted. The current ""Why Am I Seeing This Ad?"" often says something like: ""Company A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you've connected to the internet."" But it hardly tells you the whole story. Facebook doesn't say so explicitly, but it allows companies to upload their own databases, cross-reference them with Facebook's data and use that information to serve ads to users. It also doesn't say how that other site originally got that information about who you are. In fairness, the ""Why Me?"" button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users -- and rivals -- to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting. It has become something of a cliché, but in 1913, before he became a Supreme Court justice, Louis D. Brandeis said, ""Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants."" It could well be applied today at Facebook -- and its peer companies -- if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown.

Creepy or Not? Your Privacy Concerns Probably Reflect Your Politics,"Are you creeped out by the idea of a company checking a job candidate's credit history before deciding whether to hire her or him? Your answer could be tied to your political views. A new poll on surveillance from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania found that Americans are deeply divided over tracking, both online and in real life. And political affiliation is a main predictor of Americans' emotional reactions to surveillance, the researchers found. Among people who identified themselves as Democrats, for instance, 62 percent said they felt ""creeped out"" by the idea of companies checking job applicants' credit history before hiring them. By contrast, half of independents and just 29 percent of Republicans felt creeped out.   ""The Republicans are most likely to be positive about surveillance,"" said Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author of the study. ""The Democrats are most likely to be negative, and independents are always in the middle."" ""It's just a chasm,"" he added. The study, published on Monday, focused specifically on Americans' emotional responses to snooping techniques that could disproportionately affect low-income populations. Among other things, the survey asked participants about practices like police profiling and landlords subscribing to profiling databases to screen potential tenants. Professor Turow said the report was the first national study of its kind. The survey was based on phone interviews conducted in January and February with a nationally representative sample of 1,499 adults in the United States. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.  Although Republicans, Democrats and independents in the survey had divided emotional reactions on various snooping techniques, the majority of respondents said that the surveillance was expected. Whether Americans like it or not, pervasive tracking is becoming a fact of daily life.   Facebook as the Exception The report coincides with a national reckoning on privacy in the United States. In the wake of recent revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling service, harvested the personal details of up to 87 million Facebook users, many lawmakers have started publicly questioning widespread online data-mining by tech companies.  While Republicans and Democrats are divided about surveillance, there was one situation that elicited strikingly similar responses among participants, no matter their political party: Facebook showing users ads based on interests they expressed on their Facebook accounts. Although the Annenberg School study was conducted before the data-mining scandal erupted, nearly half of respondents over all said they felt angry over the Facebook ad-targeting example. Among them, 48 percent of Democrats felt mad about Facebook tracking, along with 47 percent of independents and 44 percent of Republicans.  Those results suggest that if members of Congress hope to make consumer privacy legislation a bipartisan issue, Facebook could be their likeliest common ground. In recent weeks, several senators introduced bills focused on Facebookand other online providers. It is too soon to tell whether they will gain traction.  The Schism Over Surveillance  The survey asked participants about different hypothetical situations, like the one involving Facebook. Another one involved landlords subscribing to databases that profiled the past behavior of potential tenants. And one involved government agencies tracking where people who received food stamps bought their groceries.  Interviewers asked survey participants how they felt about each example, directing them to choose between paired responses like ""happy"" or ""sad,"" ""safe"" or ""threatened,"" ""unbothered"" or ""creeped out.""   In the survey, Republicans often said they felt ""unbothered"" by surveillance practices and even ""pleased."" One question, for instance, described police officers using surveillance techniques to closely monitor ""people who they think have characteristics that are common among criminals."" Among survey respondents, 62 percent of Republicans said they felt ""happy"" about the police example, compared with 45 percent of independents and just 31 percent of Democrats. The Annenberg study is not the first survey on Americans' responses to snooping. A study published last fall by researchers at the Data & Society Research Institute in Manhattan found that a variety of factors, including income and political affiliation, correlated with respondents' attitudes on privacy. (Professor Turow was an adviser on the Data & Society study.)   ""We saw that in general Democrats have a higher concern across an array of scenarios about the use of their data,"" said Mary Madden, a researcher who leads an initiative on privacy in low socioeconomic status populations at Data & Society. ""Republicans are in general less concerned about those practices."" Professor Turow said the survey responses in his new study suggested that many Republicans lacked empathy regarding surveillance practices that could disproportionately harm people of lower income.  ""Democrats seem more interested or more likely to say, 'It may not be directly affecting me, I feel safe, but I still feel angry about it,'"" Professor Turow said.  In the Annenberg survey, participants were not told that certain hypothetical situations in the study could have discriminatory results. ""It would be interesting to see a version of this that compared responses if respondents knew the impact of the scenarios,"" said Ms. Madden, the Data & Society researcher. The Normalization of Tracking There was one trend that emerged among the survey respondents, regardless of their politics. In every situation in the study, the majority of survey participants said they felt the tracking practices were expected, not surprising. In other words, in a culture where consumers readily share their locations with Siri, their grocery lists with Alexa and their fingerprints with a federal program to speed them through airport security checks, many Americans are growing accustomed to the idea of increased monitoring. That normalization of surveillance has privacy experts warning that pervasive tracking could escalate in ways citizens might not like. ""Over time, political and commercial forces can manipulate you and others to allow for even the most vulnerable people in society to have their data used in ways that may negatively affect them,"" Professor Turow said. ""These apartment house scenarios, these grocery scenarios, these police scenarios have consequences.""

"Service Meant to Monitor Inmates' Calls Could Track You, Too","Thousands of jails and prisons across the United States use a company called Securus Technologies to provide and monitor calls to inmates. But the former sheriff of Mississippi County, Mo., used a lesser-known Securus service to track people's cellphones, including those of other officers, without court orders, according to charges filed against him in state and federal court. The service can find the whereabouts of almost any cellphone in the country within seconds. It does this by going through a system typically used by marketers and other companies to get location data from major cellphone carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon, documents show. Between 2014 and 2017, the sheriff, Cory Hutcheson, used the service at least 11 times, prosecutors said. His alleged targets included a judge and members of the State Highway Patrol. Mr. Hutcheson, who was dismissed last year in an unrelated matter, has pleaded not guilty in the surveillance cases.  As location tracking has become more accurate, and as more people carry their phones at every waking moment, the ability of law enforcement officers and companies like Securus to get that data has become an ever greater privacy concern. Securus offers the location-finding service as an additional feature for law enforcement and corrections officials, part of an effort to entice customers in a lucrative but competitive industry. In promotional packets, the company, one of the largest prison phone providers in the country, recounts several instances in which the service was used. In one, a woman sentenced to drug rehab left the center but was eventually located by an official using the service. Other examples include an official who found a missing Alzheimer's patient and detectives who used ""precise location information positioning"" to get ""within 42 feet of the suspect's location"" in a murder case. Asked about Securus's vetting of surveillance requests, a company spokesman said that it required customers to upload a legal document, such as a warrant or affidavit, and certify that the activity was authorized. ""Securus is neither a judge nor a district attorney, and the responsibility of ensuring the legal adequacy of supporting documentation lies with our law enforcement customers and their counsel,"" the spokesman said in a statement. Securus offers services only to law enforcement and corrections facilities, and not all officials at a given location have access to the system, the spokesman said. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, wrote in a letter this week to the Federal Communications Commission that Securus confirmed that it did not ""conduct any review of surveillance requests."" The senator said relying on customers to provide documentation was inadequate. ""Wireless carriers have an obligation to take affirmative steps to verify law enforcement requests,"" he wrote, adding that Securus did not follow those procedures. The service provided by Securus reveals a potential weakness in a system that is supposed to protect the private information of millions of cellphone users. With customers' consent, carriers sell the ability to acquire location data for marketing purposes like providing coupons when someone is near a business, or services like roadside assistance or bank fraud protection. Companies that use the data generally sign contracts pledging to get people's approval -- through a response to a text message, for example, or the push of a button on a menu -- or to otherwise use the data legally. But the contracts between the companies, including Securus, are ""the legal equivalent of a pinky promise,"" Mr. Wyden wrote. The F.C.C. said it was reviewing the letter. Courts are split on whether investigators need a warrant based on probable cause to acquire location data. In some states, a warrant is required for any sort of cellphone tracking. In other states, it is needed only if an investigator wants the data in real time. And in others no warrant is needed at all. The Justice Department has said its policy is to get warrants for real-time tracking. The Supreme Court has ruled that putting a GPS tracker on a car counts as a search under the Fourth Amendment, but this was because installing the device involved touching a person's property -- something that doesn't happen when a cellphone is pinged. Phone companies have a legal responsibility under the Telecommunications Act to protect consumer data, including call location, and can provide it in response to a legal order or sell it for use with customer consent. But lawyers interviewed by The New York Times disagreed on whether location information that was not gathered during the course of a call had the same protections under the law. As long as they are following their own privacy policies, carriers ""are largely free to do what they want with the information they obtain, including location information, as long as it's unrelated to a phone call,"" said Albert Gidari, the consulting director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society and a former technology and telecommunications lawyer. Even when the phone is not making a call, the system receives location data, accurate within a few hundred feet, by communicating with the device and asking it which cellphone towers it is near. Other experts said the law should apply for any communications on a network, not just phone calls. ""If the phone companies are giving someone a direct portal into the real-time location data on all of their customers, they should be policing it,"" said Laura Moy, the deputy director of the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology. Mr. Wyden, in his letter to the F.C.C., also said that carriers had an obligation to verify whether law enforcement requests were legal. But Securus cuts the carriers out of the review process, because the carriers do not receive the legal documents. The letter called for an F.C.C. investigation into Securus, as well as the phone companies and their protections of user data. Mr. Wyden also sent letters to the major carriers, seeking audits of their relationships with companies that buy consumer data. Representatives for AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon said the companies had received the letters and were investigating. ""If this company is, in fact, doing this with our customers' data, we will take steps to stop it,"" said Rich Young, a Verizon spokesman. T-Mobile said it ""would take appropriate action"" if it found any misuse of data. AT&T also said it followed industry ""best practices"" in handling data, and Sprint said it shared location information only with customer consent or in response to lawful requests. Privacy concerns about Securus and location services were raised to the F.C.C. last year before the company's sale to Platinum Equity, a private equity firm, for about $1.5 billion. Lee Petro, a lawyer representing a group of inmate family members, wrote letters urging the commission to reject the deal, based in part on concerns about locating people who spoke with inmates over the phone. Securus, founded in Dallas in 1986, has marketed its location service as a way for officials to monitor where inmates placed calls. Securus has said this would block escape attempts and the smuggling of contraband into jails and prisons, and help track calls to areas ""known for generating illegal activity."" In an email, Securus said the service was based on cell tower information, not on phone GPS. Securus received the data from a mobile marketing company called 3Cinteractive, according to 2013 documents from the Florida Department of Corrections. Securus said that for confidentiality reasons it could not confirm whether that deal was still in place, but a spokesman for Mr. Wyden said the company told the senator's office it was. In turn, 3Cinteractive got its data from LocationSmart, a firm known as a location aggregator, according to documents from those companies. LocationSmart buys access to the data from all the major American carriers, it says. LocationSmart and 3Cinteractive did not respond to requests for comment. Securus said it got consent before tracking phone calls made from prisons, requiring those on the receiving end to press a button agreeing to the collection of the data. The location service has proved to be a selling point. Matthew Thomas, chief deputy of the Pinal County Sheriff's Office in Arizona, said that the department had been using Securus's location tool for about a month, and that it had already come in handy. ""We use it for search-and-rescue operations, and at the jail they use it to maintain security and to put cases together,"" he said. Mr. Thomas said that only three people in the office could log in to the system, and that the office did monthly audits to ensure its proper use. About three weeks ago, Mr. Thomas said, someone mailed a letter containing methamphetamine to an inmate. By using the tool, Mr. Thomas said, investigators were able to link phone calls between the address and the inmate and make an arrest. For search-and-rescue cases, Mr. Thomas said, the Securus tool was more efficient than requesting data through the phone companies. ""It makes it a lot faster response for our crew,"" he said. In such instances, the people being located cannot give consent, so the official is supposed to upload a warrant, affidavit or court order to justify the surveillance. Securus said that it had cooperated with officials investigating the case in Missouri. Mr. Hutcheson, the defendant in the surveillance case, was charged with forgery in state court last year and also by a federal grand jury in March over similar offenses related to the phone pinging. He was removed from his duties as sheriff in 2017 after an inmate's death, though he was not charged with a crime in that matter. The Highway Patrol officers who were allegedly tracked filed suit in federal court. Mr. Hutcheson's lawyer declined to comment on the litigation. Timothy Williams contributed reporting.

Mark Zuckerberg to Meet European Parliament Members Over Facebook's Data Use,"LONDON -- Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, plans to meet with members of the European Parliament as early as next week, the latest stop in a wide-ranging apology tour over the social network's use of people's personal data. Mr. Zuckerberg's decision to travel to Brussels comes as Facebook faces a barrage of public criticism over how the data of tens of millions of its users was harvested without their consent, as well as concerns over the company's role in elections around the world and questions over whether it has moved quickly enough to remove inflammatory content.  His visit will involve a closed-door session with leaders of the European Parliament's various blocs and the head of the body's civil liberties committee, which is holding hearings on Facebook's practices, as well as a stop in Paris, where Mr. Zuckerberg is set to have lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss a range of issues. Senior European officials and lawmakers were quick to question why Mr. Zuckerberg's meeting in Brussels would be private. While the Facebook chief executive had been hesitant to appear before government inquiries in the past, opting to send lawyers or senior deputies in his stead, he faced a two-day public grilling in Congress last month. His planned appearance in Brussels highlights the breadth of the international concern over how Facebook failed to prevent political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica from obtaining and using the data of many as 87 million of its users. ""Our citizens deserve a full and detailed explanation,"" the European Parliament's president, Antonio Tajani, said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""I welcome Mark Zuckerberg's decision to appear in person."" Mr. Tajani added: ""It is a step in the right direction toward restoring confidence."" A Facebook spokesman confirmed Mr. Zuckerberg's visit and said the company had accepted the legislature's ""proposal to meet with leaders of the European Parliament and appreciate the opportunity for dialogue, to listen to their views and show the steps we are taking to better protect people's privacy."" The meeting in Brussels is likely to take place next Tuesday or Wednesday, officials said. The proceedings will not be televised. A spokesman for Mr. Tajani said lawmakers in attendance will be able to speak freely about it, and a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be released afterward. The format of the meeting was the result of weeks of tense negotiations between Mr. Tajani's office and Facebook, according to Pedro López de Pablo, a spokesman for the European People's Party, the biggest party in parliament, which endorsed Mr. Tajani's proposed format. Still, one European lawmaker who was invited to the meeting with Mr. Zuckerberg said he would not attend if it was not made public. ""It must be a public hearing -- why not a Facebook Live?"" said Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of a liberal group in the European Parliament. The prospect of Mr. Zuckerberg publicly testifying before the European Parliament would have raised the profile of an institution whose 751 members rarely make international headlines. The body does not directly regulate Facebook or other technology companies. Yet Europe has won a reputation in recent years as the technology industry's toughest watchdog. Officials in the region have investigated Facebook for the improper handling of customer data, fined Amazon and other companies over their tax practices and penalized firms like Google for antitrust violations. The timing of Mr. Zuckerberg's announcement, and of his visit to Brussels, coincides with Europe's introduction next week of the world's most aggressive rules for protecting data privacy. Under the new rules, called the General Data Protection Regulation, which will be enacted on May 25, regulators in the bloc's 28 member states will get the power to fine companies up to 4 percent of their global revenue for violations -- a sum equivalent to $1.6 billion in Facebook's case. On Wednesday, European leaders plan to discuss data protection, the scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and the impact the issue has had on elections in the region, according to Vera Jourova, the region's justice commissioner. ""It shows Zuckerberg really is worried about the effects of regulation and the potential for more,"" said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University who focuses on antitrust issues and intellectual property law. Mr. Carrier added that the trip demonstrated the leading role Europe plays in regulating the tech sector. Most concerning for Mr. Zuckerberg and others in Silicon Valley, Mr. Carrier said, was a broader skepticism of the industry. ""Big tech is under the public microscope from the left and the right,"" he said. Mr. Zuckerberg's trip to Brussels will be another stop on what has been has been a lengthy contrition tour meant to stem the public outcry over Facebook's handling of user data. The chief executive posted a public apology on Facebook before testifying before Congress last month, accepting personal responsibility for the issue and vowing to ""step up."" Since then, the Silicon Valley company has begun an advertising campaign in which it has promised to do more to clean up the platform. [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] Facebook has also announced new privacy and security settings that give people more control over their data. This week, the company said it had suspended 200 third-party apps pending a further review of how they had handled Facebook data. But Mr. Zuckerberg has some limits. On Monday, Facebook said the chief executive would not appear before a British parliamentary committee that has repeatedly asked that he answer questions in person. In a letter, the company said it was declining an invitation from the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which has criticized Facebook for responding to its inquiry into how the company handles British citizens' data with ""insufficient"" evidence.

"Mark Zuckerberg to Apologize Again, This Time to European Parliament","SAN FRANCISCO -- Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, plans to strike a conciliatory note when he speaks to members of the European Parliament on Tuesday, in the latest stop on his apology tour for the social network's mishandling of user information. Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to stick to what has become a well-used script when he appears before European lawmakers in Brussels on Tuesday evening. The chief executive intends to say that Facebook did not do enough to prevent the social network from being used for harm, according to an excerpt from his prepared remarks viewed by The New York Times.  ""Whether it's fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing people's information, we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibilities,"" Mr. Zuckerberg plans to say, according to the prepared remarks. ""That was a mistake, and I'm sorry."" The language closely mirrors what Mr. Zuckerberg told members of Congress last month when he went to Washington for a two-day grilling over how Facebook handled the data of tens of millions of its users. The Times and others had revealed in March that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly used the information of Facebook membersto build psychographic profiles of American voters, setting off a data privacy storm. Since then, Mr. Zuckerberg has posted a public apology for the scandal, accepting personal responsibility for the data leak and vowing to ""step up."" The Silicon Valley company has also announced new privacy and security settings and begun an advertising campaign in which it has promised to clean up the social network. In his appearance in front of Congress last month, Mr. Zuckerberg said, ""We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry."" Mr. Zuckerberg has been under pressure for weeks to appear in front of lawmakers in Europe, where officials have been more proactive than in the United States in regulating the tech giants. His appearance before the European Parliament on Tuesday comes just days before the region's introduction of new regulations for protecting data privacy, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Under the rules, European regulators will have the power to fine companies up to 4 percent of their global revenue for violations -- a sum equivalent to $1.6 billion in Facebook's case. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] Mr. Zuckerberg's decision to meet with members of the European Parliament was disclosed last week, when Antonio Tajani, the president of the body, tweeted that the chief executive would visit this week. It quickly became clear that the conditions for Mr. Zuckerberg's appearance were favorable for him because the European Parliament does not directly regulate Facebook or other technology companies and because it had agreed to a closed-door session with the chief executive. That created a backlash, with several European lawmakers quickly threatening to not attend the meeting if it was not made public. On Sunday, Mr. Tajani tweeted that it was ""great news"" that Mr. Zuckerberg had agreed to a live web broadcast of the session after all. Facebook accepted a livestream after fears that a boycott by European lawmakers would grab even more headlines and detract from the message of the meeting, according to an official within Facebook, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg is also expected to assure European lawmakers that Facebook is ""committed to Europe,"" according to a copy of his prepared remarks. He plans to cite Facebook's European headquarters in Ireland as an example, as well as the company's offices in London, where the social network has its largest engineering team outside of the United States. ""By the end of 2018, Facebook will employ 10,000 people across 12 European cities -- up from 7,000 today. And we will continue to invest,"" Mr. Zuckerberg intends to say. ""Europeans make up a large and incredibly important part of our global community."" After Mr. Zuckerberg testifies to the European Parliament, he is scheduled to make other stops in Europe. On Wednesday, he is set to have lunch with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris to discuss a range of issues. Mr. Zuckerberg will also be interviewed onstage at the Viva Technology conference in Paris on Thursday in a conversation that will be livestreamed. Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.

I Have Updated My Personal Privacy Policy; Loose Ends,"Please note that as of today, I have changed my terms and conditions and updated my Personal Privacy Policy in accordance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations. While the G.D.P.R. is a European law, my Personal Privacy Policy applies to everyone, since I don't really have any friends who live in Europe. These changes are aimed at clarifying the information I collect and how I use it.  If you tell me that I need to keep something 100 percent secret, I will take it to the grave. If you merely say, ""Don't tell anyone,"" I might tell my husband, but only because I know he won't tell anyone else. If you tell me something and then later say, ""Don't tell anyone,"" I cannot be expected to uphold this request, because you told me your secret before I agreed to these terms. This particularly applies if several hours have elapsed between the secret and the edict not to tell anyone. If you are my sister and you say, ""Don't tell Mom,"" I never tell Mom, and that policy will remain the same. However, if you are my son and you say, ""Don't tell Daddy,"" if it's something really cute, I probably will tell Daddy (although I might add, ""Don't let Johnny know I told you this""). If you drew Minecraft-inspired art on the walls, I definitely have to tell Daddy. As for data storage, I have a notoriously terrible memory. Therefore, I am unlikely to store your personal data for any length of time. For my neighbors who have given me the code to their alarm system, I have probably forgotten it and have not written it down anywhere, so you'll have to just tell me again the next time you want me to feed your cat while you're away. If I met you once, particularly if I met you along with many other people at the same time, there is a 5 percent chance of me remembering your name. If you have more than one child and they look anything alike at all, the chances of me mixing up your children's names are 75 percent, even though I have tried to create a mnemonic device to remember which kid is which. You can now ask me when your birthday is and I will have to honestly tell you I have no idea without consulting Facebook. Thank you for being my friend. I hope you will continue to enjoy my friendship and ability to keep most things private. As always, if you have any questions about these changes to my Personal Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out. My Personal Privacy Policy dictates that I will not share any messages I receive with anyone else, unless they're really funny, in which case any expectation of privacy becomes null and void.

Orlando Pulls the Plug on Its Amazon Facial Recognition Program,"Amid a growing outcry about privacy concerns by civil liberties groups, officials in Orlando, Fla., said Monday that the city's Police Department was, for now, ending a pilot program to use Amazon Rekognition facial technology.  About two years ago, Amazon introduced an online service that could help identify faces and other objects in images. The retail giant was soon pitching that technology to law enforcement agencies, saying the program could aid criminal investigations by recognizing suspects in photos and videos. The Orlando Police Department and the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon were among the first to try the program. The program thrust Amazon into the center of a heated debate around the role of facial recognition in law enforcement. Proponents of the technology see it as a powerful weapon for catching criminals, while critics see it as an instrument of mass surveillance. In recent weeks, various civil rights organizations had pushed Amazon and law enforcement agencies to not use the image recognition system. They expressed concerns that it could be used to track protesters or others whom authorities see as suspicious, rather than being limited to individuals who are committing crimes. In a letter dated Monday that was sent to Orlando's mayor, Buddy Dyer, and City Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida warned that such surveillance systems ""enable the mass location tracking of residents without criminal suspicion"" and asked that the use of such systems be immediately suspended. In a joint statement, the city and the Police Department said the pilot program ended last week when the contract with Amazon expired. The move was earlier reported by the Florida Politics website. Amazon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Still, Orlando left the door open to continuing the pilot program at a later date. ""The City of Orlando is always looking for new solutions to further our ability to keep our residents and visitors safe,"" the joint statement said. ""Partnering with innovative companies to test new technology -- while also ensuring we uphold privacy laws and in no way violate the rights of others -- is critical to us as we work to further keep our community safe."" In Washington County, Ore., the technology is fully operational and has been used for about a year and a half, said Jeff Talbot, a deputy officer and the public information officer for the Sheriff's Office. In an email, he said the technology was used to identify criminal suspects against jail booking photos, which are part of the public record. ""The Sheriff's Office has not, and will not, utilize this technology for mass or real-time surveillance,"" Mr. Talbot said. ""That use is prohibited by both Oregon state law and our own policy.""

How Smart TVs in Millions of U.S. Homes Track More Than What's On Tonight,"The growing concern over online data and user privacy has been focused on tech giants like Facebook and devices like smartphones. But people's data is also increasingly being vacuumed right out of their living rooms via their televisions, sometimes without their knowledge. In recent years, data companies have harnessed new technology to immediately identify what people are watching on internet-connected TVs, then using that information to send targeted advertisements to other devices in their homes. Marketers, forever hungry to get their products in front of the people most likely to buy them, have eagerly embraced such practices. But the companies watching what people watch have also faced scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates over how transparent they are being with users. Samba TV is one of the bigger companies that track viewer information to make personalized show recommendations. The company said it collected viewing data from 13.5 million smart TVs in the United States, and it has raised $40 million in venture funding from investors including Time Warner , the cable operator Liberty Global and the billionaire Mark Cuban.  Samba TV has struck deals with roughly a dozen TV brands -- including Sony, Sharp, TCL and Philips -- to place its software on certain sets. When people set up their TVs, a screen urges them to enable a service called Samba Interactive TV, saying it recommends shows and provides special offers ""by cleverly recognizing onscreen content."" But the screen, which contains the enable button, does not detail how much information Samba TV collects to make those recommendations. Samba TV declined to provide recent statistics, but one of its executives said at the end of 2016 that more than 90 percent of people opted in. Once enabled, Samba TV can track nearly everything that appears on the TV on a second-by-second basis, essentially reading pixels to identify network shows and ads, as well as programs on Netflix and HBO and even video games played on the TV. Samba TV has even offered advertisers the ability to base their targeting on whether people watch conservative or liberal media outlets and which party's presidential debate they watched. The big draw for advertisers -- which have included Citi and JetBlue in the past, and now Expedia -- is that Samba TV can also identify other devices in the home that share the TV's internet connection. Samba TV, which says it has adhered to privacy guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, does not directly sell its data. Instead, advertisers can pay the company to direct ads to other gadgets in a home after their TV commercials play, or one from a rival airs. Advertisers can also add to their websites a tag from Samba TV that allows them to determine if people visit after watching one of their commercials. If it sounds a lot like the internet -- a company with little name recognition tracking your behavior, then slicing and dicing it to sell ads -- that's the point. But consumers do not typically expect the so-called idiot box to be a savant. ""It's still not intuitive that the box maker or the software embedded by the box maker is going to be doing this,"" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union and a former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission. ""I'd like to see companies do a better job of making that clear and explaining the value proposition to consumers."" About 45 percent of TV households in the United States had at least one smart TV at the end of 2017, IHS Markit data showed. Samba TV, which is based in San Francisco and has about 250 employees, competes against several companies, including Inscape, the data arm of the consumer electronics maker Vizio, and a start-up called Alphonso. It can be a cutthroat business. Samba has sued Alphonso for patent infringement. Last year, Vizio paid $2.2 million to settle claims by the Federal Trade Commission and the state of New Jersey that it was collecting and selling viewing data from millions of smart TVs without the knowledge or consent of set owners. In December, The New York Times reported that Alphonso was using gaming apps to gain access to smartphone microphones and listen for audio signals in TV ads and shows. Samba TV's language is clear, said Bill Daddi, a spokesman. ""Each version has clearly identified that we use technology to recognize what's onscreen, to create benefit for the consumer as well as Samba, its partners and advertisers,"" he added. Still, David Kitchen, a software engineer in London, said he was startled to learn how Samba TV worked after encountering its opt-in screen during a software update on his Sony Bravia set. The opt-in read:  ""Interact with your favorite shows. Get recommendations based on the content you love. Connect your devices for exclusive content and special offers. By cleverly recognizing onscreen content, Samba Interactive TV lets you engage with your TV in a whole new way."" The language prompted Mr. Kitchen to research Samba TV's data collection and raise concerns online about its practices. Enabling the service meant that consumers agreed to Samba TV's terms of service and privacy policy, the opt-in screen said. But consumers couldn't read those unless they went online or clicked through to another screen on the TV. The privacy policy, which provided more details about the information collected through the software, was more than 4,000 words, and the terms exceeded 6,500 words. ""The thing that really struck me was this seems like quite an enormous ask for what seems like a silly, trivial feature,"" Mr. Kitchen said. ""You appear to opt into a discovery-recommendation service, but what you're really opting into is pervasive monitoring on your TV."" Ashwin Navin, Samba TV's chief executive, said that the company's use of data for advertising is made clear through the reference to ""special offers,"" and that the opt-in language ""is meant to be as simple as it possibly can be."" ""It's pretty upfront about the fact that this is what the software does -- it reads what's on the screen to drive recommendations and special offers,"" Mr. Navin said. ""We've taken an abundance of caution to put consumers in control of the data and give them disclosure on what we use the data for."" Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said few people review the fine print in their zeal to set up new televisions. He said the notice should also describe Samba TV's ""device map,"" which matches TV content to mobile gadgets, according to a document on its website, and can help the company track users ""in their office, in line at the food truck and on the road as they travel."" Mr. Brookman of the Consumers Union, who reviewed the opt-in screen, said the trade-off was not clear for consumers. ""Maybe the interactive features are so fantastic that they don't mind that the company's logging all the stuff that they're watching, but I don't think that's evident from this,"" he said. Citi and JetBlue, which appear in some Samba TV marketing materials, said they stopped working with the company in 2016 but not before publicly endorsing its effectiveness. JetBlue hailed in a news release the increase in site visits driven by syncing its online ads with TV ads, while Christine DiLandro, a marketing director at Citi, joined Mr. Navin at an industry event at the end of 2015. In a video of the event, Ms. DiLandro described the ability to target people with digital ads after the company's TV commercials aired as ""a little magical."" The Times is among the websites that allow advertisers to use data from Samba to track if people who see their ads visit their websites, but a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said that the company did that ""simply as a matter of convenience for our clients"" and that it was not an endorsement of Samba TV's technology. Companies like Samba TV are also a boon for TV makers, whose profit margins from selling sets can be slim. Samba TV essentially pays companies like Sony to include its software. Samba TV said ""our business model does subsidize a small piece of the television hardware,"" though it declined to provide further details. Smart TV companies aren't subject to the stricter rules and regulations regarding viewing data that have traditionally applied to cable companies, helping fuel ""this rise of weird ways to figure out what someone's watching,"" said Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University and a former technology adviser at the Federal Communications Commission. The smart TV companies are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Mayer said, meaning that ""as long as you're truthful to consumers, even if you make it really hard to exercise choices or don't offer choices at all, you probably don't have much of a legal issue."" Mr. Daddi said the trade commission had held up Samba TV as ""an exemplary model of data privacy and opt-in policies,"" pointing to its participation in a smart TV workshop the agency held in late 2016. A commission spokeswoman said that it invited a diverse array of panelists to events and that ""an invitation to participate in an F.T.C. event does not convey an endorsement of that company or organization."" She added that the agency does not ""endorse or bless companies' practices."" Mr. Daddi added: ""We have millions of viewers who have explicitly opted into our service and have continued to use it for years. So it is a fair argument to make that far more consumers are satisfied with Samba than surprised by it."" Some worry, more broadly, about the TV industry's increasing ability to use and share information about what people are watching with the internet ad ecosystem. ""I think people have rebelled to the online targeted ad experience,"" Mr. Brookman said, ""and I think they wouldn't necessarily expect that from their TV."" Kevin Roose contributed reporting.

Hold the Phone! My Unsettling Discoveries About How Our Gestures Online Are Tracked,"I was nearing the end of a five-hour marathon of meetings about Mastercard's cybersecurity efforts when an executive made a passing comment that snapped me out of my mild stupor. A small Canadian company that Mastercard had recently acquired, called NuData, had technology that could potentially stop someone from using stolen credentials to log into a website or mobile app, he said. NuData's software measured things called ""behavioral biometrics"" -- the individual gestures we make as we interact with our computers and smartphones. NuData tracked how people typed, how they tapped on their phone screens, how fast they moved their mouses and hundreds of other physical traits. Together, those could be combined into a spookily accurate analysis of whether online users were the people they claimed to be.  That sounded like something out of ""Minority Report"" or ""Gattaca."" Was this an experiment being done in a lab, I asked skeptically, or was it actually in use in the real world, by paying customers? It was real, the Mastercard executive answered, but NuData couldn't introduce me to any of its customers. They all had nondisclosure agreements, and none wanted to talk. Intrigued, I started asking bank executives and others in the security field about these kinds of biometric tools. Did they use them? Did they know anyone who did? None of the American banks I asked would tell me if they used such software, but industry analysts started pointing me toward vendors that sell it. From them, I learned about how advanced these tools had become -- and how invisible they are. Customers never know when their keyboard taps and phone screen swipes are being tracked. One thing that struck me as I reported the story, which ran in Tuesday's paper, is how quickly this technology has outraced the regulations around it. There are no federal laws that govern how companies collect, use and protect biometric data. The strictest state law, in Illinois, focuses on physical traits, like fingerprints and facial geometry. It doesn't cover behavioral biometrics. The idea of collecting such data ""wasn't even remotely contemplated"" 10 years ago when the law was written, Matthew Kugler, a law professor at Northwestern University who specializes in privacy issues, told me. I learned that several large banks, and some household-name online retailers, are using this kind of software. Almost none would go on the record about it. I kept asking: Why not? If this is such a great security tool, shouldn't you tout it? Of the two dozen analysts, entrepreneurs, security experts and banking executives I spoke with during my reporting, only a handful were willing to be named. Most financial companies cited internal policies of never talking publicly about specific security measures. The more information you make public about your defenses, the theory goes, the easier it is for bad actors to evade them. But a few also admitted that they didn't want their customers to be creeped out. The idea of companies watching how we type and tap is unnerving. One retailer I often shop at uses behavioral trackers, I found out. Now, when I'm scrolling through shoes and tossing them into my shopping cart, I have a jarring mental image of computers silently recording my clicks, pauses, mouse swoops and typos. We're still in the early days of this kind of surveillance. Right now, it's largely the province of banks and large retailers -- companies with a strong financial motive to identify and block digital thieves. The scale of the problem they face is staggering. Shuman Ghosemajumder, the chief technology officer at Shape Security, which makes fraud-blocking software, said he knew of one high-end retailer that had a 99 percent attack rate last year on its login page. Only one in 100 visitors was a legitimate shopper; the rest were criminals trying to break into those customers' accounts. Soon, though, this kind of technology could be used much more broadly. Google experimented a few years ago with eliminating passwords entirely on Android phones and instead using a mix of physical and behavioral biometrics to identify users. (A company spokesman wouldn't comment on what became of that project.) Darpa, the Pentagon's research agency, has tested it out for protecting workstations and devices. There are lots of good arguments for highly personalized security authentication. As giant data breaches like those at Yahoo and Equifax remind us far too often, keeping our personal information secret has become impossible. No one wants to log into one of their online shopping accounts and discover that a thief has gained access and gone on a spending spree. But the lack of transparency around behavioral data collection is also scary. Companies that possess very sensitive information, like our banking records or medical information, are usually heavily regulated. There are restrictions on what they can do with the data they collect. Some of the vendors that sell behavioral biometric tools have amassed profiles on tens of millions of people. I shop at merchants that use technology from Forter, which said its database has profiles on 175 million people. My own data is in there. The only limits on what such companies can do with that information are the agreements they've struck with their customers, banks and retailers. That's not a very strong safeguard. And if a company with biometric data wanted to use the information for purposes beyond security, like searching for clues about a customer's physical health or mental sharpness, there's very little to stop it. Once again, the tech industry has given us very powerful tools -- and zoomed right past any public discussion about how and when it's O.K. to use them.

Let's Retire the Phrase 'Privacy Policy',"True or false: ""When a website has a privacy policy, it means the site will not share my information with other websites or companies without my permission."" According to my research -- a nationally representative phone survey conducted in January and February -- a majority of Americans think this is true.  It isn't. Not even close.  Over the past 15 years, I've conducted six national surveys with colleagues about how people see and think about their privacy in both the online and offline worlds. In each survey we've included a statement roughly like the one above. The picture is consistent: When people see the phrase ""privacy policy,"" most assume their information is kept private. It's a misleading label. In reality, these policies explain how companies will use your information -- because they are using it. To be clear, it is lawful -- and common -- for websites to trade most types of information about us without asking. The reason ""privacy policy"" is a ubiquitous phrase is that since 1998, the Federal Trade Commission has strongly suggested that all websites (and, later, all apps) include a disclosure about what they do with visitor data and what choices visitors have regarding those uses. What lies behind these links is a cavalcade of disclosures of how businesses across the internet track us, target us and trade our information. Consider Target's privacy policy, which is perfectly legal and not at all unusual. Target collects data about you across its website and app, in addition to knowing what you buy. It uses the information for its own marketing purposes. It also allows ""third-party companies"" to collect ""certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications."" In other words, it can share the data it collects with just about anyone. But Target is not just profiling you based on how you shop with Target. It may also collect what you say on any blogs, chat rooms and social networks you use, and it may obtain ""demographic and other information"" about you from ""third parties.""  You have to assume that Target can purchase any known information about you held by any other company. Not even your body is off limits -- cameras in some stores ""may use biometrics, including facial recognition,"" for theft prevention and security. Our surveys consistently show that Americans dislike being tracked. Why, then, aren't Americans more angry and opposed to how often and extensively businesses track them? One reason: Most Americans don't read privacy policies, and so they aren't aware of what is going on. The words ""privacy policy"" may well be a big part of the problem. The very fact that a company seems to have a policy on privacy gives consumers a false belief that the company won't share their information without permission -- a reason not to click and learn more. In addition to the ""privacy policy"" label defusing public anger against commercial surveillance, it may also distract people from the need for effective privacy laws. Two of our surveys asked people whether they agreed or disagreed that ""existing laws and organizational practices provide a reasonable level of protection for consumer privacy today.""  We foundthat among people who understood the ""privacy policy"" label's correct meaning, a majority thought privacy laws needed to be stronger. By contrast, among those who misunderstood what ""privacy policy"" means, a majority saw no need for organizational and legislative changes in the service of privacy. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the term ""privacy policy"" benefits data collectors over the public. The label's phrasing was not a result of research or agency deliberation. In fact, back in 1998 the F.T.C. used the phrase ""information practice statement"" for the data-disclosure document it wanted. It didn't take hold, possibly because companies realized that ""privacy policy"" embodied the ambiguity they wanted. Fifteen years of research consistently shows that the label is deceptive -- depending on the survey, between 54 percent and 73 percent of Americans assume companies won't share their information without permission. One solution would be for the F.T.C., which is mandated to police deceptive corporate practices, to rule that only sites and apps that don't share people's information without their permission can use that phrase. Otherwise, they should use a more accurate label, such as ""how we use your information."" Companies don't want people to realize how extensively they use our information and are likely to object to this new, clearer phrasing. Yet it is a struggle worth pursuing in the interest of creating transparency around the name of a document that has been mistitled and misunderstood since its inception.

Russian Hackers Train Focus on U.S. Power Grid,"WASHINGTON -- State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives. Despite attempts to infiltrate the online accounts of two Senate Democrats up for re-election, intelligence officials said they have seen little activity by Russian military hackers aimed at either major American political figures or state voter registration systems.    By comparison, according to intelligence officials and executives of the companies that oversee the world's computer networks, there is surprisingly far more effort directed at implanting malware in the electrical grid.   The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, but their conclusions were confirmed by several executives of technology and technology security firms.    This week, the Department of Homeland Security reported that over the last year, Russia's military intelligence agency had infiltrated the control rooms of power plants across the United States. In theory, that could enable it to take control of parts of the grid by remote control.   While the department cited ''hundreds of victims'' of the attacks, far more than they had previously acknowledged, there is no evidence that the hackers tried to take over the plants, as Russian actors did in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.   In interviews, American intelligence officials said that the department had understated the scope of the threat. So far the White House has said little about the intrusions other than raise the fear of such breaches to maintain old coal plants in case they are needed to recover from a major attack.   On Friday, President Trump was briefed on government efforts to protect the coming midterm elections from what a White House statement described as ''malign foreign actors.'' It said it was giving cybersecurity support to state and local governments to protect their election systems.   ''The president has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation state to other malicious actors,'' the statement said.   It is possible that Russian hackers are holding their fire until closer to Election Day in November. Given the indictments this month of 12 Russian military officers who are accused of American election interference, the agency once known as the G.R.U. may be all too aware it is being closely watched by the National Security Agency and other American intelligence services.   But that has not completely deterred Russia's intelligence agencies from targeting politicians.   Microsoft announced at a security conference last week that it stopped an attack last fall aimed at congressional staff offices. While the company did not identify who was targeted, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who faces a tight race for re-election, said on Thursday night that her office had been struck in what she called an unsuccessful attack.   She acknowledged the breach only after The Daily Beast identified her as one of the lawmakers whose offices had been the target of an effort to obtain passwords.   ''Russia continues to engage in cyberwarfare against our democracy,'' Ms. McCaskill said in a statement. ''While this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this. I will not be intimidated.''   American officials said it was unclear whether the attack was related to Ms. McCaskill's re-election bid. She serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and one senior official said it was possible that the hackers were seeking a way into the panel's access to classified military operations and budgets.   Officials of Microsoft, which detected the intrusion in October and November, agreed.   ''When we see an attempt like this, we have no way of discerning what the attacker's motivation is,'' Tom Burt, the vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft, said on Friday.   Ms. McCaskill was one of two legislators whose offices Microsoft found were being targeted by the Russian hackers; the company has declined to name the other. (Mr. Burt initially told the Aspen Security Forum last week that three members of Congress had been targeted, but he said on Friday that the many accounts that were targeted now appear to have belonged to employees from only two legislative offices.)   Microsoft blocked the attacks with a special court order that allowed it to seize control of internet domains created by Russians that appeared to be official Microsoft sites, but were not. The company has used that procedure at least three times against hackers who are linked to Russian military intelligence.   But beyond those attempts, Mr. Burt and several American intelligence officials said there have been surprisingly few cyberattack attempts directed at political leaders, at least compared with 2016.   ''We are not seeing the level of activity in the midterm elections that we saw two years ago,'' Mr. Burt said. ''But it is still early.''   In part that may be because midterm elections are far more difficult to influence than a presidential race. It would require separate interventions in more than 460 contests, many of which would be of little interest to a foreign power.   ''I see 2018 as a ramp-up to 2020,'' said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund. Ms. Rosenberger, a former State Department official and foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, has been leading one of the most comprehensive efforts to track and expose foreign influence in American elections.   She said the Russian intelligence hackers ''want to make a highly polarized electorate even more polarized and undermine faith in the election systems.''   In a presentation at the Aspen forum, the new chief of the United States Cyber Command spoke at length about a new approach of ''persistent engagement'' with American adversaries, an effort to see attacks amassing in networks overseas before they strike in the United States.   The commander, Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, who is also the director of the National Security Agency, said that he had set up a Russia small group after assuming command in the spring, but said nothing about its operations. The N.S.A. is responsible for defending government networks and conducting covert offensive operations.   He spent much of his talk describing the difficulties of countering states that ''operate below the threshold level of war,'' which is how he and other officials often refer to the Russian efforts to influence the election.   Last year, President Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, called the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election ''an ''act of war.'' The hackers are accused of stealing of the committee's data and then publishing stolen emails through a number of websites, including WikiLeaks.   Just as it is difficult to judge the intent of the Russian hackers in attacking Ms. McCaskill's office, it is hard to fully understand why they have put so much effort into installing ''implants'' -- hard-to-find malware -- in the utility operating systems.   The fear, of course, is that Russia may be planning to unplug American power systems in a time of conflict. But such an attack would almost certainly result in a military response, as General Nakasone obliquely suggested at the Aspen forum.   It is possible that the hackers are simply trying to demonstrate what they are capable of, just as they did in 2014 when they fought the N.S.A.'s efforts to force them from the White House's unclassified email systems.   In the cases described by the Department of Homeland Security, as presented to the electric utilities and outside experts, the Russian hackers went into the power plants through the networks of contractors, some of whom were ill-protected. Those contractors provided software to the utility company's systems. Then they used ''spearphishing'' emails, trying to trick utility operators into changing their passwords.   That is exactly the approach used against Ms. McCaskill's staff, the officials said.   Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.    "
The Crisis of Election Security; Feature,"It was mid-July 2016 when Neil Jenkins learned that someone had hacked the Illinois Board of Elections. Jenkins was a director in the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security, the domestic agency with a congressional mandate to protect ""critical infrastructure."" Although election systems were not yet formally designated as such -- that wouldn't happen until January 2017 -- it was increasingly clear that the presidential election was becoming a national-security issue. Just a month before, Americans had been confronted with the blockbuster revelation that Russian government actors had hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers and stolen private email and opposition research against Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate. And now, it emerged, someone was trying to infiltrate the election system itself. The Illinois intruders had quietly breached the network in June and spent weeks conducting reconnaissance. After alighting on the state's voter-registration database, they downloaded information on hundreds of thousands of voters. Then something went wrong, and the attackers crashed a server, alerting officials to their presence.  It soon became clear that this would not be the last attack. In early August, Jenkins learned of another breach, this one on an Arizona state website, and it appeared to come from one of the same I.P. addresses that had been used to attack Illinois. This time, the intruders installed malware, as if setting the stage for further assault. Then reports from other states began to pour in, saying that the same I.P. addresses appeared to be probing their voter-registration networks. Against that backdrop, the D.N.C. hack was looking less like an isolated incident. ""We started to ask: Are these things related?"" Jenkins recalled. ""Are they the same actors? Is this some kind of concerted effort?"" He and his team realized that if Russian hackers were trying to disrupt the coming elections, D.H.S. needed to quickly get in touch with the state and local officials who ran them. But whom do you call when there are more than 10,000 election jurisdictions in the United States? Jenkins at first assumed that each state had a chief information officer who oversaw election security -- but this turned out to be wrong. A staff member suggested that the Federal Election Commission must be the governing body over elections -- but the F.E.C., they quickly realized, was focused on campaign finance, not election systems. Then a colleague did a Google search on election administration and came across the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the federal body created by Congress in 2002 to serve as a federal liaison with state election officials. ""I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't know that the E.A.C. existed,"" Jenkins said. ""I would say that I'm not the only person working in the federal government that this was true for. This topic is not something that was really on anybody's big radar."" Jenkins planned a call for mid-August for his boss, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, to discuss the problem with members of the E.A.C. and the National Association of Secretaries of State. But Jenkins's knowledge of election hacking was limited to a conference panel he was on six months earlier about the security of internet voting. Although most American voters cast ballots in person or by mail, 31 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of internet voting to military personnel and citizens living overseas. Jenkins, concerned that Russian hackers might interfere with those ballots, intended to offer election officials a simple plan: ""We were going to tell them that internet voting wasn't safe, and it was a risk factor and you need to not do it."" But when Jenkins met E.A.C. officials and the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State for a brief discussion before the scheduled call, what was supposed to be a half-hour meeting bled into four hours, as he and his staff got a crash course in election administration. Internet voting, they learned, was the least of their concerns; the real problems were the machines used to cast and tally votes and the voter-registration databases the Russians had already shown interest in hacking. The entire system -- a Rube Goldberg mix of poorly designed machinery, from websites and databases that registered and tracked voters, to electronic poll books that verified their eligibility, to the various black-box systems that recorded, tallied and reported results -- was vulnerable. In August 2016, though, there was no time to address systemic problems. Many states would begin early voting in five to six weeks, and the machines themselves had to be programmed and locked down well in advance of Election Day. The Department of Homeland Security had to settle for doing Band-Aid security before the election, and even then only with states that requested help -- mostly this involved remote-scanning internet-facing servers for known software vulnerabilities that could be patched, and providing a list of security best practices, like making sure vote-tabulation machines were not connected to the internet. Jenkins said the problems the agency couldn't address were ""troubling"" but beyond its control. ""You could spend years working on connectivity between voting machines and ballot-creating devices and try to get those things fixed,"" he said. ""But when you're trying to do something quickly with a group of people who are resource-constrained as severely as election officials are, you kind of have to focus where you can focus."" Two years later, as the 2018 elections approach, the American intelligence community is issuing increasingly dire warnings about potential interference from Russia and other countries, but the voting infrastructure remains largely unchanged. D.H.S. has now conducted remote-scanning and on-site assessments of state and county election systems, but these are still largely Band-Aid measures applied to internet-facing servers. They don't address core vulnerabilities in voting machines or the systems used to program them. And they ignore the fact that many voting machines that elections officials insist are disconnected from the internet -- and therefore beyond the reach of hackers -- are in fact accessible by way of the modems they use to transmit vote totals on election night. Add to this the fact that states don't conduct robust postelection audits -- a manual comparison of paper ballots to digital tallies is the best method we have to detect when something has gone wrong in an election -- and there's a good chance we simply won't know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election. How did our election system get so vulnerable, and why haven't officials tried harder to fix it? The answer, ultimately, comes down to politics and money: The voting machines are made by well-connected private companies that wield immense control over their proprietary software, often fighting vigorously in court to prevent anyone from examining it when things go awry. In Ohio in 2004, for example, where John Kerry lost the presidential race following numerous election irregularities, Kerry's team was denied access to the voting-machine software. ""We were told by the court that you were not able to get that algorithm to check it, because it was proprietary information,"" Kerry recalled in a recent interview on WNYC's ""Brian Lehrer Show."" He was understandably rueful, arguing how wrong it was that elections are held under ""the purview of privately owned machines, where the public doesn't have the right to know whether the algorithm has been checked or whether they're hackable or not. And we now know they are hackable."" The ballot box is the foundation of any democracy. It's not too grand to say that if there's a failure in the ballot box, then democracy fails. If the people don't have confidence in the outcome of an election, then it becomes difficult for them to accept the policies and actions that pour forth from it. And in the United States, it's safe to say, though few may utter it publicly, that the ballot box has failed many times and is poised to fail again. There are roughly 350,000 voting machines in use in the country today, all of which fall into one of two categories: optical-scan machines or direct-recording electronic machines. Each of them suffers from significant security problems. With optical-scan machines, voters fill out paper ballots and feed them into a scanner, which stores a digital image of the ballot and records the votes on a removable memory card. The paper ballot, in theory, provides an audit trail that can be used to verify digital tallies. But not all states perform audits, and many that do simply run the paper ballots through a scanner a second time. Fewer than half the states do manual audits, and they typically examine ballots from randomly chosen precincts in a county, instead of a percentage of ballots from all precincts. If the randomly chosen precincts aren't ones where hacking occurred or where machines failed to accurately record votes, an audit won't reveal anything -- nor will it always catch problems with early-voting, overseas or absentee ballots, all of which are often scanned in county election offices, not in precincts. Direct-recording electronic machines, or D.R.E.s, present even more auditing problems. Voters use touch screens or other input devices to make selections on digital-only ballots, and votes are stored electronically. Many D.R.E.s have printers that produce what's known as a voter-verifiable paper audit trail -- a scroll of paper, behind a window, that voters can review before casting their ballots. But the paper trail doesn't provide the same integrity as full-size ballots and optical-scan machines, because a hacker could conceivably rig the machine to print a voter's selections correctly on the paper while recording something else on the memory card. About 80 percent of voters today cast ballots either on D.R.E.s that produce a paper trail or on scanned paper ballots. But five states still use paperless D.R.E.s exclusively, and an additional 10 states use paperless D.R.E.s in some jurisdictions. The voting-machine industry -- an estimated $300-million-a-year business -- has long been as troubling as the machines it makes, known for its secrecy, close political ties (overwhelmingly to the Republican Party) and a revolving door between vendors and election offices. More than a dozen companies currently sell voting equipment, but a majority of machines used today come from just four -- Diebold Election Systems, Election Systems &amp; Software (ES&amp;S), Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems. Diebold (later renamed Premier) and Sequoia are now out of business. Diebold's machines and customer contracts were sold to ES&amp;S and a Canadian company called Dominion, and Dominion also acquired Sequoia. This means that more than 80 percent of the machines in use today are under the purview of three companies -- Dominion, ES&amp;S and Hart InterCivic. Many of the products they make have documented vulnerabilities and can be subverted in multiple ways. Hackers can access voting machines via the cellular modems used to transmit unofficial results at the end of an election, or subvert back-end election-management systems -- used to program the voting machines and tally votes -- and spread malicious code to voting machines through them. Attackers could design their code to bypass pre-election testing and kick in only at the end of an election or under specific conditions -- say, when a certain candidate appears to be losing -- and erase itself afterward to avoid detection. And they could make it produce election results with wide margins to avoid triggering automatic manual recounts in states that require them when results are close. Hackers could also target voting-machine vendors and use this trusted channel to distribute their code. Last year a security researcher stumbled across an unsecured ES&amp;S server that left passwords exposed for its employee accounts. Although the passwords were encrypted, a nation-state with sufficient resources would most likely be able to crack them, the researcher noted. Since ES&amp;S creates ballot-definition files before each election for some customers -- the critical programming files that tell machines how to apportion votes based on a voter's screen touch or marks on a paper ballot -- a malicious actor able to get into ES&amp;S's network could conceivably corrupt these files so machines misinterpret a vote for Donald Trump, say, as one for his opponent, or vice versa. Did anything like that happen in 2016? The Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and election officials have all insisted that there is no evidence that Russian hackers altered votes in 2016. But the truth is that no one has really looked for evidence. Intelligence assessments are based on signals intelligence -- spying on Russian communications and computers for chatter or activity indicating that they altered votes -- not on a forensic examination of voting machines and election networks. ""We should always be careful to point out that there hasn't been any evidence that votes were changed in any election in this way, and that's a true fact,"" said Matt Blaze, a computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a voting-machine-security expert. ""It's just less comforting than it might sound at first glance, because we haven't looked very hard."" Even if experts were to look, it's not clear what they would find, he added. ""It's possible to do a pretty good job of erasing all the forensic evidence."" And targeting voting machines is just one way to subvert elections. A hacker (or inside operator) could target voters themselves by deleting their names from the voter roll and electronic poll book -- the device used at polling places to verify a voter's eligibility. Or change their precinct assignments to send them to the wrong location, creating chaos and frustration that causes them to leave without voting. Bad actors could also undermine election results by altering tallies as they are transmitted to county offices on election night or posted to public websites. Although these are unofficial results, any discrepancy between these and official tallies compiled days after an election would sow distrust in the outcome, particularly if the winner of a race changes. The stakes are high when it comes to election security, and the concerns about Russian hackers are warranted. But the focus on Russia, or any would-be election manipulators, ignores the underlying issue -- the myriad vulnerabilities that riddle the system and the ill-considered decisions that got us here. The mad history of election security in the United States is a history of how misguided politicians and naïve election officials allowed an unregulated industry to seize control of America's democratic infrastructure. [Read about Amendment 4, the ballot that could enfranchise more people at once than any single initiative since women's suffrage, but could also change the Florida electorate.] The ballot box is in the distressed state it is in today because of an overreaction -- or rather a wrong reaction -- to a previous systemic electoral breakdown: the presidential-election fiasco in Florida in 2000. Everyone remembers the dangling chads that led to a landmark Supreme Court decision and a nation divided over who won. But another election mishap occurred that night that got less attention, despite the fact that it played a significant role in pushing the presidential race into the hands of the justices. This one involved a memory card in Volusia County. Deborah Tannenbaum had a front-row seat for what occurred that night. A Democratic Party field director in Florida, she refreshed her web browser frequently as returns came in from around the county. At 10 p.m., Al Gore was ahead in Volusia, with 83,000 votes to George W. Bush's 62,000. Things were going well for Gore across the state, and exit polls projected a six-point lead for him. But then something changed. ""I had stepped out, and one of the assistants came, and he's just like, 'I need you to come here and verify the numbers,' "" Tannenbaum recalled. When she looked at the county's website, Gore's total had dropped 16,000 votes. Tannenbaum called the county election office, alarmed. ""I don't know what's going on down there, but you can't take away votes!"" she said. The mysterious drop would later be traced to Precinct 216, a community center in DeLand, where Gore's total was showing negative 16,022 votes. It wasn't the only mathematical absurdity in the tally. A Socialist Workers Party candidate named James Harris had 9,888 votes. But the DeLand precinct had only 585 registered voters, and only 219 of them cast ballots at the center that day. Unfortunately for Gore, reporters were focused on overall state returns and didn't notice the funny numbers. At 7:52 p.m., Voter News Service -- a consortium of media outlets reporting election results -- projected Gore the Florida winner based on exit polls. But when the Volusia County numbers changed at 10 p.m., and Brevard County subsequently posted results inadvertently missing 4,000 votes for Gore, Bush shot into the lead; news outlets retracted their call for Gore and called the state for Bush. Gore was on his way to make a concession speech at 3 a.m. when he learned the numbers were wrong. Volusia officials blamed the mishap on a faulty memory card. The county used optical-scan machines made by Global Election Systems (a Canadian company later acquired by Diebold and renamed Diebold Election Systems), which the county had used since 1996. When the election ended, poll workers were supposed to transmit results to the county election office via modem; but the transmission failed, so a worker drove the memory card in, where officials inserted it directly into the election-management system to tally results. Logs for that computer, however, showed two memory cards for Precinct 216 inserted, an hour apart. The vote totals went haywire after the second card was loaded. Beyond the mystery of the two cards, there was another problem with this explanation. A faulty memory card should produce an onscreen error message or cause a computer to lock up, not alter votes in one race while leaving others untouched. And what kind of faulty card deleted votes only for Gore, while adding votes to other candidates? Ultimately, the phantom card was forgotten in the battle that ensued over dangling chads in other counties. Gore's team requested manual recounts in four counties, including Volusia, but a Supreme Court ruling on Dec. 12 halted them, though not before Volusia completed its recount. The manual tally of optical-scan ballots in Precinct 216 gave Gore 193 votes, Bush 22 and Harris 0. Bush won Florida, and by extension the presidency, by just 537 votes. To this day, questions about the Volusia card remain unanswered. Internal emails from Global Election Systems later leaked to Bev Harris, an election-integrity activist, show that the manufacturer itself remained unsure about what happened. When a Volusia County elections worker named Lana Hires requested an explanation from Global, the response was vague. Talbot Iredale, a Global developer, responded that a corrupt memory card remained ""the most likely explanation for the problem but since I know nothing about the 'second' memory card I have no ability to confirm the probability of this."" He then suggested a more ominous explanation. ""There is always the possibility that the 'second memory card' or 'second upload' came from an unauthorized source."" To which a Global colleague replied: ""Heh. Second shooter theory. All we need now is a grassy knoll."" The memory card in Volusia vividly demonstrated the kind of problems that could occur if states expanded their use of electronic voting machines without proper safeguards. But even as security experts showed how malicious insiders and outsiders could subvert the machines, the warnings went ignored. A month after the Supreme Court decision, Representative Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, met with Representative Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican and his colleague on the House Administration Committee, to talk about election reform. Hoyer wanted to make sure that what happened with Florida's punch cards didn't happen again. So, unmindful of the lessons of Volusia County, they decided to draft a bill that would push states to get rid of punch-card systems as well as lever voting machines, a century-old mechanical technology still being used in some states, and replace them with new electronic voting systems. But beyond setting parameters to protect civil rights and prevent disenfranchisement, the federal government couldn't tell states how to run elections. So Hoyer and Ney devised a workaround: money. Their bill, the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, offered states $3.9 billion to help administer federal elections and buy new voting equipment. But the money came with a few conditions: States couldn't spend it on punch-card or lever machines, and if they wanted to use HAVA funds to replace these systems, they had to do so in time for the 2004 presidential elections (or by 2006 if they sought an extension). They also had to offer at least one accessible voting machine at each polling place so that disabled voters could cast ballots without assistance. And they had to consolidate county voter-registration files into a single statewide database to prevent voters from registering in multiple counties. HAVA also created a new agency -- the U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- to administer the funds to states and to serve as a clearinghouse for election best practices. Computers had been used in elections ever since the 1960s, when punch cards and computerized card readers and tabulators were introduced. And experts had been warning for just as long about the danger of placing too much trust in them. A 1969 front-page article in The Los Angeles Times described a ""war games"" exercise to determine if Los Angeles County's new computerized punch-card readers and tabulators could be rigged without detection. Three computer scientists on the offensive team faced off against three computer scientists on defense. ""In each test, the offensive team won,"" the paper reported; the team's ""highly sophisticated techniques"" were neither detected nor prevented. The importance of paper ballots to back up and verify digital vote tallies was also underscored by numerous election mishaps over the years. In Rock Island County, Ill., in 1984, for every one vote cast for a particular candidate, a computer tabulator gave him two; it also failed to count ""no"" votes on a referendum. In Moline, Ill., in 1985, a punch-card reader elected the wrong candidate for City Council by failing to properly count some votes; a recount flipped the race. Hoyer insists that the subject of security and paper trails didn't come up when lawmakers were developing HAVA. But Rebecca Mercuri disputes this. A computer scientist at Bryn Mawr at the time, she told the House science committee -- in a hearing that was meant to inform the lawmakers writing HAVA -- that ""any programmer can write code that displays one thing on the screen, records something else and prints out something else as an entirely different result. I have freshmen, by the way, who can do this. There is no known way to ensure that this is not happening inside of a voting system."" The experts also recognized even then that voting machines wouldn't be secure if there weren't adequate standards for testing and certifying them. Douglas W. Jones, a computer-science professor at the University of Iowa and the chairman of a board that tested and approved machines used in his state, testified to the science committee that the voting machines available to replace punch-card and lever machines weren't secure, largely because the standards didn't require them to be. The standards were created in the 1980s, when security was a nascent field and touch-screen D.R.E.s didn't exist. He advised lawmakers against issuing large-scale funding for new machines until better standards and machines were available. But few in Congress took the critics seriously. Although lawmakers did include a provision in HAVA mandating the creation of new standards -- with the aim that machines bought with HAVA funds would meet them -- the purchasing deadlines they included in the bill forced states to buy their machines before the new standards could be completed in 2005 (they took effect in 2007). In October 2002, the bill passed with broad bipartisan support, and the clock began ticking down to the November 2004 deadline to replace punch-card machines. And with that, the gold rush was on, as a small group of vendors with little security expertise began lining up to win billions of dollars of federal money. Most of that money ended up going to buy D.R.E.s. In 2000, just 9 percent of American voting precincts were using D.R.E.s. After HAVA passed, the proportion ballooned to 67 percent. The basic technology was not new; the first direct-recording electronic voting machines went on sale in 1974, and touch-screen versions were introduced in the mid-90s. But before HAVA, election officials who wanted electronic machines generally chose optical-scan systems. Each machine was more expensive, but you needed fewer per polling place, because voters could fill out the ballots in simple booths and then quickly scan them. The new D.R.E. machines did offer real advantages. With direct recording, counties no longer had to print hundreds of thousands of paper ballots or store them for 22 months after a federal election, as federal law required. And the machines could be adapted to voter needs, by displaying digital ballots in multiple languages and font sizes. They also satisfied the accessibility requirement in HAVA, offering Braille keyboards, audio instruction and other aids for physically impaired voters. Under HAVA, states had to purchase only one accessible machine per precinct and could provide optical-scan systems for other voters. But some counties bought D.R.E.s exclusively, swayed in part by the National Federation of the Blind, which insisted that HAVA, in calling for ""uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology,"" required states to provide identical equipment for all voters. This interpretation benefited vendors, of course, who were more than happy to sell counties their most expensive systems. In November 2002, just days after Bush signed HAVA into law, Georgia underwent the nation's first major test of D.R.E.s. The state had signed a $54 million contract with Diebold to use its paperless D.R.E.s exclusively statewide. As the November midterm elections approached, the company scrambled to get the machines in place for one of the closest races for governor that Georgia had seen -- between Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Sonny Perdue. Perdue won with just 51 percent of votes in a major upset. It was the first time in more than 130 years that a Republican became governor of Georgia. This wasn't the only upset. Senator Max Cleland, a popular Democrat, went into Election Day leading his Republican opponent, Saxby Chambliss, by three points; he lost by seven. What happened next highlighted everything that was wrong with electronic voting machines and their vendors. Rob Behler, a contractor who worked in the Georgia warehouse where Diebold prepared its D.R.E.s for the election, came forward to reveal that many of the machines experienced frequent crashes or other persistent malfunctions. Diebold had given workers at least three software patches to fix the problems, he said, but the patches were not examined by the independent lab responsible for testing voting machines or by Georgia officials. Brit Williams, a retired academic overseeing the rollout for the state, denied to me at the time that Diebold installed any uncertified patches, but acknowledged that it did install one patch that a test lab took a ""quick look"" at. The Georgia patches underscored a disturbing reality -- no one really knew what companies were programming into their black boxes, in part because the lab testing reports were confidential. Election activists and computer-security experts did get occasional glances inside the boxes, though, and what they saw wasn't reassuring. Months after the Georgia election, Bev Harris, the election-integrity activist, discovered the FTP server that Diebold used to distribute software patches for its machines in Georgia. The server had been left unsecured, and Harris found about 40,000 files on it, including source code for Diebold's D.R.E.s. She gave the code to computer scientists at Johns Hopkins University, who found several security problems with it, including an encryption key hard-coded in the software, a violation of basic security practices. The key was used to encrypt vote records and audit logs -- the most critical data on a voting system -- and was the same key for every Diebold system. Anyone who accessed the source code on Diebold's unsecured server could find the key in the code. Over the next several years, reports commissioned by officials in California, Maryland and Ohio found more problems with Diebold machines and similar issues with machines from other manufacturers. Problems with voting machines in elections were also making headlines. In 2002 in North Carolina, for example, D.R.E.s made by ES&amp;S failed to record 436 entire ballots during early voting in Wake County, a failure the company attributed to a software bug. Two years later, in Jacksonville, N.C., a D.R.E. made by UniLect lost more than 4,500 ballots when its memory became full and stopped recording; it continued to let voters cast ballots, however, instead of locking up. The incidents that made headlines were disturbing enough, but the real concerns were the ones that weren't being caught. The problems with voting machines did not go entirely unnoticed on Capitol Hill. In May 2003, Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, introduced an amendment to HAVA that would require all voting machines to produce a voter-verifiable paper trail and to mandate random manual audits. It was an opportunity for lawmakers like Hoyer, who missed the security issues with D.R.E.s the first time, to make up for the oversight. But still they resisted. Hoyer told me, ""I didn't think Rush was correct"" about paper trails. Hoyer and other lawmakers believed that the new voting systems were ""in fact reliable and secure and user-friendly. Now I think in retrospect we were obviously wrong, because our premise was the machines were not subject to being hacked. And now we know."" The troublesome 2004 presidential election in Ohio, in which Kerry was denied access to the voting software, provided a strong case for why paper and audits were necessary. A lot of Ohio counties still used punch cards, but some had adopted D.R.E.s and optical-scan systems. For one precinct of Franklin County, which used D.R.E.s made by a company called Danaher Control, the election-management system tallied 4,258 votes for Bush, though only 638 voters cast ballots. When officials pulled votes stored in the D.R.E., Bush's total was 365. In Mahoning County, voters using 25 D.R.E.s made by ES&amp;S found that when they touched the screens to vote for John Kerry, the machines interpreted it as a vote for Bush, not an uncommon problem when touch screens are poorly calibrated. ""Undervoting"" -- when a ballot shows no vote in a particular race -- was also exceptionally high in the state. Democratic precincts across Ohio had 75 percent more undervotes than predominantly Republican ones. In two precincts in Montgomery County that used punch-card machines, the computer tabulators indicated that 6,000 ballots had no vote for president -- an undervote rate of 25 percent, while 2 percent is normal. A congressional inquiry found ""numerous serious election irregularities"" in Ohio but ultimately couldn't conclude whether fraud had occurred. The incidents in Ohio demonstrated that American elections still had integrity problems, but there was little constituency for change. In 2005, Holt introduced a variation of his 2003 reform bill, and once again it quickly died, in part because voting-machine vendors launched a formidable lobbying effort to quash the requirement of paper trails. Some state election officials joined the effort, arguing that adding printers to D.R.E.s would create problems for elderly poll workers if the printers jammed or ran out of paper. The American Association of People With Disabilities was also remarkably effective in lobbying against paper trails, arguing that they discriminated against blind voters, even though the same audio that assisted blind voters to mark their digital ballot could read the paper trail to them. The association persuaded the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union, two politically powerful groups, to oppose paper trails as well. A second major undervote incident with D.R.E.s in 2006 also failed to move Congress. In Sarasota, Fla., more than 18,000 ballots cast on D.R.E.s made by ES&amp;S showed no vote in the race for the 13th Congressional District. Kathy Dent, the supervisor of elections, insisted that voters either didn't see that particular contest or intended to leave it blank. But documents I obtained through a public-records request showed that poll workers in 19 precincts called her office on Election Day and during the primary months before it to pass along voter complaints about the machines. Many reported that when they tried to vote for Christine Jennings, a Democrat, the screen failed to register their touch. Jennings lost by fewer than 400 votes. The incident led Florida -- the state whose punch-card fiasco prompted the nationwide switch to paperless D.R.E.s -- to mandate the use of voter-marked paper ballots. But when Holt reintroduced his bill in Congress in 2007 and 2009 to do the same, he still couldn't get any interest. Despite this proliferation of voting-machine problems, the industry was expanding its reach and control, even as it was concentrating power into fewer hands. By 2010, ES&amp;S was so big -- it had bought Diebold's election division and controlled more than 70 percent of the market -- that the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit and required it to sell off some of its assets. Many election officials, baffled by the new technology and unable to hire dedicated I.T. staff, purchased complete suites of election services from vendors, services that in some cases included programming ballot-definition files for voting machines and assisting with tabulation. It became common to see voting-machine employees or their local contractors in election offices before, during and after elections, and in some cases even working in election offices full time. ES&amp;S, for instance, even installed remote-access software and modems on election-management systems to gain remote access to them from its Nebraska headquarters to troubleshoot when things went wrong. And when things did go wrong with machines, it was often the vendor who investigated and supplied the explanation that was fed to the news media and the public. The companies also expanded their reach into other parts of the elections process. Some states built their HAVA-mandated voter-registration databases in-house, but some outsourced this to Diebold and ES&amp;S, the companies that made their voting machines, as well as to other firms. And once these centralized databases were in place, the vendors saw an opportunity for another revenue stream: They persuaded states to replace paper poll books -- the lists poll workers use to verify that voters are registered -- with electronic poll books that could sync with the statewide databases. The software on these devices didn't have to undergo testing and certification the way voting machines do, and there were inevitable problems -- in 2006 in Denver, Sequoia electronic poll books crashed extensively, creating long lines for an estimated 20,000 people who left without voting. In 2008 in Georgia, Diebold electronic poll books caused delays lasting more than two hours. Over the years, as election officials became more comfortable with their voting equipment, many jurisdictions who gave control to vendors gradually took it back, but there are still districts where vendors and contractors are involved in every phase of elections, from writing the software that registers voters and determines their eligibility to cast ballots, to programming machines and counting the votes. And it's not clear to what degree, if any, they're subject to oversight. Sixteen years ago, lawmakers led Americans to believe that they had solved the problems of Florida in 2000. But the 2016 election made it clear that the problems simply shifted from one technology to another. Once again, lawmakers are proposing fixes that they say will help address the current state of elections, and once again, those proposals fall short. Legislators have introduced several bills that propose to bolster security, in part by mandating paper trails and manual audits. But only one of them, the Secure Elections Act, has advanced, and in the process it has been significantly watered down. In August, Republican lawmakers weakened the bill by allowing officials performing audits to rely on the digital images of paper ballots stored in optical-scan machines -- images that can be manipulated by hackers and others, security experts say. This year, Congress appropriated $380 million to states to pay for security upgrades and replace some of the machines that were bought with HAVA funds more than a decade ago, in the belief that this will make elections more secure. But the new machines have the same problems as the ones they will replace -- all machines on the market today were tested and certified to the standards HAVA put into effect in 2007, and technology has evolved considerably in the last decade. The Election Assistance Commission and its technical-guidelines committee are completing new standards, but it will be at least another two years before any machines will be tested and certified to them. Even those standards will almost certainly be inadequate. They will, for instance, most likely continue to exempt commercial off-the-shelf components from testing. (If a vendor uses the Windows operating system or a commercial modem in its machines and asserts that it hasn't altered them, the labs don't look at those components.) And they probably won't require labs to do ""penetration testing"" to see if they can hack voting systems -- one of the most effective ways to measure the security of a system. ""These companies have seized a central role in our democracy,"" said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is one of a small group of lawmakers who have shown a willingness to demand more transparency from the vendors. ""But rather than recognizing that cybersecurity needs to be their top priority, they treat it as a public-relations problem that can be dismissed with spin."" The valuable work of testing system security has been taken up voluntarily by security researchers like the Finnish computer programmer Harri Hursti, J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan and the participants at the recent Def Con Voting Machine Hacking Village. But the researchers face hostility and sometimes even legal threats from vendors, who want to prevent them from finding and exposing problems with the machines. Before the Def Con event this year, which received unprecedented support and interest from election officials, ES&amp;S and other vendors sent comments to the United States Copyright Office expressing opposition to a proposed exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would expand the rights of researchers to reverse-engineer election software. Even now, when the country is desperate to prevent Russian hackers from interfering with future elections, the company is more focused on asserting proprietary control over its systems than on working with communities of researchers who want to secure them. In addition to the comments it sent the Copyright Office, it also sent a vaguely threatening letter to its own customers, warning them against helping researchers by providing them with voting-machine software to examine. In that letter, ES&amp;S reminded election officials of an essential fact: The American people don't own the software that now sits at the heart of their democracy; they just lease it.

"To Protect Data, Be Wary of Unfamiliar Brands","If there was one broad takeaway from the data leak involving Cambridge Analytica, the voter profiling firm that obtained private information from up to 87 million Facebook accounts, it's that you should hesitate before sharing your data with an unknown brand. This lesson applies to just about everything that touches your personal technology, including the apps that you download to your phone or computer and the free online services that you use. And, yes, it also includes those seemingly harmless personality tests run by some unfamiliar organization on Facebook -- the kind that helped Cambridge Analytica get the data on users.    To make matters worse, the information that can be stolen from you is becoming increasingly personal. Smartphones, for one, are embedded with microphones, motion sensors and cameras that can spy on your every move if corrupted by a bad actor. Home gadgets like internet-connected thermostats, power outlets and audio speakers are capable of collecting information about what you are doing at home, including listening to your conversations, and knowing when you are away from home.    It's time to stop using technology and the internet as though you were shopping at a supermarket. In a grocery store, you can reasonably assume that the food labels are accurate and the products safe to eat, because the food industry is heavily regulated. The handling of personal digital information, in contrast, is  loosely regulated. There have been scores of obscure companies baiting you with products that purport to improve your life -- but actually capitalize on your data.   ''We don't really know why we're trusting that a particular company with access to our data won't do something like sell it or rent it or share it without our consent,'' said Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights.   That's not to say the tech behemoths are innocent. The data leak to Cambridge Analytica was ultimately Facebook's fault because its app platform allowed data to be harvested from people's friends lists in the first place. About five years ago, Google had to pay a $7 million fine after acknowledging that it had scooped up passwords, email and other personal data with its Street View mapping project.   Yet I am recommending taking extra caution with obscure tech brands because it is something under your control. You can take a pause. Don't immediately download every app you see in an app store or on the web just because it looks fun. Don't take every quiz you see on Facebook (even if you are dying to know which ''Game of Thrones'' character identifies with you). Don't impulse buy internet-connected devices from unfamiliar brands. Don't do any of this without first doing some research on the reputations of these vendors and their business models.   Here are some examples of when unknown brands did us wrong -- and the lessons we can learn.   The 'Free' Email Service   Last year, The New York Times revealed that Uber bought information about Lyft, its main ride-hailing competitor in the United States, from Unroll.me, a free email service that offered to unsubscribe people from marketing emails.   How did Unroll.me get data about Lyft? Unroll.me scanned users' inboxes for information and sold it to other businesses, and Uber paid it for data it found about Lyft receipts. Many consumers found it misleading that a company that promised to rid you of spam from marketers made money by selling your information to marketers and other companies.   Here's the kicker: The truth was always laid out in the privacy policy, which said that ''we may collect, use, transfer, sell and disclose nonpersonal information for any purpose'' and that data could be used ''to build anonymous market research products and services.''   In response to the backlash, Unroll.me said it was ''heartbreaking'' to see that people were upset and pledged to be more transparent about its use of data. The app continues to operate.   The lessons. Whenever you have the time, read privacy policies before opting to share your data with a brand. This is a daunting task but a healthy exercise, especially when you are unfamiliar and feeling distrustful toward an obscure company. And do the best you can to research a company's business model. When a service or product is free, assume that your personal information is being monetized.   ''We all need to know that whenever you're not paying for the thing, then you're paying for the thing in a nonmonetary way,'' Mr. Tien said.   The Messaging App That Spied   Last year, an app called Soniac was available for Android phones on the Google Play app store. Soniac marketed itself as a messaging app -- and indeed, it included features for sending text messages. The less obvious features: The app was also capable of silently recording audio, taking photos with the camera, placing phone calls and downloading call logs among other features.   Lookout, a security firm that follows malicious software for Android devices, alerted Google about Soniac's hidden abilities last year, and the app was quickly removed from the Play app store.   Yet Lookout said its researchers had identified over 1,000 spyware apps with many of the same characteristics that Soniac had. Many of those spyware apps were served in third-party app stores that are not authorized by Google.   The company that offered Soniac, Iraqwebservice, had published other spyware apps on the Play store. All of its apps have been removed from Play, but Lookout warned that the spyware would probably resurface in the future.   The lessons. For one, before you install an app from a company you've never heard of, look at its user reviews and do a web search on the company to see if its services are legitimate. You can also check reputable web publications that review apps, like TouchArcade, CNET and Tom's Guide.   For another, when installing an app, take a close look at what data it is accessing. Smartphone apps will ask for permission for access to certain data and sensors. If an app is asking for data that is unrelated to the product, don't install it. For example, you can reasonably expect a mapping app to ask for your location data, but it shouldn't need access to your camera.   ''If something seems outside of the scope, like if a calculator app tells you it needs to use your webcam, say, 'What, why?''' said Adam Kujawa, the head of malware intelligence at Malwarebytes, a security firm.   Third, avoid downloading apps from unofficial app stores and sites that are not affiliated with large brands. And keep in mind that alternative app stores are particularly ripe for malware, because just about anything can be distributed there, similar to a flea market.   Tech That Collects Data on Minors   Parents, beware: A number of internet products have specifically collected data about children. EchoMetrix is a notorious example. In 2009, the company issued a news release bragging that it had predicted the winner of that year's ''American Idol'' singing competition.   How did it do that? By looking at children's private information. The company started in 2004 with the name SearchHelp, offering a parental control app called FamilySafe for parents to monitor their children's online activities. Five years later, it rebranded itself as EchoMetrix and released Pulse, a tool for providing insight to third-party marketers on youths, by aggregating data from millions of teenagers' chat transcripts and blog posts, among other sources.   EchoMetrix's practices attracted the attention of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy rights group, which filed a complaint about the company to the Federal Trade Commission. The group accused EchoMetrix of violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting information on minors without parental consent. In 2010, EchoMetrix reached settlements with the commission and the New York attorney general's office in which it agreed not to analyze or share information about children's private communications or online activities. EchoMetrix has since rebranded itself as Protext Mobility, a biotech company.   The lessons. Be judicious when choosing tech products for your children. Increasingly, toys are beginning to include internet connections -- before buying a ''smart'' toy, do your homework on what the companies are doing with the data. Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that evaluates content and products for families, is a good place to start your research.   Perhaps the most important lesson is to acknowledge that you don't know anything about the vast majority of brands you engage with on the internet. So tread carefully.   ''These threats aren't going away,'' Mr. Tien said. ''With the expansion of data collection and the expansion of what's possible to collect, it's just going to continue to proliferate.''   Brian X.

How to Tell Us a Secret; Understanding the times,"In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more from this series here. At first glance, there's nothing unusual about the stack of mail on Gabriel Dance's desk: a handful of envelopes, variously sized, addressed to ""Tips"" at The New York Times, with no return addresses. (Anonymously submitted letters and documents, after all, have long played a part in The Times's news gathering, as was seen in our publication of Donald J. Trump's tax records in October 2016.) But the cellphone Mr. Dance keeps eying tells the story of an innovative Times initiative: a set of digital channels intended to receive confidential news tips.  As a matter of practice, journalists at The Times have long used digital security measures -- encrypted communications and storage -- when handling sensitive information. But in December 2016, Mr. Dance, the deputy investigations editor, teamed up with Runa Sandvik, the senior director of information security, to gather a set of tools for readers to anonymously submit information that might be of journalistic interest to The Times. The tools -- WhatsApp, Signal, SecureDrop and encrypted email -- are listed on nytimes.com on a centralized tips page, which outlines each method's strengths and vulnerabilities. From there, users can download the appropriate software and use it to transmit their tips to The Times. The effect on the newsroom was immediate. ""We received useful information within 24 hours of launching,"" Ms. Sandvik said. Recently the tips have been arriving at a rate of more than 100 per day. They range from single-sentence suggestions to databases with hundreds of thousands of records. When a tip submission reaches The Times, it is added to a secure and ever-growing database that is overseen by Mr. Dance. Roughly a third of the submissions don't qualify as tips and are quickly discarded -- a reader sounding off on a recent news article, for example. Another third -- tips that, for one reason or another, are especially time-sensitive -- are distributed to editors and reporters on the desks most capable of vetting them. And the remaining tips, those that might lead to substantive investigative stories, are held by the investigations team for further evaluation. The anonymous tips received from mobile devices, via WhatsApp and Signal, have been particularly useful, Mr. Dance said. And there's good reason: WhatsApp, with more than 1.2 billion active users, is one of the easiest ways to send secure information. ""With WhatsApp, it's as simple as sending a text message -- but it's encrypted,"" Mr. Dance explained. SecureDrop and encrypted email, on the other hand, take more time for the average user to set up, and can be slightly more complicated to use. Still, each of the channels has helped deliver useful information. Audio from a speech Hillary Clinton gave during a closed-door gathering in the wake of the 2016 presidential election arrived the same day the tips page debuted; a series of questions posed to the State Department by Mr. Trump's transition team showed up a few weeks later; and the story about the F.B.I. raid of Michael Cohen's office started with a tip. The response from tipsters has been so positive that the newsroom created a searchable database to help its journalists handle the overwhelming volume. ""It's a great problem to have,"" Mr. Dance said. In that respect, The Times isn't alone -- not anymore, at least. Shortly after Ms. Sandvik and Mr. Dance opened the tips page, BuzzFeed followed suit with a similar page of its own. The Guardian and The Washington Post also provide channels for secure communication with tipsters. The journalists who make up The Times's tips team expect that the project, when fully realized, will fundamentally change the newsroom by opening up valuable and searchable information to reporters and editors. What won't change, though, is the way that information is handled. ""Each tip, be it from a submission or from a source, is rigorously vetted and probed,"" Mr. Dance said. ""While the tip line has allowed hundreds of news tips to reach our reporters and editors,"" he added, ""our process of investigating the world remains the same.""

Damage Control at Facebook: 6 Takeaways From The Times's Investigation,"For more than a year, Facebook has endured cascading crises -- over Russian misinformation, data privacy and abusive content -- that transformed the Silicon Valley icon into an embattled giant accused of corporate overreach and negligence. An investigation by The New York Times revealed how Facebook fought back against its critics: with delays, denials and a full-bore campaign in Washington. Here are six takeaways. Facebook knew about Russian interference  In fall 2016, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, was publicly declaring it a ""crazy idea"" that his company had played a role in deciding the election. But security experts at the company already knew otherwise.  They found signs as early as spring 2016 that Russian hackers were poking around the Facebook accounts of people linked to American presidential campaigns. Months later, they saw Russian-controlled accounts sharing information from hacked Democratic emails with reporters. Facebook accumulated evidence of Russian activity for over a year before executives opted to share what they knew with the public -- and even their own board of directors. The company feared Trump supporters In 2015, when the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump called for a ban of Muslim immigrants, Facebook employees and outside critics called on the company to punish Mr. Trump. Mr. Zuckerberg considered it -- asking subordinates whether Mr. Trump had violated the company's rules and whether his account should be suspended or the post removed. But while Mr. Zuckerberg was personally offended, he deferred to subordinates who warned that penalizing Mr. Trump would set off a damaging backlash among Republicans. Mr. Trump's post remained up. Facebook launched a multipronged attack and lobbying campaign As criticism grew over Facebook's belated admissions of Russian influence, the company launched a lobbying campaign -- overseen by Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer -- to combat critics and shift anger toward rival tech firms.  Facebook hired Senator Mark Warner's former chief of staff to lobby him; Ms. Sandberg personally called Senator Amy Klobuchar to complain about her criticism. The company also deployed a public relations firm to push negative stories about its political critics and cast blame on companies like Google. Those efforts included depicting the billionaire liberal donor George Soros as the force behind a broad anti-Facebook movement, and publishing stories praising Facebook and criticizing Google and Apple on a conservative news site. Cambridge Analytica raised the stakes Facebook faced worldwide outrage in March after The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian published a joint investigation into how user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. But inside Facebook, executives thought they could contain the damage. The company installed a new chief of American lobbying to help quell the bipartisan anger in Congress, and it quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called ""We Get It,"" meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018. Some criticisms hurt more than others Sensing Facebook's vulnerability, some rival tech firms in Silicon Valley sought to use the outcry to promote their own brands. After Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, quipped in an interview that his company did not traffic in personal data, Mr. Zuckerberg ordered his management team to use only Android phones. After all, he reasoned, the operating system had far more users than Apple's. Facebook still has friends Washington's senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress during the 2016 election cycle -- and he was there when the company needed him.  This past summer, as Facebook's troubles mounted, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, who by then had emerged as Facebook's most insistent inquisitor in Congress. Back off, Mr. Schumer told Mr. Warner, and look for ways to work with Facebook, not vilify it. Lobbyists for Facebook -- which also employs Mr. Schumer's daughter -- were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer's efforts. PHOTO: Mark Zuckerberg at a congressional hearing in April.

Home Addresses Are Up for Sale. Time to Take Back Your Privacy.,"In 2017, an internet troll named Tyler Barriss called a SWAT team to what he thought was the home address of another gamer who had insulted him online in Wichita, Kan. It was the wrong address. In the confused confrontation that followed, a police officer shot and killed Andrew Finch, a 28-year-old father of two. ""Swatting"" is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator makes a fake emergency call intended to send a SWAT team to the home of a target. There aren't good statistics on the frequency of this type of mayhem, but one F.B.I. agent estimated that it has happened hundreds of times each year.   The ease with which online squabbles can escalate to swatting is made possible by the vast amount of personal information organized by search engines. But just because information is public doesn't mean it has to be so easy for so many people to get. There are small steps that tech companies and regulators can take to claw back some privacy that Americans have lost to technology. They can begin with the home address. Already, the location of a home is among the most policed speech online. Posting someone's address is prohibited on mainstream social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit -- it's even banned in more laissez-faire places like 4chan.  But search engines put the home addresses of the entire nation a few keystrokes away. And there's an entirely legal industry that peddles that and other personal information for a price. Search for a name in Google, and you may very well find a number of data brokers offering to sell information for a couple of dollars -- if not offering it up for free. The data comes from a number of places, including property and voting records, which are often public. (In some states, voters may apply to have their information in public voter rolls concealed by filing a form stapled to a copy of a restraining order or an affidavit that they fear for their safety.) But the data also could have been sold through the private sector -- harvested, for instance, from a grocery store rewards card.  Once the information is out, it spreads -- sometimes scraped, sometimes bought and sold -- among data brokers. Some are sites that operate as low-touch private detectives, hanging their shingle on the first page of Google results. Anyone trying to remove information must contact dozens of different services to do so. Some remove information only for a fee. The home address wasn't always such a sensitive piece of information -- the once-ubiquitous phone book was considered useful, not dangerous. But times have changed, and the information provided by these new online databases aren't weaponized only by trolls, but also by stalkers, domestic abusers and criminals.  There are laws around the dissemination of personal information like home addresses, but they're stuck in the era of phone booths and yellow pages. Home address privacy is governed mainly by 1990s legislation like the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (regarding the collection and release of information gathered by states to issue licenses for driving) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (which partly regulates how banks handle personal information). It's time for legislators -- at both the federal and state levels -- to update protections for home addresses and to allow regulators to rein in the personal data industry.  Americans need more control over who knows where they and their families live. Home addresses should not be for sale without the knowledge of and the explicit, meaningful consent of those who live there. And it should be easier to remove information from these databases without having to spend hours tracking it down to every corner of the internet.  But in the interim, there's one thing that would make people safer and their privacy more secure. Google has, for some time, de-indexed many revenge pornography sites and has tweaked its algorithms to tamp down on the proliferation of mug shot databases. Similarly, search engines could de-index the data brokers who hawk personal information.  An intelligent and dedicated pursuer would still be able to track down an address. In many cases, they are public records, after all. But cleaning up the search engines will slow down someone who finds and posts your address in a fit of pique. In the absence of regulation over the sale and purchase of personal data, just a little bit of friction can make a big difference for vulnerable people.

The Mad Dash to Find a Cybersecurity Force,"A stunning statistic is reverberating in cybersecurity: An estimated 3.5 million cybersecurity jobs will be available but unfilled by 2021, according to predictions from Cybersecurity Ventures and other experts. ""It's scary. Our power grid, our cars, our everyday devices -- basically everything is online and able to be attacked,"" said Georgia Weidman, author of ""Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking."" Ms. Weidman is the founder of two cybersecurity companies, Bulb Security, where she is chief executive, and Shevirah, where she is chief technology officer. Shevirah specializes in security for mobile devices. ""It would certainly cause mass destruction if our power grid went down or our water pumps started going haywire or our dams decided to open all their sluices,"" she said. ""That's actually something that could happen."" According to a report released this year by theIdentity Theft Resource Center, the number of data breaches tracked in the United States in 2017 hit a high of more than 1,500, up almost 45 percent over 2016. In one incident this year, the data of 29 million Facebook users was stolen.  In response to the sheer number of new digital gates that might be left open, employers and educators have had to become more creative in finding people to guard them. They need penetration testers to simulate attacks to find and fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a real attacker. They need malware analysts to find out what malicious programs do so they can protect from the attacks. They need security researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in applications and other products -- before the thieves do -- so they can be fixed. They need security architects to make sure all the best practices are being followed. According to the chief economist for LinkedIn, Guy Berger, there was a shortage as of September of 11,000 people with cybersecurity skills in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5,000 in New York and almost 4,000 in Seattle, the areas with the largest concentration of need. LinkedIn regularly issues work-force reports based on its analysis of jobs data in the United States. Some major corporations have openly taken to hiring hackers to help protect them. An extreme example is Kevin Mitnick, who hacked into corporations, landed on the F.B.I. Most Wanted Fugitives list, went to jail for five years, but is now a security consultant to Fortune 500 companies and governments. As he says on his website about hackers, ""It takes one to know one."" Many companies are also putting less emphasis on the need for a college degree to qualify for a cybersecurity job, Ms. Weidman said. With an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Va., and a master's in computer science from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., Ms. Weidman said she had seen how much hands-on experience really mattered in the cyberfield. That insight came early when she participated in the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition as a student. The competition, which began in 2005, is held at colleges across the country and designed to test student teams' abilities to detect and respond to outside threats and to protect services such as mail servers and web servers. The sponsors include high-tech companies like the defense contractor Raytheon and IBM, but also retailers like Walmart and transportation companies like Uber. Recalling the difference between theoretical learning in college and hands-on experience, Ms. Weidman said she could do a lot of math about computer networking, ""but could I actually manage a network at a company? Absolutely not."" The people who were in community colleges would ""wipe the floor with those of us at universities, because community colleges really were focused on how to do these things,"" she said. ""I think that people at the university level are starting to realize that we need more hands-on skills in cybersecurity, as well as just the theory."" With that in mind, colleges and universities are changing their curriculums. Ms. Weidman is working with the Tulane School of Professional Advancement in New Orleans to build an online class for its Applied Computing Systems &amp; Technology degree program. At New York University, the Center for Cybersecurity has been operating for 20 years and graduates about 50 students annually. But this year, it created an online master's program to help make the training more affordable in hopes of attracting more people to the field. Students in cybersecurity get a 75 percent discount, so the master's degree costs about $15,000, compared with about $60,000 for the traditional on-campus program. The online program enrolled 125 students in September and hopes to have 1,000 students annually within three or four years. ""Nationally, we graduate twice the number of psychology majors as opposed to engineers,"" said Nasir Memon, professor and associate dean for online learning at the N.Y.U. Tandon School of Engineering. ""We graduate as many park rangers as compared to computer scientists."" Students frequently graduate in fields that lack opportunity for long-term careers, he said. If they want to switch to computer science in traditional programs, they can face daunting barriers, like multiple semesters of catch-up courses and a requirement to take the Graduate Record Examination. ""So one of the things we did is start a bridge program, where we say, we don't care what you did in your undergrad; you could have done physics, anthropology, anything, just come on in,"" Professor Memon said. The welcome the school extends is in the form of an intense, four-month online program of computer science courses with a price of $1,500. If students pass, they are eligible for the full program. This year, 230 students were accepted into the bridge program, 22 percent of them women. That number compares with 11 percent of women in thecybersecurity force over all, according to a 2017 report by the Center for Cyber Safety and Education and the Executive Women's Forum on Information Security, Risk Management &amp; Privacy. Shamla Naidoo, global chief information security officer for IBM, has had success reaching out to mothers returning to work, as well as to veterans, to find potential cybersecurity workers. ""We've been talking about this for the last few years,"" Ms. Naidoo said. ""The first year, I spent a lot of time worrying about it. After that I thought, there's no point in worrying about it, I'm going to have to go act, and I'm going to have to act in a nontraditional way. Posting a job description and hoping people are going to show up and apply to the job wasn't working because the people just didn't exist. So rather than trying to hire the skills and knowing they're not as easily available, let's create the skills internally."" She created a system open to hiring people who have little or no experience, and, in many cases, even skills, in cybersecurity, with the understanding that they will come in, join a more experienced team and learn on the job. They are formed into teams of five to seven people solving one problem at a time, with the new employees teaming with more experienced security experts to watch. Many skills from other industries are transferable to the cybersecurity field. Cybersecurity experts need to be able to communicate policies to, as Ms. Naidoo put it, ""increase the cybersecurity I.Q."" of an entire organization. For example, people from a finance background might be able to educate their co-workers in accounting about cyberrisk. She's grown her team by about 25 percent over the last year with developers, consultants and research professionals. She said being more flexible in hiring, and hiring outside of the normal pipeline, had evened out some of the inequities in the field -- like a relative dearth of minorities and women. ""To solve the skills shortage, we have to hire people who have the right aptitude, who have the right attitude, people who are curious, are willing to learn,"" Ms. Naidoo said. ""Outside of that, I have very few other criteria. I'm opening the aperture for where we look. I'm trying to hire in nontraditional places, nontraditional groups of people, and so I don't expect them to have the skills or the experience that we need. I will hire people wherever I can find them."" Michael Doran, 38, was a police officer in St. Louis for almost 10 years before going into cybersecurity. ""I quickly found out a lot of the older detectives were not doing a lot of the computer crimes,"" he said. ""I saw my opening there to make a niche for myself."" After learning about the field of digital forensics, he took free, online courses through the National White Collar Crime Center. He then decided to get another bachelor's degree and a master's degree online in computer forensics and intelligence. He studied at Utica College from home while working full time. He went to the cybercrimes unit as a forensic digital examiner within the St. Louis police department's cybercrime unit. But it didn't take long for the private industry to scoop him up. ""It was an offer I couldn't refuse,"" he said, speaking of more than doubling his salary to near six figures. ""I took that chance, and I haven't looked back since."" He's now a senior security consultant within the enterprise incident management team for Optiv, a cybersecurity company, where he performs digital forensics and interacts with clients. More C-suite executives are filling their own skills gaps when it comes to cybersecurity, said Eric Rosenbach, co-director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and former chief of staff at the Defense Department. He runs an online class for working, senior-level executives ""who are only now seeing how seriously they need to take it because they've seen so many other C.E.O.s get fired for major breaches,"" said Mr. Rosenbach. Offered at least six times a year, the classes educate 300 to 400 people each term. He says executives need to know how to minimize the legal, financial and public relations risks before an attack occurs. Beyond the particular needs of firms in the cybersecurity arena, there is also a skills gap in the larger population that needs to be addressed, Mr. Rosenbach said. ""I'm surprised, even at Harvard, how few of the students here know very basic stuff about cyberhygiene, two-factor authentication, things like that, that people should be doing to protect themselves,"" he said. ""One thing I don't think people appreciate as much is that cyber is about human issues, it's about training people not to do dumb things like click on spear-phishing links, holding people accountable. There's a lot of human leadership involved in trying to improve cybersecurity."" PHOTO: There is a shortage of cybersecurity workers.

"Shift in Tactics Targets Sellers, Not Online Sites, In Corner of Dark Web","WASHINGTON -- More than 35 people were charged with selling drugs on the so-called dark web, the Justice Department announced on Tuesday, marking the first time that federal prosecutors made the sellers of illegal goods their primary focus rather than the operators of illicit online marketplaces. Investigators seized opioids, cocaine and other drugs, more than 100 guns and assault rifles, a grenade launcher and five cars in a broad federal inquiry in which prosecutors opened more than 90 cases. They also took nearly $24 million in cash, gold, and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.     ''Criminals who think that they are safe on the dark net are wrong,'' the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, said in a statement, using another term for the dark web, where people can use encryption and electronic currencies to hide their identities. ''We can expose their networks.''   Homeland Security investigators posed as a money launderer who exchanged virtual currencies on the dark web, the authorities said.   ''Special agents were able to walk amongst those in the cyberunderworld to find those vendors who sell highly addictive drugs for a profit,'' said Derek Benner, acting executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations. ''H.S.I. has infiltrated the dark net.''   The suspects were mostly in their 20s and 30s. Scattered across the country in states like New York, Maryland, Ohio, California and Vermont, they sold a variety of drugs including opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, prosecutors said.   In most cases they accepted Bitcoin as payment, then attempted to launder that money through undercover agents who exchanged the coins for cash. The agents then had mailing addresses for the vendors, and were able to obtain data about who had owned the coins.   Bitcoin has long been the currency of choice for those looking to purchase illegal goods online. Its appeal is obvious: The currency is controlled by no bank or government, and it can be difficult to conclusively link a Bitcoin to a person.   But every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on what is known as a ledger called the blockchain. If you know what to look for, the transactions are essentially public. Cybersecurity experts have predicted that Bitcoin's structure would eventually allow law enforcement to use it to make arrests.   The government could also compel companies who trade in Bitcoin to hand over information about those using the cryptocurrency, cybersecurity experts have said.   Online drug trafficking, which has long provided easy access to illegal commerce, has emerged as one of the most pernicious issues that drug enforcement officials face, James J. Hunt, the Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge, said in a statement.   Drugs, weapons, child pornography, stolen financial data and other illicit materials have been bought and sold on black market websites like the Silk Road and AlphaBay, online bazaars that have been targeted by law enforcement authorities.   Some of those marketplaces have become hubs for sales of fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that has become a driver of the nation's opioid addiction crisis.   But the government has generally targeted the founders of those websites, rather than the vendors selling goods on their platforms.   The government shut down the Silk Road and prosecuted its founder, Ross W. Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht is now serving a life sentence for overseeing a global, online drug-trafficking business. Some vendors on Silk Road were also prosecuted.   Last July, the Justice Department seized AlphaBay, then the world's largest criminal online marketplace. Authorities arrested Alexandre Cazes, the creator and administrator of the site, on charges of racketeering, drug trafficking and fraud. Mr. Cazes committed suicide while in custody in Thailand, the Justice Department said.   Newer forms of cryptocurrencies are designed to evade detection, Greg Nevano, an ICE official who investigates them, said during a hearing this month before a House Financial Services subcommittee.   ''Some newer cryptocurrencies have features that make the tracing of them quite complicated,'' he said. ''These new anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies are clearly ripe for illicit use in an effort to subvert legitimate law enforcement inquiries.''   While these cryptocurrencies are more difficult to trace, ''it is not impossible,'' Mr. Nevano added. He said law enforcement agencies could press companies to hand over customer data or devices.

Russian Court Bans Telegram App After 18-Minute Hearing,"MOSCOW -- A Moscow court cleared the way on Friday for the government to ban Telegram, the messaging app, over its failure to give Russian security services the ability to read users' encrypted messages.  Roskomnadzor, the Russian communications and technology watchdog, had asked the court for the authority to block the app, and for the ban to take immediate effect. It took the court all of 18 minutes to grant the request, after scheduling the hearing just one day before. Telegram had ordered its lawyers to skip the hearing in protest of the hurried process. The ruling came a month after Telegram lost a lawsuit it brought against the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., Russia's powerful and secretive security agency, which had demanded access to messages. The Kremlin pushed through a sweeping antiterrorism law in 2016 that mandated providing the security services backdoor access to encrypted applications, among other measures. Telegram said last month that it now has 200 million active monthly users, many of them in the lands of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. Because of its strong privacy protections, it has long been a favorite of the Islamic State and other extremist groups. There was no immediate comment from Pavel Durov, the Telegram founder, a Russian who fled the country in 2014 after losing control of the Russian social network Vkontakte, which he had also created. He and other experts have said that the Kremlin is asking the impossible, because encryption happens at the individual user level and there is no universal key. The ban puts the Kremlin in a slightly awkward position because Telegram is widely used by government agencies, including by President Vladimir V. Putin's press office. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, after announcing his daily conference call on Telegram, first declined to comment and then said the company should follow the law. ""There is a certain legislation that demands certain data to be passed to certain services of the Russian Federation,"" he said, adding that his office would switch to an alternative app as soon as Telegram stopped functioning. But government officials have said that it could easily be replaced. The Foreign Ministry announced that it was moving to Viber, the news agency Interfax reported. Telegram has the right to appeal, a process that could take from 10 days to a month. But the court gave Roskomnadzor the express right to shut the service down immediately, and it was not immediately clear which approach might be followed.

"A New Tax Scam, and Tips On How to Deal With It","Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.com If you weren't expecting an income tax refund but discover a big deposit from the Internal Revenue Service in your bank account, don't be quick to celebrate. You may have been the target of a clever new scam. The latest twist in tax-time identity fraud involves thieves who pilfer personal and financial information, often from professional tax preparers. They then use those details to file fake tax returns and have refunds -- sometimes as large as $20,000 -- sent electronically to your account with plans to collect it later.     The I.R.S. initially warned about the scam on Feb. 2, urging tax professionals to ''step up security and beware of phishing emails that can secretly download malicious software that can help cybercriminals steal client data.''   The agency next issued a warning to taxpayers on Feb. 13 after reports of the incidents ''mushroomed'' from a few hundred potential victims nationwide to thousands, said Terry Lemons, an agency spokesman.   ''This one is really worrisome to us,'' Mr. Lemons said. ''Scammers are getting a government deposit into your account.''   In the past few years, the I.R.S. said, its Security Summit -- a collaboration with state tax agencies and makers of do-it-yourself tax software -- has helped reduce incidents of tax-related identity fraud, in which someone files a fake return in your name to collect a refund.   But now, criminals are increasingly targeting businesses, including tax professionals and human resource departments, because they are rich sources of sensitive personal information -- including W-2 forms, bank statements and tax returns -- that thieves can use to impersonate taxpayers and file bogus returns with authentic data.   ''Criminals go where the data is,'' said Jonathan Horn, senior manager for tax policy and advocacy with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.   How does putting the money in your account benefit the criminals? The thieves think you'll give it to them.   The crooks, for example, will call victims and pretend they're a collection company for the I.R.S., which has deposited the funds in error. They then demand that victims transfer the money to a different account. ''They say, 'We made a mistake; send it back to us,''' Mr. Lemons said.   Or, they will leave voice messages threatening the taxpayer with criminal fraud charges or an arrest warrant if they don't call the number provided to return the ''refund.''   ''It signifies the ingenuity of the fraudsters out there,'' said Russell Schrader, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, which promotes online safety and security.   The scam has the ring of truth for victims, as there is actually an erroneous deposit sitting in their bank account (or in some cases, a paper check in the mailbox). That can frighten victims into acting, especially if a caller is bullying them. But it's always best to hang up and independently check whether the information you were given is valid, said Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the nonprofit group Identity Theft Resource Center. ''Always go to the source when you get these kind of contacts,'' she said. Look up a public number for the I.R.S. online, she advised, and contact the agency to ask if the call was legitimate. (The I.R.S. identity theft unit's number is 1-800-908-4490).   Here are some questions and answers about tax refund fraud:   What should I do if an erroneous tax refund is deposited in my account?   If it seems too good to be true, it probably is, Mr. Lemons said. Don't forward the money, he said, and don't spend it: ''Don't go out and make a down payment on a new car with the cash.''   If the refund arrived as a direct deposit, the agency said that you should contact your bank's automated clearinghouse department and have the funds returned to the I.R.S. (Consumers may also need to close their account.) Call the I.R.S. to explain why the money is being returned, notify your tax preparer and file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.   In the case of paper checks, the next steps depend on whether you have cashed the check. The agency provides details on its website.   What questions about security procedures should I have for my tax preparer?   Mr. Horn with the accountant association recommended that consumers ask whether their tax preparer uses encrypted email -- standard email isn't secure and should never be used for sensitive financial information -- and where the agency stores its paper files.   Mr. Lemon offered his own suggestions: Do you update security protocols regularly? Do you train employees to recognize phishing attacks? How is information shared securely with clients?   David Thomas, chief executive of Evident ID, an information security company based in Atlanta, suggested asking which employees have access to your files, and inquiring whether the firm offers extra login security. He particularly likes YubiKey, a token that authenticates a user's identity.   The tax preparation firm ''should have confident answers'' to your questions, Mr. Thomas said.   Does a bogus refund in my account mean a fake tax return was filed in my name?   Most likely yes, but you should contact the I.R.S. to verify if it has accepted a return using your Social Security number, Ms. Velasquez said. In some fraud cases overseas, she said, criminals have been known to mix and match stolen information. So it may be possible that criminals used one person's data to file a tax return, but someone else's bank account to deposit the refund. If a fraudulent return was filed in your name, she said, you'll probably have to file a special affidavit with the I.R.S. explaining that you are a victim of identity theft. Victims can contact the resource center for free help, she said.    "
A Cyberattack in Saudi Arabia Had a Deadly Goal. Experts Fear Another Try.,"In August, a petrochemical company with a plant in Saudi Arabia was hit by a new kind of cyberassault. The attack was not designed to simply destroy data or shut down the plant, investigators believe. It was meant to sabotage the firm's operations and trigger an explosion. The attack was a dangerous escalation in international hacking, as faceless enemies demonstrated both the drive and the ability to inflict serious physical damage. And United States government officials, their allies and cybersecurity researchers worry that the culprits could replicate it in other countries, since thousands of industrial plants all over the world rely on the same American-engineered computer systems that were compromised. Investigators have been tight-lipped about the August attack. They still won't identify the company or the country where it is based and have not identified the culprits. But the attackers were sophisticated and had plenty of time and resources, an indication that they were most likely supported by a government, according to more than a dozen people, including cybersecurity experts who have looked into the attack and asked not to be identified because of the confidentiality of the continuing investigation.  The only thing that prevented an explosion was a mistake in the attackers' computer code, the investigators said. The assault was the most alarming in a string of hacking attacks on petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia. In January 2017, computers went dark at the National Industrialization Company, Tasnee for short, which is one of the few privately owned Saudi petrochemical companies. Computers also crashed 15 miles away at Sadara Chemical Company, a joint venture between the oil and chemical giants Saudi Aramco and Dow Chemical. Within minutes of the attack at Tasnee, the hard drives inside the company's computers were destroyed and their data wiped clean, replaced with an image of Alan Kurdi, the small Syrian child who drowned off the coast of Turkey during his family's attempt to flee that country's civil war. The intent of the January attacks, Tasnee officials and researchers at the security company Symantec believe, was to inflict lasting damage on the petrochemical companies and send a political message. Recovery took months. Energy experts said the August attack could have been an attempt to complicate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to encourage foreign and domestic private investment to diversify the Saudi economy and produce jobs for the country's growing youth population. ""Not only is it an attack on the private sector, which is being touted to help promote growth in the Saudi economy, but it is also focused on the petrochemical sector, which is a core part of the Saudi economy,"" said Amy Myers Jaffe, an expert on Middle East energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Saudi Arabia has cut oil exports in recent years to support global oil prices, a strategy central to its efforts to make a potential public offering of shares of government-controlled Saudi Aramco more attractive to international investors. The kingdom has tried to compensate for its lost revenue by expanding its petrochemical and refining industry. Some technical details of the attack in August have been previously reported, but this is the first time the earlier attacks on Tasnee and other Saudi petrochemical companies have been reported. Security analysts at Mandiant, a division of the security firm FireEye, are still investigating what happened in August, with the help of several companies in the United States that investigate cyberattacks on industrial control systems. A team at Schneider Electric, which made the industrial systems that were targeted, called Triconex safety controllers, is also looking into the attack, the people who spoke to The Times said. So are the National Security Agency, the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which has been supporting research into forensic tools designed to assist hacking investigations. All of the investigators believe the attack was most likely intended to cause an explosion that would have killed people. In the last few years, explosions at petrochemical plants in China and Mexico -- though not triggered by hackers -- have killed several employees, injured hundreds and forced evacuations of surrounding communities. What worries investigators and intelligence analysts the most is that the attackers compromised Schneider's Triconex controllers, which keep equipment operating safely by performing tasks like regulating voltage, pressure and temperatures. Those controllers are used in about 18,000 plants around the world, including nuclear and water treatment facilities, oil and gas refineries, and chemical plants. ""If attackers developed a technique against Schneider equipment in Saudi Arabia, they could very well deploy the same technique here in the United States,"" said James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. The Triconex system was believed to be a ""lock and key operation."" In other words, the safety controllers could be tweaked or dismantled only with physical contact. So how did the hackers get in? Investigators found an odd digital file in a computer at an engineering workstation that looked like a legitimate part of the Schneider controllers but was designed to sabotage the system. Investigators will not say how it got there, but they do not believe it was an inside job. This was the first time these systems were sabotaged remotely. The only thing that prevented significant damage was a bug in the attackers' computer code that inadvertently shut down the plant's production systems. Investigators believe that the hackers have probably fixed their mistake by now, and that it is only a matter of time before they deploy the same technique against another industrial control system. A different group could also use those tools for its own attack. The August attack was also a significant step up from earlier attacks in Saudi Arabia. Starting on Nov. 17, 2016, computer screens at a number of Saudi government computers went dark and their hard drives were erased, according to researchers at Symantec, which investigated the attacks. Two weeks later, the same attackers hit other Saudi targets with the same computer virus. On Jan. 23, 2017, they struck again, at Tasnee and other petrochemical firms, deploying a computer virus known as Shamoon, after a word embedded in its code. The Shamoon virus first surfaced five years earlier at Saudi Aramco, wiping out tens of thousands of computers and replacing the data with a partial image of a burning American flag. Leon E. Panetta, the United States defense secretary at the time, said the attack could be a harbinger. ""An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these kinds of cyber tools to gain control of critical switches,"" he said. Government officials and cybersecurity experts in Saudi Arabia and the United States attributed the 2012 Shamoon attack to Iranian hackers. ""Another attacker could have adopted that code"" for the January 2017 attacks, said Vikram Thakur, a senior researcher at Symantec, ""but our analysis showed the likelihood it was the same perpetrator was pretty high."" The attack in August was not a Shamoon attack. It was much more dangerous. Investigators believe a nation-state was responsible because there was no obvious profit motive, even though the attack would have required significant financial resources. And the computer code had not been seen in any earlier assaults. Every hacking tool had been custom built. The attackers not only had to figure out how to get into that system, they had to understand its design well enough to know the layout of the facility -- what pipes went where and which valves to turn in order to trigger an explosion. Investigators believe someone would have had to buy the same version of the Triconex safety system to figure out how it worked. The components, investigators said, could be purchased for $40,000 on eBay. The attack has also shown the challenge of attributing with unquestionable evidence an attack to one country. Security experts said Iran, China, Russia the United States and Israel had the technical sophistication to launch such attacks. But most of those countries had no motivation to do so. China and Russia are increasingly making energy deals with Saudi Arabia, and Israel and the United States have moved to cooperate with the kingdom against Iran. That leaves Iran, which experts said had a growing military hacking program, although the Iranian government has denied any involvement in such attacks. Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have steadily escalated in recent years, and the conflict has drifted online. United States officials and security analysts blamed Iranian hackers for a spate of attacks on American banks in 2012 and more recent espionage attacks on the airline industry. Iranian hackers were blamed for the 2012 Aramco attack and are also the leading suspects in the more recent Shamoon attacks. The August attack was far more sophisticated than any previous attack originating from Iran, Mr. Thakur of Symantec said, but there is a chance Iran could have improved its hacking abilities or worked with another country, like Russia or North Korea. Tasnee said in an email that it had hired experts from Symantec and IBM to study the attack against it. The company said it had also ""completely overhauled our security standards"" and started using new tools to prevent attacks. ""Being a global business,"" the company said, ""we believe that cybersecurity is a concern wherever you are in the world.""

Danger of a Cyberattack on New York; Letter,"To the Editor: Re ""Atlanta Hobbled by Major Cyberattack That Mayor Calls 'a Hostage Situation' "" (news article, March 28):  Without question, cybersecurity is a public safety issue; it is panic-inducing to think about the damage an attack similar to Atlanta's could inflict on New York City's 8.6 million residents. While local governments are certainly vulnerable to such hacks, so, too, are the institutions that keep New York's economy running: our banks, media and tech companies, real estate companies and hospitals. A sustained, targeted attack on these economic engines could send us into a recession, or worse. Some forward-thinking companies are already investing millions to protect their assets. But New York and other global cities need to support cyber companies developing the latest technology that can keep all our institutions, both public and private, safe. New York recently announced that it will create a dedicated cyber hub to accelerate research and development, an important first step in bringing more cybersecurity options to the marketplace. Atlanta is a stark reminder that such advancements can't come soon enough. JAMES PATCHETT, NEW YORK The writer is president and chief executive of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.

U.S.-U.K. Warning on Cyberattacks Includes Private Homes,"LONDON -- The United States and Britain on Monday issued a first-of-its-kind joint warning about Russian cyberattacks against government and private organizations as well as individual homes and offices in both countries, a milestone in the escalating use of cyberweaponry between major powers. Although Washington and London have known for decades that the Kremlin was trying to penetrate their computer networks, the joint warning appeared to represent an effort to deter future attacks by calling attention to existing vulnerabilities, prodding individuals to mitigate them and threatening retaliation against Moscow if damage was done.  ""When we see malicious cyberattacks, whether from the Kremlin or other nation-state actors, we are going to push back,"" Rob Joyce, a special assistant to the president and the cybersecurity coordinator for the National Security Council, said in joint conference call with journalists by senior officials in Washington and London. That would include ""all elements of U.S. power available to push back against these kinds of intrusions,"" he added, including ""our capabilities in the physical world."" Robert Hannigan, an executive with the cybersecurity company BlueVoyant and the former director of the British electronic spying agency GCHQ, said: ""We have found the Russians in routers and deep inside networks for 20 years. But this is about saying to the Russians, 'We know where you are pre-positioned and if something happens, we will know it is you.'"" The sweep and urgency of the statements from both sides of the Atlantic called to mind a computer-age version of a Cold War air raid drill, but asking citizens to upgrade their passwords rather than duck and cover. Ciaran Martin, chief executive of Britain's National Cyber Security Center, said Russia had targeted ""millions"" of devices in both countries, often seeking to hack into individual homes or small businesses or to control their routers. ""Once you own the router, you own all the traffic, to include the chance to harvest credentials and passwords,"" said Howard Marshall, deputy assistant director of the cyber division at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ""It is a tremendous weapon in the hands of an adversary."" In particular, both governments said, Russians were seeking to exploit the increasing popularity of internet-connected devices around homes and businesses -- the so-called internet of things -- ""the kind of thing you and I have in our homes,"" Mr. Joyce said. The officials said the Kremlin was often utilizing what were known as man-in-the-middle attacks, in which hackers secretly inserted themselves into the exchange of data between a computer or server in order to eavesdrop, collect confidential information, misdirect payments or further compromise security. ""Russian state-sponsored actors are using compromised routers to conduct spoofing 'man-in-the-middle' attacks to support espionage, extract intellectual property, maintain persistent access to victim networks and potentially lay a foundation for future offensive operations,"" the British government said in a prepared statement. ""Multiple sources including private and public-sector cybersecurity research organizations and allies have reported this activity to the U.S. and U.K. governments."" But the officials said that the extent of Russia's successful penetration of Western computer networks was not fully clear, nor was the Kremlin's ultimate intent. Russia might be tapping into millions of home or small business computers and other devices to gain the ability to use them later in a coordinated attack on government computers or critical infrastructure, the officials said. The goal ""is not always to steal information,"" Mr. Joyce said. ""Sometimes it is to facilitate other operations"" or ""for further aggressive acts."" The warnings issued Monday, including the release of technical guidance to businesses and individuals, had been in the works for a long period and do not reflect any response to recent events, the officials said. But the finger pointing toward Moscow also comes at a moment of escalating tensions. Russian diplomats have castigated the United States, Britain and France for their airstrikes last week on what they said were chemical weapons facilities in Syria, where the Kremlin is backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia and the Western governments have also recalled diplomats in a back and forth over British accusations that the Kremlin used a nerve agent to try to assassinate a former Russian spy living near London. In Washington, both Democrats and Republicans have criticized President Trump for what they say is his reluctance to hold Russia accountable for its hacking of the Democrats during the 2016 presidential election; American intelligence agencies have also blamed the Kremlin for those attacks. Against that backdrop, Washington and London have been moving together for months to publicize allegations of other malicious cyberactivities by the Kremlin. In February, they blamed Russia for a cyberattack the previous June that was known as NotPetya. Initially aimed at Ukraine, the attack spread through computer networks around the world, doing what the White House said was billions of dollars in damages in the United States, Europe and Asia. Both the United States and Britain have accused the Kremlin of trying to penetrate the electrical grid in both countries, although without yet doing any damage. After describing the Russian threats, officials of both governments on Monday repeatedly urged individuals and businesses to better protect their own networks. ""We need to place as much emphasis on security as we do on ease and functionality,"" Mr. Joyce urged manufacturers. David D. Kirkpatrick reported from London, and Ron Nixon from Washington.

How West Virginia Is Trying to Build Hacker-Proof Voting,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- The next election in the Mountaineer State was still weeks away. But 5,000 miles from West Virginia's capital city, in a suburb northwest of Moscow, someone was already scouting for ways to get into the state's election computer network this spring. That someone's IP address, a designation as a ""malicious host,"" even a tiny Russian flag -- it was all there on a computer display in an office just across the Kanawha River from the state's gold-domed capitol. And he had company. ""See, right here, a Canadian IP address is trying to go into online voter registration,"" said the West Virginia Air National Guard sergeant who was tracking the would-be intruders, pointing at the screen. ""Here's someone from Great Britain trying to do the same. China is trying to get into the home page -- trying to, but they're getting blocked.""  As West Virginians cast ballots on Tuesday in a primary election, no one can guarantee that outsiders will not disrupt the voting or even alter the results. Since 2016, when Russian hackers attacked election systems in 21 states and even penetrated one voter-registration database, it has become clear that any election that relies on computers -- that is, all of them -- is a potential target for meddlers. But the odds that the state will be able to fend off the attackers, or detect and correct any damage they do, are far better today than they were two years ago. West Virginia is neither wealthy nor particularly tech-savvy, but since 2016 it has embraced election cybersecurity with an enthusiasm that many other states have yet to muster. ""We had a lot of county clerks saying, 'Why are you talking so much about cybersecurity? The Russians aren't going to attack us,' "" the state's chief election official, Secretary of State Mac Warner, said in an interview. But in an era when election irregularities can be instantly publicized and spread online, he said, any state that does not protect its election systems is inviting an attack. While meddling by hostile nations is of greatest concern, hundreds and even thousands of other outsiders probe West Virginia's election computer security almost daily, as they do in other states. It's usually difficult to tell whether a specific probe comes from a government, a live hacker intent on doing harm, or a computer program that is automatically checking for vulnerabilities. Mr. Warner's point was driven home only last month when the elections website in Knox County, Tenn. was immobilized by a so-called distributed denial-of-service attack as the polls closed for a primary election. The attack, which was came from computers both inside and outside the country, slowed the reporting of election returns but did not destroy any data. Mr. Warner, a Republican in his first term as secretary of state, says he has taken the security threat to heart. Last year he sought and received an F.B.I. briefing on the origin and nature of the Russian cyberattacks, and he took a seat on a council of state, local and federal officials that coordinates election-security policies with the Department of Homeland Security. He has since obtained a security clearance that gives him limited access to intelligence on election-related threats. And he has placed the National Guard sergeant, who has a top-secret clearance, in West Virginia's Intelligence Fusion Center, a nexus of state and federal law-enforcement and intelligence officials who handle threats ranging from floods to cyberattacks. Nationwide, experts say, election security still can be a hit-or-miss affair. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, 13 states employ at least some voting machines that leave no paper record of ballots cast, making it impossible to detect fraud. Five of them use paperless machines exclusively. Georgia and Pennsylvania are particularly notorious for relying on voting devices that run ancient, insecure versions of Windows software and create no paper trail that can be audited. When the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress graded the states and the District of Columbia in February on seven key aspects of election security, no state earned higher than a B. Five -- Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee -- earned Fs. But that is rapidly changing. ""While we're certainly not all the way there, both awareness and activity in the security field is considerable"" among state election officials, said Doug Chapin, the director of the Program for Excellence in Election Administration at the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs. ""Maybe we haven't closed all the holes. But we're in the process of closing the bigger ones."" States are making progress in replacing outdated paperless voting machines with new, more secure ones that leave a paper trail: Louisiana and Delaware, two of the five states, have sought bids for replacements, and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest number of paperless devices, told its 67 counties last month to order new machines to take their place by the end of 2019. Efforts to replace all voting machines in another paperless state, Georgia, died when the legislature adjourned in March. Bipartisan federal legislation that would enable states to receive federal grants to improve election cybersecurity is stalled in the Senate, apparently by Republican opposition; a similar Republican-sponsored bill in the House also appears dead in the water. Many election-security experts say the biggest threat is the one that Russian hackers seemed to focus on in 2016: disrupting an election by scrambling the databases of registered voters that precinct workers rely on to check voters' eligibility on Election Day. Here, too, states are battening down their computer networks. Some states have installed Department of Homeland Security-approved monitors on state or local computer systems to spot malware and attacks from rogue IP addresses; 33 states undergo weekly ""cyberhygiene"" reviews conducted remotely by the agency. Perhaps the biggest unplugged hole, according to Mr. Chapin of the University of Minnesota, is the lack of security precautions in smaller jurisdictions -- small cities and rural counties where managing elections is a part-time job, often farmed out to local representatives of national makers of election computer systems. ""The old line about a chain only being as strong as its weakest link is true,"" Mr. Capin said. ""One person who gives up access to a server can create tremendous problems for everybody."" West Virginia's cyberdefenses began with a built-in advantage: State law requires that hand-countable paper ballots be used in every election. Even if voting machines were altered to try to sway election results, the ballots guarantee that the true outcome of a race could still be determined. The state also demands other safeguards. Voting machines are tested before and after elections to ensure that a set of mock votes are reported identically; testers also reset the machines' internal clocks to Election Day to spot any malware programmed to alter results on that one day and then self-destruct. The other tempting target for hackers, the statewide voter registration database, also is tightly guarded. In 2016, Russian hackers broke into one such database, in Illinois, by exploiting a flaw in a web page that allowed citizens to register or change registrations online. In West Virginia and many other states, the database is ""air-gapped"" -- cut off from public access. Online registrations are hosted on a separate computer, and new data is hand-carried to the main database on a thumb drive. The database does have a vulnerability: Some 300 workers in the state's 55 county clerk's offices regulary log in to it to update local registrants' information. Passwords pilfered from those offices could provide a hostile power with an avenue to change or destroy voters' information. But there, too, security has been tightened. The county clerks regularly meet by phone for briefings on cybersecurity issues like password management. Last year Mr. Warner participated in cyberwar games -- a simulated attack on an American election by a hostile power -- staged by the Defending Digital Democracy project at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Mr. Warner was so impressed, he said, that he asked the head of West Virginia's county clerks' association to attend a reprise of the exercise. The war games, he said, taught him that even the most secure election system will be attacked and perhaps even cracked -- and that ""speed of recovery"" is the key to keeping voters' confidence in the results high. ""It gave me a comfort level as a new secretary of state that, yes, we're going to be attacked, and when it happens, don't freak,"" he said. ""You have to have your detection capabilities up to know when it happens. And when it does, close it down."" PHOTO: Voting machines for Putnam County, W. Va., are secured in a building in Winfield, the county seat, when not in use. The state has been reinforcing its defenses against election tampering.

White House Eliminates Cybersecurity Coordinator Role,"The White House eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator on the National Security Council on Tuesday, doing away with a post central to developing policy to defend against increasingly sophisticated digital attacks and the use of offensive cyber weapons. A memorandum circulated by an aide to the new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said the post was no longer considered necessary because lower-level officials had already made cybersecurity issues a ""core function"" of the president's national security team. Cybersecurity experts and members of Congress said they were mystified by the move, though some suggested Mr. Bolton did not want any competitive power centers emerging inside the national security apparatus.  The decision was criticized by Mark R. Warner, a senator from Virginia and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""I don't see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats,"" he wrote on Twitter. It was the latest in a series of steps that appeared to run counter to the prevailing view in Washington of cybersecurity's importance. Two years ago, a commission established by President Barack Obama urged elevating the cybersecurity coordinator job and turning the position into an assistant to the president, on par to the assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security -- a reflection that various federal agencies did not have clear lines of authority or clear strategies in cybersecurity. President Trump began his administration with two respected veterans of cyber policy. He appointed Thomas P. Bossert, a lawyer in the administration of President George W. Bush, as the homeland security adviser. The cybersecurity coordinator who reported to him, Rob Joyce, had run the Tailored Access Operations unit of the N.S.A. -- the unit that, until it was reorganized and renamed, was responsible for breaking into foreign computer systems as part of United States covert operations. Mr. Bossert and Mr. Joyce said Russia and North Korea were the culprits in major cyberattacks over the last year, and together they developed a system for making more public the decisions about which vulnerabilities to turn over to the private sector for patching -- and which to retain in America's arsenal for possible offensive use. Mr. Bossert was forced out on Mr. Bolton's second day on the job, and Mr. Joyce returned to the N.S.A. on Friday. It is unclear how those issues will now be managed in the White House. Mr. Bolton has virtually no cyber-related experience. When he was last in government, as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, cybersecurity was not formally considered a national threat. It is now listed as the No. 1 threat in the annual assessment that the director of national intelligence sends to Congress. Mr. Bolton has talked about ""streamlining"" the N.S.C., and so far that appears to have involved reducing many of the new positions created over the past decade. Mr. Bolton's decision was first reported by Politico. The elimination of the cybersecurity role is likely to increase concern that the Trump administration is short-handed and unprepared to deal with increasing cybersecurity threats. The White House still has not presented a coherent plan to protect election systems in advance of the fall midterm elections. Russian hackers are believedto have penetrated election computers in a number of states, though there is no evidence that vote counts were changed. And authorities say hackers with Kremlin ties engaged in a wide-ranging campaign to attack the computer systems of Democratic officials and spread misinformation on social media before and after the 2016 presidential election. Security experts are also worried that hackers operating out of Iran or Russia could renew their efforts to penetrate computer systems in the United States, including machines that operate critical infrastructure like the electric power grid. The responsibilities of White House cybersecurity coordinator will be delegated to two members of the N.S.C.'s team. Joshua Steinman, who had little cybersecurity policy experience before joining the N.S.C., will assume responsibility for offensive policy, including responses to cyberthreats from foreign adversaries. The defensive and homeland security responsibilities will fall to Grant Schneider, who already serves in a dual role as acting United States chief information security officer and senior director for cybersecurity at the N.S.C. ""Moving forward, these senior directors will coordinate cyber matters and policy. As they sit six feet apart from one another, they will be able to coordinate in real time,"" Robert Palladino, an N.S.C. spokesman, said in a statement. Cybersecurity policy experts had been pressing the administration in recent weeks to keep the position. Michael Daniel, who was White House cybersecurity coordinator under the Obama administration, said the Trump administration was sending a message that ""cybersecurity is not very important."" ""The position is actually a very important one,"" Mr. Daniel said. ""The cyber threat landscape only getting worse, it's not getting easier right now."" Follow Nicole Perlroth and David E.

Banks Adopt Military-Style Tactics to Fight Cybercrime,"O'FALLON, Mo. -- In a windowless bunker here, a wall of monitors tracked incoming attacks -- 267,322 in the last 24 hours, according to one hovering dial, or about three every second -- as a dozen analysts stared at screens filled with snippets of computer code. Pacing around, overseeing the stream of warnings, was a former Delta Force soldier who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan before shifting to a new enemy: cyberthieves. ""This is not that different from terrorists and drug cartels,"" Matt Nyman, the command center's creator, said as he surveyed his squadron of Mastercard employees. ""Fundamentally, threat networks operate in similar ways."" Cybercrime is one of the world's fastest-growing and most lucrative industries. At least $445 billion was lost last year, up around 30 percent from just three years earlier, a global economic study found, and the Treasury Department recently designated cyberattacks as one of the greatest risks to the American financial sector. For banks and payment companies, the fight feels like a war -- and they're responding with an increasingly militarized approach.  Former government cyberspies, soldiers and counterintelligence officials now dominate the top ranks of banks' security teams. They've brought to their new jobs the tools and techniques used for national defense: combat exercises, intelligence hubs modeled on those used in counterterrorism work and threat analysts who monitor the internet's shadowy corners. At Mastercard, Mr. Nyman oversees the company's new fusion center, a term borrowed from the Department of Homeland Security. After the attacks of Sept. 11, the agency set up scores of fusion centers to coordinate federal, state and local intelligence-gathering. The approach spread throughout the government, with the centers used to fight disease outbreaks, wildfires and sex trafficking. Then banks grabbed the playbook. At least a dozen of them, from giants like Citigroup and Wells Fargo to regional players such as Bank of the West, have opened fusion centers in recent years, and more are in the works. Fifth Third Bank is building one in its Cincinnati headquarters, and Visa, which created its first two years ago in Virginia, is developing two more, in Britain and Singapore. Having their own intelligence hives, the banks hope, will help them better detect patterns in all the data they amass. The centers also have a symbolic purpose. Having a literal war room reinforces the new reality. Fending off thieves has always been a priority -- it's why banks build vaults -- but the arms race has escalated rapidly. Cybersecurity has, for many financial company chiefs, become their biggest fear, eclipsing issues like regulation and the economy. Alfred F. Kelly Jr., Visa's chief executive, is ""completely paranoid"" about the subject, he told investors at a conference in March. Bank of America's Brian T. Moynihan said his cybersecurity team is ""the only place in the company that doesn't have a budget constraint."" (The bank's chief operations and technology officer said it is spending about $600 million this year.) The military sharpens soldiers' skills with large-scale combat drills like Jade Helm and Foal Eagle, which send troops into the field to test their tactics and weaponry. The financial sector created its own version: Quantum Dawn, a biennial simulation of a catastrophic cyberstrike. In the latest exercise last November, 900 participants from 50 banks, regulators and law enforcement agencies role-played their response to an industrywide infestation of malicious malware that first corrupted, and then entirely blocked, all outgoing payments from the banks. Throughout the two-day test, the organizers lobbed in new threats every few hours, like denial-of-service attacks that knocked the banks' websites offline. The first Quantum Dawn, back in 2011, was a lower-key gathering. Participants huddled in a conference room to talk through a mock attack that shut down stock trading. Now, it's a live-fire drill. Each bank spends months in advance re-creating its internal technology on an isolated test network, a so-called cyber range, so that its employees can fight with their actual tools and software. The company that runs their virtual battlefield, SimSpace, is a Defense Department contractor. Sometimes, the tests expose important gaps. A series of smaller cyber drills coordinated by the Treasury Department, called the Hamilton Series, raised an alarm three years ago. An attack on Sony, attributed to North Korea, had recently exposed sensitive company emails and data, and, in its wake, demolished huge swaths of Sony's internet network. If something similar happened at a bank, especially a smaller one, regulators asked, would it be able to recover? Those in the room for the drill came away uneasy. ""There was a recognition that we needed to add an additional layer of resilience,"" said John Carlson, the chief of staff for the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the industry's main cybersecurity coordination group. Soon after, the group began building a new fail-safe, called Sheltered Harbor, which went into operation last year. If one member of the network has its data compromised or destroyed, others can step in, retrieve its archived records and restore basic customer account access within a day or two. It has not yet been needed, but nearly 70 percent of America's deposit accounts are now covered by it. The largest banks run dozens of their own, internal attack simulations each year, to smoke out their vulnerabilities and keep their first responders sharp. ""It's the idea of muscle memory,"" said Thomas J. Harrington, Citigroup's chief information security officer, who spent 28 years with the F.B.I. Growing interest among its corporate customers in cybersecurity war games inspired IBM to build a digital range in Cambridge, Mass., where it stages data breaches for customers and prospects to practice on. One recent morning, a fictional bank called Bane & Ox was under attack on IBM's range, and two dozen real-life executives from a variety of financial companies gathered to defend it. In the training scenario, an unidentified attacker had dumped six million customer records on Pastebin, a site often used by hackers to publish stolen data caches. As the hours ticked by, the assault grew worse. The lost data included financial records and personally identifying details. One of the customers was Colin Powell, the former secretary of state. Phones in the room kept ringing with calls from reporters, irate executives and, eventually, regulators, wanting details about what had occurred. When the group figured out what computer system had been used in the leak, a heated argument broke out: Should they cut off its network access immediately? Or set up surveillance and monitor any further transmissions? At the urging of a Navy veteran who runs the cyberattack response group at a large New York bank, the group left the system connected. ""Those are the decisions you don't want to be making for the first time during a real attack,"" said Bob Stasio, IBM's cyber range operations manager and a former operations chief for the National Security Agency's cyber center. One financial company's executive team did such a poor job of talking to its technical team during a past IBM training drill, Mr. Stasio said, that he went home and canceled his credit card with them. Like many cybersecurity bunkers, IBM's foxhole has deliberately theatrical touches. Whiteboards and giant monitors fill nearly every wall, with graphics that can be manipulated by touch. ""You can't have a fusion center unless you have really cool TVs,"" quipped Lawrence Zelvin, a former Homeland Security official who is now Citigroup's global cybersecurity head, at a recent cybercrime conference. ""It's even better if they do something when you touch them. It doesn't matter what they do. Just something."" Security pros mockingly refer to such eye candy as ""pew pew"" maps, an onomatopoeia for the noise of laser guns in 1980s movies and video arcades. They are especially useful, executives concede, to put on display when V.I.P.s or board members stop by for a tour. Two popular ""pew pew"" maps are from FireEye and the defunct security vendor Norse, whose video game-like maps show laser beams zapping across the globe. Norse went out of business two years ago, and no one is sure what data the map is based on, but everyone agrees that it looks cool. Jason Witty, the chief information security officer at U.S. Bank, admits that the blinking map he breaks out for customer briefings is mostly for show. But it serves a serious purpose, he said: making the command center's high-stakes work more tangible. ""If you show customers the scripts you're actually running, it's just digits on a screen,"" Mr. Witty said. A big, colorful map is easier to grasp. What everyone in the finance industry is afraid of is a repeat -- on an even larger scale -- of the data breach that hit Equifax last year. Hackers stole personal information, including Social Security numbers, of more than 146 million people. The attack cost the company's chief executive and four other top managers their jobs. Who stole the data, and what they did with it, is still not publicly known. The credit bureau has spent $243 million so far cleaning up the mess. It is Mr. Nyman's job to make sure that doesn't happen at Mastercard. Walking around the company's fusion center, he describes the team's work using military slang. Its focus is ""left of boom,"" he said -- referring to the moments before a bomb explodes. By detecting vulnerabilities and attempted hacks, the analysts aim to head off an Equifax-like explosion. But the attacks keep coming. As he spoke, the dial displayed over his shoulder registered another few assaults on Mastercard's systems. The total so far this year exceeds 20 million.

Facebook Identifies an Active Political Influence Campaign Using Fake Accounts,"WASHINGTON -- Facebook said on Tuesday that it had identified a political influence campaign that was potentially built to disrupt the midterm elections, with the company detecting and removing 32 pages and fake accounts that had engaged in activity around divisive social issues. The company did not definitively link the campaign to Russia. But Facebook officials said some of the tools and techniques used by the accounts were similar to those used by the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked group that was at the center of an indictment this year alleging interference in the 2016 presidential election. Facebook said it had discovered coordinated activity around issues like a sequel to last year's deadly ""Unite the Right"" white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Activity was also detected around #AbolishICE, a left-wing campaign on social media that seeks to end the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. ""At this point in our investigation, we do not have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind it,"" said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy. ""But we can say that these accounts engaged in some similar activity and have connected with known I.R.A accounts.""  The jolting disclosure, delivered to lawmakers in private briefings on Capitol Hill this week and in a public Facebook post on Tuesday, underscored how behind-the-scenes interference in the November elections had begun. In recent weeks, there have been reports of other meddling, including a Daily Beast report that the office of Claire McCaskill of Missouri, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this fall, was unsuccessfully targeted by Russian hackers last year, which Ms. McCaskill confirmed. American intelligence officials have indicated that at least one other unnamed Democratic senator up for re-election has been targeted. Officials at Facebook, which is based in Silicon Valley, said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies on their discovery of the influence campaign. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and other executives also mounted a media blitz to explain what the company did and did not know about the efforts. Those actions were a change from last year, when Facebook was widely criticized for failing to detect Russian interference in the 2016 election. It took Facebook executives months to acknowledge the extent of the Russian operation and release information connected with their investigation. Since then, Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators for other scandals, including data misuse, a misinformation epidemic and accusations of political bias. Last week, the company lost over $120 billion in market value as it projected it would spend more money on moderation and security. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, did not directly address Facebook's findings with reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, but he said President Trump had ""made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference into our electoral process from any nation-state or other malicious actors."" Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump declared again on Twitter that there had been ""No Collusion"" between his campaign and the Russians, and asserted that, in any case, ""collusion is not a crime."" Lawmakers from both parties quickly set aside questions of who had perpetrated the influence campaign and said Facebook's disclosure only clarified what they had feared since the extent of Russian involvement in 2016 became clear more than a year ago: that social media companies would be unable to keep up with the pace and scope of malicious efforts to abuse their platforms. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he would make the disclosure a central part of a previously scheduled hearing on Wednesday, when lawmakers plan to press outside experts on the pervasiveness of foreign influence on social media networks like Facebook. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, praised Facebook on Tuesday for bringing the activity out into the public, but asked for its cooperation in updating laws to prevent influence campaigns. ""Today's disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation,"" he said. Facebook executives characterized the battle with foreign campaigns as a cat-and-mouse game, but said they were making progress to detect suspicious activity more quickly. ""Security is an arms race, and it's never done,"" Ms. Sandberg said in a conference call on Tuesday. Facebook said the recently purged accounts -- eight Facebook pages, 17 Facebook profiles and seven Instagram accounts -- were created between March 2017 and May 2018 and were first discovered two weeks ago. More than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the suspect pages, which had names like Aztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, Mindful Being and Resisters, the company said. Between April 2017 and June 2018, the accounts ran 150 ads costing $11,000 on the two platforms. They were paid for in American and Canadian dollars. The pages created roughly 30 events over a similar period, the largest of which attracted interest from 4,700 accounts. Finding suspicious activity was harder this time around, Facebook said. Unlike many of the alleged Russian trolls in 2016, who paid for Facebook ads in rubles and occasionally used Russian internet protocol addresses, these accounts used advanced security techniques to avoid detection. For instance, they disguised their internet traffic using virtual private networks and internet phone services, and used third parties to buy ads for them. ""These bad actors have been more careful to cover their tracks, in part due to the actions we've taken to prevent abuse over the past year,"" Mr. Gleicher said. But there were clues that the suspicious accounts may have been connected to the Internet Research Agency. Mr. Gleicher said an account known to be associated with the agency had been listed as an administrator of one of the pages for seven minutes. Like the 2016 Russian interference campaign, the recently detected campaign sought to amplify divisive social issues, including through organizing real-world events. Among the campaign's efforts was organizing support for a counterprotest to a conservative rally. Specifically, an account called Resisters, which interacted with one Internet Research Agency account in 2017, created an Aug. 10 event, ""No Unite the Right 2 -- DC,"" to counter a planned white supremacist rally in Washington on Aug. 11 and 12 by the same group that organized the racist march in Charlottesville one year earlier. Although other Facebook pages are promoting the counterprotest, the social network said that the Resisters page was the first, and that it had coordinated with administrators for five other apparently real pages to co-host its page -- publicizing details about transportation and other logistics. A person familiar with the matter said the page was created on June 24. That event page has been taken down, and Facebook has notified roughly 2,600 users who had indicated interest in attending the event, and 600 more who planned to attend, about the suspicious activity behind it. Organizers of the counterprotest -- who quickly created a new Facebook page -- objected to Facebook's suggestion that a fake account was behind the event itself and not just the creator of a Facebook event page for it. One organizer, Chelsea Manning, the former Army analyst who was convicted of sending archives of secret documents to WikiLeaks in 2010 and whose sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017, said the counterprotest was ""real and organic."" She called Facebook's implication that the Resisters account had started it misleading. ""We started organizing several months ago,"" Ms. Manning said. ""Folks from D.C. and Charlottesville have been talking about this since at least February."" On Capitol Hill and in congressional races across the country, the #AbolishICE campaign has divided Democrats and provided Republicans with fodder to paint Democratic candidates as extremists who want open borders. The issue, Republicans hope, could help drive a wedge between liberal Democrats and the moderate voters the party needs to retake control in Washington. Mr. Trump has gone as far as encouraging Democratic candidates to embrace the campaign. ""They're going to get beaten so badly,"" he said in early July. [How ""Abolish ICE"" went from social media to progressive candidates' rallying cry.] After being caught flat-footed by the Internet Research Agency's efforts ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Facebook has expanded its security team, hired counterterrorism experts and recruited workers with government security clearances. The company is using artificial intelligence and teams of human reviewers to detect automated accounts and suspicious election-related activity. It has also tried to make it harder for Russian-style influence campaigns to use covert Facebook ads to sway public opinion, by requiring political advertisers in the United States to register with a domestic mailing address and by making all political ads visible in a public database. Despite Facebook's efforts, stopping coordinated influence campaigns has proved difficult. False news flourished before the Mexican elections in July, and the company has been cracking down on misinformation ahead of Brazil's national elections in October. The American midterms, though, are a major test for the company, which is trying to show that it can handle its role as a global arbiter of conversation and commerce -- even with interference by others. Earlier in July, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, warned that Russian interference remains an active threat to November's elections. ""The warning lights are blinking red again,"" he said. Follow Kevin Roose and Nicholas Fandos on Twitter: @kevinroose and @npfandos.

Trump's Reckless Cybersecurity Strategy,"At first glance, it would be easy to confuse the Trump administration's new National Cyber Strategy with its predecessors: the Obama administration's 2009 Cyberspace Policy Review and George W. Bush's 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. All three documents emphasize strikingly similar goals: the importance of hardening critical infrastructure, working with the private sector, securing government networks and establishing more robust partnerships for sharing information about online threats.  Despite its similarities with previous administrations' plans, however, the National Cyber Strategy represents an abrupt and reckless shift in how the United States government engages with adversaries online. Instead of continuing to focus on strengthening defensive technologies and minimizing the impact of security breaches, the Trump administration plans to ramp up offensive cyberoperations. The new goal: deter adversaries through pre-emptive cyberattacks and make other nations fear our retaliatory powers.   The framework for this shift to an offense-first strategy is found in three recently announced pieces of policy. The first, the National Cyber Strategy, outlines a broad vision of how the administration plans to approach online issues and emphasizes the importance of imposing ""swift, costly and transparent consequences"" on online attackers.  The second is the new Department of Defense cyber strategy, a more detailed plan for how the military will approach cybersecurity. It outlines a plan to ""defend forward"" by going after threats ""before they reach their targets"" and disrupting ""malicious cyber activity at its source.""  And the third is the classified National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, which makes it easier for the military to launch offensive cyberoperations by largely eliminating a lengthy interagency approval process put in place by the Obama administration. The idea of using offensive cyberattacks for defensive purposes is not a new one -- discussions about the potential risks and rewards of ""hacking back,"" especially in the private sector, go back more than five years. But for the American government to embrace this strategy is a sharp change from the cautious, defense-oriented approach of the past decade.  President Barack Obama was notably restrained in his authorization of offensive cyber missions. When deciding whether to use the Stuxnet worm to compromise uranium enrichment facilities in Iran in 2010 (his administration's most famous use of offensive cyber capabilities), he reportedly expressed repeated concerns about the precedent it would set for other countries. The Obama administration's forbearance and careful decision-making around cyberattack authorization aligns with the 2015 Department of Defense cyber strategy, which identified controlling the escalation of cyber conflicts as a key strategic goal. That goal is conspicuously absent from the Department of Defense's new strategy.  The Trump administration's shift to an offensive approach is designed to escalate cyber conflicts, and that escalation could be dangerous. Not only will it detract resources and attention from the more pressing issues of defense and risk management, but it will also encourage the government to act recklessly in directing cyberattacks at targets before they can be certain of who those targets are and what they are doing.  One of the advantages of the slow, unwieldy approval processes put into place by previous administrations is that they gave the government ample time to ascertain who was behind a cyberattack. That is not always easy to do: Many adversaries route cyberattacks through compromised third-party machines in other countries, such as university computer systems. Rushing to retaliate may make it more likely that the United States will lash out at the wrong target, which may invite new attacks rather than deter them.  It could also lead to more attacks from existing adversaries like Russia and North Korea, from whom we already face substantial online threats. These countries have demonstrated their considerable online capabilities in cyberattacks directed at hospitals and power companies. If the United States pre-emptively attacks their servers and online infrastructure, it will only provoke greater and more damaging shows of force. And what these countries are capable of will be every bit as terrifying and harmful as what we can do.  There is no evidence that pre-emptive cyberattacks will serve as effective deterrents to our adversaries in cyberspace. In fact, every time a country has initiated an unprompted cyberattack, it has invariably led to more conflict and has encouraged retaliatory breaches rather than deterring them. Nearly every major publicly known online intrusion that Russia or North Korea has perpetrated against the United States has had significant and unpleasant consequences.  When North Korea compromised Sony Pictures in 2014 and stole the company's data, it experienced a national disruption to its internet connectivity the following month. More recently, Russia has faced sanctions, indictments identifying their key online activities and personnel, and possibly covert cyber operations as punishment for a series of online intrusions and computer compromises. While nobody knows where these counterattacks originated, experts believe some of them came from the United States. Under the new attack-first policy, it's likely that North Korea or Russia will retaliate against the United States in similar ways if threatened. For the United States, this is an especially risky approach given how much of our infrastructure -- from energy distribution to financial systems to voting -- is digitized and how vulnerable that dependence on computer networks makes us to cyberattacks. A smart national cyber strategy would focus on securing our computer systems, data and networks by allocating more money for their protection and by allocating more time and energy to regularly update, measure and test their security. It would charge the government with attacking its own servers and systems domestically to identify potential vulnerabilities before foreign adversaries have a chance to exploit them, rather than encouraging officials to strike out at overseas targets. And it would reserve the use of offensive cyber capabilities for situations that allow for careful consideration of the possible unintended consequences, narrow tailoring to a specific mission and contained, targeted damage. Ironically, the new national cyber strategy also charges the United States government with enhancing cyber stability ""through norms of responsible state behavior."" As the rest of its policies make all too clear, this administration has already committed itself to irresponsible uses of cyber force that may serve to destabilize everyone's online infrastructure, including our own.

Australia Wants to Take Government Surveillance to the Next Level,"SYDNEY, Australia -- A state's capacity to spy on its citizens has grown exponentially in recent years as new technology has meant more aspects of our lives can be observed, recorded and analyzed than ever before. At the same time, much to the frustration of intelligence agencies around the world, so has the ability to keep digital information secret, thanks to encryption.  That's why the main intelligence agencies of the Anglophone world are now hoping that Australia will lead the charge in developing ways to get decrypt information at will, and to tap into data that was previously kept secret. A proposed law, the draft of which was released last month by the cybersecurity minister, is an aggressive step in that direction.  We should all be worried, because it's not just criminals or terrorists who use encryption, but every one of us. We use encryption to buy things online, manage our finances, and communicate personally and professionally. Hospitals, transportation systems and government agencies use encrypted data. Creating tools to weaken encrypted systems for one purpose weakens it for all purposes. If Australia succeeds in doing so, it could be your bank account or your medical records that are compromised in the end. This particular bill has been more than a year in the making. At the June 2017 meeting in Ottawa of the Five Eyes -- the intelligence alliance made up of the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand -- Australia made a point of the need for states to find ways to overcome encryption. A joint communiqué that came out of the meeting noted that encryption can ""severely undermine public safety efforts"" and committed Five Eyes members to working with technology companies to ""explore shared solutions.""  The Australian government set about translating this objective into law. The release of the bill, which came just before the latest meeting of the Five Eyes in Australia last month, which confirmed the strategy. No doubt Australia's intelligence and law enforcement establishment were thrilled with this proposal.  Australia, which has no bill of rights, is a logical place to test new strategies for collecting intelligence that can later be adopted elsewhere. Among other things, the proposed law would create a process for ""designated communications providers"" -- defined so expansively that it covers any business hosting a website -- to assist intelligence and law enforcement agencies to do almost anything to give them access to encrypted communications. For example, providers may have to build tools, install software or keep agencies up-to-date with developments. In essence, state agencies will be able to circumvent encryption, either with the cooperation of tech companies or by compulsion.  The government has been quick to claim that this is not a back door, and the bill prohibits requests to companies to create ""systemic"" weaknesses. But this prohibition is ambiguous, and the reporting and accountability safeguards are minimal.  The truth is that there is simply no way to create tools to undermine encryption without jeopardizing digital security and eroding individual rights and freedoms. Hackers with bad intentions will do their utmost to take advantage of any such tools that companies are forced to provide the government.  There are good reasons to be deeply wary of granting powers to state agencies to build and hoard tools that weaken technological infrastructure. Last year, the WannaCry ransomware threwBritain's National Health Service into chaos. The attack exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft software. According to Microsoft, the United States National Security Agency had discovered the vulnerability well before the ransomware was released, but decided against disclosing it to Microsoft to fix, and thereby protect the information systems used by the health service.  Industry figures and experts argue that the N.S.A. was seeking to accumulate a kind of digital arsenal -- it could use the vulnerability for its own intelligence purposes while it remained unpatched. The problem was that at some point, intelligence about the vulnerability was apparently stolen. Only then did the N.S.A. tell Microsoft about its existence. As Microsoft pointed out, this was the equivalent of a Tomahawk missile going missing. British patients paid the price.  Seemingly in response to such criticisms, the bill in Australia prohibits the government from preventing a company from repairing such a vulnerability. But this is cold comfort: The N.S.A. didn't need to prevent Microsoft patching the problem because Microsoft didn't even know it existed.  The WannaCry attack illustrates how intelligence agencies prioritize their own interests. If we give state agencies more power to build tools to circumvent encryption, not only do we expose ourselves to the risk that they can be stolen, we are forced to trust that these agencies will behave responsibly. The evidence to date suggests the opposite.  Worse still, the Australian government hardly has the best reputation for keeping things safe. In recent times, it has lost control of medical data; one of its military contractors was hacked and lost ""large amounts"" of data; a cabinet full of secret documents even turned up this year in a secondhandfurniture store. Just think about how easily sophisticated criminals might be able to get their hands on any digital tools for getting access to encrypted communications.  When Edward Snowden revealed in 2013 that the American and British spy agencies had tried to weaken encryption so that they could tap digital communications, cryptography scholars voiced their shock that these agencies would act ""against the interests of the public."" ""By weakening all our security so that they can listen in to the communications of our enemies,"" they wrote, ""they also weaken our security against our potential enemies.""  The same is true today. The Australian government is testing the limits of our democracy by seeking to empower the surveillance state, and what it learns will have implications globally. We need to take a stand against this power grab by state agencies, and reject the idea that encrypted communications undermine security. Quite the opposite: They are complementary.

"Attempted Hacking of Voter Database Was a False Alarm, Democratic Party Says","Follow Eileen Sullivan, Noah Weiland and Kate Conger on Twitter: @esullivannyt and @noahweiland and @kateconger. WASHINGTON -- The suspected hacking attempt of the Democratic National Committee's voter database this week was a false alarm, and the unusual activity that raised concern was merely a test, party officials said on Thursday. The blunder was caused by a lack of communication between the national committee and one of its state branches, the officials said. The Michigan Democratic Party had hired hackers to simulate an attack known as phishing, but did not inform the national committee.    The Michigan Democratic Party's test had attributes similar to an actual hacking, said Bob Lord, the national committee's chief security officer. When the Democratic National Committee was contacted by cybersecurity experts this week about the activity, it notified the F.B.I. out of fears that it was another Russian attempt to penetrate the committee, as Moscow did during the 2016 presidential campaign.    The jolts of panic caused by what turned out to be an intraparty action underscored the fear of another major breach of the party's systems just weeks before the midterm elections, even as computer security has been made a priority and shored up since 2016. American intelligence officials have said there continue to be real threats from Russia to interfere in American elections.   ''There are constant attempts to hack the D.N.C. and our Democratic infrastructure, and while we are extremely relieved that this wasn't an attempted intrusion by a foreign adversary, this incident is further proof that we need to continue to be vigilant in light of potential attacks,'' Mr. Lord said in a statement.   Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, called the situation a ''misstep'' and said it was part of efforts to improve cybersecurity ''especially as the Trump administration refuses to crack down on foreign interference in our elections.''   ''In an abundance of caution, our digital partners ran tests that followed extensive training,'' he added.   In 2016, Russian state-backed operatives penetrated the Democratic National Committee using a phishing campaign, in which hackers create website login pages that appear to be legitimate to trick unsuspecting users into giving up their user names and passwords. Hackers can then use the stolen credentials to log in to systems like email or voter registration databases.   Now campaigns often test their employees with phishing simulations like the one conducted by the Michigan party, in which it had third parties set up a fake page that mimicked the party's login page for its voter-registration website.   That page was detected late Monday by the cybersecurity firm Lookout, which informed the Democratic National Committee. The fake page appeared to be aimed at hacking the Democratic National Committee's Votebuilder database, which Mr. Lord has referred to as ''the party's most sensitive information.''   The database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and computer files. Its successful penetration could have set off other hacking in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said.   ''Phishing attacks to get credentials or install malware are the ammunition that's currently being used to attack our election systems,'' said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, an election security expert and the chief technologist of the Center for Democracy and Technology.   In an interview, Mr. Lord said that the fake page did not contain any educational features -- leading the Democratic National Committee to believe it was an actual hacking attempt rather than a test.   ''It very closely mimicked the infrastructure you'd see actual hackers using,'' he said. ''At the time that it was detected by outside parties, it did not exhibit any of the characteristics of a training system.''   The committee's incident response plan requires it to notify law enforcement in the event of a hacking attempt. ''It's important for me to make sure that when we believe that we are the victim of a criminal act, that we take appropriate action and involve law enforcement,'' Mr. Lord said.   Mike Murray, the head of security intelligence at Lookout, said it was essential that the activity was caught, even if it was benign.   ''You don't know that it's a false alarm until you show up with the ladders and the fire trucks and the hoses,'' he said. ''Our goal is to detect bad people doing bad things, regardless of whether that's crime or espionage or some kid messing around. We don't want anybody to be attacked.''   With the midterms just over 70 days from now, political groups and systems administrators have been on high alert about hacks and foreign meddling.   Microsoft recently detected that hackers tied to Russian intelligence targeted the Senate and conservative think tanks in the United States by creating fake websites. Last month, Facebook discovered a political influence campaign directed at disrupting the coming elections. And this week, the social media giant said it had found other disinformation efforts outside the United States.    "
Google Deletes 39 YouTube Channels Linked to Iranian Influence Operation,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Two days after Facebook revealed far-reaching Iranian and Russian disinformation campaigns on its social network, Google said Thursday that it had removed 39 YouTube channels linked to the Iranian state broadcaster. Google, which owns YouTube, said in a blog post that it had determined the 39 YouTube channels were linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting. It discovered those accounts working off a tip from the cybersecurity firm FireEye about a handful of suspicious Google accounts. Google terminated those accounts, along with six blogs on its Blogger service and 13 Google+ accounts, for running an influence campaign starting as early as January 2017 while disguising its connection to Iran, said Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs. Google said those accounts had shared ""English-language political content in the U.S.,"" but it did not provide detail on what types of videos or content.  Google revealed the new influence campaigns taking place through its products after Facebook and Twitter announced that they had deleted similar accounts. It is another indication of the growing efforts by state-sponsored actors to use the social media platforms of American companies for politically motivated purposes. While YouTube is the most popular online video platform, with nearly two billion visitors every month, it has managed to avoid the scrutiny heaped upon Facebook for its involvement in spreading misinformation by foreigners. In part, that is because sharing content to other users across its network is not as easy. Google's attempts to build a social network to rival Facebook have largely flopped, so fake Google+ accounts reach a limited audience -- making it unpopular among both users and foreign manipulators. Google said Tuesday that it suspended one account linked to an Iranian influence campaign. Google said that ""relevant videos"" on the 39 now-deleted YouTube channels had 13,466 total views in the United States -- a relatively small number for YouTube. It did not define what constituted a relevant video. Those YouTube channels were terminated over the last few weeks, said Rob Shilkin, a Google spokesman. Google said it had used forensic evidence, such as common internet protocol addresses and website domain information, to conclude that the misinformation campaign was a coordinated attack from Iran's state broadcaster. ""This finding is consistent with internet activity we've warned about in recent years from Iran,"" Mr. Walker wrote. He added that Google had warned its users about email ""phishing"" attempts and security attacks from Iran. A report published by FireEye regarding an Iranian influence campaign aimed at audiences in the United States, Britain, Latin America and the Middle East provided a few examples of YouTube accounts that were trying to advance Iran's interests. One of those channels was called Liberty Front Press -- the account that Google said it had deleted earlier in the week -- featuring videos with titles like ""Rudy Giuliani: Mueller probe now illegitimate"" and ""New C.I.A. chief followed the law, served the country."" Facebook said Tuesday that it had deleted 652 accounts, many of them with Iranian ties. A number of those accounts had been sharing content from Liberty Front Press. In October, Google said it had deleted 18 accounts with links to the Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, that uploaded English-language political content. The channels had uploaded more than 1,100 videos spanning 43 hours. Google said Thursday that it had detected and removed an additional 42 channels from ""I.R.A.-related actors"" since last year. Those channels had 58 English-language political videos, which had accumulated fewer than 1,800 views. Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.

How FireEye Helped Facebook Spot a Disinformation Campaign,"SAN FRANCISCO -- FireEye, a cybersecurity company that has been involved in a number of prominent investigations, including the 2016 attack on the Democratic National Committee, alerted Facebook in July that it had a problem. Security analysts at the company noticed a cluster of inauthentic accounts and pages on Facebook that were sharing content from a site called Liberty Front Press. It looked like a news site, but most of its content was stolen from outlets like Politico and CNN. The small amount of original material was written in choppy English. FireEye's tip eventually led Facebook to remove 652 fake accounts and pages. And Liberty Front Press, the common thread among much of that sham activity, was linked to state media in Iran, Facebook said on Tuesday. Facebook's latest purge of disinformation from its platforms highlighted the key role that cybersecurity outfits are playing in policing the pages of giant social media platforms. For all of their wealth and well-staffed security teams, companies like Facebook often rely on outside firms and researchers for their expertise.  The discovery of the disinformation campaign also represented a shift in the bad behavior that independent security companies are on the lookout for. Long in the business of discovering and fending off hacking attempts and all sorts of malware, security companies have expanded their focus to the disinformation campaigns that have plagued Facebook and other social media for the past few years. Founded in 2004 in Milpitas, Calif., FireEye has a work force of about 3,000 people, a fraction of Facebook's. But it employs security analysts with particular skills, including employees who are fluent in English, Arabic, Russian, French and Italian, helping them to identify and track misinformation around the world. Lee Foster, the manager of FireEye's information operations analysis team, described in an interview with The New York Times how his company spotted the Iranian disinformation campaign. He declined to say whether his research into the Iranian campaign was on behalf of a particular client because FireEye has a policy against naming who it is working with. ""It started with a single social media account or a small set of accounts that were pushing this political-themed content that didn't necessarily seem in line with the personas that the accounts had adopted,"" said Mr. Foster. Many of the fake accounts, which sprawled across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, shared content from Liberty Front Press. Over two months, Mr. Foster and a small group of analysts mapped the connections between the accounts and unearthed more of them. The evidence pointed toward Iran. A website for Liberty Front Press was initially registered to an email linked to ads for web designers in Tehran before being switched to a registrant purportedly based in San Jose, Calif. The web designer email had also been used to register another news site. That site, in turn, was associated with a number of email addresses linked to even more inauthentic news sites. Digging deeper, FireEye found that many of the Twitter accounts sharing Liberty Front Press content were linked to Iranian phone numbers, although the profiles claimed to be operating in the United States. Stepping from fake news site to news site and from Twitter to Facebook, FireEye pieced together a campaign that tried to influence audiences in the Middle East, as well as in the United States, Britain and Latin America. The analysts were careful to collect data without being noticed. ""I have to be conscious about tipping off the operators of this,"" Mr. Foster said. ""I want to make sure I've got everything, so we don't deal with one small component of the threat and we find out there's this whole other cluster of it."" Iran's cyber capabilities have grown in recent years and Iranian hackers have been blamed for a number of significant attacks. Earlier this year, federal law enforcement officials said nine Iranians were behind intrusions at American government agencies, universities and private companies. Attributing attacks to Iran has been tricky. Security experts who have studied Iranian hackerssaid many take part in attacks, or disinformation campaigns, while they are still in college. They are often recruited for government work, but may also float in and out of government-backed contracts. Those loose affiliations make it difficult to pinpoint which attacks are directed by Iranian authorities. FireEye's information set off Facebook's own investigation, which uncovered three other Iranian disinformation efforts and another that appeared to originate in Russia. One of the Iranian campaigns Facebook discovered dabbled in a mix of misinformation and more traditional hacking, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, wrote in a blog post. ""They typically posed as news organizations and didn't reveal their true identity,"" he said. ""They also engaged in traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack people's accounts and spread malware, which we had seen before and disrupted."" The Russian pages discovered by Facebook were unrelated to FireEye's research. Facebook said the accounts were linked to people that law enforcement in the United States had identified as Russian military intelligence. Unlike other fake pages that have been attributed to Russians over the last year, those accounts posted content focused on politics in Syria and Ukraine. FireEye's information operations analysis team was formed in 2016, when hacked emails from several political figures were beginning to appear on the site DCLeaks. ""All through that period, we were tracking the Russian effort to influence U.S. elections,"" Mr. Foster said. ""Obviously, social media is a very important kind of medium by which these campaigns are undertaken."" Mr. Foster had been tracking influence campaigns long before they became a major narrative in American politics. He previously worked at iSight Partners, a cyberintelligence firm acquired by FireEye in January 2016, where he tracked so-called hacktivist groups like Anonymous. An attack on Sony's computer network by North Korean hackers in 2014 put cybersecurity companies on notice that they had to pay more attention to information warfare. The Sony intrusion was destructive to technical systems, ""but there was more to it than that,"" Mr. Foster said. ""It was about conveying a message and trying to influence an audience."" In time, ""we realized there was a bigger kind of potential threat there that we need to address,"" he added. The Sony attack was also a game changer for governments and other major companies, said Graham Brookie, the director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, which has analyzed misinformation on Facebook. Thousands of embarrassing emails between Sony executives were dumped online. The hackers also stole employees' personal information, including Social Security numbers, and wiped Sony's servers. The incident prompted officials in the United States to establish protocols for sharing information about cybersecurity threats and influence operations, Mr. Brookie said. But information sharing still seems to have its limits. Unlike Facebook, Twitter did not receive advance notice from FireEye about the fake Twitter profiles the security company had uncovered. Several of them were still live Tuesday night, hours after Facebook's announcement. Twitter has since suspended 284 accounts based on the information revealed by Facebook and FireEye, the company said in a tweet. As internet outlets struggle to keep up with influence campaigns, Mr. Foster believes complex disinformation schemes will become more common. ""What this is great for demonstrating is, it really doesn't matter what the political goals or ideological goals are, these techniques are seen as an attractive way to try to achieve them,"" Mr. Foster said.

Hack of Saudi Petrochemical Plant Was Coordinated From Russian Institute,"A new study of the malicious computer code used in a botched attack on a Saudi petrochemical plant concludes that much of the effort was coordinated from inside a state-owned Russian scientific institute, one of the most direct links between official Russian hackers and a hostile intrusion on a major piece of infrastructure. The report, issued by FireEye, a major cybersecurity company, identifies the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, a technical research institute in Moscow with ties to Russian governments reaching back before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. But it leaves unanswered the question of why Moscow would target a Middle Eastern plant, even given Russia's rivalry with Saudi Arabia in the petroleum marketplace.  FireEye did not identify the plant that was attacked, because of restrictions placed on it by the customer who sought the company's help in recovering from the attack. But The New York Times identified the facility in March as a Saudi plant, at a time that there was wide consensus that the attack must have been initiated by Iran, Saudi Arabia's great rival for regional influence. It still may have been that Iran was behind the attack -- but the new research suggests that, if it was, Iran had a lot of Russian help, and that when the malware needed to be fine-tuned, the Russian institute provided the expertise. The attack marked one of the scariest moments so far in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. It was the first known attempt to manipulate an emergency-shutdown system, which is designed to avoid disaster and protect human lives. But something went wrong with the attack, and it actually prompted a full shutdown of the plant, which appeared to be accidental as the malware was loaded into the plant's computers. No industrial accident occurred. Nonetheless, the episode has captivated the attention of experts, who concluded that had things gone according to plan, the next stage of the attack was most likely intended to trigger an industrial accident. If that had happened, the shutdown system would have been disabled. ""We don't know why this facility was targeted,"" said John Hultquist, who oversaw the study at FireEye. ""They may have just been testing things out, just experimenting."" It was unclear why the Russians would have targeted a Saudi plant, other than the obvious fact that the two countries compete as oil and petrochemical producers. ""Sometimes it makes no geopolitical sense,"" Mr. Hultquist said, noting that Russian and other hackers ""operate all over the globe."" The report did not assert that the Russians initiated the attack on the petrochemical facility, nor did it conclude who initiated the action. But it traced much of the code, and activity to maintain and rewrite elements of the malware, to the Russian institute in Moscow. The institute had not been seen before as a major player in the development of cyberweapons. At a moment when there is acute attention to whether the Russian government is seeking to influence the 2018 midterm elections, the report is a reminder that the bulk of Russia's cyberactivity has been in more traditional arenas: placing malware in facilities that are critical to keeping a nation's infrastructure running. In March, the Trump administration accused the Russians of placing malware in American nuclear and conventional power plants, as well as in water systems. In the probing of the utility sector in the United States, the Russians were placing ""implants,"" or malware that could be activated at a later date. That is essentially what FireEye concluded was happening in the Saudi case, where the Russian institute was helping to update and improve the malware. The Russian government has consistently denied that it is placing malware in foreign systems, and has often called for treaties or norms of behavior to govern cyberspace. But the United States has viewed Russia's calls as a cynical way to attempt to limit American cyberactivity, while sending out surrogates to conduct operations on Russia's behalf.

India loves data but fails to protect it,"Rahul Bhatia (@rahulabhatia) is writing a book about technology in the developing world. MUMBAI, India -- The Indian government is in thrall of the dazzle and promise of technology, seeing in it a vehicle to overcome the inefficiencies of its humongous bureaucratic apparatus. Shortly before coming to power in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi positioned himself as a digital governance evangelist. A few months into his tenure, the Indian government began using biometric devices to tell on government employees who didn't turn up for work. The state of Gujarat, which Mr. Modi had ruled for more than a decade, took to using biometrics to red-pen students who skipped school. Mr. Modi has argued that digital payments will check ''black money'' -- the Indian term for unaccounted, often illegally acquired wealth -- and other forms of corruption.     Under Mr. Modi's government, Aadhaar, India's enormous biometric identification system, which was initially promoted as a voluntary program to refine the delivery of public services and curb corruption, is increasingly seen as necessary for public and private services -- giving birth in a hospital, enrolling a child in preschool, collecting your college degree, maintaining a telephone connection or a bank account, and collecting a death certificate. The government seems to be in a war of attrition with itscitizens, breaking down their resistance to the biometric identification program.   Mr. Modi, who has spoken relentlessly of his dream of a digital India and flaunted the miracle of technology by appearing in public as a three-dimensional hologram in numerous places at the same time, has described data as ''real wealth'' that would confer ''hegemony'' on ''whoever acquires and controls'' it.   But alarming gaps in India's information security infrastructure, government departments and the Unique Identification Authority of India -- the federal agency running the Aadhaar project -- have exposed the private data of several million Indians on numerous occasions over the last two years.   The chasm between India's digital governance aspirations and its ability to protect that data is visible at the very top of the governance pyramid. In 2015, Mr. Modi offered his millions of followers the ''unique opportunity to receive messages and emails directly from the prime minister'' by downloading the Narendra Modi mobile app. ''No intermediaries, no media, no officials, no red tape,'' it promised. The Android app alone was downloaded over five million times.   The trust those millions of citizens invested in Mr. Modi's personal app seems to have been violated. In late March, a French security researcher discovered that the Narendra Modi app shared user data with an American company without the consent of its users. An investigation by The Indian Express newspaper revealed the invasiveness of the Modi app: it asked permission from its users to access their photographs, contacts, location data, cameras and microphones. A day after the revelation, the app's privacy policy was changed.   Around the same time, ZDNet, a technology website, reported that a webpage hosted by Indane, a liquefied petroleum gas company owned by the Indian government, inadvertently exposed the names, bank details and Aadhaar numbers of over half a billion Indians to anyone with the right technical skills.   Karan Saini, a New Delhi-based security researcher who found the vulnerability on a late-night bug hunt, realized that he could make thousands of requests with random Aadhaar numbers every minute through the program and extract information each time the database responded with a match.   The Unique Identification Authority of India, which runs the Aadhaar project, insisted that its own database had not been breached and said that it was ''contemplating legal action'' against the publication. The response was in keeping with the agency's practice of filing court cases and sending legal notices to reporters and security researchers who shine a torch on the ease with which unauthorized people can access the data it collects.   Nandan Nilekani, the technology entrepreneur who oversaw the creation of Aadhaar in 2009 under the Congress Party-led government, recently raised the possibility of Indians selling their data for easier credit and better health care. Such idealism lives beside the reality of a society that's largely digitally illiterate, where consent is not fully understood.   Every week brings new revelations about the considerable gaps in India's digital infrastructure. Compounding the anxieties is the failure of the Indian government agencies to act on these findings when alerted by researchers.   ZDNet informed the National Informatics Center, which builds information technology infrastructure for the government. The agency didn't reply. The publication informed Indane executives as well as the officials overseeing Aadhaar, but they did nothing. According to Mr. Saini, ZDNet also informed the Indian Consulate in New York, but the data remained exposed.   Aadhaar officials insist that their primary database is safe and that it hasn't been breached. They are willfully missing the point. India's federal Ministry of Rural Development exposed details of nearly 16 million Aadhaar numbers. A database of unorganized workers in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh exposed the details of over 20 million workers.   Aadhaar's database might be secure, but everything else it touches leaks like a sieve. Technology has ended up strengthening a dysfunctional bureaucracy that desires efficiency through data it cannot seem to protect. Worries about data being misused have been met with official denial and fury, but no investigations have been ordered.   Technologists describe these issues as teething troubles, bugs that will disappear as systems improve and uncertainty is gradually removed. But these instances raise concerns that the initiatives on technology and governance by the Indian government are removed from the concerns of the citizens and implemented with almost no explanation.   Last year, a journalist trying to demonstrate weaknesses within the biometric identification program enrolled once with his real name and then with a fictitious one. His real name was rejected. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, the chief executive officer of the agency overseeing the program, told a gathering that the journalist would have to live ''with the fake name forever. You go to your child's school and say your papa's name has changed.''   India's government is pushing hard to digitalize the lives of Indian citizens, but it also needs to bear the responsibility for the violations of citizens' data and trust. Indians are hostage to a government behaving like a tech company, and there is no customer service in sight.

Facebook and Cambridge Analytica: What You Need to Know as Fallout Widens,"Our report that a political firm hired by the Trump campaign acquired access to private data on millions of Facebook users has sparked new questions about how the social media giant protects user information. Who collected all that data? Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump's 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users. The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  On Monday, a British TV news report cast it in a harsher light, showing video of Cambridge Analytica executives offering to entrap politicians. A day later, as a furor grew, the company suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix. What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired? The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and ""likes."" The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads. Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned. The technique had been developed at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica's data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users -- those who participated in the survey -- had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use. Facebook said no passwords or ""sensitive pieces of information"" had been taken, though information about a user's location was available to Cambridge.  So was Facebook hacked? Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes -- and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account. But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred ""to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service."" It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm. Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. What is Facebook doing in response? The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan's research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan's app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed. Facebook also said: ""Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information."" In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm ""to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists."" It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie ""thus far has declined."" What are others saying? Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica.

12 Russians Charged: Major Highlights of the Indictment and Rod Rosenstein's Statement,"Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on Friday announced new charges against 12 Russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. [Read our main story on the latest indictments in the Russia investigation. ]    The following are some of the key highlights of the indictment of the Russian agents and what Mr. Rosenstein said at the announcement on Friday.   ______   Key portions of the indictment, annotated.    Analysis by David E. Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg   â-  ''4. By in or around April 2016, the conspirators also hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (''D.C.C.C.'') and the Democratic National Committee (''D.N.C.''). The conspirators covertly monitored the computers of dozens of D.C.C.C. and D.N.C. employees, implanted hundreds of files containing malicious computer code (''malware''), and stole emails and other documents from the D.C.C.C. and D.N.C. 5. By in or around April 2016, the conspirators began to plan the release of materials stolen from the Clinton campaign, D.C.C.C. and D.N.C.''   The indictment makes no reference to the previous hack of the D.N.C. by another Russian intelligence agency. That agency appeared to just be spying -- it did not publish the committee's documents, or go into the Clinton campaign itself. Mr. Mueller focused only on efforts to influence the election, not to spy.   â-  ''7. The conspirators also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release additional stolen documents through a website maintained by an organization (''Organization 1''), that had previously posted documents stolen from U.S. persons, entities and the U.S. government. The conspirators continued their U.S. election-interference operations through in or around November 2016.''   ''Organization 1'' appears to be WikiLeaks. It is not clear why the indictment does not name the organization. And it does not answer the mystery of whether WikiLeaks got the documents directly or through a cutout -- a critical question for those examining whether there was any link to the Trump campaign.   â-  ''8. To hide their connections to Russia and the Russian government, the conspirators used false identities and made false statements about their identities. To further avoid detection, the conspirators used a network of computers located across the world, including in the United States, and paid for this infrastructure using cryptocurrency.''   We know that Russian hackers had posed as American citizens, but we did not know until now that they used cryptocurrency to hide their identities. That is a relatively new addition to traditional means of falsifying identities.   â-  ''22. The conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-party provider and used by Clinton's personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted 76 email addresses at the domain for the Clinton campaign.''   The Russia hack was announced by CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, in mid-June 2016. This suggests that the revelation did not slow the officers from the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence agency; they continued their hacking even though they had been exposed. This is consistent with the group's activities when caught inside the White House computer systems, where it fought an National Security Agency operation to oust them.   â-  ''25. On or about April 19, 2016, KOZACHEK, YERSHOV, and their co-conspirators remotely configured an overseas computer to relay communications between X-Agent malware and the AMS panel and then tested X-Agent's ability to connect to this computer. The conspirators referred to this computer as a 'middle server.' The middle server acted as a proxy to obscure the connection between malware at the D.C.C.C. and the conspirators' AMS panel.''   This level of detail clearly indicates that intelligence agencies were inside Russian computers. That might be the N.S.A. -- but it could also be the Dutch or the British, who were monitoring Russian activity and providing information secretly to the United States. It raises questions about why the United States did not act more quickly.   â-  ''33. In response to Company 1's efforts, the conspirators took countermeasures to maintain access to the D.C.C.C. and D.N.C. networks. a. On or about May 31, 2016, YERMAKOV searched for open-source information about Company 1 and its reporting on X-Agent and X-Tunnel. On or about June 1, 2016, the conspirators attempted to delete traces of their presence on the D.C.C.C. network using the computer program CCleaner.''   Company 1 is CrowdStrike. The countermeasures are similar to the G.R.U.'s action when caught in the White House system. It also shows an effort to cover the group's tracks.   â-  ''35. More than a month before the release of any documents, the conspirators constructed the online persona DCLeaks to release and publicize stolen election-related documents. On or about April 19, 2016, after attempting to register the domain electionleaks.com, the conspirators registered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant.''    This says what has long been suspected: that the G.R.U. officers directly created DCLeaks.   â-  ''41. On or about June 15, 2016, the conspirators logged into a Moscow-based server used and managed by Unit 74455 and, between 4:19 PM and 4:56 PM Moscow Standard Time, searched for certain words and phrases.''   This was a day after the public revelation of the hack. It shows that the United States or one of its allies eventually got into the Russian servers to gather the evidence, or monitored the traffic from those servers.   â-  ''58. Although the conspirators caused transactions to be conducted in a variety of currencies, including U.S. dollars, they principally used Bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity. Many of these payments were 21 processed by companies located in the United States that provided payment processing services to hosting companies, domain registrars and other vendors both international and domestic. The use of Bitcoin allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.''   The indictment's details about the Russians' use of Bitcoin showed how cryptocurrencies -- and the anonymity they provide -- have become both a tool and a challenge for intelligence agencies in the battles between nation states. The Bitcoin network allows anyone to move millions of dollars across the world without any in-person meetings, and without requiring the approval of any financial institutions. For spies, that means gone are the days of covertly exchanging suitcases full of cash.   â-  ''The conspirators funded the purchase of computer infrastructure for their hacking activity in part by ''mining'' Bitcoin. Individuals and entities can mine Bitcoin by allowing their computing power to be used to verify and record payments on the Bitcoin public ledger, a service for which they are rewarded with freshly minted Bitcoin. The pool of Bitcoin generated from the G.R.U.'s mining activity was used, for example, to pay a Romanian company to register the domain dcleaks.com through a payment processing company located in the United States.''   Spies need to get their money somewhere, and Russia's intelligence services are not nearly as well bankrolled as their American counterparts. So, in 2016, the Russians came up with a new way to secure money -- they created it by mining their own Bitcoins.   [Read the full indictment, here.]   ______   Excerpts: Mr. Rosenstein's Announcement   Laying out the charges.   ''Today a grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an indictment presented by the special counsel's office. The indictment charges 12 Russian military officers by name for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Eleven of the defendants are charged with conspiring to hack into computers, steal documents and release those documents with the intent to interfere in the election.    One of those defendants, and a 12th Russian military officer, are charged with conspiring to infiltrate computers of organizations involved in administering the elections, including state boards of election, secretaries of state, and companies that supply software used to administer elections.''   On the hackers' strategy.   ''According to the allegations in the indictment, the defendants worked for two units of the main intelligence directorate of the Russian general staff known as the G.R.U. The units engaged in active cyber operations to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.    There was one unit that engaged in active cyber operations by stealing information, and a different unit that was responsible for disseminating the stolen information. The defendants used two techniques to steal information. First, they used a scheme known as spearfishing which involves sending misleading email messages and tricking the users into disclosing their passwords and security information.    Secondly, the defendants hacked into computer networks and installed malicious software that allowed them to spy on users and capture keystrokes, take screenshots, and exfiltrate or remove data from those computers.''   The Russians used cryptocurrencies to conceal their efforts.   ''In addition to releasing documents directly to the public, the defendants transferred stolen documents to another organization that is not identified by name in the indictment and they used that organization as a pass-through to release the documents. They discussed the timing of the release in an attempt to enhance the impact on the election. In an effort to conceal their connections to Russia, the defendants used a network of computers around the world and they paid for it using cryptocurrencies.''   No Americans were charged in the indictment.   ''There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime. There is no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result. The special counsel's investigation is ongoing and there will be no comments on the special counsel at this time.''   Rosenstein subtly jabbed Congress weeks after testifying on Capitol Hill.   ''We do not try cases on television or in congressional hearings. Most anonymous leaks are not from the government officials who are actually conducting these investigations. We follow the rule of law, which means that we follow procedures. And we reserve judgment. We complete our investigations and we evaluate all of the relevant evidence before we reach any conclusion.''   Rosenstein stressed focusing on holding criminals accountable, not partisan bickering.   ''A partisan warfare fueled by modern technology does not fairly reflect the grace, dignity, and unity of the American people. The blame for election interference belongs to the criminals who committed election interference. We need to work together to hold the perpetrators accountable. And we need to keep moving forward to preserve our values, protect against future interference, and defend America.''    "
The Crisis of Election Security,"Kim Zetter has covered cybersecurity for more than a decade. She is the author of ''Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon.'' It was mid-July 2016 when Neil Jenkins learned that someone had hacked the Illinois Board of Elections. Jenkins was a director in the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications at the Department of Homeland Security, the domestic agency with a congressional mandate to protect ''critical infrastructure.'' Although election systems were not yet formally designated as such -- that wouldn't happen until January 2017 -- it was increasingly clear that the presidential election was becoming a national-security issue. Just a month before, Americans had been confronted with the blockbuster revelation that Russian government actors had hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers and stolen private email and opposition research against Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate. And now, it emerged, someone was trying to infiltrate the election system itself. The Illinois intruders had quietly breached the network in June and spent weeks conducting reconnaissance. After alighting on the state's voter-registration database, they downloaded information on hundreds of thousands of voters. Then something went wrong, and the attackers crashed a server, alerting officials to their presence.     It soon became clear that this would not be the last attack. In early August, Jenkins learned of another breach, this one on an Arizona state website, and it appeared to come from one of the same I.P. addresses that had been used to attack Illinois. This time, the intruders installed malware, as if setting the stage for further assault. Then reports from other states began to pour in, saying that the same I.P. addresses appeared to be probing their voter-registration networks. Against that backdrop, the D.N.C. hack was looking less like an isolated incident.   ''We started to ask: Are these things related?'' Jenkins recalled. ''Are they the same actors? Is this some kind of concerted effort?'' He and his team realized that if Russian hackers were trying to disrupt the coming elections, D.H.S. needed to quickly get in touch with the state and local officials who ran them. But whom do you call when there are more than 10,000 election jurisdictions in the United States?   Jenkins at first assumed that each state had a chief information officer who oversaw election security -- but this turned out to be wrong. A staff member suggested that the Federal Election Commission must be the governing body over elections -- but the F.E.C., they quickly realized, was focused on campaign finance, not election systems. Then a colleague did a Google search on election administration and came across the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the federal body created by Congress in 2002 to serve as a federal liaison with state election officials. ''I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't know that the E.A.C. existed,'' Jenkins said. ''I would say that I'm not the only person working in the federal government that this was true for. This topic is not something that was really on anybody's big radar.''   Jenkins planned a call for mid-August for his boss, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, to discuss the problem with members of the E.A.C. and the National Association of Secretaries of State. But Jenkins's knowledge of election hacking was limited to a conference panel he was on six months earlier about the security of internet voting. Although most American voters cast ballots in person or by mail, 31 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of internet voting to military personnel and citizens living overseas. Jenkins, concerned that Russian hackers might interfere with those ballots, intended to offer election officials a simple plan: ''We were going to tell them that internet voting wasn't safe, and it was a risk factor and you need to not do it.''   But when Jenkins met E.A.C. officials and the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State for a brief discussion before the scheduled call, what was supposed to be a half-hour meeting bled into four hours, as he and his staff got a crash course in election administration. Internet voting, they learned, was the least of their concerns; the real problems were the machines used to cast and tally votes and the voter-registration databases the Russians had already shown interest in hacking. The entire system -- a Rube Goldberg mix of poorly designed machinery, from websites and databases that registered and tracked voters, to electronic poll books that verified their eligibility, to the various black-box systems that recorded, tallied and reported results -- was vulnerable.   In August 2016, though, there was no time to address systemic problems. Many states would begin early voting in five to six weeks, and the machines themselves had to be programmed and locked down well in advance of Election Day. The Department of Homeland Security had to settle for doing Band-Aid security before the election, and even then only with states that requested help -- mostly this involved remote-scanning internet-facing servers for known software vulnerabilities that could be patched, and providing a list of security best practices, like making sure vote-tabulation machines were not connected to the internet. Jenkins said the problems the agency couldn't address were ''troubling'' but beyond its control. ''You could spend years working on connectivity between voting machines and ballot-creating devices and try to get those things fixed,'' he said. ''But when you're trying to do something quickly with a group of people who are resource-constrained as severely as election officials are, you kind of have to focus where you can focus.''   Two years later, as the 2018 elections approach, the American intelligence community is issuing increasingly dire warnings about potential interference from Russia and other countries, but the voting infrastructure remains largely unchanged. D.H.S. has now conducted remote-scanning and on-site assessments of state and county election systems, but these are still largely Band-Aid measures applied to internet-facing servers. They don't address core vulnerabilities in voting machines or the systems used to program them. And they ignore the fact that many voting machines that elections officials insist are disconnected from the internet -- and therefore beyond the reach of hackers -- are in fact accessible by way of the modems they use to transmit vote totals on election night. Add to this the fact that states don't conduct robust postelection audits -- a manual comparison of paper ballots to digital tallies is the best method we have to detect when something has gone wrong in an election -- and there's a good chance we simply won't know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election.   How did our election system get so vulnerable, and why haven't officials tried harder to fix it? The answer, ultimately, comes down to politics and money: The voting machines are made by well-connected private companies that wield immense control over their proprietary software, often fighting vigorously in court to prevent anyone from examining it when things go awry. In Ohio in 2004, for example, where John Kerry lost the presidential race following numerous election irregularities, Kerry's team was denied access to the voting-machine software. ''We were told by the court that you were not able to get that algorithm to check it, because it was proprietary information,'' Kerry recalled in a recent interview on WNYC's ''Brian Lehrer Show.'' He was understandably rueful, arguing how wrong it was that elections are held under ''the purview of privately owned machines, where the public doesn't have the right to know whether the algorithm has been checked or whether they're hackable or not. And we now know they are hackable.''   The ballot box is the foundation of any democracy. It's not too grand to say that if there's a failure in the ballot box, then democracy fails. If the people don't have confidence in the outcome of an election, then it becomes difficult for them to accept the policies and actions that pour forth from it. And in the United States, it's safe to say, though few may utter it publicly, that the ballot box has failed many times and is poised to fail again.   There are roughly 350,000 voting machines in use in the country today, all of which fall into one of two categories: optical-scan machines or direct-recording electronic machines. Each of them suffers from significant security problems.   With optical-scan machines, voters fill out paper ballots and feed them into a scanner, which stores a digital image of the ballot and records the votes on a removable memory card. The paper ballot, in theory, provides an audit trail that can be used to verify digital tallies. But not all states perform audits, and many that do simply run the paper ballots through a scanner a second time. Fewer than half the states do manual audits, and they typically examine ballots from randomly chosen precincts in a county, instead of a percentage of ballots from all precincts. If the randomly chosen precincts aren't ones where hacking occurred or where machines failed to accurately record votes, an audit won't reveal anything -- nor will it always catch problems with early-voting, overseas or absentee ballots, all of which are often scanned in county election offices, not in precincts.   Direct-recording electronic machines, or D.R.E.s, present even more auditing problems. Voters use touch screens or other input devices to make selections on digital-only ballots, and votes are stored electronically. Many D.R.E.s have printers that produce what's known as a voter-verifiable paper audit trail -- a scroll of paper, behind a window, that voters can review before casting their ballots. But the paper trail doesn't provide the same integrity as full-size ballots and optical-scan machines, because a hacker could conceivably rig the machine to print a voter's selections correctly on the paper while recording something else on the memory card. About 80 percent of voters today cast ballots either on D.R.E.s that produce a paper trail or on scanned paper ballots. But five states still use paperless D.R.E.s exclusively, and an additional 10 states use paperless D.R.E.s in some jurisdictions.   The voting-machine industry -- an estimated $300-million-a-year business -- has long been as troubling as the machines it makes, known for its secrecy, close political ties (overwhelmingly to the Republican Party) and a revolving door between vendors and election offices. More than a dozen companies currently sell voting equipment, but a majority of machines used today come from just four -- Diebold Election Systems, Election Systems & Software (ES&S), Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems. Diebold (later renamed Premier) and Sequoia are now out of business. Diebold's machines and customer contracts were sold to ES&S and a Canadian company called Dominion, and Dominion also acquired Sequoia. This means that more than 80 percent of the machines in use today are under the purview of three companies -- Dominion, ES&S and Hart InterCivic.   Many of the products they make have documented vulnerabilities and can be subverted in multiple ways. Hackers can access voting machines via the cellular modems used to transmit unofficial results at the end of an election, or subvert back-end election-management systems -- used to program the voting machines and tally votes -- and spread malicious code to voting machines through them. Attackers could design their code to bypass pre-election testing and kick in only at the end of an election or under specific conditions -- say, when a certain candidate appears to be losing -- and erase itself afterward to avoid detection. And they could make it produce election results with wide margins to avoid triggering automatic manual recounts in states that require them when results are close.   Hackers could also target voting-machine vendors and use this trusted channel to distribute their code. Last year a security researcher stumbled across an unsecured ES&S server that left passwords exposed for its employee accounts. Although the passwords were encrypted, a nation-state with sufficient resources would most likely be able to crack them, the researcher noted. Since ES&S creates ballot-definition files before each election for some customers -- the critical programming files that tell machines how to apportion votes based on a voter's screen touch or marks on a paper ballot -- a malicious actor able to get into ES&S's network could conceivably corrupt these files so machines misinterpret a vote for Donald Trump, say, as one for his opponent, or vice versa.   Did anything like that happen in 2016? The Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and election officials have all insisted that there is no evidence that Russian hackers altered votes in 2016. But the truth is that no one has really looked for evidence. Intelligence assessments are based on signals intelligence -- spying on Russian communications and computers for chatter or activity indicating that they altered votes -- not on a forensic examination of voting machines and election networks. ''We should always be careful to point out that there hasn't been any evidence that votes were changed in any election in this way, and that's a true fact,'' said Matt Blaze, a computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a voting-machine-security expert. ''It's just less comforting than it might sound at first glance, because we haven't looked very hard.'' Even if experts were to look, it's not clear what they would find, he added. ''It's possible to do a pretty good job of erasing all the forensic evidence.''   And targeting voting machines is just one way to subvert elections. A hacker (or inside operator) could target voters themselves by deleting their names from the voter roll and electronic poll book -- the device used at polling places to verify a voter's eligibility. Or change their precinct assignments to send them to the wrong location, creating chaos and frustration that causes them to leave without voting. Bad actors could also undermine election results by altering tallies as they are transmitted to county offices on election night or posted to public websites. Although these are unofficial results, any discrepancy between these and official tallies compiled days after an election would sow distrust in the outcome, particularly if the winner of a race changes.   The stakes are high when it comes to election security, and the concerns about Russian hackers are warranted. But the focus on Russia, or any would-be election manipulators, ignores the underlying issue -- the myriad vulnerabilities that riddle the system and the ill-considered decisions that got us here. The mad history of election security in the United States is a history of how misguided politicians and naïve election officials allowed an unregulated industry to seize control of America's democratic infrastructure.   [Read about Amendment 4, the ballot that could enfranchise more people at once than any single initiative since women's suffrage, but could also change the Florida electorate.]    The ballot box is in the distressed state it is in today because of an overreaction -- or rather a wrong reaction -- to a previous systemic electoral breakdown: the presidential-election fiasco in Florida in 2000. Everyone remembers the dangling chads that led to a landmark Supreme Court decision and a nation divided over who won. But another election mishap occurred that night that got less attention, despite the fact that it played a significant role in pushing the presidential race into the hands of the justices. This one involved a memory card in Volusia County.   Deborah Tannenbaum had a front-row seat for what occurred that night. A Democratic Party field director in Florida, she refreshed her web browser frequently as returns came in from around the county. At 10 p.m., Al Gore was ahead in Volusia, with 83,000 votes to George W. Bush's 62,000. Things were going well for Gore across the state, and exit polls projected a six-point lead for him. But then something changed. ''I had stepped out, and one of the assistants came, and he's just like, 'I need you to come here and verify the numbers,' '' Tannenbaum recalled. When she looked at the county's website, Gore's total had dropped 16,000 votes. Tannenbaum called the county election office, alarmed. ''I don't know what's going on down there, but you can't take away votes!'' she said.   The mysterious drop would later be traced to Precinct 216, a community center in DeLand, where Gore's total was showing negative 16,022 votes. It wasn't the only mathematical absurdity in the tally. A Socialist Workers Party candidate named James Harris had 9,888 votes. But the DeLand precinct had only 585 registered voters, and only 219 of them cast ballots at the center that day.   Unfortunately for Gore, reporters were focused on overall state returns and didn't notice the funny numbers. At 7:52 p.m., Voter News Service -- a consortium of media outlets reporting election results -- projected Gore the Florida winner based on exit polls. But when the Volusia County numbers changed at 10 p.m., and Brevard County subsequently posted results inadvertently missing 4,000 votes for Gore, Bush shot into the lead; news outlets retracted their call for Gore and called the state for Bush. Gore was on his way to make a concession speech at 3 a.m. when he learned the numbers were wrong.   Volusia officials blamed the mishap on a faulty memory card. The county used optical-scan machines made by Global Election Systems (a Canadian company later acquired by Diebold and renamed Diebold Election Systems), which the county had used since 1996. When the election ended, poll workers were supposed to transmit results to the county election office via modem; but the transmission failed, so a worker drove the memory card in, where officials inserted it directly into the election-management system to tally results. Logs for that computer, however, showed two memory cards for Precinct 216 inserted, an hour apart. The vote totals went haywire after the second card was loaded.   Beyond the mystery of the two cards, there was another problem with this explanation. A faulty memory card should produce an onscreen error message or cause a computer to lock up, not alter votes in one race while leaving others untouched. And what kind of faulty card deleted votes only for Gore, while adding votes to other candidates?   Ultimately, the phantom card was forgotten in the battle that ensued over dangling chads in other counties. Gore's team requested manual recounts in four counties, including Volusia, but a Supreme Court ruling on Dec. 12 halted them, though not before Volusia completed its recount. The manual tally of optical-scan ballots in Precinct 216 gave Gore 193 votes, Bush 22 and Harris 0. Bush won Florida, and by extension the presidency, by just 537 votes.   To this day, questions about the Volusia card remain unanswered. Internal emails from Global Election Systems later leaked to Bev Harris, an election-integrity activist, show that the manufacturer itself remained unsure about what happened. When a Volusia County elections worker named Lana Hires requested an explanation from Global, the response was vague. Talbot Iredale, a Global developer, responded that a corrupt memory card remained ''the most likely explanation for the problem but since I know nothing about the 'second' memory card I have no ability to confirm the probability of this.'' He then suggested a more ominous explanation. ''There is always the possibility that the 'second memory card' or 'second upload' came from an unauthorized source.'' To which a Global colleague replied: ''Heh. Second shooter theory. All we need now is a grassy knoll.''   The memory card in Volusia vividly demonstrated the kind of problems that could occur if states expanded their use of electronic voting machines without proper safeguards. But even as security experts showed how malicious insiders and outsiders could subvert the machines, the warnings went ignored.   A month after the Supreme Court decision, Representative Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, met with Representative Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican and his colleague on the House Administration Committee, to talk about election reform. Hoyer wanted to make sure that what happened with Florida's punch cards didn't happen again. So, unmindful of the lessons of Volusia County, they decided to draft a bill that would push states to get rid of punch-card systems as well as lever voting machines, a century-old mechanical technology still being used in some states, and replace them with new electronic voting systems. But beyond setting parameters to protect civil rights and prevent disenfranchisement, the federal government couldn't tell states how to run elections.   So Hoyer and Ney devised a workaround: money. Their bill, the Help America Vote Act, or HAVA, offered states $3.9 billion to help administer federal elections and buy new voting equipment. But the money came with a few conditions: States couldn't spend it on punch-card or lever machines, and if they wanted to use HAVA funds to replace these systems, they had to do so in time for the 2004 presidential elections (or by 2006 if they sought an extension). They also had to offer at least one accessible voting machine at each polling place so that disabled voters could cast ballots without assistance. And they had to consolidate county voter-registration files into a single statewide database to prevent voters from registering in multiple counties. HAVA also created a new agency -- the U.S. Election Assistance Commission -- to administer the funds to states and to serve as a clearinghouse for election best practices.   Computers had been used in elections ever since the 1960s, when punch cards and computerized card readers and tabulators were introduced. And experts had been warning for just as long about the danger of placing too much trust in them. A 1969 front-page article in The Los Angeles Times described a ''war games'' exercise to determine if Los Angeles County's new computerized punch-card readers and tabulators could be rigged without detection. Three computer scientists on the offensive team faced off against three computer scientists on defense. ''In each test, the offensive team won,'' the paper reported; the team's ''highly sophisticated techniques'' were neither detected nor prevented. The importance of paper ballots to back up and verify digital vote tallies was also underscored by numerous election mishaps over the years. In Rock Island County, Ill., in 1984, for every one vote cast for a particular candidate, a computer tabulator gave him two; it also failed to count ''no'' votes on a referendum. In Moline, Ill., in 1985, a punch-card reader elected the wrong candidate for City Council by failing to properly count some votes; a recount flipped the race.   Hoyer insists that the subject of security and paper trails didn't come up when lawmakers were developing HAVA. But Rebecca Mercuri disputes this. A computer scientist at Bryn Mawr at the time, she told the House science committee -- in a hearing that was meant to inform the lawmakers writing HAVA -- that ''any programmer can write code that displays one thing on the screen, records something else and prints out something else as an entirely different result. I have freshmen, by the way, who can do this. There is no known way to ensure that this is not happening inside of a voting system.''   The experts also recognized even then that voting machines wouldn't be secure if there weren't adequate standards for testing and certifying them. Douglas W. Jones, a computer-science professor at the University of Iowa and the chairman of a board that tested and approved machines used in his state, testified to the science committee that the voting machines available to replace punch-card and lever machines weren't secure, largely because the standards didn't require them to be. The standards were created in the 1980s, when security was a nascent field and touch-screen D.R.E.s didn't exist. He advised lawmakers against issuing large-scale funding for new machines until better standards and machines were available.   But few in Congress took the critics seriously. Although lawmakers did include a provision in HAVA mandating the creation of new standards -- with the aim that machines bought with HAVA funds would meet them -- the purchasing deadlines they included in the bill forced states to buy their machines before the new standards could be completed in 2005 (they took effect in 2007). In October 2002, the bill passed with broad bipartisan support, and the clock began ticking down to the November 2004 deadline to replace punch-card machines.   And with that, the gold rush was on, as a small group of vendors with little security expertise began lining up to win billions of dollars of federal money. Most of that money ended up going to buy D.R.E.s. In 2000, just 9 percent of American voting precincts were using D.R.E.s. After HAVA passed, the proportion ballooned to 67 percent. The basic technology was not new; the first direct-recording electronic voting machines went on sale in 1974, and touch-screen versions were introduced in the mid-90s. But before HAVA, election officials who wanted electronic machines generally chose optical-scan systems. Each machine was more expensive, but you needed fewer per polling place, because voters could fill out the ballots in simple booths and then quickly scan them.   The new D.R.E. machines did offer real advantages. With direct recording, counties no longer had to print hundreds of thousands of paper ballots or store them for 22 months after a federal election, as federal law required. And the machines could be adapted to voter needs, by displaying digital ballots in multiple languages and font sizes. They also satisfied the accessibility requirement in HAVA, offering Braille keyboards, audio instruction and other aids for physically impaired voters.   Under HAVA, states had to purchase only one accessible machine per precinct and could provide optical-scan systems for other voters. But some counties bought D.R.E.s exclusively, swayed in part by the National Federation of the Blind, which insisted that HAVA, in calling for ''uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology,'' required states to provide identical equipment for all voters. This interpretation benefited vendors, of course, who were more than happy to sell counties their most expensive systems.   In November 2002, just days after Bush signed HAVA into law, Georgia underwent the nation's first major test of D.R.E.s. The state had signed a $54 million contract with Diebold to use its paperless D.R.E.s exclusively statewide. As the November midterm elections approached, the company scrambled to get the machines in place for one of the closest races for governor that Georgia had seen -- between Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Sonny Perdue. Perdue won with just 51 percent of votes in a major upset. It was the first time in more than 130 years that a Republican became governor of Georgia. This wasn't the only upset. Senator Max Cleland, a popular Democrat, went into Election Day leading his Republican opponent, Saxby Chambliss, by three points; he lost by seven.   What happened next highlighted everything that was wrong with electronic voting machines and their vendors. Rob Behler, a contractor who worked in the Georgia warehouse where Diebold prepared its D.R.E.s for the election, came forward to reveal that many of the machines experienced frequent crashes or other persistent malfunctions. Diebold had given workers at least three software patches to fix the problems, he said, but the patches were not examined by the independent lab responsible for testing voting machines or by Georgia officials. Brit Williams, a retired academic overseeing the rollout for the state, denied to me at the time that Diebold installed any uncertified patches, but acknowledged that it did install one patch that a test lab took a ''quick look'' at.   The Georgia patches underscored a disturbing reality -- no one really knew what companies were programming into their black boxes, in part because the lab testing reports were confidential. Election activists and computer-security experts did get occasional glances inside the boxes, though, and what they saw wasn't reassuring. Months after the Georgia election, Bev Harris, the election-integrity activist, discovered the FTP server that Diebold used to distribute software patches for its machines in Georgia. The server had been left unsecured, and Harris found about 40,000 files on it, including source code for Diebold's D.R.E.s. She gave the code to computer scientists at Johns Hopkins University, who found several security problems with it, including an encryption key hard-coded in the software, a violation of basic security practices. The key was used to encrypt vote records and audit logs -- the most critical data on a voting system -- and was the same key for every Diebold system. Anyone who accessed the source code on Diebold's unsecured server could find the key in the code.   Over the next several years, reports commissioned by officials in California, Maryland and Ohio found more problems with Diebold machines and similar issues with machines from other manufacturers. Problems with voting machines in elections were also making headlines. In 2002 in North Carolina, for example, D.R.E.s made by ES&S failed to record 436 entire ballots during early voting in Wake County, a failure the company attributed to a software bug. Two years later, in Jacksonville, N.C., a D.R.E. made by UniLect lost more than 4,500 ballots when its memory became full and stopped recording; it continued to let voters cast ballots, however, instead of locking up. The incidents that made headlines were disturbing enough, but the real concerns were the ones that weren't being caught.   The problems with voting machines did not go entirely unnoticed on Capitol Hill. In May 2003, Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat, introduced an amendment to HAVA that would require all voting machines to produce a voter-verifiable paper trail and to mandate random manual audits. It was an opportunity for lawmakers like Hoyer, who missed the security issues with D.R.E.s the first time, to make up for the oversight. But still they resisted. Hoyer told me, ''I didn't think Rush was correct'' about paper trails. Hoyer and other lawmakers believed that the new voting systems were ''in fact reliable and secure and user-friendly. Now I think in retrospect we were obviously wrong, because our premise was the machines were not subject to being hacked. And now we know.''   The troublesome 2004 presidential election in Ohio, in which Kerry was denied access to the voting software, provided a strong case for why paper and audits were necessary. A lot of Ohio counties still used punch cards, but some had adopted D.R.E.s and optical-scan systems. For one precinct of Franklin County, which used D.R.E.s made by a company called Danaher Control, the election-management system tallied 4,258 votes for Bush, though only 638 voters cast ballots. When officials pulled votes stored in the D.R.E., Bush's total was 365. In Mahoning County, voters using 25 D.R.E.s made by ES&S found that when they touched the screens to vote for John Kerry, the machines interpreted it as a vote for Bush, not an uncommon problem when touch screens are poorly calibrated. ''Undervoting'' -- when a ballot shows no vote in a particular race -- was also exceptionally high in the state. Democratic precincts across Ohio had 75 percent more undervotes than predominantly Republican ones. In two precincts in Montgomery County that used punch-card machines, the computer tabulators indicated that 6,000 ballots had no vote for president -- an undervote rate of 25 percent, while 2 percent is normal. A congressional inquiry found ''numerous serious election irregularities'' in Ohio but ultimately couldn't conclude whether fraud had occurred.   The incidents in Ohio demonstrated that American elections still had integrity problems, but there was little constituency for change. In 2005, Holt introduced a variation of his 2003 reform bill, and once again it quickly died, in part because voting-machine vendors launched a formidable lobbying effort to quash the requirement of paper trails. Some state election officials joined the effort, arguing that adding printers to D.R.E.s would create problems for elderly poll workers if the printers jammed or ran out of paper. The American Association of People With Disabilities was also remarkably effective in lobbying against paper trails, arguing that they discriminated against blind voters, even though the same audio that assisted blind voters to mark their digital ballot could read the paper trail to them. The association persuaded the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union, two politically powerful groups, to oppose paper trails as well.   A second major undervote incident with D.R.E.s in 2006 also failed to move Congress. In Sarasota, Fla., more than 18,000 ballots cast on D.R.E.s made by ES&S showed no vote in the race for the 13th Congressional District. Kathy Dent, the supervisor of elections, insisted that voters either didn't see that particular contest or intended to leave it blank. But documents I obtained through a public-records request showed that poll workers in 19 precincts called her office on Election Day and during the primary months before it to pass along voter complaints about the machines. Many reported that when they tried to vote for Christine Jennings, a Democrat, the screen failed to register their touch. Jennings lost by fewer than 400 votes. The incident led Florida -- the state whose punch-card fiasco prompted the nationwide switch to paperless D.R.E.s -- to mandate the use of voter-marked paper ballots. But when Holt reintroduced his bill in Congress in 2007 and 2009 to do the same, he still couldn't get any interest.   Despite this proliferation of voting-machine problems, the industry was expanding its reach and control, even as it was concentrating power into fewer hands. By 2010, ES&S was so big -- it had bought Diebold's election division and controlled more than 70 percent of the market -- that the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit and required it to sell off some of its assets. Many election officials, baffled by the new technology and unable to hire dedicated I.T. staff, purchased complete suites of election services from vendors, services that in some cases included programming ballot-definition files for voting machines and assisting with tabulation. It became common to see voting-machine employees or their local contractors in election offices before, during and after elections, and in some cases even working in election offices full time. ES&S, for instance, even installed remote-access software and modems on election-management systems to gain remote access to them from its Nebraska headquarters to troubleshoot when things went wrong. And when things did go wrong with machines, it was often the vendor who investigated and supplied the explanation that was fed to the news media and the public.   The companies also expanded their reach into other parts of the elections process. Some states built their HAVA-mandated voter-registration databases in-house, but some outsourced this to Diebold and ES&S, the companies that made their voting machines, as well as to other firms. And once these centralized databases were in place, the vendors saw an opportunity for another revenue stream: They persuaded states to replace paper poll books -- the lists poll workers use to verify that voters are registered -- with electronic poll books that could sync with the statewide databases. The software on these devices didn't have to undergo testing and certification the way voting machines do, and there were inevitable problems -- in 2006 in Denver, Sequoia electronic poll books crashed extensively, creating long lines for an estimated 20,000 people who left without voting. In 2008 in Georgia, Diebold electronic poll books caused delays lasting more than two hours.   Over the years, as election officials became more comfortable with their voting equipment, many jurisdictions who gave control to vendors gradually took it back, but there are still districts where vendors and contractors are involved in every phase of elections, from writing the software that registers voters and determines their eligibility to cast ballots, to programming machines and counting the votes. And it's not clear to what degree, if any, they're subject to oversight.   Sixteen years ago, lawmakers led Americans to believe that they had solved the problems of Florida in 2000. But the 2016 election made it clear that the problems simply shifted from one technology to another. Once again, lawmakers are proposing fixes that they say will help address the current state of elections, and once again, those proposals fall short.   Legislators have introduced several bills that propose to bolster security, in part by mandating paper trails and manual audits. But only one of them, the Secure Elections Act, has advanced, and in the process it has been significantly watered down. In August, Republican lawmakers weakened the bill by allowing officials performing audits to rely on the digital images of paper ballots stored in optical-scan machines -- images that can be manipulated by hackers and others, security experts say.   This year, Congress appropriated $380 million to states to pay for security upgrades and replace some of the machines that were bought with HAVA funds more than a decade ago, in the belief that this will make elections more secure. But the new machines have the same problems as the ones they will replace -- all machines on the market today were tested and certified to the standards HAVA put into effect in 2007, and technology has evolved considerably in the last decade. The Election Assistance Commission and its technical-guidelines committee are completing new standards, but it will be at least another two years before any machines will be tested and certified to them.   Even those standards will almost certainly be inadequate. They will, for instance, most likely continue to exempt commercial off-the-shelf components from testing. (If a vendor uses the Windows operating system or a commercial modem in its machines and asserts that it hasn't altered them, the labs don't look at those components.) And they probably won't require labs to do ''penetration testing'' to see if they can hack voting systems -- one of the most effective ways to measure the security of a system. ''These companies have seized a central role in our democracy,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is one of a small group of lawmakers who have shown a willingness to demand more transparency from the vendors. ''But rather than recognizing that cybersecurity needs to be their top priority, they treat it as a public-relations problem that can be dismissed with spin.''   The valuable work of testing system security has been taken up voluntarily by security researchers like the Finnish computer programmer Harri Hursti, J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan and the participants at the recent Def Con Voting Machine Hacking Village. But the researchers face hostility and sometimes even legal threats from vendors, who want to prevent them from finding and exposing problems with the machines. Before the Def Con event this year, which received unprecedented support and interest from election officials, ES&S and other vendors sent comments to the United States Copyright Office expressing opposition to a proposed exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would expand the rights of researchers to reverse-engineer election software.   Even now, when the country is desperate to prevent Russian hackers from interfering with future elections, the company is more focused on asserting proprietary control over its systems than on working with communities of researchers who want to secure them. In addition to the comments it sent the Copyright Office, it also sent a vaguely threatening letter to its own customers, warning them against helping researchers by providing them with voting-machine software to examine. In that letter, ES&S reminded election officials of an essential fact: The American people don't own the software that now sits at the heart of their democracy; they just lease it.    "
'Foreign Entity' Is Said to Hack G.O.P. Officials,"WASHINGTON -- The campaign committee for House Republicans discovered in April that the email accounts of several of its senior officials had been hacked by what analysts later concluded was a ''foreign entity,'' people who have been briefed on the case said on Tuesday, highlighting the continued vulnerability of the United States to interference in its elections. The hack of the organization, the National Republican Congressional Committee, exposed thousands of emails from four senior aides for months, and perhaps longer. The hack was terminated when the staff members, alerted to the intrusion, changed their passwords. The committee called in the F.B.I. to investigate.     But the committee waited eight months -- until after Republicans lost 40 seats and control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections -- to disclose publicly what had happened. It remains unclear who was behind the hack.   Over the weekend, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told a defense forum at the Reagan Library in California that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ''tried again to muck around in our elections this last month, and we are seeing a continued effort along those lines.'' But he gave no indication whether he was referring to the Republican committee email breach or other activity including a disinformation campaign.   By all accounts, the hack was not as widespread or sophisticated as the Russian effort to take over the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. In that instance, the Russians implanted malware into the computer server that ran many of the Democratic committee's operations and had free run of its communications networks. It was an operation American intelligence officials have testified was personally ordered by Mr. Putin.   The breach of the Republican campaign committee, first reported by Politico, appears to have been more limited. The intrusion into the four email accounts was detected in April by a vendor for the committee.   ''The N.R.C.C. can confirm that it was the victim of a cyberintrusion by an unknown entity,'' Ian Prior, a spokesman for the organization, said in a statement. ''The cybersecurity of the committee's data is paramount, and upon learning of the intrusion, the N.R.C.C. immediately launched an internal investigation and notified the F.B.I., which is now investigating the matter.''   Mr. Prior declined to comment further, citing the continuing investigation. None of the emails appear to have been published. That could suggest that the hackers were just testing to see if they could break into the committee, or that they found the trove of stolen material insufficiently interesting.   This was not the first time the Republicans had been a target. In 2016, Russian hackers broke into the servers of an outside vendor who appeared to have largely outdated documents from past presidential campaigns, James B. Comey, then the director of the F.B.I., told Congress in January 2017.   Mr. Comey said that Russian hackers executed ''limited penetration'' of old Republican National Committee computer systems that were ''no longer in use.''   Until then, Republican officials -- led by Sean Spicer, who later became Mr. Trump's first press secretary -- denied that the Russians had gotten into the party's systems. Mr. Trump himself mocked the Democrats for the breach they suffered, saying Republicans had far stronger cybersecurity.   The hack of the Republican campaign committee discovered this spring came after years in which cybersecurity and the risk of interference by foreign governments or other malicious actors have loomed large in American politics, putting both parties on guard.   In this case, senior House Republicans, including Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin; Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader; and Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip, were not aware of the breach until Politico reporters contacted them, a person familiar with the investigation said.   The person said that the techniques used by the hacker or hackers suggested that the breach was carried out by ''a sophisticated actor.'' The chief evidence was the lengths to which the hacker or hackers went to cover their tracks, another person familiar with the investigation said. ''It was not a very broad or big hack,'' that person added, ''but it was skillful.''   That alone would suggest that the hackers might be state sponsored, or at least experienced. But often it is difficult to tell whom hackers are working for, and state-sponsored hackers often go to considerable lengths to hide that information.   Until the announcement on Tuesday, Republicans had little to say about continued Russian activity in the midterm elections. While top national security leaders had  warned before the November elections that Russia was engaged in a ''pervasive'' campaign to sow discord and influence American voters, Congress appropriated relatively few funds to protect election systems. And a once-bipartisan effort to pass legislation that was intended to ensure that state officials had the resources to protect machines and voter-registration systems failed before the bill even made it out of committee.   Ever since the 2016 events, Democrats and Republicans have tried, and failed, to come to some kind of agreement over whether their candidates would exploit the revelation of emails or other hacked materials about their opponents. The talks have always broken down.   In a statement, the incoming chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Cheri Bustos, said that ''we condemn all cyberattacks in the strongest possible terms, and we continue to urge all political committees and campaigns to agree publicly never to use stolen hacked materials for political gain.''

"Under Scrutiny, Facebook Replaces Lobbying Executive","Follow Cecilia Kang on Twitter: @ceciliakang. WASHINGTON -- Facebook on Tuesday replaced its head of policy in the United States, Erin Egan, as the social network scrambles to respond to intense scrutiny from federal regulators and lawmakers.  Ms. Egan, who is also Facebook's chief privacy officer, was responsible for lobbying and government relations as head of policy for the last two years. She will be replaced by Kevin Martin on an interim basis, the company said. Mr. Martin has been Facebook's vice president of mobile and global access policy and is a former Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.    Ms. Egan will remain chief privacy officer and focus on privacy policies across the globe, Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, said.   The executive reshuffling in Facebook's Washington offices followed a period of tumult for the company, which has put it increasingly in the spotlight on Capitol Hill. Last month, The New York Times and others reported that the data of millions of Facebook users had been harvested by the British political research firm Cambridge Analytica. The ensuing outcry led Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify at two congressional hearings this month.   Since the revelations about Cambridge Analytica, the Federal Trade Commission has started an investigation of whether Facebook violated promises it made in 2011 to protect the privacy of users, making it harder for the company to share data with third parties.   At the same time, Facebook is grappling with increased privacy regulations outside the United States. Sweeping new privacy laws called the General Data Protection Regulation are set to take effect in Europe next month. And Facebook has been called to talk to regulators in several countries, including Ireland, Germany and Indonesia, about its handling of user data.   Mr. Zuckerberg said told Congress this month that Facebook had grown too fast and that he hadn't foreseen the problems the platform would confront.   ''Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company,'' he said. ''For most of our existence, we focused on all the good that connecting people can bring.''   The executive shifts put two Republican men in charge of Facebook's Washington offices. Mr. Martin will report to Joel Kaplan, vice president of global public policy. Mr. Martin and Mr. Kaplan worked together in the George W. Bush White House and on Mr. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.   Facebook hired Ms. Egan in 2011; she is a frequent headliner at tech policy events in Washington. Before joining Facebook, she spent 15 years as a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling as co-chairwoman of the global privacy and security group.   Facebook is undergoing other executive changes. Last month, The Times reported that Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief information security officer, planned to leave the company after disagreements over how to handle misinformation on the site.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
New Charges in Huge C.I.A. Breach Known as Vault 7,"WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors have charged a former software engineer at the center of a huge C.I.A. breach with stealing classified information, theft of government property and lying to the F.B.I.  The engineer, Joshua A. Schulte, 29, of New York, had been the main suspect in one of the worst losses of classified documents in the spy agency's history. Government investigators suspect that he provided WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization, with a stolen archive of documents detailing the C.I.A.'s hacking operations, but they had not initially charged him in that crime. The breach, known as the Vault 7 leak, was a major embarrassment to the C.I.A. and set off a furious hunt to identify who was behind the 2017 disclosure. Mr. Schulte had been charged last year in New York with possession of child pornography. But in the new indictment, prosecutors accused him of repeatedly violating the Espionage Act. According to federal court documents, prosecutors said Mr. Schulte illegally obtained classified information in 2016 and then provided it to an organization, WikiLeaks, that posted it online. Prosecutors also charged him with transmitting malicious computer code and improperly gaining access to a delicate government computer system. The authorities said he granted himself access to the system and tried to conceal his activities. Prosecutors also accused him of copyright infringement. Prosecutors said the crimes occurred in Virginia, where the C.I.A. is based. The new charges are not entirely unexpected; prosecutors said in May that they had planned to file a new indictment in the next 45 days. Mr. Schulte's lawyers had urged the government to make a decision regarding the Vault 7 leak charges. ""As the evidence is flushed out, it will become clear that Mr. Schulte is hardly the villain the government makes him out to be,"" Sabrina P. Shroff, his public defender in New York, said in a statement on Monday. His family claims he did not do anything wrong. Mr. Schulte worked in the C.I.A.'s Engineering Development Group, which designed the hacking tools used by its Center for Cyber Intelligence. In late 2016, he left the spy agency and moved to New York to work for Bloomberg. In a previous statement, WikiLeaks said the source of the damaging disclosure had hoped to ""initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons."" Prosecutors have also weighed charges against Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said that arresting Mr. Assange was a priority for the Justice Department. Mr. Assange believes he is a journalist, a claim that could complicate a prosecution. Mr. Assange continues to live in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he had fled to in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on accusations of rape. Last year, Sweden's prosecutors announced that they had abandoned their attempt to extradite him. PHOTO: Joshua A.

Facebook Leaves Its Users' Privacy Vulnerable; Editorial,"Facebook is once again struggling with revelations that manipulative characters exploited the vulnerabilities of its platform during the 2016 election to put Donald Trump in the White House. The company said last week that it was suspending the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked for the Trump campaign, and a professor, Aleksandr Kogan, who is said to have deceptively amassed information from more than 50 million people without their consent. That may sound like decisive action, but it came more than two years after Facebook learned of the problem. Starting in 2014, Mr. Kogan got the data, using a quiz app, under the guise of academic research. He handed the information to Cambridge Analytica, which used it to build profiles of voters' personalities, according to reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London on Saturday.  What is particularly disturbing about this case is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up by the app, most of whom had never used it but were friends with somebody else who had. Further, Facebook did not verify that Cambridge Analytica and Mr. Kogan deleted the data after the social media company told them to in 2015. The Times reported that Cambridge still had most or all of the data. Facebook's response so far is reminiscent of its slow, defensive reaction to the spread of pro-Trump fake news on its platform during the 2016 presidential campaign. Days after the election, Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said it was a ""pretty crazy idea"" to suggest that fake news had influenced the outcome. It took months for him to admit that he was wrong to so cavalierly dismiss the importance of hoaxes spread on Facebook, many of them by people working on behalf of the Russian government. It is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge's effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what's called ""psychographic data"" for the campaign, which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them. The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people, including where they lived, that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information. Officials in the United States and the European Union are investigating Cambridge Analytica, and others say they might, including members of Congress and the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. In Britain, regulators and lawmakers are looking at whether the company tried to illegally influence the ""Brexit"" referendum of 2016. More investigations may be on the way. On Monday, Channel 4 News in Britain released hidden-camera tapes in which Cambridge executives said that their company used bribes and prostitutes to entrap politicians. The company denies engaging in corruption and extortion. Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who is a big supporter of Mr. Trump, owns a controlling stake in Cambridge, and Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for the president, is a former company board member. Lawmakers and regulators also ought to investigate Facebook's response. For starters, they need to take a close look at whether the company is in violation of a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused it of deceiving users by telling them their information would be kept private and then allowing it to be shared and made public. They also need to force the company to quickly identify and alert the tens of millions of people whose information might have been disclosed to Cambridge. In the longer term, Congress clearly needs to strengthen privacy laws to give people more control over private information and prevent businesses and political campaigns from harvesting personal data under false pretenses. President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights in 2012, but the idea died in Congress after technology and advertising companies claimed it would be an unfair burden. Facebook says it takes this case seriously. But it is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself. PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Tim Peacock FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Related Articles  "
Georgia's Shaky Voting System,"The governor's race in Georgia between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp has turned into an ugly, drawn-out affair, and we won't know the final results for a while. Mr. Kemp, the Republican, declared victory and resigned as Georgia's secretary of state so he wouldn't be responsible for overseeing the counting of votes in the race -- though before he resigned he did make an unsubstantiated claim that Democrats were hacking the election. There is a silver lining in this mess: The new secretary of state could finally fix Georgia's astoundingly insecure voting system, one of the most poorly protected in the country.  This has been a rough election for Georgians. Accusations of racism and voter suppression have abounded. An outside investigation found that more than 340,000 voter registrations had been improperly canceled by Mr. Kemp's office. A significant number were reinstated by court order, but there is no way of knowing if voter turnout would have been even higher if the Kemp purge hadn't happened.  On top of this, an indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers as part of Robert Mueller&#39;s inquiry into election interference suggests that the election system in counties in Georgia were targeted for hacking in 2016.  That's not all. Earlier in the campaign cycle, a cybersecurity researcher discovered that Georgia's entire voter database (housed at Kennesaw State University), which contains the records of 6.7 million voters, was at risk. And when the Department of Homeland Security told Mr. Kemp that Georgia had been  one of 21 states targeted by Russian hackers in 2016, he waved off the threat and declined help from Washington for the midterms, saying that the state had everything under control. It gets worse. Georgia is one of five states that rely solely on direct-recording electronic voting machines. These machines don't have a paper trail, which makes it hard to detect manipulation of the vote.  The whole point of securing an election is so voters feel confident that their vote will be counted properly. News of a hack was already a significant problem before Election Day because it jeopardized the integrity of the election. Democracy needs high voter confidence to work. According to Carbon Black, a cybersecurity company, one out of four people it surveyed considered skipping the midterm elections out of a concern about hacking.  The potential exposure of Georgia's voter data at Kennesaw State, the refusal of help from the Department of Homeland Security and the state's inclusion in the Mueller indictment as a target of Russian hacking and Mr. Kemp's apparent lack of interest in new vulnerabilities probably places Georgia near the bottom of the list of states that are prepared to withstand an attack on their election system. Mr. Kemp's permament successor will be decided in a runoff on Dec. 4. How can the winner fix Georgia's problems? Register new voters, encourage maximum participation in elections and use best practices to ensure the integrity of Georgia's voter database. The new secretary should not emulate Mr. Kemp, who seemed to reject voter registration applications or declare previously registered voters ineligible every chance he got. The secretary of state should identify vulnerabilities in Georgia's election systems before the Russians, a cybersecurity researcher or anyone else does. When informed of a problem, the secretary must promptly fix it. The Department of Homeland Security and private election security firms should participate in this process. Protecting election security requires collaboration. It's crucial that the secretary stays abreast of the known vulnerabilities in voting machines used at polling stations and other devices connected to elections. The new secretary needs to collaborate with fellow secretaries of state to share threat assessments and solutions. Another task is to develop a method to detect fraud (like risk-limiting audits that many states use) that will identify unusual results as soon as possible after they are recorded. Aggressive testing is critically important to determine whether any change or patch to a system has introduced a new vulnerability. This is something that did not happen when Georgia quietly patched that reported hack that Mr. Kemp had blamed on the Democrats. A big part of the solution is for all state, county and local election officials to inculcate a culture of privacy and security. This requires continuous education and comprehensive training in threat identification and r best practices. There is a reason we've heard so much about election security since 2016: Democracy demands confidence in the vote. We don't have that yet.

Safety Tips To Protect Your Data On the Web,"Editors' note: This guide was originally published in 2017. But after Marriott disclosed on Friday that the personal information of as many as a half billion people may have been compromised by hackers, the suggestions below are as important as ever.    There are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information, as major website breaches become ever more frequent.    How do I know if my personal information has been taken?   Unfortunately, you may want to assume that it was. Cyberattacks happen all the time.   Should I change my passwords?   Regardless of the type of breach or the company involved, it's always a safe bet to change passwords for sites that contain sensitive information like financial, health or credit card data. Do not use the same password across multiple sites and do not use your Social Security number as a username or password, especially in the wake of the recent Equifax breach.   And if you were not doing so already, you will have to treat everything you receive online with an abundance of suspicion, in case hackers are trying to trick you out of even more information.   How do I create stronger passwords?   Try a password manager like 1Password or LastPass.   These sites create a unique password for each website you visit and store them in a database protected by a master password that you create. Password managers reduce the risk of reused passwords or those that are easy to decode.   Wirecutter, a New York Times company, provides a helpful explanation of why password managers are so essential. They also maintain an updated guide to what it considers to be the best password managers.   If you must create your own passwords, try creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases or one-sentence summaries of strange life events and add numbers and special characters.   My favorite number is Green4782#The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%   Or, if you're extra paranoid, consider mimicking this setup. Take the sentence:   One time in class I ate some glue   And convert it into this:   1TiC!AsG   One time in class I ate some glue â+' 1TiC!AsG    In general, create the strongest passwords for the sites that contain the most sensitive information and do not reuse them anywhere.   Are passwords enough?   Passwords are not enough. If a site offers additional security features, like secondary or two-factor authentication, enable them. Then, when you enter your password, you will receive a message (usually a text) with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in.   Many bank sites and major sites like Google and Apple offer two-factor authentication. In some cases, the second authentication is required only if you are logging in from a new computer.   Won't security questions protect my data?   Sites will often use common security questions to recover a user's account if the password is forgotten.   These questions are problematic because the internet has made public record searches simple and the answers are usually easy to guess.   In a study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user's answer to the question, ''What is your favorite food?'' (It was pizza.)   With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user's answer to the question, ''What is your city of birth?'' and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.

U.S. Spies Paid Russian Peddling Trump Secrets,"Follow Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter: @AllMattNYT BERLIN -- After months of secret negotiations, a shadowy Russian bilked American spies out of $100,000 last year, promising to deliver stolen National Security Agency cyberweapons in a deal that he insisted would also include compromising material on President Trump, according to American and European intelligence officials. The cash, delivered in a suitcase to a Berlin hotel room in September, was intended as the first installment of a $1 million payout, according to American officials, the Russian and communications reviewed by The New York Times. The theft of the secret hacking tools had been devastating to the N.S.A., and the agency was struggling to get a full inventory of what was missing.    Several American intelligence officials said they made clear that they did not want the Trump material from the Russian, who was suspected of having murky ties to Russian intelligence and to Eastern European cybercriminals. He claimed the information would link the president and his associates to Russia. Instead of providing the hacking tools, the Russian produced unverified and possibly fabricated information involving Mr. Trump and others, including bank records, emails and purported Russian intelligence data.    The United States intelligence officials said they cut off the deal because they were wary of being entangled in a Russian operation to create discord inside the American government. They were also fearful of political fallout in Washington if they were seen to be buying scurrilous information on the president.   The Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment on the negotiations with the Russian seller. The N.S.A., which produced the bulk of the hacking tools that the Americans sought to recover, said only that ''all N.S.A. employees have a lifetime obligation to protect classified information.''   The negotiations in Europe last year were described by American and European intelligence officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a clandestine operation, and the Russian. The United States officials worked through an intermediary -- an American businessman based in Germany -- to preserve deniability. There were meetings in provincial German towns where John le Carré set his early spy novels, and data handoffs in five-star Berlin hotels. American intelligence agencies spent months tracking the Russian's flights to Berlin, his rendezvous with a mistress in Vienna and his trips home to St. Petersburg, the officials said.   The N.S.A. even used its official Twitter account to send coded messages to the Russian nearly a dozen times.   The episode ended this year with American spies chasing the Russian out of Western Europe, warning him not to return if he valued his freedom, the American businessman said. The Trump material was left with the American, who has secured it in Europe.   The Russian claimed to have access to a staggering collection of secrets that included everything from the computer code for the cyberweapons stolen from the N.S.A. and C.I.A. to what he said was a video of Mr. Trump consorting with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room in 2013, according to American and European officials and the Russian, who agreed to be interviewed in Germany on the condition of anonymity. There remains no evidence that such a video exists.   The Russian was known to American and European officials for his ties to Russian intelligence and cybercriminals -- two groups suspected in the theft of the N.S.A. and C.I.A. hacking tools.   But his apparent eagerness to sell the Trump ''kompromat'' -- a Russian term for information used to gain leverage over someone -- to American spies raised suspicions among officials that he was part of an operation to feed the information to United States intelligence agencies and pit them against Mr. Trump. Early in the negotiations, for instance, he dropped his asking price from about $10 million to just over $1 million. Then, a few months later, he showed the American businessman a 15-second clip of a video showing a man in a room talking to two women.   No audio could be heard on the video, and there was no way to verify if the man was Mr. Trump, as the Russian claimed. But the choice of venue for showing the clip heightened American suspicions of a Russian operation: The viewing took place at the Russian Embassy in Berlin, the businessman said.   There were other questions about the Russian's reliability. He had a history of money laundering and a thin legitimate cover business -- a nearly bankrupt company that sold portable grills for streetside sausage salesmen, according to British incorporation papers.   ''The distinction between an organized criminal and a Russian intelligence officer and a Russian who knows some Russian intel guys -- it all blurs together,'' said Steven L. Hall, the former chief of Russia operations at the C.I.A. ''This is the difficulty of trying to understand how Russia and Russians operate from the Western viewpoint.''   American intelligence officials were also wary of the purported kompromat the Russian wanted to sell. They saw the information, especially the video, as the stuff of tabloid gossip pages, not intelligence collection, American officials said.   But the Americans desperately wanted the hacking tools. The cyberweapons had been built to break into the computer networks of Russia, China and other rival powers. Instead, they ended up in the hands of a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has since provided hackers with tools that infected millions of computers around the world, crippling hospitals, factories and businesses.   No officials wanted to refuse information they thought might help determine what had happened.   ''That's one of the bedeviling things about counterintelligence and the wilderness that it is -- nobody wants to be caught in a position of saying we wrote that off and then five years later saying, 'Holy cow, it was actually a real guy,''' Mr. Hall said.   American intelligence agencies believe that Russia's spy services see the deep political divisions in the United States as a fresh opportunity to inflame partisan tensions. Russian hackers are targeting American voting databases ahead of the midterm election this year, they said, and using bot armies to promote partisan causes on social media. The Russians are also particularly eager to cast doubt on the federal and congressional investigations into the Russian meddling, American intelligence officials said.   Part of that effort, the officials said, appears to be trying to spread information that hews closely to unsubstantiated reports about Mr. Trump's dealings in Russia, including the purported video, whose existence Mr. Trump has repeatedly dismissed.   Rumors that Russian intelligence possesses the video surfaced more than a year ago in an explosive and unverified dossier compiled by a former British spy and paid for by Democrats. Since then, at least four Russians with espionage and underworld connections have appeared in Central and Eastern Europe, offering to sell kompromat to American political operatives, private investigators and spies that would corroborate the dossier, American and European intelligence officials said.   American officials suspect that at least some of the sellers are working for Russia's spy services.   The Times obtained four of the documents that the Russian in Germany tried to pass to American intelligence (The Times did not pay for the material). All are purported to be Russian intelligence reports, and each focuses on associates of Mr. Trump. Carter Page, the former campaign adviser who has been the focus of F.B.I. investigators, features in one; Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire Republican donors, in another.   Yet all four appear to be drawn almost entirely from news reports, not secret intelligence. They all also contain stylistic and grammatical usages not typically seen in Russian intelligence reports, said Yuri Shvets, a former K.G.B. officer who spent years as a spy in Washington before immigrating to the United States after the end of the Cold War.   American spies are not the only ones who have dealt with Russians claiming to have secrets to sell. Cody Shearer, an American political operative with ties to the Democratic Party, has been crisscrossing Eastern Europe for more than six months to secure the purported kompromat from a different Russian, said people familiar with the efforts, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid damaging their relationship with him.   Reached by phone late last year, Mr. Shearer would say only that his work was ''a big deal -- you know what it is, and you shouldn't be asking about it.'' He then hung up.   Mr. Shearer's efforts grew out of work he first began during the 2016 campaign, when he compiled a pair of reports that, like the dossier, also included talk of a video and Russian payoffs to Trump associates. It is not clear what, if anything, Mr. Shearer has been able to purchase.   Before the Americans were negotiating with the Russian, they were dealing with a hacker in Vienna known only to American intelligence officials as Carlo. In early 2017, he offered to provide them with a full set of hacking tools that were in the hands of the Shadow Brokers and the names of other people in his network, American officials said. In exchange, he wanted immunity from prosecution in the United States.   But the immunity deal fell apart, so intelligence officials decided to do what spies do best: They offered to buy the data. That is when the Russian in Germany emerged, telling the Americans he would handle the sale.   Like Carlo, he had previously dealt with American intelligence operatives, American and European officials said. He served as a fixer, of sorts, brokering deals for Russia's Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., which is the successor to the Soviet K.G.B. American intelligence officials said that he had a direct link to Nikolai Patrushev, a former F.S.B. director, and that they knew of previous work he had done helping move illicit shipments of semiprecious metals for a Russian oligarch.   By last April it appeared that a deal was imminent. Several C.I.A. officers even traveled from the agency's headquarters to help the agency's Berlin station handle the operation.   At a small bar in the former heart of West Berlin, the Russian handed the American intermediary a thumb drive with a small cache of data that was intended to provide a sample of what was to come, American officials said.   Within days, though, the deal turned sour. American intelligence agencies determined that the data was genuinely from the Shadow Brokers, but was material the group had already made public. As a result, the C.I.A. said it would not pay for it, American officials said.   The Russian was furious. But negotiations limped on until September, when the two sides agreed to try again.   Late that month, the American businessman delivered the $100,000 payment. Some officials said it was United States government money but routed through an indirect channel.   A few weeks later, the Russian began handing over data. But in multiple deliveries in October and December, almost all of what he delivered was related to the 2016 election and alleged ties between Mr. Trump's associates and Russia, not the N.S.A. or C.I.A. hacking tools.   In December, the Russian said he told the American intermediary that he was providing the Trump material and holding out on the hacking tools at the orders of senior Russian intelligence officials.   Early this year, the Americans gave him one last chance. The Russian once again showed up with nothing more than excuses.   So the Americans offered him a choice: Start working for them and provide the names of everyone in his network -- or go back to Russia and do not return.   The Russian did not give it much thought. He took a sip of the cranberry juice he was nursing, picked up his bag and said, ''Thank you.'' Then he walked out the door.

Top Trump Homeland Security Adviser Is Forced Out as Bolton Settles In,"WASHINGTON -- A day after John R. Bolton went to work as national security adviser, he began shaking up the Trump administration's national security ranks, ousting President Trump's chief adviser on homeland security, Thomas P. Bossert. Mr. Bossert's sudden departure on Tuesday was the latest in an exodus of senior officials, and it leaves the White House short-handed in counterterrorism and cybersecurity operations as the president moves closer to a military strike on Syria.     But it confirms that Mr. Bolton, a hard-line former ambassador to the United Nations, is determined to put his own stamp on the National Security Council. He also moved some of Mr. Bossert's duties directly under the council, according to administration officials.   While Mr. Bolton was widely expected to clean house, Mr. Bossert's ouster came as a surprise -- at least to him. On Sunday, he stoutly defended Mr. Trump's immigration policies on the ABC program ''This Week,'' then traveled to a conference in Sea Island, Ga., where he gave a spirited defense of the way the White House makes policy.   In a statement, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the president thanked Mr. Bossert, 43, ''for his patriotic service.''   ''The president is grateful for Tom's commitment to the safety and security of our great country,'' Ms. Sanders said. ''Tom led the White House's efforts to protect the homeland from terrorist threats, strengthen our cyberdefenses and respond to an unprecedented series of natural disasters.''   A lawyer who had served in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Bossert made a name for himself as the public face of the White House response to hurricanes that tore through Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. His briefings, lucid and laden with statistics, were a counterpoint to the chaos that was seen as pervading other parts of the White House.   But administration officials said Mr. Bossert chafed at that part of his job, preferring to get involved in higher-level policy issues on counterterrorism and cyberwarfare. Mr. Bossert, they said, aspired to a broader portfolio -- even that of national security adviser -- which was not in the cards.   ''You won't believe this, but this White House seems to function just about the same as every other White House,'' he said at the conference in Georgia. ''At the end of the day, the only thing that creates instability or the perception of it is, A, the coverage, and B, the turnover.'' Mr. Bossert spoke extensively about his plans for the coming year.   Some colleagues viewed him as highhanded and faulted his handling of cybersecurity issues for being plodding and overly cautious. Others said he recognized the legal complexities raised by offensive cyberoperations, and was determined to conduct a thorough policy process before making decisions.   Still, Mr. Bossert was one of the few high-ranking figures in Mr. Trump's White House who had won bipartisan praise.   ''Tom's departure is a loss for this administration,'' said Jeh Johnson, who was secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama. ''I met him during the transition and was impressed. He struck me as a conscientious, levelheaded public servant.''   While Mr. Bossert is known more as a technocrat than an ideologue, he became one of Mr. Trump's most enthusiastic public defenders, sometimes to the discomfort of his friends from the Bush administration.   He dismissed the president's pardon of  Joe Arpaio, the divisive former sheriff of Maricopa County in Arizona, as ''pretty straightforward.'' He said after Mr. Trump's equivocal response to the white supremacist march and clashes in Charlottesville, Va., ''I'm proud of the fact that he stood up and calmly looked into the camera and condemned this violence and bigotry in all its forms.''   Mr. Bossert also came to the president's defense last year when the government's hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico came under withering criticism for leaving large parts of the island without power, weeks after the storm.   ''I don't accept that we're doing anything short of everything we can do,'' he said to CNN, but added, ''I do accept that there's going to be a difference between a full-throated, adequate response and the complete satisfaction of bringing that entire territory back to its full, functional state.''   By all accounts, Mr. Bossert got along well with Mr. Trump, who praised his handling of natural disasters. He also developed close ties to Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, with whom he traveled to Iraq, and with Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser.   But Mr. Bossert, officials said, had an extremely strained relationship with Mr. Bolton's predecessor, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and clashed with Kirstjen Nielsen, who served as a deputy to the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, before becoming the secretary of homeland security.   Mr. Bolton, an official said, has moved the counterterrorism and cybersecurity portfolios under the National Security Council. Rob Joyce, the cybersecurity coordinator on the council, who was Mr. Bossert's deputy, will take his place on an acting basis.   Mr. Joyce, a veteran of the National Security Agency, until last year ran the Tailored Access Operations unit, the nation's premier group of hackers, which breaks into foreign government computer networks.   Some former officials worried that the change would downgrade the job, which was created after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. ''This is a vitally important position that should be a direct report to the president,'' said Lisa Monaco, who served as homeland security adviser under Mr. Obama.   Mr. Bossert stirred controversy during a recent meeting with members of the families of Americans who were detained and beheaded in Syria by Islamic State terrorists. He told them he hoped the United States would send two men recently captured in Syria, and suspected of imprisoning the Americans, to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.   That rankled some family members, who recently published an Op-Ed in The New York Times calling for these suspects to be given criminal trials in the United States or The Hague.   Mr. Bolton has yet to announce a major new appointment to the National Security Council. But he is making changes on multiple fronts. The day before Mr. Bolton took office, the director of strategic communications, Michael Anton, resigned under pressure.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Confronted With Evidence of Russian Hacking, Trump Reverts to Conspiracy","Last week, the American public saw for the first time detailed, specific evidence that President Vladimir V. Putin's military commanders in Russia were engaged in a day-to-day, highly sophisticated effort to manipulate the 2016 election. But on Monday, standing next to Mr. Putin, President Trump not only avoided all mention of the Justice Department's indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers, but he questioned the very conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking.    Instead, Mr. Trump raised a series of largely irrelevant conspiracy theories -- none of which were directly related to the evidence of Russian hacking activity.   He returned to questions of why the F.B.I. never took custody of a Democratic National Committee computer server.    He asked what happened to Imran Awan, a Pakistan-born Capitol Hill aide, who pleaded guilty this month on unrelated fraud charges after becoming a cause célèbre for conservatives who questioned whether he was linked to the committee's hacking. (A July 3 plea agreement found no evidence that Mr. Awan illegally handled congressional computer systems.)   And Mr. Trump demanded to know why thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails had disappeared, a question apparently unrelated to Russia's activities.   It was a smoke-and-mirrors effort, several American intelligence officials said later Monday. While Mr. Trump's supporters repeatedly return to the question of the Democratic National Committee's reluctance to turn over its server, which still sits in the committee's basement, investigators familiar with the intelligence in the case said the hardware itself is of little investigative value.   That is because the emails were always supposed to be stored in the party committee's server. How they made their way into communications channels and networks used by the G.R.U., Mr. Putin's aggressive military intelligence unit, is the crux of the investigation. And so is the question of who ordered that they be made public at critical moments in the 2016 campaign.   The Russian president, for his part, was more subtle.   Mr. Putin invited American investigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to come to Moscow and work with Russian officials in a joint investigation. It was akin to the prime suspect in a homicide offering to join detectives in going house to house in a search for the culprit.   ''Putin is just trying to tie this investigation thing up,'' said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   Mr. Lewis said the Russian president ''wants to assert himself as peer.'' He noted that Mr. Putin again raised the proposal of a joint cybersecurity working group -- an idea that Mr. Trump initially and enthusiastically supported until his staff explained the dangers of potentially undercutting American cyberdefense programs.   ''He must just laugh when he gets back to Moscow,'' Mr. Lewis said.   Mr. Trump's own effort at misdirection is not new.   When he first met Mr. Putin a year ago, in Hamburg, Germany, he said the Russian leader had made a persuasive case that Moscow was so skilled at cyberattacks it could not have been involved. Mr. Trump offered a version of the same explanation on Monday, saying Mr. Putin had been enormously persuasive in his denials.   That shocked many of his current and former aides, who say the president has been briefed repeatedly -- starting at Trump Tower in Manhattan in January 2017 -- on the basis for the conclusion that Mr. Putin himself ordered the attack. The aides said Mr. Trump understands that American, British and Dutch intelligence all intercepted Russian messages and Democratic National Committee documents.   The American president has also been told that the F.B.I. has received a full ''forensic copy'' of the committee's server. That is a fairly standard practice and, as the committee noted Monday in a statement, is ''the best thing to use in an investigation so that your exploration of the server does not change the evidence.''   And Mr. Trump has been briefed extensively on the specific roles of the newly indicted Russian military commanders in publishing stolen emails and attempts to infiltrate election systems.   His equivocating on Monday left several people who have worked with him to conclude that the president simply will not accept evidence of Russian involvement -- fearing it could be used by political enemies to argue he was not legitimately elected.   More than 18 months into his presidency, Mr. Trump has stood alone as the sole senior American official who has questioned the quality of the evidence.   His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he had no doubts about Russia's involvement when he served as director of the C.I.A. The heads of the National Security Agency and the other leading intelligence agencies have said the same.   Mr. Trump's director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, went further last week when he argued that the system was ''blinking red'' about future cyberattacks, maybe intended to affect the next election. On Monday, shortly after his boss questioned whether Mr. Putin or the American intelligence community was right, Mr. Coats responded, ''We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.''   In a normal political environment, it is easy to imagine a president pursuing the investigation even while making the case that the 2016 outcome was not affected by the Russian activities. Mr. Trump, his closest aides say, has never been able to separate the question of preventing future Russian meddling from his conviction that the entire issue is a political concoction.   The effects of that paralysis are now being seen. At the White House, the job of cybercoordinator -- the post responsible for coordinating American defenses -- has been eliminated.   The Department of Homeland Security has raised urgent concerns about the vulnerability of American critical infrastructure, including electric utilities, to malware planted by Russian hackers. But Mr. Trump has never led a significant meeting on the subject, aides said. He never created a commission to learn lessons from the 2016 experience.   Now, as was clear in the most awkward moments of the news conference, the issue is more complicated for both Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.   The intelligence revealed in Friday's indictment contains such specific conversations between Russian military officers, WikiLeaks and others that it would reasonably leave both presidents concerned about what else from the American intelligence trove may have been turned over to Mr. Mueller. If there were Americans involved, they would have to assume they, too, were caught in the digital dragnet.   Mr. Mueller's investigation is clearly not yet over, and there are hints in the Friday indictments that he is now trying to establish the links between the Russian hackers and any Americans who may have been working with them. Perhaps that is why Mr. Trump kept returning to his claim that there was no collusion -- a question the special counsel has not yet publicly addressed.

"Cybersecurity Experts Expect Interference, but Not a Repeat of 2016","WASHINGTON -- Shane Huntley has seen every form of state-sponsored cyberattack, first as an Australian intelligence officer and now as director of Google's most advanced team of threat detectors. So when he was asked what surprised him the most about the 2018 midterm elections, his response was a bit counterintuitive. ''The answer is surprisingly little on the hacking front, at least compared to two years ago.'' He paused, and added: ''And that reassures some people, and it scares some people.''    He is right. From the cyberwar room that the Department of Homeland Security runs round the clock in a bland office building in Arlington, Va., to Microsoft's threat-assessment center at the other end of the country, in Redmond, Wash., every form of digital radar is being focused on America's election infrastructure -- and particularly on the Russian military intelligence agency once known as the G.R.U.    This weekend, some of those radars began to sound a few warnings -- but faintly, and in strange places. Cybersecurity firms and some election officials reported seeing an increase in cyberattacks on websites and infrastructure surrounding the vote, but not on systems that are part of the voting process. Hackers have targeted websites across the United States -- including in Georgia, Florida and California -- that allow voters to look up the location of their local polling stations or to verify that they are registered to vote.   It is unclear where the attacks are coming from, but the sources appear to be a mix, everything from other countries to lone hackers looking to make a name for themselves, investigators say. ''The attackers are trying to make a lot of noise,'' said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a cybersecurity firm that is tracking the action.   He said the incursions were not an effort to disrupt the vote, but merely to bolster rumors of election fraud and interference. ''They are going after anything that can undermine the process itself,'' he said. ''Their aim is to put the outcome in doubt,'' which could enable President Trump or losing candidates, come Wednesday, to declare that the outcome was rigged.   There is no evidence yet that the Russians have had anything to do with this latest set of malicious activities, and many experts say they believe that President Vladimir V. Putin is sitting out this election. After all, the argument goes, the scrutiny is intense, and 470 House and Senate races make it just too hard for the Russians to figure out their interests, much less manipulate the outcome. But after the 2016 debacle, suspicions run deep, and some think that the Russians just have not played their hand yet.   ''The Russians are too smart to run the same play a second time,'' said Dmitri Alperovich, one of the founders of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, who was central to identifying the Russian military inside the D.N.C., touching off chaos in the Democratic Party. ''If they were going to do anything in today's environment, they certainly wouldn't want to act until the very last moment.''   Whether a Russian change of tactics is unfolding is just one of many mysteries surrounding this first national election in the United States after the most sophisticated known effort by a foreign power to divide Americans, and ultimately seek to alter the outcome.   If there is a lesson from 2016, it was that America was constantly taken by surprise -- by the hacking of the D.N.C. and prominent Democrats, by the publication of internal emails, by efforts to get inside the voter-registration rolls of 20 states.   The Russians haven't exactly gone away. While there are few signs of pre-election intrusions into voter-registration systems, the social media campaigns never ended; some accelerated immediately after the 2016 elections.   ''We shouldn't be surprised by any of this,'' Mr. Huntley said. ''It's like fighting the last war. When I was in the military academy people told us all the next wars were going to look like the first Gulf War. They didn't. And in cyber, the next war won't look like 2016.'' Already, it is full of surprises.   Some Surprise Visitors: The Iranians   In 2016, the Iranians were nowhere to be seen in the American election process. This year, they showed up in such force that Facebook announced on Oct. 26 that it was taking down a series of Iranian posts -- mostly, it seemed, to demonstrate that the company's radar is finally on high alert.   Intelligence officials and cybersecurity companies say the Iranians mostly appear to be copying techniques that they learned from watching the Russians, especially in social media.   But there is a twist: The Russians and the Iranians are clearly not in political agreement here. While both have sought to exacerbate political and social divides, the Russians clearly showed a preference for Mr. Trump as Election Day approached, according to the conclusions published after the election by American intelligence agencies.   The Iranians are playing the other side. ''They don't like what happened to the nuclear deal,'' said Yasmin Green, the director of research and development for Jigsaw, a unit of Alphabet, which is Google's parent company.   Ms. Green, one of the country's leading experts on the uses and abuses of social media, noted that Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and his reimposition of drastic sanctions, has made the Iranians determined to cripple him.   ''Not only are they anti-this administration,'' she said, they are ''pro-liberal.''   By comparison to the Russians, the Iranian hackers are still pretty unsophisticated and are largely inept at imitating down-the-street-neighbors when posting to Facebook and Reddit.   One ad showed a frowning Mr. Trump, and declared him ''The Worst, Most Hated President in American History,'' the kind of extreme declaration one might expect of Mr. Trump himself.   The number of these posts appeared small -- about 82 Facebook pages, groups and accounts -- but they generated more than a million followers.   What Is Russia's Testing Ground? Ukraine   In 2016, America's big mistake was failing to understand what had been happening in Ukraine.   Every technique that Mr. Putin's hackers, from the network break-in artists at the G.R.U. to the producers of fake social-media posts at the internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, used in the United States they tested in Kiev and the Donbass, the separatist area where the Russians have been stoking civil war.   So it is no surprise, said Tom Burt, the vice president for customer security and trust at Microsoft, that the most active battleground is, once again, Ukraine.   In the Microsoft Cybercrime Center, a giant digital map of the world shows cyberattack activity, but the number of attacks are adjusted for the size of the population. Ukraine shows up in bright red. The United States, with 330 million people, or seven times the population of Ukraine, shows up in white, a sign of relative calm.   ''We're seeing activity in the U.S., but we're seeing it at levels less than we saw in 2016,'' said Mr. Burt.   He cautioned that Microsoft, with its network of machines using Office software and its Azure cloud computing services, is more likely to see hacking of accounts than social media activity. Still, Mr. Burt's group alerted two senators last year that a hacking group long linked to the G.R.U. had attacked their Capitol Hill offices, unsuccessfully.   One of the senators was Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat who is considered highly vulnerable. Microsoft also detected intrusions on two politically conservative think tanks in Washington in August.   To get a sense of what is coming to the United States, Ms. Green and Jigsaw's chief executive, Jared Cohen, visited Ukraine in recent weeks and found that it was still Mr. Putin's petri dish, a place where sophisticated new experiments were underway to deluge separatist parts of the country with disinformation ahead of military actions and a presidential election next March.   Ukraine is ''always on the leading edge,'' she concluded.   The Chinese Are Doing It, Too. Or Maybe Not.   The question of China's involvement was raised first by Mr. Trump and then by Mr. Pence, who said in a speech that ''Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans' perception of Chinese policies.''   But Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were borrowing the terminology of cyberattacks to describe something very different: Efforts by China to publish policy arguments, often in newspaper supplements that have been paid for by the Chinese government for years, to make its case.   There is no evidence, officials and outside experts say, of the kind of hacking that Russia has engaged in, or even much social-media use.   When three Democratic senators asked Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, for an unclassified letter explaining what the Chinese were doing in the 2018 election, to truth-test the administration's arguments, Mr. Coats avoided any potential contradictions with his boss by sending a classified answer.   ''You can't have it both ways,'' Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said. Mr. Coats, he said, ''has an obligation to the American people to provide a public response to our questions, particularly since this is about America's elections and the security of our democracy.''   What About Those Texas Voting Machines That Alter Votes?   If awards were handed out for most-bungled-election-machine-management, Texas would be a strong contender for the top prize. It's just that the problem is the machines or the voters, not Mr. Putin's hackers.   As early voting began recently, voters who hit the button to choose a straight Republican or Democratic ballot on a certain kind of machine -- called a ''Hart InterCivic eSlate'' -- discovered that if they mistakenly touched a quirky button or clickwheel, the ballot could change. And there was no way for voters to see it changing.   That is another reason that paper backup for electronic voting machines is so important, so that voters can look over their selections, and so vote-counters have a nonelectronic way of conducting a recount, if the machines cannot be trusted. One would think that after all the concerns in 2016, states and counties would have been racing to update their systems. ''Most did almost nothing,'' Douglas Lute, a former American ambassador to NATO and Army general, who has taken up the cause of reforming the election infrastructure, said in an interview. The $380 million that Congress allotted recently mostly went to funding assessments of vulnerabilities.   Yet while states and counties made changes, New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana still use no paper backup, and parts of Pennsylvania, a vital swing state, do not either. That has not changed since 2016, and it is unlikely that it will be solved by 2020.   That is only part of the problem. Many counties use old, insecure websites for their voter registration; it would be relatively simple to create ''spoofed'' alternative sites or break into them, to manipulate data or post notices that polls have been closed or Election Day moved. That could be the next move in the county-by-county activity seen in recent days.   There also is room for mischief as votes are tabulated and reported to the state, and ultimately to media outlets.   Eric Rosenbach, a former senior Defense Department official who directs the Defending Digital Democracy initiative at Harvard's Belfer Center, which has provided training in recent months to election officials from 38 states, notes that is exactly what happened in Ukraine, ''creating conflicting reporting about who really won.'' The effort was intended to sow doubts about whether the entire election had been manipulated.   Tuesday Risk: A Cybersurprise   It wouldn't take much to disrupt Tuesday's vote in a few important swing districts, and that's what the United States government -- and many private security experts -- are worried about.   The Department of Homeland Security says it will be deploying small teams of cyberexperts to important states -- presumably those that are most vulnerable, or have close races -- just before the election. But it is not hard to imagine different scenarios that could cause disruption, or just create the illusion of disruption.   A last-minute attack on county or state voter-registration systems, just to knock them off-line, would create an uproar from voters who might show up at the polls and find they could not vote. A strike at power grids, turning out the lights at polling places, or just disrupting transportation systems could suppress turnout and lead to charges of manipulation.   And then there is another fear: Come Wednesday, if there are still races that are too close to call, just a rumor campaign about possible election manipulation might be enough to cast doubt about the integrity of the results. And in the end, that is what election disruption is all about -- undermining the citizens' confidence that their vote counts.    "
Ex-N.S.A. Worker Accused of Stealing Trove of Secrets Offers to Plead Guilty,"BALTIMORE -- A veteran cybersecurity specialist for the National Security Agency and other intelligence organizations, accused of taking thousands of secret documents home over two decades, has decided to plead guilty later this month to a single charge that could carry a 10-year sentence. But under the terms laid out by prosecutors, the intelligence contractor, Harold T. Martin III, would have no guarantee that the government will drop 19 additional felony charges. Mr. Martin appears to be making an unusual gamble that his penitence and cooperation will eventually persuade prosecutors to dismiss the rest of the indictment.  According to court filings on Wednesday, Mr. Martin is expected to plead guilty on Jan. 22 before Judge Marvin J. Garbis of United States District Court to one count of willful retention of national defense information in connection with his taking home a single classified N.S.A. document. But charges involving 12 other N.S.A. documents, five from the military's Cyber Command, and one each from the C.I.A. and the National Reconnaissance Office, would remain in place. A detailed letter filed by prosecutors in federal court marks a step toward resolution of a highly embarrassing case that exposed gaping holes in the government's system for safeguarding secrets. Mr. Martin, 52, described by his own lawyers as a compulsive hoarder, took home highly classified documents from the N.S.A. and other agencies beginning in the late 1990s, stashing them on paper, hard drives and flash drives in his house in Glen Burnie, Md.; a shed in his yard; and his car. His serial theft, totaling a staggering 50 terabytes of data, went undetected until his arrest on Aug. 27, 2016. Mr. Martin had worked for the N.S.A.'s hacking unit, then known as Tailored Access Operations, and the material he took included most or all of the agency hacking tools that ended up being offered for sale on the internet by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. In the scramble to trace the breach, investigators stumbled upon Mr. Martin's thefts. But officials have said investigators have been unable to prove a connection between Mr. Martin and the Shadow Brokers, who are widely suspected to have ties to Russian intelligence. The Shadow Brokers disclosures, which continued for more than a year, have been devastating for the N.S.A., where morale has been hurt by the continuing hunt for a possible leaker. The stolen tools have been used by North Korea and Russia to carry out cyberattacks around the world. If Mr. Martin can convince investigators that he had nothing to do with the Shadow Brokers' disclosures and assist them in other ways, he may be able to limit his exposure at sentencing. The prosecutors' letter, however, says that his proposed guilty plea ""does not preclude"" the use of any admissible evidence ""at the defendant's trial on the remaining 19 counts of the indictment."" A schedule laid out by Judge Garbis sets dates for continuing legal action on the additional charges after the Jan. 22 plea hearing. Mr. Martin's lawyer, James Wyda, the federal public defender for Maryland, declined to comment. Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Martin's lawyers have indicated that they will argue for a lesser sentence on the grounds that he suffers from a mental disorder that caused him to take the material home year after year; that he never tried to give it to the news media, a foreign country or anyone else; and that he is a Navy veteran and a patriot who served his country for years. But prosecutors may be loath to offer leniency for Mr. Martin's repeated, brazen violations of his secrecy oath. He is charged with taking a volume of information that dwarfs even the data taken by Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor who fled the country in 2013 with hundreds of thousands of secret documents and gave them to journalists. They may also be wary of a condemning tweet from President Trump, who has vowed to be tough on leakers and has shown no reluctance to criticize his own Justice Department. After the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, who lives in exile in Russia and faces charges should he ever return to the United States, N.S.A. officials spent millions of dollars toughening security and installing software to detect unusual downloads. But Mr. Martin appears to have blithely continued his theft of secrets without trouble from the stepped-up safeguards. In addition to Mr. Martin, two other former N.S.A. workers have been charged with illegally removing classified material from the agency, which eavesdrops on foreign communications and hacks into computer networks overseas. Last month, Nghia H. Pho, 67, of Ellicott City, Md., pleaded guilty to one count of willful retention of national defense information. He is scheduled for sentencing in April. His case revealed what officials believe was the use of Kaspersky Lab antivirus software by Russian intelligence officials to steal classified documents from Mr. Pho's home computer. In addition, Reality L. Winner, 26, awaits trial on charges that she took a classified N.S.A. document about Russian hacking attacks on a voting software company and sent it to the online publication The Intercept last year. Those cases do not appear to be related to either the Shadow Brokers disclosures or a parallel leak of hacking-related documents from the C.I.A. to WikiLeaks, which has published them under the names Vault7 and Vault8. The repeated loss of extremely sensitive material on a large scale from two agencies has raised questions about whether it is possible for the government to protect secrets from determined hackers or insiders who have a political or financial motive to divulge them.

Joint News Conference by Trump and Putin: Full Video and Transcript,"After meeting privately in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia held a joint news conference. Following is a transcript as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live updates, and this analysis. ___________ Mr. Putin (through an interpreter):  Thank you so much. Shall we start working? I guess. Distinguished Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations with the president of the United States, Donald Trump, took place in a frank and businesslike atmosphere. I think we can call it a success and a very fruitful round of negotiations. We carefully analyzed the current status, the present and the future of the Russia-United States relationship, key issues of the global agenda. Mr. Putin:  It's quite clear to everyone that the bilateral relationship are going through a complicated stage, and yet those impediments, the current tension, the tense atmosphere, essentially have no solid reason behind it. The Cold War is a thing of past, the era of acute ideological confrontation of the two countries is a thing of remote past, is a vestige of the past. The situation in the world changed dramatically.  Today, both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges. Those include a dangerous maladjustment of mechanisms for maintaining international security and stability, regional crises, the creeping threats of terrorism and transnational crime, the snowballing problems in the economy, environmental risks and other sets of challenges. We can only cope with these challenges if we join ranks and work together. Hopefully we will reach this understanding with our American partners. Today's negotiations reflected our joint wish -- our joint wish with President Trump to readdress this negative situation in the bilateral relationship. I outlined first steps for improving this relationship, to restore the acceptable level of trust and going back to the previous level of interaction on all mutual interest issues. As major nuclear powers, we bear special responsibility for maintaining international security. (inaudible) vital -- and we mentioned this here in the negotiations -- it's crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions. We believe it necessary to work together further on -- to interact on the disarmament agenda, military and technical cooperation. This includes the extension of the Strategic Offensive Arms Limitation Treaty. It's a dangerous situation with a global American antimissile defense system, it's the implementation issues with the INF [intermediate-range nuclear forces] treaty. And, of course, the agenda of non-placement of weapons in space. Mr. Putin:  We favor the continued cooperation in counterterrorism and maintaining cybersecurity. And I'd like to point out specifically that our special services are cooperating quite successfully together. The most recent example is their operational cooperation within the recently concluded World Football Cup. In general, the context among the special services should be put to a systemwide basis -- should be brought to a systemic framework. I recall I reminded President Trump about this suggestion to re-establish the working group on antiterrorism. We also mentioned a plethora of regional crises. It's not always that our postures dovetail exactly, and yet the overlapping and mutual interests abound. We have to look for points of contact and interact closer in a variety of international forum. Clearly, we mentioned the regional crisis, for instance Syria. As far as Syria is concerned, the task of establishing peace and reconciliation in this country could be the first showcase example of the successful joint work. Russia and the United States apparently can act proactively and take considerable leadership on this issue, and organize the interaction to overcome humanitarian crisis and help Syrian refugees to go back to their homes. Mr. Putin:  In order to accomplish this level of successful cooperation in Syria, we have all the required components. Let me remind you of that. Both Russian and American military have acquired the useful experience of coordination of their action, established the operational channels of communication which permit it to avoid dangerous incidents and unintentional collisions in the air and in the ground. Also crushing terrorists in the southwest of Syria. The south of Syria should be brought to the full compliance with the treaty of 1974, about the separation of forces -- about separation of forces of Israel and Syria. This will bring peace to Golan Heights, and bring more peaceful relationship between Syria and Israel, and also to provide security of the state of Israel. Mr. President paid special attention to the issue during today's negotiations. And I would like to confirm that Russia is interested in this development and will act accordingly. Thus far, we will make a step toward creating a lasting peace in compliance with the respective resolutions of Security Council, for instance, the Resolution 338. We are glad that the Korean Peninsula issue is starting to resolve. To a great extent, it was possible thanks to the personal engagement of President Trump, who opted for dialogue instead of confrontation. We also mentioned our concern about the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA[the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal]. Well, the U.S. -- our U.S. counterparts are aware of our posture. Let me remind you that thanks to the Iranian nuclear deal, Iran became the most controlled country in the world. It submitted to the control of IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. It effectively ensured the exclusively peaceful nature of Iranian nuclear program and strengthened the nonproliferation regime. While we discussed the internal Ukrainian crisis, we paid special attention to the bona fide implementation of Minsk Agreements by Kiev. At the same time, United States could be more decisive in nudging the Ukrainian leadership, and encourage it to work actively on this. We paid more attention to economic ties and economic cooperation. It's clear that both countries -- the business of both countries are interested in this. American delegation was one of the largest delegations in the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. It featured over 500 representatives from American businesses. We agreed -- me and President Trump -- we agreed to create a high-level working group that would bring together captains of Russian and American business. After all, entrepreneurs and businessmen know better how to articulate this successful business cooperation. We'll let them think and make their proposals and suggestions in this regard. Once again, President Trump mentioned the issue of the so-called interference of Russia with the American elections, and I had to reiterate things I said several times, including during our personal contacts, that the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including election process. Mr. Putin: Any specific material -- if such things arise -- we are ready to analyze together. For instance, we can analyze them through the joint working group on cybersecurity, the establishment of which we discussed during our previous contacts. And clearly, it's past time we restore our cooperation in the cultural area and the humanitarian area. As far as -- I think you know that recently we hosted the American Congressional Delegation, and now it's perceived and portrayed almost as a historic event, while -- although it should have been just a current affairs, just business as usual. And in this regard, we mentioned this proposal to the president, we have to think about practicalities of our cooperation, but also about the rationality of the underlying logic of it. And we have to engage experts on bilateral relationship who know history and the background of our relationship. The idea is to create an expert council that would include political scientists, prominent diplomats and former military experts from both countries who would look for points of contact between the two countries and would look for ways on putting the relationship on the trajectory of growth. In general, we are glad with the outcome of our first full-scale meeting, because previously we only had a chance to talk briefly on international fora. We had a good conversation with President Trump, and I hope that we start to understand each other better. And I'm grateful to Donald for it. Clearly there are some challenges left when we were not able to clear all the backlog, but I think that we made the first important step in this direction. And in conclusion, I want to point out that this atmosphere of cooperation is something that we are especially grateful for to our Finnish hosts. We are grateful for Finnish people and Finnish leadership for what they've done. I know that we've caused some inconvenience to Finland and we apologize for it. Thank you for your attention. President Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you. I have just concluded a meeting with President Putin on a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries. We had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue. Went very well. Before I begin, I want to thank President Niinisto of Finland for graciously hosting today's summit. President Putin and I were saying how lovely it was and what a great job they did. I also want to congratulate Russia and President Putin for having done such an excellent job in hosting the World Cup. It was really one of the best ever. And your team also did very well. It was a great job. I'm here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy. From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility. A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world. The disagreements between our two countries are well known and President Putin and I discussed them at length today. But if we're going to solve many of the problems facing our world, then we're going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests. Mr. Trump: Too often, in both recent past and long ago, we have seen the consequences when diplomacy is left on the table. We've also seen the benefits of cooperation. In the last century, our nations fought alongside one another in the Second World War. Even during the tensions of the Cold War, when the world looked much different than it does today, the United States and Russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue. But our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed as of about four hours ago. I really believe that. Nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage, but that would not accomplish anything. As president, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics, or the media, or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct. Constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. As president, I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people. During today's meeting, I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections. I felt this was a message best delivered in person. Spent a great deal of time talking about it. And President Putin may very well want to address it, and very strongly, because he feels very strongly about it, and he has an interesting idea. We also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity: nuclear proliferation. I provided an update on my meeting last month with Chairman Kim on the denuclearization of North Korea. And after today, I am very sure that President Putin and Russia want very much to end that problem, going to work with us. And I appreciate that commitment. The president and I also discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. Both Russia and the United States has suffered horrific terrorist attacks, and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace. Last year, we told Russia about a planned attack in St. Petersburg, and they were able to stop it cold. They found them. They stopped them. There was no doubt about it. I appreciated President Putin's phone call afterwards to thank me. I also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions, and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area, throughout the Middle East. As we discussed at length, the crisis in Syria is a complex one. Cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. I also made clear that the United States will not allow Iran to benefit from our successful campaign against ISIS. We have just about eradicated ISIS in the area. Mr. Trump: We also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today, and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki. Today's meeting is only the beginning of a longer process, but we have taken the first step toward a brighter future and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought. Our expectations are grounded in realism, but our hopes are grounded in America's desire for friendship, cooperation and peace. And I think I can speak on behalf of Russia, when I say that, also. President Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States. Our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between Russia, the United States, for the greater good of all. And this was a very constructive day, this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together. It's in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation, and we have agreed to do so. I'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future often, and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today. So again, President Putin, thank you very much. Russian aide (through an interpreter): Distinguished presidents, now the journalists would have a chance to ask two questions, two sets of questions each. First the Russian journalist will ask the question. Please give your affiliation. Question (through an interpreter): Good afternoon, my name is Alex Amashkov (ph), Interfax Information Agency. I have a question to President Trump. During your recent European tour, you mentioned that implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline makes Europe a hostage of Russia, and you suggested that you could free Europe from this by supplying American LNG. But this cold winter actually showed that the current modal -- current mechanism of supply of fuel to Europe is quite viable. At the same time, as far as I know, U.S. had to buy even Russian gas for Boston. I have a question: The implementation of your idea has a political tinge to it or is it a practical one? Because there will be a gap formed in the supply-and-demand mechanism and the first is the consuming countries who will fall into this gap. And the second question, before the meeting with President Putin, you called him an adversary, a rival, and yet you expressed hope that you will be able to bring this relationship to a new level. Did you manage to do this? Mr. Trump: Well, actually I called him a competitor. And a good competitor he is. And I think the word ""competitor"" is a compliment. I think that we will be completing when you talk about the pipeline. I'm not sure, necessarily, that it's in the best interests of Germany or not, but that was a decision that they made. We'll be competing -- as you know, the United States is now -- or soon will be, but I think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world. So we're going to be selling LNG, and we'll have to be competing with the pipeline and I think will compete successfully, although there is a little advantage locationally. So I just wish them luck. I mean, I did. I discussed with Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones. But I also know where they're all coming from and they have a very close source. So we'll see how that all works out. Mr. Trump: But we have lots of sources now and the United States is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren't able to extract what we could extract today. So today we're number one in the world at that, and I think we'll be out there competing very strongly. Thank you very much. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter):  If I may, I'd throw in some two cents. We talked to Mr. President, including this subject as well. We are aware of the stance of President Trump, and I think that we, as a major oil and gas power, and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, we could work together on regulation of international markets, because neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the prices. And the consumers will suffer as well, and the consumers in the United States will suffer as well. And the shale gas production will suffer. Because beyond a sudden price breakup, it's no longer profitable to -- to produce gas. But nor we are interested in driving prices up, because it will drain just as -- just as from all other sectors of the economy, from (inaudible) building, et cetera. So we do have space for cooperation here. That's the first thing. Then about the Nord Stream 2, Mr. President voiced his concerns about the possibility of disappearance of transit through Ukraine. And I reassured Mr. President that Russia stands ready to maintain this transit. Moreover, we stand ready to extend this transit contract that's about to expire next year in case -- if the dispute between the economic entitles -- dispute will be settled in the Stockholm arbitration court. American aide: [The next question] goes to Jeff Mason from Reuters. Question: Thank you. Mr. President, you tweeted this morning that it's U.S. foolishness, stupidity and the Mueller probe that is responsible for the decline in U.S. relations with Russia.Do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular? And if so, what would you -- what would you consider them -- that they are responsible for? Mr. Trump: Yes I do. I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we've all been foolish. We should've had this dialogue a long time ago; a long time, frankly, before I got to office. And I think we're all to blame. I think that the United States now has stepped forward along with Russia, and we're getting together and we have a chance to do some great things, whether it's nuclear proliferation in terms of stopping -- you have to do it, ultimately that's probably the most important thing that we could be working on. But I do feel that we have both made some mistakes. I think that the -- the probe is a disaster for our country. I think it's kept us apart, it's kept us separated. There was no collusion at all. Everybody knows it. And people are being brought out to the fore. So far that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign. And they're going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign. That was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily. And, frankly, we beat her -- and I'm not even saying from the standpoint -- we won that race. And it's a shame that there could even be a little bit of a cloud over it. People know that, people understand it. But the main thing -- and we discussed this also -- zero collusion. And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world. We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous what's going on with the probe. Question: For President Putin, if I could follow up as well, why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election, given the evidence that U.S. intelligence agencies have provided? And will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a U.S. grand jury Mr. Trump: Well, I'm going to let the president answer the second part of that question. But, as you know, the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. We won the Electoral College by a lot: 306 to 223, I believe. And that was a well-fought -- that was a well-fought battle. We did a great job. And, frankly -- I'm going to let the president speak to the second part of your question -- but just to say it one time again -- and I say it all the time -- there was no collusion. I didn't know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. And every time you hear all of these, you know, 12 and 14 -- it's stuff that has nothing to do -- and, frankly, they admit these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they're saying, ""Well, maybe that does."" It doesn't. And even the people involved, some, perhaps, told mis-stories. Or, in one case, the F.B.I. said there was no lying. There was no lying. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign, and that's why I'm president. Thank you. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): As to who is to be believed and to who's not to be believed, you can trust no one if you take this. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America, and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact. There are issues where our postures diverge, and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense, just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there's nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That's the usual thing. President Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia-U.S. relationship. And it's clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it, and different people could express their sympathies in different ways. But isn't that natural? Isn't it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us? We heard the accusations about a conquered country. Well, as far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn't have a fighting change in the American courts. So there's no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts and not by rumors. Now let's get back to the issue of these 12 alleged intelligence officers of -- of Russia. Mr. Putin:  I don't know the full extent of the situation, but President Trump mentioned this issue and I will look into it. So far, I can say the following things off the top of my head. We have enacting an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999. The Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases. This treaty is in full effect. It works quite efficiently. On average, we initiate about 100, 150 criminal cases upon request from foreign states. For instance, the last year there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. So this treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller. He can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal -- an official request to us so that we would interrogate -- we want to hold a questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller -- we can let them into the country and they will be present at this questioning. But in this case, there is a -- there's another condition. This kind of effort should be a mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and that they would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence service of the United States, whom we believe are -- who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia, and we have to -- to request the presence of our law enforcement. For instance, we can bring up the Mr. [William F. ] Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Well, that's the personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal. So we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions. So we have a -- an interest of questioning them. We can all -- that -- that could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework. Question: President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? Mr. Putin (through an interpreter):  Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal. Russian aide (through an interpreter): I think there can be three questions from the Russian pool. Russia Today, you have the floor. Question (through an interpreter): Thank you so much. Good evening to everyone. My name is Ilya Petrenko, RT TV channel. (Now speaking in English.) Mr. President, would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the U.S. to work together with Russia in Syria, if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discussed? (Now through an interpreter): And my question to President Putin in Russian. Since we -- we brought up the issue of football several times, I ask -- use the football language. Mr. Pompeo mentioned that when we talk about the Syrian cooperation, the ball is in the Syrian court. Mr. Putin -- in the Russian court -- is it true? And how would you use this fact, the -- the -- having the ball? Mr. Trump: Well, I guess I'll answer the first part of the question. We've worked with Israel long and hard for many years, many decades. I think we've never -- never has anyone, any country been closer than we are. President Putin also is helping Israel. And we both spoke with Bibi Netanyahu, and they would like to do certain things with respect to Syria, having to do with the safety of Israel. So in that respect, we absolutely would like to work in order to help Israel. And Israel would be working with us. So both countries would work jointly. And I think that when you look at all of the progress that's been made in certain sections, with the eradication of ISIS, we're about 98 percent, 99 percent there. And other things that have taken place that we've done, and that, frankly, Russia has helped us with in certain respects. But I think that working with Israel is a great thing. And creating safety for Israel is something that both President Putin and I would like to see very much. One little thing I might add to that is the helping of people. Helping of people. Because you have such horrible -- if you see -- and I've seen reports, I've seen pictures, I've seen just about everything. And if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter, and -- on a humanitarian basis -- and that's what the word was, really, a humanitarian basis -- I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that. And we are. We will do that. O.K.? Thank you very much. Question: Excuse me, but for now, no specific agreements, for instance, between the militaries... Mr. Trump: Well, our militaries do get along. In fact, our militaries actually have gotten along probably better than our political leaders, for years. But our militaries do get along very well, and they do coordinate in Syria and other places. O.K.? Thank you. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Yes. We did mention this. We mentioned the humanitarian track of this issue. Yesterday, I discussed this with French President Mr. Macron. And we reached an agreement that, together with European countries including France, we will step up this effort. On our behalf, we provide military cargo aircraft to deliver the humanitarian cargo. And today, I brought up this issue with President Trump. I think there is plenty of things to -- to look into. The crucial thing here is that a huge amount of refugees are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in the states that border -- are adjacent to Syria. Mr. Putin: If we help -- help them, the migratory pressure upon the European states will drop -- will be decreased manyfold. And I believe it's crucial from any point of view, from humanitarian point of view, from the point of view of -- of helping people, helping the refugees and in general. I agree, I concur with President Trump, our military cooperate quite successfully together. They do get along and I hope they will be able to do so in future. And we will keep working in the Astana format -- I mean Russia, Turkey and Iran, which I informed President Trump about. But we do stand ready to link this effort through the so-called small group of states so that the process would be a broader one, it would be a multidimensional one, and so that we will be able to maximize our fighting chance to get the ultimate success in the issue of Syria. And speaking about the -- having the ball in our court in Syria, President Trump has just mentioned that we've successfully completed the World Football Cup. Speaking of the football actually, Mr. President, I'll give this ball to you and now the ball is in your court. All the more that the United States will host the World Cup in 2026. Mr. Trump: Thank you very much. We do host it and we hope we do as good a job. That's very nice. That will go to my son Barron. We have no question. In fact, Melania, here you go. (Laughter.) O.K. American aide: Final question from the United States will go to Jonathan Lemire from The A.P. Question: Thank you. A question for each president; President Trump, you first. Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. What -- who -- my first question for you, sir, is who do you believe? My second question is would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again? Mr. Trump: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the F.B.I. never took the server -- haven't they taken the server. Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that, I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server. But I have -- I have confidence in both parties. I -- I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the D.N.C.? Where are those servers? They're missing; where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton's e-mails? 33,000 e-mails gone -- just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn't be gone so easily. I think it's a disgrace that we can't get Hillary Clinton's 33,000 e-mails. Mr. Trump: So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer. O.K.? Thank you. Mr. Putin: Mr. President? Mr. Trump: Yes, please. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): I'd like to add something to this. After all, I was an intelligence officer myself, and I do know how dossiers are made up. Just a -- just a second. That's the first thing. Now the second thing: I believe that Russia is a democratic state, and I hope you are not denying this right to your own country, you're not denying that United States is a democracy. Do you believe United States is a democracy? And if so, if it is a democratic state, then the final conclusion in this kind of a dispute can only be delivered by a trial, by the court, not by the executive, by the law enforcement. For instance, the Concord company that was brought up is being accused, it's been accused of interference. But this company does not constitute the Russian state. It does not represent the Russian state. And I brought several examples before. Well, you have a lot of individuals in the United States -- take George Soros, for instance -- with multibillion in capital, but does it make him -- his position, his posture the posture of the United States? No, it does not. Well, it's the same case. There is the issue of trying a case in the court, and the final -- the -- the final say is for the court to deliver. We are now talking about the private -- the -- the individuals, not about particular states. And as far as the most recent allegation is concerned, about the Russian intelligence officers, we do have an intergovernmental treaty. Please do send us the request. We will analyze it properly, and we'll send a formal response. And as I said, we can extend this cooperation, but we should do it on a reciprocal basis, because we would await our Russian counterparts to provide us access to the persons of interest for us who -- who we believe can have something to do with the intelligence services. Let's discuss the specific issues, and not use the Russia and the U.S. relationship as a loose change -- the loose change for this internal political struggle. Question: A question for President -- for President Putin. Thank you. Two questions for you, sir. Can you tell me what President Trump may have indicated to you about officially recognizing Crimea as part of Russia? And then secondly, sir, do you, does the Russian government have any compromising material on President Trump or his family? (Laughter.) Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): President Trump and -- well, posture of President Trump on Crimea is well known, and he stands firmly by it. He continued to maintain that it was illegal to annex it. Our viewpoint is different. We held a referendum in strict compliance with the U.N. charter and the international legislation. For us, this issue -- we put paid to this issue. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): And now, to the compromising material. Yeah, I did hear these rumors that we allegedly collected compromising material on Mr. Trump when he was visiting Moscow. Well, distinguished colleague, let me tell you this: When President Trump was at Moscow back then, I didn't even know that he was in Moscow. I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow. Well, let's take St. Petersburg Economic Forum, for instance. There were over 500 American businessmen, high-ranking, high-level ones. I don't even remember the last names of each and every one of them. Well, do you remember -- do you think that we try to collect compromising material on each and every single one of them? Well, it's difficult to imagine an utter nonsense of a bigger scale than this. Well, please, just disregard these issues and don't think about this anymore again. Mr. Trump:  It would have been out long ago. And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of days -- and I was in Brussels watching it -- it was a disgrace to the F.B.I., it was a disgrace to our country, and you would say that was a total witch hunt. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.Related Articles  "
U.S. Intelligence Community Reacts With Fury to Trump's Rebuke,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump, in the words of a former C.I.A. director, Michael V. Hayden, appeared ""raw, naked and unfiltered."" John O. Brennan, another former spy chief, called the president's performance ""treasonous."" And Mark M. Lowenthal, a former C.I.A. assistant director and congressional intelligence official, said it was ""just beyond the pale."" Mr. Trump has frequently questioned the conclusions of his own spies that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election and has tried to do the same regarding potential Russian meddling in this year's midterms. But this time he did it standing next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has repeatedly denied that Russia made any effort to interfere in the vote -- a denial that American intelligence officials say is a nothing more than a hollow lie.  But not Mr. Trump. Asked Monday at his news conference in Helsinki whether he believed his own people or Mr. Putin, the American president appeared to come down on the side of the Russian leader. Mr. Putin was ""extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,"" Mr. Trump said. Then Mr. Trump seemed to throw his support behind a proposal from Mr. Putin for some kind of joint investigation into the 12 Russian intelligence officers indicted last week by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for their alleged role in hacking into Democratic Party servers and state election systems in 2016. ""What he did is an incredible offer,"" Mr. Trump said of his Russian counterpart. ""He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer. O.K.?"" Mr. Trump later appeared to try to walk back his comments in a tweet. But the tweet did little to mollify American intelligence officials past and present, especially related to Mr. Putin's offer to aid the Mueller investigation. ""The odds of that happening are a negative number,"" said Mr. Hayden, who ran the C.I.A. and National Security Agency under President George W. Bush. He expected the idea to go the way of the ""impenetrable Cyber Security unit"" Mr. Trump said he discussed when he met with Mr. Putinin July 2017. ""It's not going to happen,"" he said, noting that even with the British and Australians -- arguably America's two closest allies -- ""we're a little private with our stuff."" The reason, current and former intelligence officials said, was simple: Inviting in the Russians would result in sharing what is known in the intelligence world as sources and methods. Far more than the information spies collect, it is the sources of that information and the methods through which it is gathered that intelligence agencies consider their most closely guarded secrets. Intelligence officials even hesitate when sharing such information with members of congressional oversight committees. Giving Russian intelligence operatives a chance to figure who inside their government is aiding American spies or how the United States was listening in on conversations between Russian officials was unimaginable, they said. Mr. Hayden said the president's ""departure point for speech and thought is not objective reality."" ""He was probably thinking that he was getting out of a very uncomfortable question,"" Mr. Hayden added. Mr. Trump did not get out of answering a question. If anything, he deepened the mistrust many inside America's spies agencies have of their president. The remarks prompted a rare public response from Mr. Trump's own director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who said in a statement, ""We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy."" Two American officials said the White House did not approve his statement. Few other currently serving intelligence officials were willing to speak publicly about Mr. Trump's remarks -- intelligence officials are, after all, expected to work for any president no matter their politics and, in any case, most work in offices where they cannot easily speak with reporters or any outsiders. Those that would talk spoke only on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their careers. But all were unanimous in saying that they and their colleagues were aghast at how Mr. Trump had handled himself with Mr. Putin. One official summed up what appeared to be the consensus view, saying that it was clear whose side Mr. Trump was on, and ""it isn't ours."" Mr. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, was far more blunt in an assessment delivered via the president's favorite medium, Twitter. Mr. Lowenthal, who served as an intelligence official in Congress and at the White House under Republicans, said he had never seen a president so openly break with his own spy agencies. He rattled off a list of times that presidents publicly split with their intelligence chiefs: President John F. Kennedy fired his C.I.A. director after the Bay of Pigs disaster. President Richard M. Nixon dismissed the agency's chief for refusing to help cover-up the Watergate break in. And President Bill Clinton's director quit, complaining that he had no real access to the Oval Office. But Mr. Trump's performance on Monday was ""just beyond the pale,"" Mr. Lowenthal said. ""He's the best president that Russia's ever had,"" Mr. Lowenthal added.

Democratic Party Says It Thwarted Attempted Hack of Voter Database,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Update: The suspected hack of the Democratic National Committee's voter database was a false alarm, D.N.C. officials said on Thursday, and the unusual activity that raised concern was merely a test. The updated article is here. The Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that it was alerted to an attempted hack of its voter database this week and that it had notified law enforcement. The effort to target the Democratic Party's voter file, known as Votebuilder, was not successful, and a party official said the identities of the culprits were unclear. When the Democratic National Committee was hacked in 2016 during the presidential campaign, the incident was traced to Russia. This week's attempt was aggressive, two officials briefed on it said. The hackers set up a fake page that mimicked the party's login page for its voter-registration website, a tactic that could gather names, passwords and other credentials of those using the voter database. The hackers also may have sent emails to people within the national committee to try to trick them into using the fake page, a tactic known as ""spearphishing,"" the officials said.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident, one of the officials said. ""This attempt is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections, and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks,"" said Bob Lord, chief security officer for the Democratic National Committee. He called the voter file ""the party's most sensitive information."" The combination of this attack on the committee, continued influence operations by Russia and others using social media, and efforts to breach think tanks underscores that the cyber age has changed elections forever. So many systems are vulnerable to manipulation, from the voter-registration systems in the 50 states to the inner workings of the parties, that the opportunities for foreign and domestic manipulation are many. ""The focus has gone from using the cyber realm to steal secrets to using it to impose national power,"" Rob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator until the position was eliminated a few months ago, said this month at Defcon, an annual convention that focuses on hacking and defenses against it. Ahead of the midterms, political groups and government organizations have been on high alert for new hacks and foreign meddling. Microsoft said this week that it had detected that hackers tied to Russian intelligence targeted the Senate and conservative think tanks in the United States, also by creating fake websites. And after Facebook last month identified a political influence campaign aimed at potentially disrupting the midterms, the company said this week that it had uncovered other disinformation efforts targeting people around the world. On Sunday, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the November elections. ""I can say definitively that it's a sufficient national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling and North Korean meddling that we're taking steps to try and prevent it,"" Mr. Bolton said in an interview with ABC. Many of the hacking attempts are mimicking the techniques that were used to penetrate the Democratic National Committee in 2016. At the time, Russian state-backed hackers used trick emails to take senior party officials, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, to a page that looked identical to a password screen for Google's email service, Gmail. In fact, the page gave attackers access to the officials' accounts. Many of the warnings the national committee received several years ago about potential attacks either were ignored or did not reach the right individuals. Since then, the committee has taken steps to improve its cybersecurity. This year, it hired Mr. Lord, who previously held top technology roles at Yahoo and Twitter, and Raffi Krikorian, a former Uber executive, as its chief technology officer. The party's team has put new security practices into place and begun testing employees in spearphishing drills to see if they will click on the malicious emails. The national committee has also improved its cooperation with the F.B.I., according to law enforcement officials. The Votebuilder database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and files. A successful penetration of the database could have set off other hacks in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said. A cybersecurity researcher from a firm called Lookout contacted the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday about the attempted intrusion, the two officials briefed on the matter said. Lookout confirmed that it had been in touch with the committee, and the attempt was also detected by DigitalOcean, a cloud service provider. CNN earlier reported the new hacking attempt. Lookout first detected the fake website late Monday, using a newly built artificial intelligence system that spots fake sites as they are created, said Mike Murray, the company's vice president of security intelligence. ""We realized the significance,"" he said. ""Within hours, we started waking up people to get them on the phone."" Because the website was caught so quickly, it is impossible to know who the hackers were or how they planned to use the site, Mr. Murray said. Such attacks are easy, he said, because anyone with decent programming skills can make a fake website in a few hours. ""The adversaries are becoming more sophisticated in how they use these websites, but the attack is the same,"" he said. Mr. Lord said the White House also needed to get involved to improve cyberdefenses. ""These threats are serious, and that's why it's critical that we all work together, but we can't do this alone,"" he said. ""We need the administration to take more aggressive steps to protect our voting systems."" The attempted hack was revealed as the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity division hailed its efforts to protect the nation's election systems from foreign intrusions. During a tour of the agency's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center near Washington on Wednesday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Christopher C. Krebs, her top deputy for cybersecurity, said the department was more prepared than it had been during the 2016 elections. ""We are better positioned than at any time in history,"" Ms. Nielsen said, standing before a bank of computers and giant monitors showing real-time threats to the nation's cyber and physical infrastructure.

Is a New Russian Meddling Tactic Hiding in Plain Sight?,"To an untrained eye, USAReally might look like any other fledgling news organization vying for attention in a crowded media landscape. Its website publishes a steady stream of stories on hot-button political issues like race, immigration and income inequality. It has reader polls, a video section and a daily podcast. But this is no ordinary media start-up. USAReally is based in Moscow and has received funding from the Federal News Agency, a Russian media conglomerate with ties to the Internet Research Agency, the ""troll farm"" whose employees were indicted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Caught flat-footed by the influence campaigns of 2016, intelligence agencies and tech companies in the United States have spent months looking for hidden Russian footprints ahead of the midterm elections.  USAReally's website, which began publishing in May, does not advertise its Russian roots. But in many ways, it is operating in plain sight. Its founder, Alexander Malkevich, is a Russian journalist with little previous experience in American media. Its domain was registered through a Russian company, and its formation was announced in a news release on the Federal News Agency's website. The project, originally known as ""USAReally, Wake Up Americans,"" was intended to promote ""information and problems that are hushed up by major American publications controlled by the political elite of the United States,"" according to the release. Today, USAReally's website depicts the United States as a democracy in decline, riddled with crime and divided by partisan rancor. Many of the site's stories are similar to the divisive content that Russian trolls circulated on social media in 2016, down to their conspiratorial tone and telltale grammatical errors. (""Rabid Squirrels Is Terrorizing Florida,"" read one headline.) Some of its articles appear to have been lifted word for word from legitimate American news websites. The amateurish appearance of USAReally has led some critics to assume that it is either a bizarre vanity project or a decoy meant to attract attention away from more covert Russian campaigns happening elsewhere. But some cybersecurity experts believe the website may be a part of a retooled Russian propaganda operation that is experimenting with new tactics ahead of November's midterm elections, and testing the boundaries of what American social media companies will allow. ""It's a very overt operation,"" said Lee Foster, an intelligence analysis manager with the cybersecurity firm FireEye. ""Perhaps it's an attempt to move this type of activity more into the mainstream, to try to legitimize it as a media entity so that it's tougher to take action against it."" [If you see disinformation before the midterms, we want to hear from you. Here is how to submit a tip.] Last month, in a two-hour interview while traveling in New York, Mr. Malkevich, USAReally's founder, explained his vision. Red-bearded and combative, Mr. Malkevich wore a T-shirt printed with an image of cartoon spies, accompanied by a Russian sentence that translates as ""the motherland is listening."" Accompanied by a translator but mostly speaking in his own heavily accented English, he peppered his speech with American political catchphrases like ""fake news"" and ""witch hunt,"" and he denied that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election, calling it a paranoid conspiracy theory. ""I cannot imagine how several people from Russia or from Australia or from Japan can change the electoral situation in the United States,"" he said. ""Why do some representatives of a deep state think that Americans are so foolish?"" Mr. Malkevich acknowledged that he had received funding and other support from the Federal News Agency. Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, a wealthy Russian businessman who has been nicknamed Putin's Chef because of his close ties to the Russian president, is believed to oversee the news agency. Mr. Prigozhin faces criminal charges stemming from the Mueller investigation, and he and several associates have been placed under sanctions that forbid them from entering the country. But Mr. Malkevich, who said he had several types of visas that allowed him to enter the United States, denied any connection to the Internet Research Agency. He quoted a Russian proverb -- translated roughly as ""the son is not responsible for his father"" -- to distance himself from the group's 2016 trolling campaigns. ""I don't know anybody from so-called troll farms,"" he said. A video interview posted to YouTube in June provided a glimpse of Mr. Malkevich in USAReally's office in Moscow, which featured a large portrait of President Trump and two flags on the wall -- one American, one Confederate. Behind Mr. Malkevich was a Russian-language map of the United States, in which states were labeled with topics such as ""crime,"" ""poverty,"" and ""Second Amendment (mass-shooting)."" Mr. Malkevich characterized the map as ""normal,"" and said it helped the site's editors focus their work on different states. Spokeswomen from the Justice Department and F.B.I. declined to comment on USAReally. Mr. Malkevich said he aimed to turn USAReally into a kind of digital-first version of RT or Sputnik -- both Russian media organizations that broadcast pro-Kremlin views inside the United States -- and a counterweight to organizations funded by the United States, like Radio Free Europe, that broadcast in Russia and other countries. A 2017 American intelligence report concluded that both RT and Sputnik were part of ""Russia's state-run propaganda machine."" But they have been allowed to remain on Facebook and Twitter, because government-funded media is generally allowed on those platforms as long as it is created by authentic users and doesn't violate the sites' content guidelines. USAReally, by contrast, was quickly banned by both Facebook and Twitter, although it recently opened a second Facebook page. A Twitter spokesman said that USAReally's account was suspended for violating the site's rules against spam. A Facebook spokesman said the company had enough evidence that the first page was involved in coordinated inauthentic activity to take action against it. He said the group's second page was being investigated, and that the company had been aware of the account before being contacted by The New York Times. Despite Mr. Malkevich's claims, there are hints that USAReally may be drawing from the Internet Research Agency's playbook, in addition to adopting the more open tactics of RT and Sputnik. Last week, users on the popular message board Redditcomplained that links to USAReally stories were being posted on the site's largest pro-Trump forum, r/the_donald. The links were disguised, appearing to belong to websites like geotus.army and geotus.band. But when users clicked on the links, they were redirected to stories on USAReally's website. (G.E.O.T.U.S., or ""God Emperor of the United States,"" is a nickname for President Trump popularized by users of r/the_donald.) Reddit banned USAReally, geotus.army and geotus.band, along with a separate Russian-linked website called Brutalist.press. A Reddit spokeswoman said that the company had taken action against the domains for breaking the company's policies, which prohibit manipulative behavior. In a text message, Mr. Malkevich called the Reddit ban ""just another illustration of censorship in America."" He said he had never heard of the G.E.O.T.U.S. domains, and that USAReally had no need to post its stories to Reddit, given the small amount of traffic it received from the site. Without a presence on major social media networks, it has been difficult for USAReally to build an audience. Mr. Malkevich said USAReally's website typically receives 5,000 to 10,000 visitors a day, a pittance compared to more established news sites, although several recent posts have received thousands of views apiece. Mr. Malkevich, 43, was born in Leningrad, now called St. Petersburg, and has had a career trajectory similar to other successful post-Soviet media managers. He started in music journalism, spent time in political public relations, then ran a television station in Omsk, Siberia. Recently, he has positioned himself as a champion of freedom of speech. In a column on the Federal News Agency's website, he wrote that American social media networks were guilty of ""selective censorship that Orwell did not dream of."" Mr. Malkevich's fumbling misadventures in American media have, at times, made him seem more like a Sacha Baron Cohen character than a sinister propagandist. In June, he planned a rally outside the White House, but canceled the event, he said, after failing to obtain the proper permit. He scheduled a round-table discussion about fake news inside a WeWork office in Washington, but his membership was abruptly terminated. An NBC News story about Mr. Malkevich carried the headline, ""This man is running Russia's newest propaganda effort in the U.S. -- or at least he's trying to."" ""I'm an easy victim for American media,"" Mr. Malkevich said. ""You can showcase this Russian journalist -- he wants to destroy our democracy with his bad English. But I don't want to destroy. I want to build."" USAReally has a full-time staff of 15 in Moscow, according to Mr. Malkevich, and a handful of American writers who contribute to the site. One of those writers, Jeffrey K. Silverman, said in a phone interview that USAReally's Russian origins weren't a concern. He had previously written for other pro-Kremlin sites, and when he learned that USAReally was looking for American writers, he volunteered. The site paid him $50 to $100 for each of his articles, he said, and didn't instruct him to cover particular subjects or parrot a party line. ""Whenever I write for anything Russian, they don't censor me,"" Mr. Silverman said. ""If I write for American publications, I get censored."" Unlike the Russian trolls of 2016, who posed as Black Lives Matter activists, pro-gun Republicans and other American groups, many of USAReally's writers use their real names. Several of them also write for a variety of other pro-Kremlin media outlets and think tanks. ""There's a wide-ranging collection of Russian propaganda sites online that are connected,"" said Renee DiResta, the head of research at New Knowledge, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in disinformation networks. ""USAReally has drawn from many of them to create a site that appears to be using the less-academic style of I.R.A. content to reach a much broader American audience."" When not recruiting writers, Mr. Malkevich has been busy touring America, conducting interviews and posting dispatches to a group of supporters on the messaging app Telegram. In New York, he posed for a photo in front of Trump Tower, then stopped at a bookstore, where he filled a shelf with books about Russian collusion, took a photo and posted it to his followers, mocking what he sees as a conspiracy-obsessed American public. With a smirk, Mr. Malkevich said that despite the bleak vision of America that his website paints, he was not interested in sowing discord and division. ""I am interested in cooperation and friendship between our two great countries,"" he said. Graphic by Keith Collins. Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow.

"Consulting Firms Keep Lucrative Saudi Alliance, Shaping Crown Prince's Vision","As Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia charmed Goldman Sachs bankers and Silicon Valley executives on an American tour this spring, some of his most trusted lieutenants were taking care of business in Washington. In a low-key ceremony two blocks from the White House, Saudi officials signed an agreement with Booz Allen Hamilton, the American consulting company, to help train the kingdom's growing ranks of cyberfighters. The agreement would ""open great horizons"" by improving the skills of the kingdom's cybersecurity experts, Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to the crown prince overseeing the deal, said in Saudi Arabia in a statement to the official press. It did not mention his continuing campaign to silence critics both inside the kingdom and online. Mr. Qahtani was fired last month after Saudi officials linked him to the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying he had contributed to an aggressive environment that helped lead to the killing. But while Mr. Khashoggi's death prompted investors from around the globe to distance themselves from the Saudi government, Booz Allen and its competitors McKinsey &amp; Company and Boston Consulting Group have stayed close after playing critical roles in Prince Mohammed's drive to consolidate power.  In addition to standard consulting work like doling out economic advice and helping burnish Prince Mohammed's image, they have taken on more unconventional assignments. Booz Allen trains the Saudi Navy as it runs a blockade in the war in Yemen, a disaster that has threatened millions with starvation. McKinsey produced a report that may have aided Mr. Qahtani's crackdown on dissidents. BCG advises Prince Mohammed's foundation. The work is lucrative -- the three firms have earned hundreds of millions of dollars altogether on projects in Saudi Arabia. McKinsey's work in the kingdom grew from two Saudi projects in 2010 to almost 50 the following year and kept accelerating, to almost 600 projects from 2011 to 2016. McKinsey consultants spread across the kingdom in recent years to advise government agencies such as the planning ministry, nicknamed the ""Ministry of McKinsey"" by some Saudis; the royal court; and a coterie of companies in industries such as banking, media, telecommunications, real estate and energy, internal McKinsey documents viewed by The New York Times showed. Last year, McKinsey bought a politically connected Saudi consultancy, adding that firm's 140 employees to more than 300 already in the region. Its report singling out the kingdom's prominent online critics drew widespread condemnation when The Times revealed it last month. The dissidents -- including Khalid al-Alkami, a writer critical of Saudi policies, and Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi now living in Canada -- were described in detail, alongside photos of them. ""Omar has a multitude of negative tweets on topics such as austerity and the royal decrees,"" the author, who McKinsey says is a researcher based in Saudi Arabia, wrote in bullet points. Mr. Alkami ""wrote multiple negative tweets regarding austerity."" Though McKinsey said the report was prepared for an internal audience, Mr. Alkami was subsequently arrested, and Mr. Abdulaziz said two of his brothers were imprisoned. A third, pseudonymous account was shut down, and it remains unclear what happened to the person behind it. The crackdown was an early sign of the Saudi government's extreme measures to quash criticism, which culminated in Mr. Khashoggi's murder. McKinsey said it was ""horrified"" at the possibility that its information could have been misused. In a note to former employees, McKinsey said the researcher had published the analysis in January 2017 on an internal system and that it was intended only to ""showcase techniques to gauge social media usage and reaction."" Even before Prince Mohammed rose up the royal hierarchy, McKinsey and BCG nurtured ties to him. BCG's top Middle East executive, Joerg Hildebrandt, cultivated a relationship with Prince Mohammed in recent years, according to two consultants who have worked in the region. Mr. Hildebrandt, through a spokesman, declined to comment. After Prince Mohammed was installed as defense minister in 2015, BCG landed a contract to help overhaul the ministry's procurement systems and improve its handling of finances and personnel, two people familiar with the contract said. Press officers for the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to emails seeking comment. In February 2016, consultants for McKinsey and BCG escorted five emissaries from the Saudi royal court to make the rounds of think tanks in Washington. They informed Gulf experts about Mohammed bin Salman's grand goals to remake Saudi life while the consultants, who outnumbered the Saudis, quietly took notes. BCG has been deeply enmeshed in laying out the economic blueprint of the country, called Vision 2030, which aims to wean Saudi Arabia from its dependency on oil revenues. A McKinsey report in 2015 laid out the broad strokes of that plan. Asked by The Economist in 2016 about a $4 trillion estimate of needed investment to transform the kingdom's economy, the prince immediately recognized the figure. ""This is a report from McKinsey, not from the Saudi government,"" he replied, adding that McKinsey ""participates with us in many studies."" Last month's Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, a conclave championed by Prince Mohammed, underscored Saudi Arabia's importance to the consulting firms. While executives, companies and journalists pulled out amid the global furor over Mr. Khashoggi's murder, they stayed on. McKinsey led panels on money and energy, the event program showed. Boston Consulting Group focused on unspecified ""intelligence."" In a statement, BCG said it focused in Saudi Arabia on work that could ""positively contribute to economic and societal transformation"" and that the company has turned down work that goes against that principle. The firm declines projects that involve military or intelligence strategy, a spokesman said. For years, Booz Allen has trained the Saudi Navy, part of an American government program to help allied militaries. The company has worked with the navy on operations, intelligence and electronic warfare, as well as logistics and financial management, it said in 2012. The contract ended last year, a spokesman said. Dozens of American military veterans work for Booz Allen in Saudi Arabia. One retired rear admiral with combat experience in the region advises top Saudi officers on military planning. Others have extensive shipboard experience that could be used to train Saudis on how to carry out blockades and how to operate equipment like electronic warfare gear that can detect and interfere with enemy radars and missiles. A spokesman for Booz Allen said the firm's work with the Saudis did not include training on blockades or electronic warfare equipment. The spokesman said such work was out of the parameters of its United States government license covering the company's work with the Saudis. Booz Allen also advises the Saudi Army; it won a contract to help with logistics, including maintaining the Saudis' Abrams tanks. In a statement, Booz Allen said that it had provided no support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, and that the company coordinates with the American government to ensure that its work ""is consistent with U.S. foreign policy and trade regulations."" The firm did not address whether the troops and sailors it trains participate in the Saudi blockade in Yemen. The United States military has provided limited but significant aid to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, including refueling aircraft, sharing intelligence and sending Army commandos to the Saudi-Yemeni border to locate and destroy caches of ballistic missiles that Iran-backed Houthi rebels have used to attack Saudi cities. Booz Allen did advise the Saudi government on a plan to provide humanitarian aid to Yemen. But the project, the Yemen Comprehensive Humanitarian Operations, is seen by aid groups as an ineffective effort that undercuts the United Nations' own program. ""We have had no control over how the plan or portions of it may have been used,"" the company said. Booz Allen's role was first reported by IRIN, a humanitarian news agency. After signing the agreement in March to help shore up Saudi cybersecurity, Booz Allen began working directly to protect the systems of government ministries, citing ""damaging cyberattacks in companies in the kingdom."" It also ran a so-called hack-a-thon -- the kind of event the company has done in the United States to teach people how to penetrate computer systems to discover their vulnerabilities. Booz Allen denied that its work with the Saudis involved hacks ""or the use of cyber for offensive purposes."" But cyberexperts say that the same defensive maneuvers used to discover vulnerabilities or otherwise protect computer networks can easily be redirected to target other governments or dissidents as well. As for McKinsey, its work with Saudi Arabia is controversial even within the firm. Amid the Arab Spring, its consultants in the region argued that the firm should consider curtailing business in Saudi Arabia, said one former McKinsey consultant who worked in the Middle East. But more senior consultants, including partners, said McKinsey was not in the business of passing judgment on its clients' cultures and values. The best way to improve the kingdom, they argued, was to modernize the economy and make government and companies work better. Rather than scaling back in Saudi Arabia, McKinsey doubled down. Many foreign consultants working in Saudi Arabia fail to understand the local culture or how an authoritarian government could exploit their work, said one consultant who has worked with the higher reaches of the Saudi government. He qualified that by saying that his colleagues take care to try not to cause harm. In a statement, a McKinsey spokesman said, ""We are proud of our record in Saudi Arabia,"" citing job creation and improved health outcomes. Consultants who aim to help authoritarian governments from the inside often give in to a desire to preserve their lucrative assignments, said Calvert W. Jones, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies the role of consultants in the Middle East. ""They soft-pedal,"" she said. ""Their fear is if they speak truth to power at this state of their interactions, they will be tossed out."" The surge in business for BCG, McKinsey and Booz Allen also stems from Prince Mohammed's need for expertise as he pushes his proposals to revamp the country. His dependence on consultants is so great that some of the companies have people embedded at the royal court to respond quickly to requests, according to three consultants who have done work for the kingdom. Some reported being asked to turn around proposals in 24 hours, much faster than they often work. And the crown prince will sometimes ask different companies for proposals, then have their consultants pitch to each other as he looks on, the consultants said. ""It's like a beauty pageant,"" said one. Many of the consultants, who spend five days a week in Riyadh before flying elsewhere to see their families on weekends, were annoyed last year when the government kicked them out of their preferred hotel, the Ritz-Carlton, to use it as a temporary lockup for those accused of corruption. But not long after the government released those held, the consultants moved back in. Katie Benner contributed reporting.

Minister in Charge of Japan's Cybersecurity Says He Has Never Used a Computer,"HONG KONG -- A lot of people don't use computers. Most of them aren't in charge of a nation's cybersecurity. But one is. Japanese lawmakers were aghast on Wednesday when Yoshitaka Sakurada, 68, the minister who heads the government's cybersecurity office, said during questioning in Parliament that he had no need for the devices, and appeared confused when asked basic technology questions.  ""I have been independently running my own business since I was 25 years old,"" he said. When computer use is necessary, he said, ""I order my employees or secretaries"" to do it. ""I don't type on a computer,"" he added. Asked by a lawmaker if nuclear power plants allowed the use of USB drives, a common technology widely considered to be a security risk, Mr. Sakurada did not seem to understand what they were. ""I don't know details well,"" he said. ""So how about having an expert answer your question if necessary, how's that?"" The comments were immediately criticized. ""I can't believe that a person who never used a computer is in charge of cybersecurity measures,"" said Masato Imai, an opposition lawmaker. Even before his admission on Wednesday, Mr. Sakurada, who is also overseeing the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, had occasionally attracted media coverage for head-scratching public comments. A week before his comments on cybersecurity, The Asahi Shimbun wrote that he showed a ""knack for giving baffling replies."" His responses to questions about Olympic preparations ""showed a stunning lack of understanding of basic issues concerning the event,"" the newspaper wrote. He fumbled questions about how much the event would cost and whether North Korean officials would be attending, frequently turning to his aides for help, according to the newspaper. He said he had stumbled because he did not know the questions ahead of time. In 2016, he apologized after saying that so-called comfort women -- Koreans who were abducted and forced to become sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II -- were ""prostitutes by occupation"" and that people had been ""heavily misled by propaganda work treating them as if they were victims."" His comments came a month after Japan and South Korea had officially settled a long-simmering dispute about reparations for the women, which remains a sore spot in relations between the two countries. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, gave Mr. Sakurada oversight of cybersecurity and the Olympics and Paralympics last month in a cabinet shake-up. Hisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.

A Plan to Turn New York Into a Capital of Cybersecurity,"A new partnership among two prominent Israeli venture capital funds, a handful of major private-sector companies and the city's economic growth development enterprise is hoping to turn New York City into the nation's leading center for yet one more major industry: cybersecurity. Cyber NYC, as the project is called, is among the nation's most ambitious cybersecurity initiatives, which over the next decade could transform New York City into a global leader of cybersecurity innovation and job creation. The multiyear project would simultaneously create a Global Cyber Center in Chelsea, a cybersecurity innovation hub in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan and an academic cybepartnership with area colleges, such as Columbia University, New York University and City University of New York. At the same time, major corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Mastercard and PricewaterhouseCoopers also are participating in advisory roles or to assist with the project's training and hiring. ""We are at a seminal moment in the trajectory of the cybersecurity industry,"" said James Patchett, president and chief executive of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is spearheading the Cyber NYC initiative, including assembling and leading public-private partnerships and developing and overseeing six programs to grow New York's cyberindustry and expand the work force.  ""Making New York City the epicenter of cybersecurity makes complete sense because New York City is where all the customers are,"" Mr. Patchett said. Cyber NYC will initially be funded by about $70 million in private investments, including from the two Israeli firms: Jerusalem Venture Partners, a venture capital fund; and SOSA, a corporate innovation specialist, among others Another $30 million is coming from the city. Its goal: to create 10,000 local cybersecurity jobs over the next decade as part of Mayor de Blasio's New York Works Plan. Two new cybersecurity centers in separate locations will work in tandem to anchor this project. In SoHo, a 50,000-square-foot cybersecurity investment hub will support cybersecurity start-ups in New York City. In Chelsea, the 15,000-square-foot Global Cyber Center will bring together investors, corporations and start-ups and serve as a virtual testing ground to run simulations. Both are expected to be completed before the end of 2019. According to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, cybersecurity already is a $1 billion-plus industry in New York, with more than 100 companies and 6,000 employees as of 2017. Those numbers are expected to grow as the city continues to attract new technology-related companies. The highest-profile is Amazon, which selected New York's Long Island City as one of its East Coast headquarters. ""We're the logical place for this to be located,"" Mr. Patchett said. The real driver behind a project like Cyber NYC is the nation's urgent need for improved cybersecurity at all levels of corporate and government operations. Nearly 60 million Americans have been affected by identity theft, according to a 2018 online survey by The Harris Poll, an increase from 15 million in 2017. Cybersecurity attacks have become so common that experts worry about the onset of ""cyberfatigue"" as consumers begun to shrug off their impact. A corporate cyberattack takes place every 40 seconds via ransomware across the globe, reported Cybersecurity Ventures, a research specialist in the global cybereconomy. That figure is expected to be every 14 seconds by next year. Cybercrimes, Cybersecurity Ventures also noted, are predicted to cause $6 trillion in damages by 2021, an increase from $3 trillion in 2015. Despite the clear need for cybersecurity upgrades and improvements, not everyone is convinced that a project like Cyber NYC is the right solution. ""This sounds like a huge marketing pitch,"" said Bruce Schneier, a cybersecurity expertwho has written 13 books on the topic. ""I've worked in this field forever, and I've never even heard the term cybersecurity hub."" Such skepticism doesn't really bother Erel Margalit, founder and chairman of Jerusalem Venture Partners, which is overseeing the creation of the cybersecurity investment hub in SoHo. ""Come and see what we already have done in Israel,"" Mr. Margalit said, in response to Mr. Schneier's skepticism. Jerusalem Venture Partners has raised over $1.3 billion to create and finance more than 130 companies -- more than one-third of them in cybersecurity, including CyberArk, which is one of Israel's largest cybersecurity companies (Israel is second to the U.S. in terms of overall investment in cybersecurity firms). ""If someone wants to call this a marketing ploy, O.K. The storytelling part is important. When you tell people a story, they listen."" Mr. Margalit, who as a former member of Israel's legislative body, the Knesset, led its cybersecurity task force. Mr. Margalit earned his Ph.D. at Columbia and was living in New York City during 9/11. He says that his company will oversee much of the business end of the venture. ""Most innovation occurs when the two disciplines meet: investors and cybersecurity experts,"" he said. Equally invested in Cyber NYC's success is Uzi Scheffer, chief executive of SOSA, which has offices in Tel Aviv and New York. The company mostly focuses on protecting major financial companies from cyberattacks. While SOSA already has been operating out of another New York location for about 18 months, it is building the Global Cyber Center in Chelsea and plans to move into it in 2019. ""The Global Cyber Center will expose New York's largest players to the best cybersecurity solutions out there,"" said Mr. Scheffer. Mr. Scheffer said a global cybersecurity hub doesn't really exist anywhere yet. ""It's about seizing the opportunity rather than taking it away from someone else,"" said Scheffer, whose firm, like Jerusalem Venture Partners, secured its partnership with Cyber NYC through a competitive bidding process. There's also a serious academic element to the overall cybersecurity partnership, which involves the participation of virtually every major academic institution in New York City. ""Whether or not this leads to New York becoming the single, cybersecurity hub of the world is a story that will be played out over the next 15 years,"" said Orin Herskowitz, senior vice president of Intellectual Property and Tech Transfer for Columbia University. In the meantime, he says, the combined efforts will train and link local university students with substantive cybersecurity jobs in NYC. ""There is a real chance this will become a catalytic event,"" Mr. Herskowitz said. There's even a so-called Cybersecurity Boot Camp planned, where the city's Fullstack Academy and CUNY LaGuardia Community College plan to educate and place more than 1,000 students in high-paying cybersecurity jobs over the first three years of the program. Program development for the boot camp has begun with the first session scheduled to take place in spring 2019. Until now, all of the major cybersecurity stakeholders in New York City have been physically and operationally separated, said Satish Rao, associate director of physical sciences licensing at Columbia, who helps to support cybersecurity start-ups. But with Cyber NYC, he said, ""a coalition of stakeholders is coming together."" One such stakeholder is Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, an Israeli financial cybersecurity specialty company, which opened a temporary New York office at another location 18 months ago, but will be ultimately be housed in the SoHo building early next year. ThetaRay will start with about 15 to 20 employees at the location, but plans to have more than 100 within several years, Gazit said. ""Few people come to a bank branch and use a gun to steal money,"" he said. Today, the thief is far more likely to be behind a server in some remote country, stealing money without any physical access to the bank, he says. His company, which aims to prevent the spread of this cybercrime, works with such clients as General Electric. To be a cybercriminal is the highest-paying, low-risk job in the world, Mr. Gazit said. ""Nobody knows who you are, and you can disappear without a trace,"" he says. His and other cybersecurity companies hope to make New York City the center of halting cybercrime. There is no better location than New York, said Mr. Gazit, because New York is where the talent is and where the financial giants are headquartered. ""At the end of the day,"" Mr. Gazit said, ""we have to make sure the good guys win. "" PHOTO: On the corner of Broadway and Grand Street in SoHo, Jerusalem Venture Partners is converting a cast-iron building into a cybersecurity innovation hub.

Russian 2016 Influence Operation Targeted African-Americans on Social Media,"The Russian influence campaign on social media in the 2016 election made an extraordinary effort to target African-Americans, used an array of tactics to try to suppress turnout among Democratic voters and unleashed a blizzard of activity on Instagram that rivaled or exceeded its posts on Facebook, according to a report produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee. The report adds new details to the portrait that has emerged over the last two years of the energy and imagination of the Russian effort to sway American opinion and divide the country, which the authors said continues to this day. ""Active and ongoing interference operations remain on several platforms,"" says the report, produced by New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company based in Austin, Tex., along with researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research LLC. One continuing Russian campaign, for instance, seeks to influence opinion on Syria by promoting Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president and a Russian ally in the brutal conflict there.  The New Knowledge report is one of two commissioned by the Senate committee on a bipartisan basis. They are based largely on data about the Russian operations provided to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and the other companies whose platforms were used. [Read the New Knowledge report here.] The second report was written by the Computational Propaganda Project at Oxford University along with Graphika, a company that specializes in analyzing social media. The Washington Post first reported on the Oxford report on Sunday. [Read the Oxford report here.] The Russian influence campaign in 2016 was run by a St. Petersburg company called the Internet Research Agency, owned by a businessman, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who is a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Prigozhin and a dozen of the company's employees were indicted last February as part of the investigation of Russian interference by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. Both reports stress that the Internet Research Agency created social media accounts under fake names on virtually every available platform. A major goal was to support Donald J. Trump, first against his Republican rivals in the presidential race, then in the general election, and as president since his inauguration. Among the services the Russians have provided Mr. Trump is to join in and amplify his regular attacks on Mr. Mueller. Posing as fed-up Americans, the Internet Research Agency trolls have denounced the investigation of Russian election interference as a ""weird conspiracy"" pushed only by ""liberal crybabies,"" the New Knowledge report says. One Facebook page, called ""'Merican Fury,"" declared falsely that Mr. Mueller ""worked with radical Islamic groups."" Another, ""Back the Badge,"" called James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, ""a dirty cop."" Creating accounts designed to pass as belonging to Americans, the Internet Research Agency spread its messages not only via Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which have drawn the most attention, but also on YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest, Vine and Google+, among other platforms. Its attack on the United States used almost exclusively high-tech tools created by American companies. The New Knowledge researchers discovered many examples of the Russian operators building an audience with one theme and then shifting to another, often more provocative, set of messages. For instance, an Instagram account called @army_of_jesus_ first posted in January 2015 images from ""The Muppet Show,"" then shifted to ""The Simpsons"" and by early 2016 became Jesus-focused. Multiple memes associated Jesus with Mr. Trump's campaign and Satan with that of his rival, Hillary Clinton. [See the Russians' most popular posts and memes.] The Russian campaign was the subject of Senate hearings last year and has been widely scrutinized by academic experts. The new reports largely confirm earlier findings: that the campaign was designed to attack Mrs. Clinton, boost Mr. Trump and exacerbate existing divisions in American society. But the New Knowledge report gives particular attention to the Russians' focus on African-Americans, which is evident to anyone who examines collections of their memes and messages. ""The most prolific I.R.A. efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities and appear to have been focused on developing black audiences and recruiting black Americans as assets,"" the report says. Using Gmail accounts with American-sounding names, the Russians recruited and sometimes paid unwitting American activists of all races to stage rallies and spread content, but there was a disproportionate pursuit of African-Americans, it concludes. The report says that while ""other distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts, the black community was targeted extensively with dozens."" In some cases, Facebook ads were targeted at users who had shown interest in particular topics, including black history, the Black Panther Party and Malcolm X. The most popular of the Russian Instagram accounts was @blackstagram, with 303,663 followers. The Internet Research Agency also created a dozen websites disguised as African-American in origin, with names like blackmattersus.com, blacktivist.info, blacktolive.org and blacksoul.us. On YouTube, the largest share of Russian material covered the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality, with channels called ""Don't Shoot"" and ""BlackToLive."" The report does not seek to explain the heavy focus on African-Americans. But the Internet Research Agency's tactics echo Soviet propaganda efforts from decades ago that often highlighted racism and racial conflict in the United States, as well as recent Russian influence operations in other countries that sought to stir ethnic strife. Renee DiResta, one of the report's authors and director of research at New Knowledge, said the Internet Research Agency ""leveraged pre-existing, legitimate grievances wherever they could."" As the election effort geared up, the Black Lives Matter movement was at the center of national attention in the United States, so the Russian operation took advantage of it, she said -- and added ""Blue Lives Matter"" material when a pro-police pushback emerged. ""Very real racial tensions and feelings of alienation exist in America, and have for decades,"" Ms. DiResta said. ""The I.R.A. didn't create them. It exploits them."" Of 81 Facebook pages created by the Internet Research Agency in the Senate's data, 30 targeted African-American audiences, amassing 1.2 million followers, the report finds. By comparison, 25 pages targeted the political right and drew 1.4 million followers. Just seven pages focused on the political left, drawing 689,045 followers. In response, the N.A.A.C.P. said it would not use Facebook or Instagram for a week and urged its social media followers and partners to do the same. While the right-wing pages promoted Mr. Trump's candidacy, the left-wing pages scorned Mrs. Clinton while promoting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. The voter suppression effort was focused particularly on Sanders supporters and African-Americans, urging them to shun Mrs. Clinton in the general election and either vote for Ms. Stein or stay home. Whether such efforts had a significant effect is difficult to judge. Black voter turnout declined in 2016 for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, but it is impossible to determine whether that was the result of the Russian campaign. The New Knowledge report argues that the Internet Research Agency's presence on Instagram has been underestimated and may have been as effective or more effective than its Facebook effort. The report says there were 187 million engagements on Instagram -- users ""liking"" or sharing the content created in Russia -- compared with 76.5 million engagements on Facebook. In 2017, as the American news media focused on the Russian operations on Facebook and Twitter, the Russian effort shifted strongly to Instagram, the report says. The New Knowledge report criticizes social media companies for misleading the public. ""Regrettably, it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress,"" the report says, noting what it calls one false claim that specific population groups were not targeted by the influence operation and another that the campaign did not seek to discourage voting. ""It is unclear whether these answers were the result of faulty or lacking analysis, or a more deliberate evasion,"" the report says. The report suggests a grudging respect for the scale and creativity of Russian influence operations. But the Russians were not eager to take credit for their own efforts. After the election, the report says, the Internet Research Agency put up some 70 posts on Facebook and Instagram that mocked the claims that Russia had interfered in the election. ""You've lost and don't know what to do?"" said one such post. ""Just blame it on Russian hackers."" PHOTO: Yevgeny Prigozhin, left, and the Russian leader Vladimir V.

U.S. Accuses Chinese Nationals of Infiltrating Corporate and Government Technology,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration ramped up its pressure campaign on Beijing on Thursday, as the Justice Department accused two Chinese nationals with ties to the country's Ministry of State Security of infiltrating the biggest providers of internet services and boring into government computer systems, including a major Department of Energy laboratory. The indictment of the two men came just months after the Justice Department lured one of the Chinese intelligence agency's officers to Belgium, where he was arrested and extradited to the United States. Both cases focus on an intelligence effort based in Tianjin to advance Beijing's economic and geopolitical interests with an extraordinarily broad attack on Western companies and governments. Just as the indictment was unsealed, Britain identified the same intelligence operation, often named APT 10 by cybersecurity firms, as responsible for separate attacks in that country and beyond. The statement from Britain's Foreign Office was part of a new, collective effort by Western allies to call out China's attempts to obtain trade secrets and intellectual property through a state-coordinated cyberespionage campaign, according to people involved in the planning. Australia and New Zealand on Friday issued similar statements.  The allegations highlight the tension between the United States and China over what the White House says is a brazen effort by the Chinese to obtain Western technology and other proprietary information. The United States formally accused the Chinese of violating a 2015 agreement -- brokered by President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping -- to cease economic espionage, saying Chinese hackers have come roaring backafter two years of comity. The Justice Department action also comes amid other Trump administration pressure on the Chinese. The United States helped coordinate the arrest of a top executive of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, on suspicion of committing fraud related to sanctions against Iran. Her arrest, while she was changing planes in Canada, has set off a geopolitical standoff, with China arresting three Canadians on its own soil. Last week, American investigators said that a long-running hack of Starwood Hotels, now part of Marriott International, was a Chinese intelligence-gathering operation. And the United States has taken steps to block Chinese investment and student enrollments in the United States. It is not clear how, if at all, the latest indictment will affect Mr. Trump's effort to reach a trade agreement with Mr. Xi that would end an escalating tariff war between the world's two largest economies. The United States has set a March 2 deadline to reach agreement with Beijing on a range of issues, including what the White House says is a pattern in which China has pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets as a condition of doing business there. China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website that it does not support stealing trade secrets and that the move ""seriously violates the basic norms of international relations and has severely damaged Sino-U.S. cooperation."" It said that American monitoring of foreign governments, businesses and individuals has long been an ""open secret."" The statement was a reminder of how cyberspace has become a primary battleground between the two nations. The indictment unsealed on Thursday describes the broad outlines of what it calls a yearslong campaign by China to steal American technological secrets in a range of industries to allow Beijing's companies to undercut international competitors and help its military erode the United States' defensive edge. That echoes a previous indictment against officers of the People's Liberation Army in 2014, who were charged with stealing a variety of industrial secrets. Safely ensconced in China, none of them have ever been arrested or brought to trial. In the new case, the government said it had charged two Chinese nationals, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, with conspiracy to hack into computer systems and commit wire fraud and identity theft. The government accused them of targeting unnamed aviation, telecommunications, pharmaceutical and satellite companies, and said several government entities were attacked, including the Navy and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The indictment does not describe any specific technology stolen by the group but said they ""successfully obtained unauthorized access"" to a range of entities, including the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, an Energy Department lab in California. Security firms have been tracking the Chinese hackers, Mr. Zhu, also called ""Godkiller,"" and Mr. Zhang, also called ""Baobeilong,"" for 13 years, under various names including APT10 and Stone Panda. At the National Security Agency, intelligence analysts tracked the two, along with a third Chinese hacker, whom they called ""Legion Opal."" All targeted an exhaustive list of individuals and companies in aerospace and defense, naval, energy, natural resources, automotive, electronic and government sectors, as well as the occasional Chinese dissident. But as recently as 2013, intelligence officials were not sure what to make of the hackers' relationship to Chinese state officials. All three were based in Tianjin, and that year, a classified intelligence assessment was vague in describing any tie to Beijing. The ""exact affiliation with Chinese government entities is not known, but their activities indicate a probable intelligence requirement feed,"" one N.S.A. document obtained by The New York Times said. The hackers worked for private tech companies, but their targets -- particularly in aerospace and defense -- were of value to China's civilian spy agency. Other targets in the energy, automotive, electronic and national resources industries closely aligned with China's economic priorities. ""This is outright cheating and theft, and it gives China an unfair advantage at the expense of law-abiding businesses and countries that follow the international rules in return for the privilege of participating in the global economic system,"" Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference. APT10 has rapidly changed its approaches and technology after private cybersecurity firms discovered its attacks. It constantly shifted its internet protocol, or IP, addresses to avoid detection and bypass security filters, the indictment alleged, allowing it to remain on its victims' systems far longer. Between 2006 and 2018, according to the indictment, the APT10 group hacked computers in at least a dozen countries and broke into companies and the American government to steal information and data on various technologies. Beginning in 2014, APT10 began to target companies that provide computer services like cloud computing and networking support. It penetrated those networks and stole confidential business data from companies around the world, the indictment says. In doing so, the administration said, Beijing violated its 2015 agreement not to steal American technological secrets. Not only did it use the stolen information to give its companies a competitive advantage, but it also used the intelligence to rapidly advance the capabilities of the People's Liberation Army as it worked to increase its influence in the Pacific region. In addition to its corporate espionage, the group compromised the Navy's computer systems, downloading the private information of more than 100,000 Navy personnel, the Justice Department said. ""China stands accused of engaging in criminal activity that victimizes individuals and companies in the United States, violates our laws and departs from international norms of state behavior,"" Mr. Rosenstein said. He accused China of trying to ""dominate"" other countries through economic espionage, and said the response ""requires a strategic, whole-of-government approach to the threats that China poses."" The legal assault on China comes as Mr. Trump tries to end a trade war with Beijing that has begun inflicting economic harm on both sides of the Pacific. But while the administration has tried to divorce trade talks from law enforcement actions, Mr. Trump has eagerly conflated the two, potentially complicating an already complex negotiation. Mr. Trump has suggested that he could intervene in the Huawei case if it would help secure a trade agreement with China. And he previously intervened in another sanctions case involving a Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, which had been barred from buying American components after China's president, Mr. Xi, personally appealed to the president. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that the charges against Chinese hackers would not derail the trade negotiations. He said that while cybersecurity had been discussed, this specific situation had not been raised. Nicole Perlroth contributed reporting from San Francisco. Related Articles  "
Germany Says Hackers Infiltrated Main Government Network,"BERLIN -- Hackers using highly sophisticated software penetrated the German government's main data network, a system that was supposed to be particularly secure and is used by the chancellor's office, ministries and the Parliament, government officials have said. German news outlets, citing security sources, have widely blamed a Russian hacking group backed by the Russian government -- either one called Snake, or another known as APT28, or Fancy Bear. But Berlin has not publicly said who was behind the attack.  The attack was narrowly targeted, apparently seeking specific information, said Patrick Sensburg, a lawmaker with the governing Conservative Party. Officials would not say how successful the intrusion was, or what data the hackers may have taken. The parliamentary committee responsible for monitoring Germany's intelligence services called a special session on Thursday, demanding information about the hacking, which was first reported on Wednesday by the German news agency D.P.A. ""We have suffered a veritable cyberattack on parts of the government network,"" Armin Schuster, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party, told reporters on Thursday. He declined to give any further information, saying that the attack was continuing, as was an investigation into who might be behind it. ""A public discussion would serve as a warning to the attackers that we simply do not want to give them,"" Mr. Schuster said. Germany's Interior Ministry confirmed the attack on Wednesday, describing it as ""isolated"" and having been ""brought under control."" But the ministry would not say whether Russian hackers were responsible, and declined to give any more details. The attack comes two years after German security officials determined that Fancy Bear hackers were able to breach the German Parliament's data network, leading to calls for increased security on the country's most sensitive systems. The same group has been accused of breaching the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee in the United States, leading to the release of embarrassing emails during the 2016 campaign, and of targeting Olympic athletes and circulating their emails. German security officials warned in the months leading up to a national election in September that the country remained vulnerable to ""cyberespionage,"" but the country appeared to have escaped any attacks on the level of those seen during the presidential campaigns in the United States and France. Süddeutsche Zeitung, a left-leaning German daily, reported that the country's Foreign Ministry had been among the targets of the most recent attack, citing anonymous sources within the ministry. That information, while unconfirmed, was supported by a report by Palo Alto Networks, a cyber security firm, pointing to what it called ""a new set of attacks"" by Russian hackers that appeared to be aimed at the diplomatic community in the West. Investigators with Palo Alto Networks said that groups associated with Fancy Bear had used ""malicious emails targeting foreign affairs agencies and ministries in North America and Europe, including a European embassy in Moscow."" German media reported that the country's Defense Ministry had also been targeted. Mr. Sensburg refused to place blame on the Russians, insisting that the authorities would need time to determine who was behind the attack. ""Whether this really was the work of this hacking collective must be carefully investigated,"" he told ZDF, a public broadcaster, before the parliamentary committee convened on Thursday. ""As this involved the government network, which is used for communication and email traffic and a lot of daily exchanges, but does not primarily involve secret or top-secret information, it must also be carefully examined whether data has been leaked."" Unlike the 2015 hacking attack on the German Parliament, which succeeded in breaching the system and making off with 16 gigabytes of sensitive information, Mr. Sensburg said the most recent attack appeared to be more refined, clearly targeting specific information. Despite attempts to play down the communication exchanged on the government network, known as the IVBB, it would be of interest for anyone seeking to spy on German intelligence. The network allows the chancellery, ministries, security services and federal auditing office to exchange information with one another. Offices in Bonn, the former West German capital, and in Berlin, are included on the specially secured network. Efforts to bolster Germany's data security have been a point of debate for months. The country's military is allowed to legally initiate a cyber-offensive to combat a hacking attack on its resources, but there is no such law that would permit similar defense of the country's civilian infrastructure.

"Joy Reid Blames Hackers for Anti-Gay Blog Posts, but Questions Mount","Back in December, after a series of homophobic posts on her defunct, decade-old blog resurfaced on social media, the MSNBC host Joy Reid apologized for them. But this week, when Ms. Reid was confronted with a new batch of homophobic writings from that same period, she said she had been the victim of hackers. That claim was called into question on Tuesday, when the Internet Archive, the meticulous online record-keeping nonprofit that hosted the archived version of her site, said it had found no evidence to support her claim.     Late Tuesday night, MSNBC provided documents that show Ms. Reid's lawyers alerted Google and the Internet Archive to the alleged hacking in December, shortly after her public apology but long before the latest batch of posts appeared on social media.   The latest group of alleged blog posts includes a great deal of material that might embarrass a prominent liberal figure like Ms. Reid, including expressions of disgust at the thought of homosexuality, opposition to gay marriage, claims that gay men prey on ''impressionable teens'' and criticism of political correctness.   ''Most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing,'' one post said. It concluded: ''The nature of political correctness is that gay people are allowed to say straight sex is gross but the reverse is considered to be patently homophobic.''   One of the posts also criticizes Rachel Maddow, who is now the most-watched host on MSNBC, as being ''at the left-most end of the political spectrum'' when it comes to gay rights. (Ms. Reid hosts a weekend morning show on MSNBC, but at the time she kept her blog active neither she nor Ms. Maddow had shows on the network.)   Ms. Reid did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday, but MSNBC provided a statement from Jonathan Nichols, a cybersecurity consultant working on her case.   He said her blog was ''breached'' in December and that ''fraudulent entries'' were posted ''with suspicious formatting and time stamps,'' including ''text and visual styling'' that was not consistent with the rest of the blog.   He said Ms. Reid's team also had ''significant evidence'' that some of the posts circulating online -- he did not say which ones -- had never appeared on the blog and were instead doctored screenshots meant ''to tarnish Ms. Reid's character.''   MSNBC also provided two letters sent by Ms. Reid's lawyer, John H. Reichman, to Alphabet -- Google's parent company -- and the Internet Archive in December alerting them to alleged hacking and requesting their assistance, which was not forthcoming.   Hacked or not, the posts appear to have made an impact. On Tuesday, PFLAG, a group for the families of L.G.B.T. people, said it was canceling an award it had planned to give Ms. Reid this spring ''in light of new information and the ongoing investigation of that information.''   The newly discovered posts were found on the Wayback Machine, a project of the Internet Archive, and were shared on social media last week by the Twitter user who discovered Ms. Reid's old blog posts last year. That user did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.   In a statement to the website Mediaite, which wrote about the posts on Monday, Ms. Reid said hackers had planted them.   ''In December I learned that an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog, The Reid Report, to include offensive and hateful references that are fabricated and run counter to my personal beliefs and ideology,'' the statement said. It added, ''Now that the site has been compromised I can state unequivocally that it does not represent the original entries.''   The Internet Archive responded to Ms. Reid's claim on Tuesday, saying in a statement that it had found no evidence of hacking in the archived versions of her site on the Wayback Machine.   The Internet Archive also said Ms. Reid's lawyers asked the group to take down the archived version of her site in December because they said either the archive or the original site had been hacked.   The archive said it was warned by Ms. Reid's lawyers that '''fraudulent' posts were 'inserted into legitimate content' in our archives of the blog.'' But an investigation found that claim to be untrue, according to the archive.   ''When we reviewed the archives, we found nothing to indicate tampering or hacking of the Wayback Machine versions,'' the statement said, adding, ''We let Reid's lawyers know that the information provided was not sufficient for us to verify claims of manipulation.''   The Internet Archive said it declined the request to remove Ms. Reid's blog from the archive ''due to Reid's being a journalist (a very high-profile one, at that) and the journalistic nature of the blog archives.''   Ms. Reid appeared eager to blunt the statement by the Internet Archive. Her security consultant, Mr. Nichols, said on Tuesday that ''at no time has Ms. Reid claimed that the Wayback Machine was hacked'' with an intention to alter her blog.   Instead, he said Ms. Reid's team detected a ''breach'' of the site that it thought may have been related to the posts on her blog but that it determined was unrelated.   But it appears Ms. Reid may have taken matters into her own hands. The Internet Archive said that at some point during its correspondence with Ms. Reid's lawyers, a robots exclusion protocol specific to the Wayback Machine was activated on her old blog.   That protocol sends a signal to the archive, which the archive chooses to abide by, that can be used to get around the Wayback Machine's policies and remove pages from the archive of the internet.

"UK, Dutch Accuse 'Pariah State' Russia of Hacking Chemical Watchdog","LONDON/THE HAGUE -- Britain and the Netherlands accused Russia of running a global campaign of cyber attacks to undermine democracies, including a thwarted attempt to hack into the chemical weapons watchdog while it was analyzing a Russian poison used to attack a spy. In some of the strongest language used by the West since the Cold War, Britain said Russia was acting like a ""pariah state"". The accusations were backed by other Western countries including the United States, which said Moscow must pay a price.  Russia denied what its Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called a ""diabolical perfume cocktail"" of allegations by someone with a ""rich imagination"". But the accusations deepen Moscow's isolation at a time when its diplomatic ties with the West have been downgraded over the poisoning of an ex-spy in England and it is under U.S. and EU sanctions over its actions in Ukraine. The British and Dutch accusations were unveiled as NATO defense ministers gathered in Brussels to present a united front to their Cold War-era foe. ""This is not the actions of a great power, these are the actions of a pariah state,"" British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he agreed with the British and Dutch assessments. Russia must pay a price and a number of response options were available, he said. EU officials said in a statement Russia's ""aggressive act demonstrated contempt for the solemn purpose"" of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Dutch authorities said they had disrupted an attempt to hack into the Hague-based OPCW in April. At the time, the watchdog was investigating both the poison used to attack ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Britain and chemical weapons which the West says were used in Syria by Russia's ally President Bashar al-Assad. Four Russians arrived in the Netherlands on April 10 and were caught three days later with spying equipment at a hotel located next to the OPCW headquarters, the Dutch military intelligence agency said. The men had planned to travel on to a laboratory in Spiez, Switzerland used by the OPCW to analyze samples, Dutch Major-General Onno Eichelsheim said. They were expelled to Russia. The Netherlands released copies of passports of the four men, which identified them as Alexey Minin, Oleg Sotnikov, Evgenii Serebriakov and Aleksei Morenets, all in their 30s or 40s. Reuters was not immediately able to contact them.  Russian military intelligence ""is active here in the Netherlands ... where a lot of international organizations are (based),"" Eichelsheim said. AGGRESSOR Earlier on Thursday, Britain released an assessment based on work by its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which cast Russia's GRU military intelligence agency as a cyber aggressor which used a network of hackers to sow worldwide discord. The GRU, Britain said, was almost certainly behind the BadRabbit and World Anti-Doping Agency hacking attacks of 2017, the hack of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the theft of emails from a UK-based TV station in 2015. ""The GRU's actions are reckless and indiscriminate: they try to undermine and interfere in elections in other countries,"" said British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ""Our message is clear - together with our allies, we will expose and respond to the GRU's attempts to undermine international stability."" The GRU, now officially known in Russia by a shorter acronym GU, is also the agency Britain has blamed for sending two men to England to poison former GRU agent Sergei Skripal with a chemical weapon sprayed on his door. Skripal, his daughter and a police officer fell seriously ill; a woman later died after her partner found the poison in a discarded perfume bottle. Russia says the two men Britain blames for the attack were tourists who twice visited Skripal's home town for sightseeing during a weekend trip to England, a story Britain says is so far-fetched as to prove Moscow's culpability. Hunt said the hacking attempt at the OPCW was further proof of Moscow's role in the poisoning. After the Skripal poisoning, dozens of Western countries launched the biggest expulsion of Russian spies working under diplomatic cover since the height of the Cold War. Moscow replied with tit-for-tat expulsions of Westerners. In a separate case on Thursday, a Norwegian court extended for a second two-week period the detention of a Russian citizen suspected of spying on Norway's parliament. Norway arrested Mikhail Bochkaryov on Sept. 21 as he was about to fly out of the country. Moscow says he is a Russian parliamentary staff member and has demanded Oslo lift the ""absurd charges"". Britain said the GRU was associated with a host of hackers including APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Pawnstorm, Sednit, CyberCaliphate, Cyber Berkut and Voodoo Bear. The United States has sanctioned GRU officers including its chief, Igor Korobov, in 2016 and 2018 for attempted interference in the 2016 U.S. election and cyber attacks. Australia and New Zealand also backed the British findings. ""By embarking on a pattern of malicious cyber behavior, Russia has shown a total disregard for the agreements it helped to negotiate,"" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said.

The Latest: Russian Lawmaker Condemns Hacking Claims as Fake,"LONDON -- The Latest on a new wave of global cyberattacks blamed on Russia (all times local): 4 p.m. A senior Russian lawmaker has lashed out against new Western claims of alleged cybercrimes by the Russian military intelligence, saying they are intended to smear Russia. The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday charged seven Russian military intelligence officers with hacking anti-doping agencies and other organizations. Britain and the Netherlands condemned the Russian GRU military intelligence for a series of alleged global cybercrimes. Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russian parliament, denounced the accusations as fake, saying they are intended to ""delegitimize Russia"" and pave the way for using any illegitimate means against it. He argued that the West has picked up the GRU as ""a modern analogue of the KGB which served as a bugaboo for people in the West during the Cold War.""  ___ 3:50 p.m. The global chemical weapons watchdog that was targeted by Russian hackers says it ""takes very seriously the security of its information systems and networks."" The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says in a statement that its director general was briefed Thursday by Dutch authorities about the Russian hackers who were foiled in April and expelled from the Netherlands. The OPCW says that since early this year it ""has observed increased cyber-related activities"" and ""undertaken measures to mitigate them."" The organization, which oversees the global convention outlawing chemical weapons, is headquartered in The Hague. ___ 2:50 p.m. Justice Department officials say three of the seven Russian military intelligence officials accused in the hacking of anti-doping agencies were previously charged by special counsel Robert Mueller. The three defendants named in an indictment unsealed Thursday also were named in a July indictment that accused Russia of hacking Democratic email accounts and facilitating the release of stolen emails. John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, said the new indictment didn't arise out of Mueller's investigation. But he says the Russian hackers in the latest case allegedly used some of the same methods and had the same general goal: to spread disinformation and confusion. Demers says the indictment shows hackers can't use anonymity to hide from the law. ___ 2:30 p.m. The U.S. Justice Department has charged seven Russian military intelligence officers with hacking anti-doping agencies and other organizations. An indictment announced in Washington on Thursday says Russia's military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, targeted the hacking victims because they had publicly supported a ban on Russian athletes in international sports competitions and because they had condemned Russia's state-sponsored athlete doping program. Prosecutors say the Russians also targeted a Pennsylvania-based nuclear energy company and an international organization that was investigating chemical weapons in Syria and the poisoning of a former GRU officer. The indictment says the hacking was often conducted remotely. If that wasn't successful, the hackers would conduct ""on-site"" or ""close access"" hacking operations with trained GRU members traveling with sophisticated equipment to target their victims through Wi-Fi networks ___ 2:10 p.m. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the United States stands ready to help its NATO allies amid allegations that Russia's intelligence services launched a series of cyberattacks. After talks with NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Thursday, Mattis said: ""We are ready today to provide cyber-support to our allies. That is now."" He did not say if the offered capabilities would be used in response to British and Dutch claims that Russia's GRU attempted cyberattacks on the international chemical weapons watchdog and other targets. Mattis backed their allegations, saying: ""I've seen enough of the evidence to say the Dutch and the British are 100 percent accurate in who they've attributed this to."" Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark also offered offensive cyber-capabilities to NATO. ___ 12:25 p.m. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has warned Russia to halt its ""reckless"" behavior amid a series of global cyberattacks blamed on Moscow, and says NATO allies stand united behind the U.K. and Dutch governments. In a statement issued Thursday during a meeting of NATO defense ministers, Stoltenberg said ""NATO allies stand in solidarity with the decision by the Dutch and British governments to call out Russia on its blatant attempts to undermine international law and institutions."" He said that ""Russia must stop its reckless pattern of behavior, including the use of force against its neighbors, attempted interference in election processes, and widespread disinformation campaigns."" The 29 allies are discussing cybersecurity at talks in Brussels, with the U.S., Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands due to announce that they will provide offensive cyber-capabilities for use by NATO. ___ 12:20 p.m. British Prime Minister Theresa May and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte have released a joint statement condemning the Russian military intelligence unit GRU for a series of alleged global cybercrimes. The two leaders said Thursday they will ""defend international institutions from those that seek do to them harm."" They spoke after officials from both countries blamed the GRU for a series of attacks against the international chemical weapons watchdog and other agencies, including the World Anti-Doping Agency and groups investigating the 2014 Malaysian Airlines crash over Ukraine. May and Rutte say the attacks ""demonstrate again the GRU's disregard for the global values and rules that keep us all safe."" Russia on Thursday dismissed the accusations as ""fantasies."" ___ 11:20 a.m. The Dutch defense minister says Russia's military intelligence unit attempted cybercrimes targeting the international chemical weapons watchdog and the investigation into the 2014 Malaysian Airlines crash over Ukraine. Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld said the GRU's hacking attempts on the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which she said took place in April, were disrupted by authorities. Four Russian intelligence officers were immediately expelled from the Netherlands, she said.  Speaking about Russia's hacking attempts into the MH17 crash investigation Thursday, she said: ""We have been aware of the interest of Russian intelligence services in this investigation and have taken appropriate measures."" She added that ""We remain very alert about this.""  ___ This version removes the incorrect reference to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as a U.N. organization. ___ 10:30 a.m. Russia's foreign ministry has denied allegations by British and Australian authorities that the Russian military intelligence agency GRU was behind a fresh wave of global cybercrimes. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Thursday dismissed the new accusations as ""big fantasies."" Britain's National Cyber Security Center cited four new attacks associated with the GRU targeting the World Anti-Doping agency, Ukrainian transport systems, the 2016 U.S. presidential race and others. British officials earlier blamed the GRU for the March nerve agent attack on a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. ___ 8:20 a.m. Britain's defense minister says a series of global cyberattacks blamed on Russia are the actions of a ""pariah state"" and that the U.K. and its NATO allies will expose such activities in the future. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said Thursday that ""where Russia acts in an indiscriminate and reckless way, where they have done in terms of these cyberattacks, we will be exposing them."" His remarks came after British and Australian officials said the Russian military intelligence unit GRU is behind a wave of global cyberattacks. Britain's National Cyber Security Center says four new attacks are associated with GRU as well as earlier cyberattacks. Williamson said: ""This is not the actions of a great power. This is the actions of a pariah state."" "
How Do You Get Students to Think Like Criminals?,"Between September 2017 and August 2018, employers in the United States posted 313,735 job openings for cybersecurity professionals. Filling those jobs would mean increasing the country's current cybersecurity work force of 715,000 people by more than 40 percent, according to data presented at the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education Conference this month. With the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs worldwide projected to multiply into the millions in the next three years, it's no surprise that governments, companies and schools are racing to pour more resources into cybersecurity training and education programs.  As someone who teaches in a rapidly growing computing security program at the Rochester Institute of Technology, this is good news for me and my students. I think we are doing a good and responsible job of training our students, who will be snapped up by recruiters.   But I've watched as the field of cybersecurity has become formalized through a flurry of new degrees, certificates and curriculums, and I worry that some fundamental components of what make people really good at security -- namely, the instincts to look at systems in unconventional ways and quickly identify possible ways to cause trouble -- are being lost along the way. The idea of degree programs focused solely on cybersecurity is still pretty new. At R.I.T., the bachelor's degree in security was introduced in 2007, and the dedicated Computing Security department wasn't formed until 2012. That means we haven't had a lot of time to debug these programs, especially since, in academic settings, every significant curricular change typically requires several meetings followed by extensive paperwork and committee approval.  The field is so new that nearly every cybersecurity professional over the age of 30 does not have a degree in cybersecurity -- many of them don't even have degrees in computer science, and several don't have college degrees at all. Cybersecurity has long been a field that embraced people with nontraditional backgrounds. Following the Equifax breach last year, some critics slammed the company for hiring a chief security officer who majored in music, prompting a considerable backlash from security professionals who took to Twitter to flash their own liberal arts degrees or lack of formal education.  The poster child for the unconventional path to a cybersecurity job is Kevin Mitnick, who was convicted of illegal computer hacking and spent five years in prison before establishing a career as a highly sought after security consultant. It's not a coincidence that someone good at cybercrime would also be good at cybersecurity. After all, many cybersecurity jobs involve trying to think like a criminal to test the security of a software program, computer network or hardware device. Many of my students go on to work for red-teaming or penetration-testing firms, where they try to probe and attack computer systems from the outside to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Some of these skills can be taught in the classroom, through checklists of where to look for possible weaknesses and tools that can be used to help conduct those assessments. But the most effective red teams, like the most effective attackers, find vulnerabilities that no one has ever thought of before -- much less included on a course syllabus. The security technologist Bruce Schneier wrote an essay a decade ago about what he called ""the security mind-set,"" or the ability to instinctively identify ways of subverting or compromising systems by using them in unexpected ways. ""It's far easier to teach someone domain expertise -- cryptography or software security or safecracking or document forgery -- than it is to teach someone a security mind-set,"" he wrote. Almost by definition, college classroom settings and the students who thrive in them are not a natural fit for the kinds of disruptive, rebellious and troublemaking instincts that lend themselves to finding new ways to compromise computers. It can be hard to reward those skills -- much less teach them -- in a college course where there are supposed to be clear expectations and learning objectives, well-defined grading rubrics and set schedules. There are efforts to try to introduce these skills to the classroom, but they are few and far between. For example, the security researchers Gregory Conti and James Caroland published an article on what they called ""Kobayashi Maru"" assignments, named for a ""Star Trek"" training exercise, designed to force students to figure out creative ways to cheat. The example they used in their own class was an exam for which students were required to write down the first 100 digits of pi with very little notice. The students were expected (and encouraged) to cheat on the test but told that if they were caught, they would fail the exam. Of the 20 students in the class where this exercise was tested, all succeeded in cheating without being caught, much to their professors' delight. There is plenty of useful and important material being taught in cybersecurity classes beside how to cheat, from programming and networks to cryptography, and my own area of economics and policy. But the students who graduate from our degree program in security often report that they got more out of their extracurricular security clubs and competitions than their coursework.  That may not necessarily be bad, or even unique to cybersecurity (don't get me started on the topic of how much I learned writing for my college newspaper), but it does suggest that as we race forward trying to train millions more people in cybersecurity to fill all the looming vacant jobs, there may be real gaps in the skills we know how to teach.  We should think carefully about the skills we need, about the rules and principles that we know how to teach and also about how to encourage students to break those rules and find ways around those principles.

Olympics Open and Cyberattacks Begin,"PYEONGCHANG, South Korea -- Internet problems before and during the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics on Friday night are being investigated as a possible cyberattack, officials said Saturday.  Sung Baik-you, a spokesman for the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said Saturday that some technical issues ''impacted some of our noncritical systems last night for a few hours.''    Mr. Sung did not elaborate and said that the committee was investigating the cause. He said the attack ''did not disrupt any event or have any effect on the safety or security of any athletes or spectators.'' A spokeswoman for the committee said a cybersecurity team was assisting in the investigation.   During the ceremony, the wireless service in the stadium stopped working as soon as the ceremony began, hampering reporters and spectators who wanted to post on social media.   According to a report by the Yonghap News Agency, the attack disrupted some internet-based telecasts at the main press center. When organizers shut down servers to deal with the attack, the Pyeongchang 2018 website stopped working, and some spectators who had bought tickets for the opening ceremony were unable to print out their reservations.   Mr. Sung said that the organizers sold 99 percent of 35,000 tickets to the opening ceremony, though viewers noticed many empty seats.   It is possible the frigid weather kept some away, in addition to technical problems.   Mark Adams, a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee, said he hoped to have more information Sunday.   Olympic Games are often targets of cyberattacks and before the opening, the United States Department of Homeland Security warned Americans that cybercriminals would likely try to infiltrate the Games.   North Korea has a persistent army of hackers that have attacked central banks and movie studios. Observers had hoped that the fact that North Korean athletes were attending the Games might ease the threat of cyberattacks, while others said that Russian groups might seek to retaliate for a ban on Russian athletes.

"Uber's $100,000 'Bug Bounty': Inside a Secret Fee to a Hacker","SAN FRANCISCO -- ''Hello Joe,'' read the November 2016 email from someone identifying himself as ''John Doughs.'' ''I have found a major vulnerability in Uber.'' The email appeared to be no different from other messages that Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, and his team routinely received through the company's ''bug bounty'' program, which pays hackers for reporting holes in the ride-hailing service's systems, according to current and former Uber security employees.    Yet the note and Uber's eventual $100,000 payment to the hacker, which was initially celebrated internally as a rare win in corporate security, have since turned into a public relations debacle for the company. In November, when Uber disclosed the 2016 incident and how the information of 57 million driver and rider accounts had been at risk, the company's chief executive since August, Dara Khosrowshahi, called it a ''failure'' that it had not notified people earlier. Mr. Sullivan and a security lawyer, Craig Clark, were fired.    In the weeks since, Uber's handling of the hacking has come under major scrutiny. Not only did Uber pay an outsize amount to the hacker, but it also did not disclose that it had briefly lost control of so much consumer and driver data until a year later. The behavior raised questions of a cover-up and a lack of transparency, as well as whether the payment really was just a ransom paid by a security operation that had acted on its own for too long.   The hacking is now the subject of at least four lawsuits, with attorneys general in five states investigating whether Uber broke laws on data-breach notifications. In addition, the United States attorney for Northern California has begun a criminal investigation into the matter.   Most of all, the hacking and Uber's response have fueled a debate about whether companies that have crusaded to lock up their systems can scrupulously work with hackers without putting themselves on the wrong side of the law.   Uber is illustrative of a breed of company that aimed to bulletproof its security. While many corporations were for years blissfully unaware of hackers penetrating their systems, Uber and others recruited former law enforcement and intelligence analysts and installed layers of technical defenses and password security. They joined other companies in embracing the same hackers they once treated as criminals, shelling out bug bounties as high as $200,000 to report flaws.   Yet since the fallout from Uber's disclosure, Silicon Valley companies have taken a harder look at their bounty programs. At least three have put their programs under review, according to two consultants who have confidential relationships with those companies, which they declined to name. Others said criminal prosecutions for not reporting John Doughs would deter ethical hackers who would otherwise come forward, causing even more security breaches.   ''Anything that causes organizations to take a step backwards and not welcome contributions from the security community will have a negative impact on all of us,'' said Alex Rice, a co-founder of HackerOne, a security company whose business is to work with customers, including Uber, to manage interactions with and payments to hackers.   The situation is complicated by Uber's track record for pushing boundaries, which put it under scrutiny last year and helped spur the resignation of Travis Kalanick, its longtime chief executive, in June. Mr. Khosrowshahi has since vowed to change the way the company conducts itself.   This account of Uber's hacking and the company's response was based on more than a dozen interviews with people who dealt with the incident, many of whom declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of their exchanges. Many are current or former members of Uber's security team, who defended their actions as a prime example of how executives should respond to security problems. The New York Times also obtained more than two dozen internal Uber emails and documents related to the incident.   In a statement, Mr. Sullivan disputed the notion that the 2016 episode was a breach and said Uber had treated it as an authorized vulnerability disclosure.   ''I was surprised and disappointed when those who wanted to portray Uber in a negative light quickly suggested this was a cover-up,'' he said, adding that he was proud its engineers had been able to fix the issue before it could be abused. He declined to discuss disclosure because of the active state investigations.   Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said, ''We stand by our decision to very publicly disclose the 2016 data breach -- not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do.''   Through a spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined to comment.   Uber started its bounty program in March 2016, challenging hackers to find bugs that could specifically lead to the exposure of sensitive user data. The higher risk the bug was, the more Uber would pay. In Uber's calculus, the payouts were better than learning about a vulnerability only after attackers had abused it.   By the time Mr. Sullivan got John Doughs email, Uber had paid rewards to hundreds of hackers. Mr. Sullivan forwarded the John Doughs note to his team for vetting and, if all checked out, patching and payment.   Uber's security team used nicknames for hackers, particularly the colorful, anonymous ones who engaged with the company. John Doughs was called ''Preacher'' for his admonitions that Uber should be better at security.   ''It's very disappointing to be finding this vulnerability in such way,'' the hacker wrote in an email to Rob Fletcher, Uber's product security engineering manager. ''Especially coming from a company like Uber.''   Other emails obtained by The Times show Mr. Fletcher treated the incident as a bounty and encouraged Preacher to provide proof of the vulnerability, including sending a few lines of data from the database he had breached.   According to the emails obtained by The Times, Uber soon discovered that some of its employees had left certain computer code known as keys on a programming site called Github. Those keys had allowed Preacher to gain access to Uber's Amazon web servers, where it stored source code as well as 57 million customer and driver accounts, including driver's license numbers for some 600,000 Uber drivers. It was a major oversight. To fix it, Uber had to inform everyone at the company that it was temporarily shutting down access to Github.   Emails between the hacker and Mr. Fletcher continued. In some, Mr. Fletcher thanked the hacker for helping the company fix the oversight. In two emails, Preacher's motivations appeared to veer closer toward blackmail. In one, he demanded ''high compensation'' for his findings. After Mr. Fletcher said the company's maximum bounty was $10,000, Preacher said he and his team would only accept ''six digits.''   Mr. Fletcher said he would need to seek authorization for a $100,000 payment, and would need Preacher's reassurances that he would delete the data he had downloaded. Mr. Fletcher also pushed the hacker to take payment through HackerOne, which requires bounty recipients to disclose their real identities for tax requirements.   Mr. Fletcher drew further details about the hacker out through emails, including tidbits about his identity, his internet hosting provider, the location of his computer and proof that he deleted his copy of Uber's downloaded data by looking at a virtual copy of his system provided by his host.   According to the emails, Uber at one point extended Preacher an all-expenses paid trip to San Francisco, where the company is based. Uber asked the hacker to discuss his security techniques and offered to introduce him to companies that might be interested in his skills. Preacher declined.   By then, Uber's executives had decided what to do. Mr. Kalanick signed off on the $100,000 payment, so long as the hacker signed an agreement to destroy any data exposed in his discovery, according to the emails.   Preacher's trail of digital bread crumbs eventually led to a 20-year-old whose first name was Brandon and who was living in a Florida trailer park with his family, according to the emails. In one email, Uber offered to send someone to meet Brandon at a local coffee shop. Brandon declined to leave his home and suggested that the employee meet him there. It was there that Brandon signed agreements assuring Uber that he had deleted the data he had downloaded.   The Times was unable to learn Brandon's full name. An email to the John Doughs account bounced back.   Uber's security team was soon celebrating its response to what could have been a major security breach. Mr. Sullivan and his colleagues were praised in year-end performance reviews, including by Mr. Kalanick, according to current and former employees.   What is now at issue is whether Uber executives broke the law with the $100,000 payment and should have quickly notified customers or officials of the discovery. The issue is not legally clear cut.   Laws concerning bug bounties are ambiguous. The Justice Department weighed into bug disclosure programs for the first time in July and largely left it to organizations to decide what access they will authorize for hackers and what they can do with the data. In Uber's case, its bounty guidelines authorized and encouraged hackers to look for vulnerabilities that exposed its most sensitive user data.   Breach disclosure laws also differ state to state. The state laws most relevant to Uber's case require disclosure if names are exposed in combination with driver's license numbers in a ''breach of security.''   Brandon received two payments of $50,000 each from Uber on Dec. 8, 2016, according to the emails. Uber continued trading emails with Brandon during 2017, until the conversation dwindled.   Last fall, when two outside law firms for Uber learned about the payment to the hacker, they advised the company that the incident should have been disclosed, according to an Uber employee familiar with the matter. Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Clark, the lawyer who directly oversaw the bounty payment, were fired for not seeking outside counsel on the issue of whether to disclose, this person said.   That prompted a call to Mr. Sullivan while he was preparing Thanksgiving dinner, according to two people familiar with the matter. He was fired, effective immediately.

"When to Report a Cyberattack? For Companies, That's Still a Dilemma","It has been seven years since the Securities and Exchange Commission first advised public companies to tell investors if they had suffered a cyberattack deemed to be material. But even with the rising number of severe hacks, only a few companies report incidents each year to the S.E.C. Now the S.E.C. has issued updated cybersecurity guidance. Again, it warned public companies to make ''timely'' disclosure, recognizing the ''grave threat'' that cybercrime poses to investors and the capital markets.     Yet, the S.E.C.'s new guidance doesn't confront the practical quandary facing public companies victimized by a cyberattack: Going public with news of a cyberattack isn't always an easy call. Doing so can risk tipping off the bad guys and imperil investigations. Law enforcement often encourages, or even demands, that the incident not be disclosed. At the same time, companies know they have a duty to their investors to provide prompt information about any real risks to their businesses.   This tension between the need for discreet cooperation with law enforcement and the obligation to inform investors and the markets creates a dilemma for public companies. Unfortunately, the commission's updated guidance provides little direction to corporate leaders confronting these conflicting demands. While the guidance acknowledges that it will often take time to ''discern the implications'' of a breach and that it ''may be necessary to cooperate'' with law enforcement, it concludes that an active investigation would not ''on its own'' be a reason to avoid disclosure of a material cybersecurity incident.   Perhaps this dilemma explains why so few public companies report breaches. In 2017, only 24 companies reported breaches to the S.E.C., according to Audit Analytics, a firm that tracks securities law filings. Since 2011, when the S.E.C. issued its initial cyber guidance, only 106 companies have reported incidents to the S.E.C.   But during that same period, there were 4,732 cyberattacks on American businesses, researchers for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse found. While a proportion of those were private companies, it's unlikely that public companies suffered only 106 breaches that were material in that time.   The S.E.C. has investigated tardy data breach disclosures but has yet to bring an enforcement action against a company that failed to disclose an incident. The agency is investigating Yahoo's two data breaches in 2013 and 2014, which the company did not disclose until 2016 even though information on three billion users was compromised. Equifax, too, has acknowledged that the S.E.C. is looking into the theft of Social Security numbers, license numbers, addresses and dates of birth for nearly 145.5 million Americans. The breach was detected in July but not disclosed to the S.E.C. and investors until September.   Where does that leave public companies that have been hacked?   The solution is not simple. Some say the S.E.C. should adopt a regulation giving companies a ''pass'' from public disclosure obligations if they refer the matter to law enforcement. But such a rule could easily be abused by corporations that have a big incentive to hush up attacks. They could easily make a halfhearted referral to law enforcement and then use it as a smoke screen to avoid a potentially devastating disclosure.   Even companies trying to do the right thing are stuck. They might report an attack to law enforcement, and then hear nothing for weeks or months, in part because there is not enough staff to investigate all of these hacks. At some point, a company will have to conclude that its duty to investors overrides its responsibility as a good corporate citizen to comply with requests for discretion.   Even when a breach is disclosed, it's difficult for companies to support the needs of law enforcement. Companies face irate money managers and investment advisers, who are duty-bound to ask tough questions about their investments. Without getting straight and candid answers to those tough questions, they lose the ability to monitor their investments and, indeed, risk watching their investments lose critical value without visibility into what actually happened.   Perhaps this conflict is fundamentally irreconcilable. But with stakes so important given the increasingly sophisticated threats posed by cybercrime to corporate America, we should view the S.E.C.'s new guidance as a starting point and collective opportunity to figure this out.

"After Equifax Breach, a Credit Freeze Provision Comes at a Price","Six months after the major data breach at Equifax, consumers finally have a chance to get one of the reforms they've been clamoring for: free credit freezes at each of the three big credit reporting bureaus. The ability to block access to your credit report -- which now costs up to $10 in certain states -- was wrapped into a giant bill that would loosen regulations for banks. The Senate passed the legislation on Wednesday, but it faces an uncertain fate in the House.    After Equifax disclosed that cyber thieves had gained access to the sensitive financial information of roughly 145 million consumers, members of Congress took turns denouncing the company's former chief executive and calling for greater oversight of the credit bureaus, particularly how they protect personal data.    That hasn't happened. And while free credit freezes would be a small win for consumers, advocates say they would come at a price: The bill would override stronger state regulations and pre-empt the states from enacting better protections. And it wouldn't begin to address the much larger issue of safeguarding consumer data.   ''For all of this talk about action, all of these months after the data breach Congress hasn't done anything,'' said Mike Litt, consumer campaign director at U.S. PIRG, the consumer advocacy group.   The new legislation might do more harm than good, Mr. Litt said. For example, it could stop states from requiring that all credit reports be frozen by default -- an arrangement that would put consumers in control of who gains access to their data. As it stands, consumers must contact each of the three bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- to initiate a freeze. Likewise, they must also contact the bureaus to lift the freeze, which is necessary when applying for a loan or, say, car insurance.   There are also several states where a freeze blocks not just lenders but also insurers and employers from access to your credit files. ''Those states would be overridden because this law would only extend to credit checks'' from lenders, Mr. Litt added.   Consumers have little choice but to work with Equifax and its peers. Banks and other financial services firms feed consumers' personal data to the bureaus, which keep files on more than 200 million people. That data is then crunched to calculate personal credit scores.   There is no way to opt out of this system. Mortgage providers, credit card companies, mobile phone providers and others won't do business with you until they check your credit report at one or all of the big bureaus. If you freeze your file, these companies cannot get to it -- and if they cannot get to it, they won't issue credit. That protects you if thieves obtain your personal information and try to open accounts in your name.   The Consumer Data Industry Association, the credit bureaus' trade group, did not oppose the language in the Senate bill. The big bureaus do not break out how much they collect in fees for initiating and lifting credit freezes, the association said.   ''Consumers in every state will be protected by a strong federal law under this bill,'' Francis Creighton, president and chief executive officer of the association, said in a statement.   But consumer advocates do not believe it goes far enough. They would like a law that gave regulators -- such as the Federal Trade Commission or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau -- the power to oversee data security at the big credit bureaus, which could include inspections and penalties for poor practices or digital breaches. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced one such bill this year.   Such an approach would be proactive, rather than the currently reactive way of doing things, said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.   ''The fundamental premise is you want a regulator to supervise for data security at the credit bureaus and not just, 'We can take enforcement action after you messed up,'' Ms. Wu said. ''That is a different way of regulating than suing them after they've lost everyone's data.''   Another bill, introduced by Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, would essentially freeze credit reports by default. Anna Laitin, director of financial policy for Consumers Union, said that bill would ''stop identity thieves in their tracks by freezing access to credit files unless the consumer gives their consent.''   The current bill's free freeze provision was viewed as a bargaining chip -- a little goody for consumers -- in legislation that would roll back some of the banking regulations that were established after the financial crisis a decade ago. But there was also at least one nugget that would be good for the bureaus: A provision to provide free credit monitoring to active-duty members of the military would strip them of the right to take the agencies to court should something go wrong.   It remains to be seen if the House will pass the legislation, which means free credit freezes aren't guaranteed just yet. If the bill does not move ahead, states will be free to consider their own changes. Some states, for example, are considering legislation that would let consumers place a credit freeze at all three agencies by making a request at just one, Ms. Laitin said.   ''State lawmakers pioneered credit freeze protection and have been quicker to take action compared to Congress,'' she said. ''They should be allowed to continue to innovate so that consumers can more easily protect themselves from identity theft fraud.''    "
Avoiding Hacker Stereotypes,"As one of The New York Times's three Surfacing residents, I've grown accustomed to entering unfamiliar places. My job is to shed light on the world's offbeat and often misunderstood communities and subcultures, and that necessarily means stepping outside what's familiar. Still, when I decided to attend Defcon, a freewheeling hacking and cybersecurity conference held each year in Las Vegas, disconcerting advice began pouring in from all sides. Bring a loaner laptop, said Runa Sandvik, the senior director of information security for The Times, referring to a temporary machine that could be wiped clean upon my return.     Be wary of the A.T.M.s in and around the conference, said Rachel Tobac, a Defcon veteran who first suggested the story idea to me. (In the past, nearby A.T.M.s have been targeted by some attendees -- leading, in one instance, to a fraudulent A.T.M., aimed at stealing data, being placed on a casino floor.) Oh, and make sure all your software is up-to-date, she added.   Above all else: Avoid the public Wi-Fi, several people cautioned. It can make you an easy target.   The anxiety surrounding Defcon and its crowds is, of course, partly justified. (See above regarding the A.T.M.) But the general public's apprehension about the hacking world is also a result of a persistent and pervasive characterization -- in the news, in films, in novels -- of hackers as uniformly nefarious characters, prone to stealing our banking information and weaponizing our private data.   As is often the case, the truth is much more nuanced.   Within a few hours of arriving in Vegas, I found myself seated at the front of a conference room with Chris Hadnagy, a pioneer in the field of social engineering -- a branch of hacking that involves manipulating people (instead of just computer systems) to gain access to information. A social-engineering hacker, for example, might call up your cellular provider and impersonate your spouse, in hopes of hijacking your text messages -- which could then be used to bypass the two-step authentication on your email account.   Mr. Hadnagy, who for many years operated under the alias loganWHD, now works as a cybersecurity professional, consulting with and training companies to bolster their defenses. He also founded a nonprofit organization, Innocent Lives Foundation, that combats child predation.   In other words: In a world that tends to focus on villainous hackers, he's one of the good guys.   The transition that people like Mr. Hadnagy have made -- from underground hacking, using aliases, to aboveboard forms of hacking, using their real names -- is the main thrust of the article that resulted from my attending Defcon. ''Our clients are the Fortune 500 companies of the world,'' Mr. Hadnagy said, referring to his consulting work. ''You're not going to get a giant bank to pay you if they're hiring 'loganWHD.'''   But as is true with many of our Surfacing pieces, another goal was to broaden reader appreciation of something that's become increasingly apparent to me this year: that many of the world's underrepresented communities are all too often painted with a broad brush. When reporting on what's different, it's easy to be distracted by what's dramatic -- and to suggest that the most dramatic elements of a community represent the whole. This trap can sometimes result in reporting that caricatures and stereotypes.   Engaging with virtuous hackers hasn't blinded me to the threat of cyber criminals. The reach of Russian hackers during the 2016 presidential election, for example, is truly stunning -- and the details are still coming to light. But now, every time I imagine a nefarious hacker targeting a voting database to commit a crime, I can counterbalance the thought by recalling a thoughtful conversation I had with Nick Bishop and Mike Westmacott, two hackers I met at Defcon who were diligently taking apart and testing a Diebold voting machine in an attempt to identify -- and increase awareness of -- its vulnerabilities.   They weren't wearing masks, nor were they hoping to undermine anyone's vote. Freely offering up their names, they said that their goal was to help ensure the integrity of our elections.   And what made our conversation dangerous wasn't the looming threat of the public Wi-Fi. It was the power I had to misrepresent their community.

Concerns Over Tech's Dark Side Emerge at China's Internet Conference,"WUZHEN, China -- Every year at the World Internet Conference, held since 2014 in the photogenic canal town of Wuzhen near Shanghai, companies and government officials have convened to send a message: China is a high-tech force to be reckoned with. With that message now settled beyond much doubt, this year's conference showcased something different. China's tech industry is becoming more serious about grappling with its products' unintended consequences -- and about helping the government.     Discussions of technology's promise were leavened with contemplation of its darker side effects, such as fraud and data breaches. A forum on protecting personal information featured representatives from China's highest prosecutor and its powerful internet regulator. And several tech companies pledged their support for Beijing's counterterrorism efforts, even as China faces international criticism for detaining and indoctrinating Muslims in the name of fighting terrorism in the western region of Xinjiang.   ''Tencent has been dedicated to dealing with terrorist information online and other internet crimes, in line with the government's crackdown,'' Chen Yong, an executive in Tencent's security management department, said at the event.   The conference, which ends Friday, also reflected some new challenges facing China. It was held at the same time as another big event: a six-day import expo in Shanghai aimed at showing China as a big buyer of foreign goods. With American tariffs threatening to slow a weakening Chinese economy, the country's leader, Xi Jinping, spoke at the expo on Monday to proclaim that China could be a positive force in global trade.   At Wuzhen, by contrast, Mr. Xi appeared only by proxy. The head of the Communist Party's propaganda department, Huang Kunming, conveyed a message of thanks from Mr. Xi and then delivered an opening address that extolled the world-changing power of internet access.   Emissaries from Silicon Valley were also in short supply. Last year, the speakers at Wuzhen included Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, as well as Sundar Pichai of Google. This year, the sole Western tech executive to give a keynote address was Steve Mollenkopf, the chief executive of the chip maker Qualcomm.   His appearance served as a reminder of American companies' continuing travails in China, which could deepen as the two powers wrestle over high-tech supremacy. Qualcomm scrapped a $44 billion deal to buy a Dutch chip manufacturer this year after China's antitrust authorities declined to approve it, a move widely viewed as retaliation in the trade war.   Among Chinese companies this week, private enterprises showed off the ways in which they increasingly support and work with the government, while state-backed companies demonstrated they were not doomed to be tech laggards.   The Tencent executive, Mr. Chen, described in an interview the company's relationship with law enforcement.   Political activists have reported being followed based on what they have said on WeChat. Chat records have turned up as evidence in court, fueling speculation about whether Tencent, the app's developer, may be the source.   Mr. Chen said Tencent reports illegal activity discovered on its platforms to the government, after which the authorities can request specific user information. Metadata describing when and where users logged into a Tencent app can be stored for up to six months, he said. But Mr. Chen denied that the company gave law enforcement officials a back door through which they could freely peruse chat records and user data.   ''We only store the content that the law prescribes,'' he said. ''However long the law says to store it, that's how long we store it. Whatever the law says to store, that's what we store.''   In the conference's exhibition halls, there were lighter touches to be found. A company called Utry let loose several eager, if herky-jerky, robots that followed people around on wheels, offering to carry their bags. Kuaishou, the maker of a popular video app, demonstrated its facial-recognition prowess by scanning visitors' faces and then, within seconds, displaying who in its vast video library most resembled them. (The results varied.)   Facial recognition is a hot area in Chinese tech, providing the technology behind both funny video selfies and smart surveillance cameras. One company attending the conference is taking things a step further.   IrisKing, which is based in Beijing and has substantial state backing, started out by making iris-recognition software for coal mines. With their faces and fingertips covered in soot, miners needed another technology for clocking in and out of work.   Now, IrisKing's tools also help identify refugees in Syria and recover trafficked children in China, said Wang Xintao, a marketing manager for the company.   The company has also started working with the authorities in Xinjiang, Mr. Wang said. The goal? To have a database of the irises of all Xinjiang residents within two years, he said.

Leading the Charge Against Political Disinformation Online,"Follow Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @kateconger and @sheeraf. SAN FRANCISCO -- FireEye, a cybersecurity company that has been involved in a number of prominent investigations, including the 2016 attack on the Democratic National Committee, alerted Facebook in July that it had a problem. Security analysts at the company noticed a cluster of inauthentic accounts and pages on Facebook that were sharing content from a site called Liberty Front Press. It looked like a news site, but most of its content was stolen from outlets like Politico and CNN. The small amount of original material was written in choppy English.    FireEye's tip eventually led Facebook to remove 652 fake accounts and pages. And Liberty Front Press, the common thread among much of that sham activity, was linked to state media in Iran, Facebook said on Tuesday.   Facebook's latest purge of disinformation from its platforms highlighted the key role that cybersecurity outfits are playing in policing the pages of giant social media platforms. For all of their wealth and well-staffed security teams, companies like Facebook often rely on outside firms and researchers for their expertise.    The discovery of the disinformation campaign also represented a shift in the bad behavior that independent security companies are on the lookout for. Long in the business of discovering and fending off hacking attempts and all sorts of malware, security companies have expanded their focus to the disinformation campaigns that have plagued Facebook and other social media for the past few years.   Founded in 2004 in Milpitas, Calif., FireEye has a work force of about 3,000 people, a fraction of Facebook's. But it employs security analysts with particular skills, including employees who are fluent in English, Arabic, Russian, French and Italian, helping them to identify and track misinformation around the world.   Lee Foster, the manager of FireEye's information operations analysis team, described in an interview with The New York Times how his company spotted the Iranian disinformation campaign. He declined to say whether his research into the Iranian campaign was on behalf of a particular client because FireEye has a policy against naming who it is working with.   ''It started with a single social media account or a small set of accounts that were pushing this political-themed content that didn't necessarily seem in line with the personas that the accounts had adopted,'' said Mr. Foster. Many of the fake accounts, which sprawled across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Reddit, shared content from Liberty Front Press.   Over two months, Mr. Foster and a small group of analysts mapped the connections between the accounts and unearthed more of them.   The evidence pointed toward Iran. A website for Liberty Front Press was initially registered to an email linked to ads for web designers in Tehran before being switched to a registrant purportedly based in San Jose, Calif.   The web designer email had also been used to register another news site. That site, in turn, was associated with a number of email addresses linked to even more inauthentic news sites. Digging deeper, FireEye found that many of the Twitter accounts sharing Liberty Front Press content were linked to Iranian phone numbers, although the profiles claimed to be operating in the United States.   Stepping from fake news site to news site and from Twitter to Facebook, FireEye pieced together a campaign that tried to influence audiences in the Middle East, as well as in the United States, Britain and Latin America.   The analysts were careful to collect data without being noticed. ''I have to be conscious about tipping off the operators of this,'' Mr. Foster said. ''I want to make sure I've got everything, so we don't deal with one small component of the threat and we find out there's this whole other cluster of it.''   Iran's cyber capabilities have grown in recent years and Iranian hackers have been blamed for a number of significant attacks. Earlier this year,  federal law enforcement officials said nine Iranians were behind intrusions at American government agencies, universities and private companies.   Attributing attacks to Iran has been tricky. Security experts who have studied Iranian hackers said many take part in attacks, or disinformation campaigns, while they are still in college. They are often recruited for government work, but may also float in and out of government-backed contracts.   Those loose affiliations make it difficult to pinpoint which attacks are directed by Iranian authorities.   FireEye's information set off Facebook's own investigation, which uncovered three other Iranian disinformation efforts and another that appeared to originate in Russia.   One of the Iranian campaigns Facebook discovered dabbled in a mix of misinformation and more traditional hacking, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, wrote in a blog post.   ''They typically posed as news organizations and didn't reveal their true identity,'' he said. ''They also engaged in traditional cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to hack people's accounts and spread malware, which we had seen before and disrupted.''   The Russian pages discovered by Facebook were unrelated to FireEye's research. Facebook said the accounts were linked to people that law enforcement in the United States had identified as Russian military intelligence. Unlike other fake pages that have been attributed to Russians over the last year, those accounts posted content focused on politics in Syria and Ukraine.   FireEye's information operations analysis team was formed in 2016, when hacked emails from several political figures were beginning to appear on the site DCLeaks. ''All through that period, we were tracking the Russian effort to influence U.S. elections,'' Mr. Foster said. ''Obviously, social media is a very important kind of medium by which these campaigns are undertaken.''   Mr. Foster had been tracking influence campaigns long before they became a major narrative in American politics. He previously worked at iSight Partners, a cyberintelligence firm acquired by FireEye in January 2016, where he tracked so-called hacktivist groups like Anonymous.   An attack on Sony's computer network by North Korean hackers in 2014 put cybersecurity companies on notice that they had to pay more attention to information warfare. The Sony intrusion was destructive to technical systems, ''but there was more to it than that,'' Mr. Foster said. ''It was about conveying a message and trying to influence an audience.''   In time, ''we realized there was a bigger kind of potential threat there that we need to address,'' he added.   The Sony attack was also a game changer for governments and other major companies, said Graham Brookie, the director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, which has analyzed misinformation on Facebook. Thousands of embarrassing emails between Sony executives were dumped online. The hackers also stole employees' personal information, including Social Security numbers, and wiped Sony's servers.   The incident prompted officials in the United States to establish protocols for sharing information about cybersecurity threats and influence operations, Mr. Brookie said.   But information sharing still seems to have its limits.   Unlike Facebook, Twitter did not receive advance notice from FireEye about the fake Twitter profiles the security company had uncovered. Several of them were still live Tuesday night, hours after Facebook's announcement. Twitter has since suspended 284 accounts based on the information revealed by Facebook and FireEye, the company said in a tweet.   As internet outlets struggle to keep up with influence campaigns, Mr. Foster believes complex disinformation schemes will become more common.   ''What this is great for demonstrating is, it really doesn't matter what the political goals or ideological goals are, these techniques are seen as an attractive way to try to achieve them,'' Mr. Foster said.

You Don't Want the Malware Prize; TECH TIP,"Q. I keep getting these ""Congratulations!"" messages about winning prizes from Amazon.com, even when I'm not using the site. Why is this? A. Those persistent pop-up messages are not from Amazon, but are part of a wave of malicious display advertisements -- also known as ""malvertising"" -- invading desktop, Android and iPhone browsers.  The intrusive ads can also appear when browsing links that are posted on Facebook.   Malvertising has been a problem for years, but lately has become more pervasive on mobile devices. Symantec, a security company, noted this year that the ""congratulations"" malware has been making a strong push onto Android devices with a Trojan horse called Android.Fakeyouwon. In January, the cybersecurity company Confiant also outlined how the recent malware was spread across the web by fraudulent advertising agencies, which placed tainted ads on legitimate sites. If you select the pop-up's O.K. button or try to dismiss the box, the browser is typically redirected to a page that promises prizes for participation in a quiz.  Interacting with the quiz may infect your system with malware or give the scammers access to your Facebook friends list. If you get a ""congratulations"" box on your screen with no way out, forcibly quit the browser to escape. If scam messages are regularly popping up on your screen, your computer or device may be infected. To disinfect your system, run an anti-malware utility like Malwarebytes AdwCleaner for Windows; Malwarebytes for the Mac scans for adware, too. Microsoft has a Malicious Software Tool for Windows. Apple's support site has guides for blocking pop-ups in the Safari browser and clearing the history and website data from an iOS device.  The Facebook Help Center has instructions for dealing with malicious software. Google recently added new security features to its Chrome browser for desktop systems and Android to help remove pop-ups and malware, and Mozilla's site has a malware-troubleshooting guide for Firefox.

Missing From Facebook's Crisis: Mark Zuckerberg,"When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company's chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation. When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, released a statement that said ''we fell short.''    And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. ''I messed up,'' he said. ''I owe everyone an explanation.''    But in the past week, as Facebook plunged into a crisis over how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that provided voter-targeting services to the Trump campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users, Mark Zuckerberg, the social network's chief executive, said, well, nothing.   Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, has made any public appearances this week. Mr. Zuckerberg's last public post on Facebook was a March 2 photo of himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, baking hamantaschen cookies to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Purim; Ms. Sandberg's most recent post was a four-day-old photo from her child's debate competition.   [Updated: Mark Zuckerberg Breaks His Silence, Vows Action to Bolster Data Privacy]   Facebook employees have described a tense atmosphere in which some joked about selling their stock in the company before it took another dip. The company has lost about $50 billion in market value in the last couple of days. Over the past few months, as criticism of the company's role in the 2016 election has escalated, some employees have sought to transfer to other divisions of the company, such as WhatsApp and Instagram, calling their work on Facebook's main product ''demoralizing.''   On Monday, The New York Times reported that Alex Stamos, the company's chief security officer, was slated to leave the company in August after disagreements with other top executives over the handling of Russia's exploitation of Facebook's platform during the 2016 election season. On Tuesday, Brian Acton, a co-founder of WhatsApp, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion, posted a tweet that read, ''It is time. #deletefacebook.'' Mr. Acton did not return a request for comment.   Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential, said that Mr. Zuckerberg planned to address the Cambridge Analytica situation and the larger data privacy issues with a public statement on Wednesday. The statement will be aimed at rebuilding trust with users, one of the people said. In the past week, one of the people said, Mr. Zuckerberg has spent significant time hunkered down with a small group of engineers to discuss how to make Facebook's users more secure, with more control of their data.   Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg's former speechwriter, said that the Cambridge Analytica controversy was different from previous Facebook privacy scandals, in that it was about an issue at the core of the company's business model that will not be easily remedied: the disclosure of Facebook data to outside sources through its third-party developer platform.   ''My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked,'' she said.   Mr. Zuckerberg is no stranger to speaking out during times of company crisis. In 2006, users rebelled after Facebook introduced the first version of its news feed, which showed users for the first time what their friends were doing on the social network. As groups formed to protest what they felt was an incursion on their privacy, Mr. Zuckerberg posted a peacemaking note on his Facebook page.   ''Calm down. Breathe. We hear you,'' he wrote.    "
A Button Facebook Could Use: 'Why Me?',"''One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data.'' That's what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive and co-founder, said just over a week ago after revelations that the data research firm Cambridge Analytica had gained access to the profiles of 50 million Facebook users.    Over the past year, the downside of social media companies -- Facebook foremost among them -- has become glaringly apparent. They have been platforms for information campaigns that influenced elections and endangered lives. They have failed to keep users' personal information private. And the carefully targeted ads that appear on them can be, well, creepy.   Now the drumbeat for regulation of social media on both sides of the aisle -- and from many in Silicon Valley -- is getting louder by the day. ''I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,'' Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said recently.    Mr. Zuckerberg may be getting tired of other executives sniping at his company, but he needs to come up with a solution -- fast. For several weeks, I've been canvassing various technology executives, privacy advocates, academics and others to come up with some ideas about exactly what Facebook could do to fix itself.   It is not clear that Facebook will be able to stave off regulators, but Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues might want to consider this: a ''Why Me?'' button. (Google, Amazon and others might want to take note, too.)   Facebook suffers from a lack of trust because of the asymmetrical nature of the relationship users have with it. We provide it all sorts of information. But we have no idea how the information is being used, how our data is being harvested, how that data is being commingled and cross-referenced with other data sets and ultimately sold to advertisers. (Facebook already has a button, relatively buried in a list of other items, that it calls ''Why Am I Seeing This Ad?'' It is, to some degree, a crippled version of what I'm suggesting should be introduced on all of Facebook's properties.)   To his credit, Mr. Zuckerberg does appear to recognize the problem that his company faces over privacy concerns. After acknowledging that protecting users' data is one of the company's biggest responsibilities, he went on to say, ''If you think about what our services are, at their most basic level, you put some content into a service, whether it's a photo or a video or a text message -- whether it's Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram -- and you're trusting that that content is going to be shared with the people you want to share it with.''   But the solution Facebook offered last week -- putting all of your privacy settings on one screen and blocking some third parties from access to data -- is just a Band-Aid. It's a start, but it doesn't provide a road map for how your information is being used.   That's where the ''Why Me?'' button could help. This button would sit next to every advertisement and piece of content that appears before you on all of Facebook's properties, including Instagram and WhatsApp.   If you saw an ad or an article pop up on your screen, you could click the ''Why Me?'' button. Then you would see a full explanation of why that item was pushed to you.   The ''Why Me?'' explanation would not just include the name of the advertiser, but what keywords, demographics or other information the advertiser specifically targeted. It would also offer a full rundown of how your information fit into the parameters of the advertiser's request and where that information came from.   Maybe Facebook saw that you had clicked on a pair of sneakers on a different service that shares information with Facebook. The ''Why Me?'' section would show you when and where that information was collected. Did Facebook notice you searched for a new cellphone plan? Facebook would tell how it knew that, too.   Did Facebook use artificial intelligence to find your face in an image without you or anyone else labeling it? The ''Why Me?'' section would show you the images that the artificial intelligence system cross-referenced to identify you. Did Facebook scrape another site or buy information about you that it commingled with the data that you had provided? It would tell you that, too.   Most important, at every point in the ''explanation tree,'' the user would have the option to turn off or disable that specific piece of data. Facebook, of course, could -- and probably should -- explain the trade-offs of such decisions.   The ''Why Me?'' button could also be extended to content. When a friend or company shares a post, Facebook doesn't just display it to everyone listed as the poster's friend or follower. Facebook's algorithms choose which friends and followers see it based on all sorts of parameters, usually related to the kind of content or how you've interacted with the friend in the past.   The ''Why Me?'' button should explain all the data points that are used in the calculation and how they are weighted.   The current ''Why Am I Seeing This Ad?'' often says something like: ''Company A wants to reach people ages 18 and older who live or were recently in the United States. This is information based on your Facebook profile and where you've connected to the internet.''   But it hardly tells you the whole story. Facebook doesn't say so explicitly, but it allows companies to upload their own databases, cross-reference them with Facebook's data and use that information to serve ads to users. It also doesn't say how that other site originally got that information about who you are.   In fairness, the ''Why Me?'' button might create all sorts of problems for Facebook, and its advertisers, too. It would allow users -- and rivals -- to reverse engineer much of the way the system works. And advertisers would probably object to the idea of making their targeting plans public. But that would be the cost of using such large public platforms with such exact targeting.   It has become something of a cliché, but in 1913, before he became a Supreme Court justice, Louis D. Brandeis said, ''Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.''   It could well be applied today at Facebook -- and its peer companies -- if it wants to avoid a governmental crackdown.    "
"Protect People, Not Data","Alvaro M. Bedoya is the founder of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy & Technology. Mark Zuckerberg promises that Facebook can do better to protect our privacy. Three times during his testimony before Congress on Tuesday, he used the same example: Face recognition technology, he explained, should require ''special consent'' from users. He left out a key fact: This week, lobbyists paid by Facebook are working with Illinois lawmakers backed by Facebook to gut the state's face recognition privacy law, the strongest in the nation. This should make us very skeptical about any calls for a broad, European-style privacy law that would apply across technologies and platforms. We cannot underestimate the tech sector's power in Congress and in state legislatures. If the United States tries to pass broad rules for personal data, that effort may well be co-opted by Silicon Valley, and we'll miss our best shot at meaningful privacy protections.     In 1995, the E.U. passed broad privacy laws that applied to almost all personal data. The United States has taken a different path. Companies that collect consumer data can't defraud or mislead their customers, and the Federal Trade Commission is a watchdog for those standards. Beyond those foundational protections, Congress has historically protected our data through ''sectoral'' laws that set specific rules for specific industries. Thus, records on the videos you watch, your credit report, health history, and other kinds of data are all protected by slightly different rules.   This is far from a perfect system, and a flood of tech sector lobbying has made it worse. Since 2009, Facebook has increased its spending on lobbying fiftyfold. And the $11.5 million it spent in 2017 still ranked it third behind Amazon and Alphabet. Lobbying works. Congress hasn't passed a single new major privacy law since a 2009 update to federal health privacy rules. Take a second to think of technologies popularized in the last nine years: drones, self-driving cars, Amazon Echo, Google Home, among others. If it blossomed after 2009, chances are, it is not regulated by any federal privacy law.   What does that flood of lobbying look like? From 2011 to 2014, as a staffer for Senator Al Franken, then chairman of the Senate privacy subcommittee, I worked to pass a bill to force companies to ask for users' permission before collecting or sharing records of their movements. The bill would have outlawed so-called ''stalking apps'' that let abusers secretly track their victims' locations through their smartphones. Industry lobbyists outnumbered our supporters 54 to 2. Yet in 2012, thanks to a small coalition of privacy, women's rights, and anti-stalking groups, we managed to pass the bill out of the Judiciary Committee.   That's when the lobbying really started. When I called a meeting of industry stakeholders, I had to move it from our 12-person conference table to the full Judiciary Committee hearing room, which seats four or five times that. The bill stalled. It was never again brought up for a vote.   Passing a strong industry-specific privacy law is tough. But at least it's possible. When the Obama administration tried to pass an omnibus privacy bill, the law's original framework was promising. It stressed that consumers needed control of their information, transparency about how it was used, and accountability when it was abused. In 2015, after Silicon Valley weighed in, the bill that the White House put forward was so toothless that almost every major consumer privacy group opposed it. Around the time our anti-stalking bill stalled, I remember a lobbyist telling me that we should really consider setting our bill aside until Congress could pass a comprehensive privacy law. Now I know why.   It could be that the Cambridge Analytica scandal will pave the way for previously impossible, European-style reforms. Facebook's actions tell a different story. Even as it yells mea culpa, Facebook is calculating that it can kneecap new privacy rules with impunity. Facebook is spending its lobbying money not only to gut the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act but also to stop a new California consumer privacy ballot initiative.   Those calculations are right -- if we make this a broad debate about ''personal data.'' Let's make this a debate about people and pass laws to address the threats they actually face. Let's talk about the people who are still stalked every year through their smartphones. Or how retailers secretly use face recognition to spot shoplifters, even though the technology misfires more often when trying to identify African-Americans and women. Let's make this a debate about how Facebook tracked people to determine if they had an ''affinity'' for African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians, and then let advertisers block those people from seeing real estate ads.   It's one thing to pit internet companies against the idea of ''privacy.'' It's another to show a lawmaker the real people in her district who will be hurt by her failure to act. In 1967, Justice Potter Stewart declared that the Fourth Amendment ''protects people, not places.'' It's time to recognize that privacy protects people, not data.

How Facebook Lets Brands And Politicians Target You,"One in five dollars spent on online advertising in the United States currently goes to Facebook. The power of the company's ad platform comes from the ability it gives politicians, brands, real estate agents, nonprofits and others to precisely target people on its social networks. Facebook has expanded its ad apparatus over time by continuously accumulating details about its users and turning those details into targetable data points. As its has grown, however, the company has drawn the scrutiny of privacy advocates, regulators and lawmakers around the world. The Early Days When Facebook introduced its ad platform in 2007, advertisers could target people using information they had volunteered on the platform. This is what a typical target audience might have looked like with those options: Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college and is 18 to 22.     In 2009, Facebook added several features, including the ability for users to click a ''like'' button on posts in their newsfeed, which refined the list of interests that advertisers could target. The company also introduced ways for advertisers to target friends of those who had interacted with their brands, and to target ads to people by age or birthday.   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college and is 21.   Introducing Third-Party Data   Three years later, Facebook introduced Custom Audiences, a feature that allowed companies to upload their own lists of people to target. A retailer, for example, could upload its customer list and target ads at those who had recently bought a specific kind of T-shirt.   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21 and has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year.   Of course, companies were not limited to using lists of their own customers. They could also upload lists of consumers bought from third-party marketing firms known as data brokers. Data brokers collect vast troves of information from public records, retailers who sell customer information and other sources. The brokers combine that data into consumer profiles, and then resell lists filtered to target certain demographics. By this time, targeting ads to people based on their interests had become a common online-advertising practice, and marketers and researchers were beginning to tap into big data analysis to push that practice further. In 2013, a researcher working for the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica released a personality quiz that people could take on Facebook, with the results indicating how open, conscientiousness, extroverted, agreeable or neurotic they were. The researcher compared the quiz results with what those who took it had liked on Facebook, ultimately determining which interests corresponded with which personality traits. Using that method, which had been developed by researchers at Cambridge University, targeting certain interests was now tantamount to targeting personality traits.   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21, has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year and is neurotic.   Around 2014, Facebook's ad program began to evolve dramatically, allowing advertisers to pinpoint people even more precisely than before. By then, more than 1.2 billion people on average used the social network every day. One new feature, Partner Categories, brought hundreds of targeting options from data brokers into Facebook's ad platform. Brands could now target people based on demographics like salary; number of open credit lines; car make and model; and whether a user fit into a category such as ''trendy moms.''   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21, has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than $28,000 a year and is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months.   In 2014, the company also introduced what it called Lookalike Audiences, a feature that allowed organizations that uploaded customer lists to also target people who had profiles similar to those customers.   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21, has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than $28,000 a year and is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months. Plus, anyone on Facebook who is similar to them.   Tracking You Around the Web and Guessing Your Ethnicity In mid-2014, Facebook incorporated users' online browsing history into its ad-targeting platform. The company had been collecting browsing data for years, from any web page that included a Facebook like button or had let people log in through their Facebook accounts. The company used the browsing data -- from, say, a user's visits to several websites while she shopped for a new tent -- to refine the specific interests that advertisers could target and to give them more confidence about what they were targeting.   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21, has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than $28,000 a year, is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months and is interested in camping. Plus, anyone on Facebook who is similar to them.   Around this time, Facebook also added a targeting option called Ethnic Affinity. The company does not ask users to identify their race, but it assigns ethnicities based on activities such as the content and pages that users like. A user could be categorized as African-American, for example, because his Facebook activity ''aligns with African-American multicultural affinity.'' The other ethnicities that can be assigned are Hispanic and Asian-American.   Anyone who lives in Philadelphia, studies philosophy in college, is 21, has bought a blue T-shirt in the past year, is neurotic, makes less than $28,000 a year, is likely to buy a minivan in the next six months, is interested in camping and whose interests align with those of African-Americans. Plus, anyone on Facebook who is similar to them.   The recent revelation that Cambridge Analytica collected information of up to 87 million Facebook users has renewed concerns about privacy on the platform, and has prompted the company to pledge to improve its privacy tools and transparency and to re-think at least one aspect of its ad practices. The company has already said it would drop targeting options based on third-party data from its advertising platform. The changes coincide with the introduction of a new law in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation. The law, which is to take effect next month, requires technology companies to limit their collection of user data to what they need to perform services, and to obtain customers' consent for how their data will be used and with whom it will be shared. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has said the company would offer all of its users the same privacy required under the European law, regardless of where they live.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Device Companies Have Vast Access To Facebook Data,"As Facebook sought to become the world's dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users' personal information. Facebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers -- including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung -- over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, ''like'' buttons and address books.    But the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company's privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users' friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users' friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.   Most of the partnerships remain in effect, though Facebook began winding them down in April. The company came under intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators after news reports in March that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, misused the private information of tens of millions of Facebook users.    In the furor that followed, Facebook's leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users' friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.   ''You might think that Facebook or the device manufacturer is trustworthy,'' said Serge Egelman, a privacy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the security of mobile apps. ''But the problem is that as more and more data is collected on the device -- and if it can be accessed by apps on the device -- it creates serious privacy and security risks.''   In interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners' servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.   The company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.   ''These partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,'' said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of ''the Facebook experience,'' the officials said.   Some device partners can retrieve Facebook users' relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.   Facebook's view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user's Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.   In interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.   ''It's like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,'' said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.'s chief technologist.   Details of Facebook's partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.   In a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.''Every piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,'' he testified. ''You have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.''   But the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook's platform.   ''This was flagged internally as a privacy issue,'' said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. ''It is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook's testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.''   The partnerships were briefly mentioned in documents submitted to German lawmakers investigating the social media giant's privacy practices and released by Facebook in mid-May. But Facebook provided the lawmakers with the name of only one partner -- BlackBerry, maker of the once-ubiquitous mobile device -- and little information about how the agreements worked.   The submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users' privacy rights.   ''What we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,'' Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. ''I would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.''   In interviews with The Times, Facebook identified other partners: Apple and Samsung, the world's two biggest smartphone makers, and Amazon, which sells tablets.   An Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.   Samsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.   Usher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company ''did not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,'' adding that ''BlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.''   Microsoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft's servers.   Facebook acknowledged that some partners did store users' data -- including friends' data -- on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.   ''I am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook's corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,'' said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.   The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.   Those developers relied on Facebook's public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.   At the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook's direct control.   Facebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.   The broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.   The decree barred Facebook from overriding users' privacy settings without first getting explicit consent. That agreement stemmed from an investigation that found Facebook had allowed app developers and other third parties to collect personal details about users' friends, even when those friends had asked that their information remain private.   After the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook's continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.   Facebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as ''service providers,'' akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.   ''These contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook's F.T.C. consent decree,'' Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.   But Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission's earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.   ''Under Facebook's interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,'' said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. ''They could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.''   To test one partner's access to Facebook's private data channels, The Times used a reporter's Facebook account -- with about 550 friends -- and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google's Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)   Immediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, ''about'' information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter's private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.   The data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.   The Hub also requested -- and received -- data that Facebook's policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter's Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.   The BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.   In all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.    "
Privacy Policies Don't Work,"Joseph Turow is a professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. True or false: ''When a website has a privacy policy, it means the site will not share my information with other websites or companies without my permission.''    According to my research -- a nationally representative phone survey conducted in January and February -- a majority of Americans think this is true.   It isn't. Not even close.    Over the past 15 years, I've conducted six national surveys with colleagues about how people see and think about their privacy in both the online and offline worlds. In each survey we've included a statement roughly like the one above. The picture is consistent: When people see the phrase ''privacy policy,'' most assume their information is kept private.   It's a misleading label. In reality, these policies explain how companies will use your information -- because they are using it.   To be clear, it is lawful -- and common -- for websites to trade most types of information about us without asking. The reason ''privacy policy'' is a ubiquitous phrase is that since 1998, the Federal Trade Commission has strongly suggested that all websites (and, later, all apps) include a disclosure about what they do with visitor data and what choices visitors have regarding those uses. What lies behind these links is a cavalcade of disclosures of how businesses across the internet track us, target us and trade our information.   Consider Target's privacy policy, which is perfectly legal and not at all unusual. Target collects data about you across its website and app, in addition to knowing what you buy. It uses the information for its own marketing purposes. It also allows ''third-party companies'' to collect ''certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications.'' In other words, it can share the data it collects with just about anyone.   But Target is not just profiling you based on how you shop with Target. It may also collect what you say on any blogs, chat rooms and social networks you use, and it may obtain ''demographic and other information'' about you from ''third parties.''   You have to assume that Target can purchase any known information about you held by any other company. Not even your body is off limits -- cameras in some stores ''may use biometrics, including facial recognition,'' for theft prevention and security.   Our surveys consistently show that Americans dislike being tracked. Why, then, aren't Americans more angry and opposed to how often and extensively businesses track them?   One reason: Most Americans don't read privacy policies, and so they aren't aware of what is going on.   The words ''privacy policy'' may well be a big part of the problem. The very fact that a company seems to have a policy on privacy gives consumers a false belief that the company won't share their information without permission -- a reason not to click and learn more.   In addition to the ''privacy policy'' label defusing public anger against commercial surveillance, it may also distract people from the need for effective privacy laws. Two of our surveys asked people whether they agreed or disagreed that ''existing laws and organizational practices provide a reasonable level of protection for consumer privacy today.''   We found that among people who understood the ''privacy policy'' label's correct meaning, a majority thought privacy laws needed to be stronger. By contrast, among those who misunderstood what ''privacy policy'' means, a majority saw no need for organizational and legislative changes in the service of privacy.   It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the term ''privacy policy'' benefits data collectors over the public. The label's phrasing was not a result of research or agency deliberation. In fact, back in 1998 the F.T.C. used the phrase ''information practice statement'' for the data-disclosure document it wanted. It didn't take hold, possibly because companies realized that ''privacy policy'' embodied the ambiguity they wanted.   Fifteen years of research consistently shows that the label is deceptive -- depending on the survey, between 54 percent and 73 percent of Americans assume companies won't share their information without permission.   One solution would be for the F.T.C., which is mandated to police deceptive corporate practices, to rule that only sites and apps that don't share people's information without their permission can use that phrase. Otherwise, they should use a more accurate label, such as ''how we use your information.''   Companies don't want people to realize how extensively they use our information and are likely to object to this new, clearer phrasing. Yet it is a struggle worth pursuing in the interest of creating transparency around the name of a document that has been mistitled and misunderstood since its inception.

Senators Call for Paper Ballots to Combat Russian Election Meddling,"Follow Nicholas Fandos and Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter: @npfandos and @AllMattNYT. WASHINGTON -- The Senate Intelligence Committee offered recommendations on Tuesday for securing American elections from foreign attacks, pressing states to buy voting machines that produce paper ballots and to secure voter databases, and calling for better cooperation between state and federal elections officials ahead of November's midterm elections. The committee's recommendations -- the first such disclosure in its year-old investigation into Russia's 2016 election meddling -- covered much of what experts and intelligence officials have been urging elections authorities to do for months. Yet the panel also urged the Trump administration to make clear that it would not tolerate any attacks on systems used to run elections.     ''The U.S. government should clearly communicate to adversaries that an attack on our election infrastructure is a hostile act, and we will respond accordingly,'' the committee's Republican chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, and Democratic vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said in a statement.   The administration has been criticized for what many consider a tepid response to Russian interference in 2016 election and warnings about Moscow targeting this November's elections.   Top American intelligence officials have warned that Russia sees its digital campaign to fan the country's social and political divisions in 2016 as a success, and is already meddling in the midterm elections. A central focus of the campaign -- the use of fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and disinformation -- has carried on unabated, the officials said.   Federal officials have also concluded that Russian hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and breached that of at least one, Illinois, during the last election cycle. No votes were changed, though.   Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate committee at a hearing last month that the intelligence agencies were still grappling with these twin challenges: neutralizing Moscow's disinformation campaign and securing the integrity of vulnerable election systems around the country. The senators shared that assessment.   ''The Russians were relentless in attempting to meddle in the 2016 elections, and they will continue their efforts to undermine public confidence in Western democracies and in the legitimacy of our elections,'' Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, told reporters on Tuesday after the recommendations were released.   The senators called on Congress to ''urgently'' make available funds and other resources for states to update voting software and systems, institute vote audits and hire additional staff and contractors focused on cybersecurity.   The senators said 14 states had used at least some machines in 2016 without a paper trail that could be audited. Five states used only those machines.   At the same time, they took pains to make clear that while it was the states' responsibility to run their own elections, the federal government should play a significant role in monitoring threats and providing resources. Both were to blame for missteps in 2016, they said.   ''We were all disappointed that states, the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security were not more on their game in advance of the 2016 elections,'' Mr. Warner said. While the department had made important improvements since then, he added, it was still a work in progress.   The senators pointed to top state election officials, who have complained in recent weeks that the federal government has left them in the dark on specifics of the threat to voter databases, machines and other systems.   The Intelligence Committee is likely to try to illustrate those breakdowns and possible solutions on Wednesday during a hearing with Homeland Security and state election officials on attempted attacks by the Russians on state election systems in 2016 and the federal response.   The committee has also assembled a classified written report on election security. But the document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for review and declassification before it can be released publicly, which could take weeks or months.   More than a year into its investigation into Russia's meddling, the Intelligence Committee has thus far offered little visibility into its work. Witnesses have come and gone in relative secret. Staff members and lawmakers have pored over thousands of pages of documents related to the Trump campaign, as well as sensitive government secrets.   And while the House Intelligence Committee shut down its investigation last week amid rancorous partisan disputes, the Senate panel is said to be nowhere near completion, with months of work left to go. Whether the increased scrutiny that comes with being the only remaining investigation on Capitol Hill will change that remains unclear.   In a show of bipartisan resolve, nearly every member of the committee took part in Tuesday's announcement and those who spoke endorsed the committee's findings.   The committee's leaders had last updated the public on the investigation in October, when they said that a review had broadly confirmed the conclusions of American spy agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a campaign of hacking and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. They said then that their investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian effort was still open.   Mr. Burr said that Tuesday's recommendations and the accompanying report would be the first in a series of findings that the committee would release in the coming months, as it closed out portions of the investigation. He said to expect the next update from the committee in about a month.   The panel does not plan to draft specific legislation related to its election security findings given its lack of jurisdiction, but Mr. Burr said its members would work with the relevant committees to implement the recommendations. Lawmakers in both chambers have introduced competing bills to address security at the ballot box and cyberdefenses, but Republican leaders who control the House and Senate have shown little interest in advancing them.   The House panel, for its part, is scheduled to vote on Thursday to release a final report drafted by Republicans that includes more than 20 election-related recommendations.    "
"Pick Up Pace on Safeguarding Elections for Midterms, Senators Urge","WASHINGTON -- Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee pressured Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, on Wednesday to speed up key election security measures, even as she trumpeted the adoption of important improvements ahead of November's midterm elections. Ms. Nielsen told the senators, who are investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election, that the department made significant strides in recent months working with state and local election officials to improve communication about threats and share cybersecurity resources. Those efforts include comprehensive risk assessments and cyberscans meant to identify vulnerabilities in election systems.     But under questioning, Ms. Nielsen signaled that one of those undertakings, to grant full security clearances to state election officials so they could receive classified information on cybersecurity threats in a timely way, had been slow going. Of the up to 150 state election officials designated to receive clearances, only about 20 have them, she said.   In the meantime, Ms. Nielsen said, the department would share necessary threat information with relevant state officials regardless of their clearance.   Republicans and Democrats on the committee made clear that they expected more.   ''When I listen to your testimony, I hear no sense of urgency to really get on top of this issue,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.   Wednesday's session was the secretive committee's first public hearing designed to scrutinize findings from its year-old investigation into Russia's interference campaign. It followed the committee's release  on Tuesday of a set of recommendations for state and federal officials to shore up the ballot box.   That effort appeared likely to get substantial resources on Wednesday, as congressional leaders completed a more than $1 trillion government funding bill that included hundreds of millions of dollars for election security. The bill, which is expected to pass later this week, includes $380 million for state grants to improve election infrastructure, as well as $307 million above what the Trump administration had requested for the F.B.I. that can be used to combat cyberattacks, election fraud and other crimes.   Top federal officials have concluded that Russian hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and breached that of at least one, Illinois, during the last election cycle. No votes were changed, but the effort -- alongside a concerted Russian disinformation and hacking campaign -- exposed dangerous vulnerabilities in the voting systems and the government's ability to respond.   American intelligence officials have warned that Russia considered its campaign to sow social and political divisions in 2016 a success, and is already meddling in the midterm elections. A central tool of the campaign -- fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and disinformation -- continues to be used unabated, the officials said.   Ms. Nielsen echoed those concerns on Wednesday, making clear that with voting already underway in primary elections around the country, the threat was not over.   ''We think the threat remains high. We think vigilance remains important. And we think there is a lot we need to do at all levels of government before the midterms,'' Ms. Nielsen said. ''Once these vulnerabilities have been made clear, it's not just Russia we have to worry about.''   There are other challenges, Ms. Nielsen said. She noted that two states were not cooperating with the department to ensure that their systems were safe.   Ms. Nielsen appeared alongside Jeh Johnson, who was President Barack Obama's homeland security secretary during the 2016 election. Mr. Johnson was asked several times why his department and other Obama administration officials had not done more to warn state election officials and the public about the threats in the run-up to the election.   He repeatedly defended his decision-making, saying that some states had rebuffed federal outreach and that the department had been able to directly assist more than 30 others. Mr. Johnson also lamented that greater heed was not taken of an October 2016 statement he signed with the director of national intelligence alerting the public to the Russian intrusion into election systems.   ''Frankly, it did not get the attention that I thought it should have received,'' he said, noting that the statement was issued the same day that the infamous ''Access Hollywood'' tape surfaced.   Some senators went further.   Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats, warned bluntly that the threat was ''not being treated with the urgency that it deserves'' and that a patchwork of defenses would mean little without a comprehensive cyberdeterrence strategy. Of the Russians' targeting of state systems in 2016, he said, ''What it looks like is a test.''   ''This country has to wake up,'' he said, later telling Ms. Nielsen, ''I encourage you to go back with your hair on fire.''   The recommendations released by the committee on Tuesday -- the first such disclosure in its investigation -- covered much of what experts and intelligence officials have been urging election authorities to do for months.   The panel also pressed the Trump administration to make it clear that any attack on an American election would be viewed as a hostile act.   Those recommendations come from a fuller classified report on election security that the committee has prepared. The fuller document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for declassification before it can be released publicly, a process that could take weeks or months. The committee's chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said on Wednesday that it would release an overview of its findings in the interim.   The committee is expected to prepare similar reports in the coming months on other areas of investigation, including the Russians' use of social media and whether the Trump campaign aided the meddling campaign.

Joy Reid Says She Did Not Write 'Hateful Things' but Cannot Prove Hacking,"Joy Reid, the MSNBC host who accused hackers of inserting homophobic posts into her now-defunct blog, said on Saturday that while she continued to deny having written the offensive language, security experts could not conclusively say her blog was breached. ''I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things, because they are completely alien to me,'' she said on her morning show, ''AM Joy.'' ''But I can definitely understand, based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past, why some people don't believe me.''     She hired a cybersecurity expert to see if her former blog had been manipulated, she said, but ''the reality is, they have not been able to prove it.''   The posts containing the offensive language,  which Mediaite wrote about on Monday, said that ''most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing'' and that ''a lot of heterosexuals, especially men, find the idea of homosexual sex to be ... well ... gross.''   They also allegedly showed Ms. Reid arguing against legalized gay marriage and criticizing commentators who supported it, including Rachel Maddow, who is now one of Ms. Reid's colleagues at MSNBC.   On Saturday morning, Ms. Reid devoted about 30 minutes of her show to the controversy, speaking with a supportive panel of experts who fight for L.G.B.T. rights.   ''I have not been exempt from being dumb or cruel or hurtful to the very people I want to advocate for,'' said Ms. Reid, 49. ''I own that. I did it. And for that I am truly, truly sorry.''   Most of Ms. Reid's guests commended her for recognizing that her words had been hurtful, and redirected the conversation to Washington and the Trump administration's policies.   ''The reality is that while we're having conversations about what may or may not have been said 10 years ago, we should be having conversations about what was tweeted 10 seconds ago,'' said Danielle Moodie-Mills, a public relations executive who hosts ''Woke AF'' on SiriusXM, the satellite radio provider.   ''There are bans that are still up at the Supreme Court right now to keep Muslims out of America,'' she added, as well as efforts to ''kick patriotic trans people out of the military. And that's coming from the Oval Office right now.''   Ms. Reid's posts emerged on social media this month via the Twitter user @Jamie_Maz. In December, the same account shared posts in which Ms. Reid  taunted Charlie Crist, the Democratic former Florida governor, as a closeted gay man whose heterosexual marriage was a political front. Late last year, she apologized and Mr. Crist responded, ''Long forgotten, but thank you, Joy. I appreciate you.''   It's not the first time Ms. Reid's words have stoked controversy.   On Saturday she apologized for some of her past tweets, including ones in which she mocked the conservative commentator Ann Coulter by ''using transgender stereotypes.'' Ms. Reid grew up in a household that had conservative values on L.G.B.T. issues, she said, but ''those tweets were wrong and horrible.''   ''I look back today at some of the ways I've talked casually about people and gender identity and sexual orientation and I wonder who that even was,'' she added. ''But the reality is that like a lot of people in this country, that person was me.''   She did not take ownership of the most recently surfaced blog posts, however. In a statement this week to Mediaite, Ms. Reid said that her website had been breached and that the posts were fabricated by hackers intending to defame her.   She said in the statement that ''an unknown, external party accessed and manipulated material from my now-defunct blog,'' and that she had retained an online security expert to investigate. ''I can state unequivocally,'' she wrote, that the resurfaced posts do ''not represent the original entries.''   Ms. Reid's former blog posts were discovered via the Wayback Machine, an archive of more than two decades of web history. On Tuesday, the Internet Archive, which runs the Wayback Machine, responded to Ms. Reid's claim that her posts had been hacked, saying in a statement that it had found no evidence of hacking in the archived versions of her site.   Ms. Reid's security consultant, Jonathan Nichols, responded that ''at no time has Ms. Reid claimed that the Wayback Machine was hacked'' with an intention to alter her blog. Instead, he said Ms. Reid's team detected a ''breach'' of her blog but that it was unrelated to the ''fraudulent'' posts.   Ms. Reid ran her blog, ''The Reid Report,'' in the mid-2000s while writing about politics for The Miami Herald, long before she started working at MSNBC, where she once had a daily show with the same name.   She has emerged as a rising star at MSNBC, galvanizing liberal viewers with her forceful interviews with supporters of President Trump and tough commentary on politics and race. ''AM Joy,'' her morning show, has risen in the ratings since its debut in 2016, and Ms. Reid was a frequent substitute for the network's marquee prime time hosts, including Ms. Maddow.   Ms. Reid is also a columnist for The Daily Beast, whose executive editor said it ''hit pause'' on her columns while it investigated her claims that she had been hacked, CNN reported.   The Daily Beast said it found errors in Mr. Nichols's methodology and concluded that ''the indicators of hacked posts don't bear out.''   On Saturday, Ms. Reid noted that she ''should have known better'' than to have ever written or tweeted words that were homophobic or transphobic, ''even a decade ago, when the country was in a very different place.''   ''But I cannot take any of that back,'' she added. ''I can only say that the person I am now is not the person I was then.''    "
"A Robocall Attack? Here's How to Repel Or, Better, Retaliate","An unfamiliar number appears on your cellphone. It's from your area code, so you answer it, thinking it might be important. There is an unnatural pause after you say hello, and what follows is a recording telling you how you can reduce your credit card interest rates or electric bill or prescription drug costs or any of a number of other sales pitches.    Another day, another irritating robocall. If it feels as if your cellphone has increasingly been flooded with them, you're right.   ____    Enjoying this guide from Smarter Living? Subscribe to its newsletter here for a weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.   ____   Ryan Kalember, senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company in Sunnyvale, Calif., said the volume of robocalls has seen a ''particularly big uptick'' in recent years.   In a Robocall Strike Force Report in October 2016, the Federal Communications Commission said telemarketing calls were the No. 1 consumer complaint.   Citing statistics from YouMail, a developer of robocall-blocking software, the commission said consumers received an estimated 2.4 billion robocalls per month last year, driven in part by internet-powered phone systems that have made it cheap and easy to make them from anywhere in the world.   Alex Quilici, chief executive of YouMail, said his company estimated that 2.3 billion calls were made in December 2016, up from 1.5 billion in December 2015. The company said it extrapolates data from the calls made each month to its users.   More than annoying, the calls can cross over into the outright fraudulent. In one scheme, callers pretending to represent the Internal Revenue Service claim the person answering the phone owes back taxes and threatens them with legal action. The scheme has reaped more than $54 million, the F.C.C. said.   ''If the robocalls were not valuable to the scammers, they wouldn't be doing them,'' Mr. Kalember said.   Here's how you can fight them:   Rule No. 1   The most simple and effective remedy is to not answer numbers you don't know, Mr. Quilici said.   ''Just interacting with these calls is just generally a mistake,'' he said.   If you do answer, don't respond to the invitation to press a number to opt out. That will merely verify that yours is a working number and make you a target for more calls, experts said.   Turn to the government   List your phones on the National Do Not Call Registry. If your number is on the registry and you do get unwanted calls, report them.   Mr. Quilici said the registry is helpful but should not be seen as a panacea.   ''If I'm sitting in India dialing a million numbers, what are the odds I'm even going to be fined for violating the Do Not Call Registry?'' he asked. ''It's probably near zero.''   Turn to technology   Download apps such as Truecaller, RoboKiller, Mr. Number, Nomorobo and Hiya, which will block the calls. YouMail will stop your phone from ringing with calls from suspected robocallers and deliver a message that your number is out of service.   Mr. Quilici said phone companies, such as T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T, also have tools to combat robocalls. They work by blocking calls from numbers known to be problematic.   Turn the tables   And then there is the Jolly Roger Telephone Company, which turns the tables on telemarketers. This program allows a customer to put the phone on mute and patch telemarketing calls to a robot, which understands speech patterns and inflections and works to keep the caller engaged.   Subscribers can choose robot personalities, such as Whiskey Jack, who is frequently distracted by a game he is watching on television, or Salty Sally, a frazzled mother.   The robots string the callers along with vocal fillers like ''Uh-huh'' and ''O.K., O.K.'' After several minutes, some will ask the callers to repeat their sales pitch from the beginning, prompting the telemarketers to have angry meltdowns, according to sample recordings posted on the company's website.   Watch what you say   One recent scheme involves getting consumers to say ''yes'' and later using a recording of the response to allow unauthorized charges on the person's credit card account, the F.C.C. warned in March.   When the caller asks, ''Can you hear me?'' and the consumer answers ''yes,'' the caller can gain a voice signature that can later be used to authorize fraudulent charges by telephone.   Best to answer with ''I can hear you,'' Mr. Kalember said.   What's ahead   The callers are evolving, Mr. Kalember said. Some have numbers that appear to be from your area code (they result in higher response rates); others employ ''imitation of life'' software in which the robocall sounds like a live person, complete with coughing, laughing and background noise. This artificial intelligence can be programmed to interact in real time with a consumer.   A recording on the Consumers Union website features an exchange in which a man tries to confirm he is talking to a live person. As the call progresses, the consumer presses for confirmation.   ''Will you tell me you're not a robot? Just say, 'I'm not a robot' please,'' he says, which is met with various programmed replies of ''I am a real person'' and ''There is a live person here.''   Why do robocalls proliferate?   Mr. Quilici compared robocalling to spam emails: It is all about volume. Companies can use software to make millions of calls at very little expense. They need only a few victims to fall prey to their schemes to more than cover their costs.   ''When you hear these guys do these scam pitches, they're pretty amazing,'' he said.   The next development will be integrated efforts combining email, phone calls and social media to scheme money from consumers, Mr. Kalember said, adding that the level of innovation ''is really quite astounding.''

Facebook Busts A Shadowy Plot To Jolt Elections,"Follow Kevin Roose and Nicholas Fandos on Twitter: @kevinroose and @npfandos. WASHINGTON -- Facebook said on Tuesday that it had identified a political influence campaign that was potentially built to disrupt the midterm elections, with the company detecting and removing 32 pages and fake accounts that had engaged in activity around divisive social issues. The company did not definitively link the campaign to Russia. But Facebook officials said some of the tools and techniques used by the accounts were similar to those used by the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-linked group that was at the center of an indictment this year alleging interference in the 2016 presidential election.    Facebook said it had discovered coordinated activity around issues like a sequel to last year's deadly ''Unite the Right'' white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Activity was also detected around #AbolishICE, a left-wing campaign on social media that seeks to end the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.   ''At this point in our investigation, we do not have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind it,'' said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy. ''But we can say that these accounts engaged in some similar activity and have connected with known I.R.A accounts.''    The jolting disclosure, delivered to lawmakers in private briefings on Capitol Hill this week and in a public Facebook post on Tuesday, underscored how behind-the-scenes interference in the November elections had begun.   In recent weeks, there have been reports of other meddling, including a Daily Beast report that the office of Claire McCaskill of Missouri, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Democrats up for re-election this fall, was unsuccessfully targeted by Russian hackers last year, which Ms. McCaskill confirmed. American intelligence officials have indicated that at least one other unnamed Democratic senator up for re-election has been targeted.   Officials at Facebook, which is based in Silicon Valley, said they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies on their discovery of the influence campaign. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and other executives also mounted a media blitz to explain what the company did and did not know about the efforts.   Those actions were a change from last year, when Facebook was widely criticized for failing to detect Russian interference in the 2016 election. It took Facebook executives months to acknowledge the extent of the Russian operation and release information connected with their investigation.   Since then, Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators for other scandals, including data misuse, a misinformation epidemic and accusations of political bias. Last week, the company lost over $120 billion in market value as it projected it would spend more money on moderation and security.   Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, did not directly address Facebook's findings with reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, but he said President Trump had ''made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference into our electoral process from any nation-state or other malicious actors.''   Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump declared again on Twitter that there had been ''No Collusion'' between his campaign and the Russians, and asserted that, in any case, ''collusion is not a crime.''   Lawmakers from both parties quickly set aside questions of who had perpetrated the influence campaign and said Facebook's disclosure only clarified what they had feared since the extent of Russian involvement in 2016 became clear more than a year ago: that social media companies would be unable to keep up with the pace and scope of malicious efforts to abuse their platforms.   Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said he would make the disclosure a central part of a previously scheduled hearing on Wednesday, when lawmakers plan to press outside experts on the pervasiveness of foreign influence on social media networks like Facebook.   Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, praised Facebook on Tuesday for bringing the activity out into the public, but asked for its cooperation in updating laws to prevent influence campaigns.   ''Today's disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow division and spread disinformation,'' he said.   Facebook executives characterized the battle with foreign campaigns as a cat-and-mouse game, but said they were making progress to detect suspicious activity more quickly.   ''Security is an arms race, and it's never done,'' Ms. Sandberg said in a conference call on Tuesday.   Facebook said the recently purged accounts -- eight Facebook pages, 17 Facebook profiles and seven Instagram accounts -- were created between March 2017 and May 2018 and were first discovered two weeks ago. More than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the suspect pages, which had names like Aztlan Warriors, Black Elevation, Mindful Being and Resisters, the company said.   Between April 2017 and June 2018, the accounts ran 150 ads costing $11,000 on the two platforms. They were paid for in American and Canadian dollars. The pages created roughly 30 events over a similar period, the largest of which attracted interest from 4,700 accounts.   Finding suspicious activity was harder this time around, Facebook said. Unlike many of the alleged Russian trolls in 2016, who paid for Facebook ads in rubles and occasionally used Russian internet protocol addresses, these accounts used advanced security techniques to avoid detection. For instance, they disguised their internet traffic using virtual private networks and internet phone services, and used third parties to buy ads for them.   ''These bad actors have been more careful to cover their tracks, in part due to the actions we've taken to prevent abuse over the past year,'' Mr. Gleicher said.   But there were clues that the suspicious accounts may have been connected to the Internet Research Agency. Mr. Gleicher said an account known to be associated with the agency had been listed as an administrator of one of the pages for seven minutes.   Like the 2016 Russian interference campaign, the recently detected campaign sought to amplify divisive social issues, including through organizing real-world events.   Among the campaign's efforts was organizing support for a counterprotest to a conservative rally. Specifically, an account called Resisters, which interacted with one Internet Research Agency account in 2017, created an Aug. 10 event, ''No Unite the Right 2 -- DC,'' to counter a planned white supremacist rally in Washington on Aug. 11 and 12 by the same group that organized the racist march in Charlottesville one year earlier.   Although other Facebook pages are promoting the counterprotest, the social network said that the Resisters page was the first, and that it had coordinated with administrators for five other apparently real pages to co-host its page -- publicizing details about transportation and other logistics. A person familiar with the matter said the page was created on June 24.   That event page has been taken down, and Facebook has notified roughly 2,600 users who had indicated interest in attending the event, and 600 more who planned to attend, about the suspicious activity behind it.   Organizers of the counterprotest -- who quickly created a new Facebook page -- objected to Facebook's suggestion that a fake account was behind the event itself and not just the creator of a Facebook event page for it.   One organizer, Chelsea Manning, the former Army analyst who was convicted of sending archives of secret documents to WikiLeaks in 2010 and whose sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in 2017, said the counterprotest was ''real and organic.'' She called Facebook's implication that the Resisters account had started it misleading.   ''We started organizing several months ago,'' Ms. Manning said. ''Folks from D.C. and Charlottesville have been talking about this since at least February.''   On Capitol Hill and in congressional races across the country, the #AbolishICE campaign has divided Democrats and provided Republicans with fodder to paint Democratic candidates as extremists who want open borders. The issue, Republicans hope, could help drive a wedge between liberal Democrats and the moderate voters the party needs to retake control in Washington. Mr. Trump has gone as far as encouraging Democratic candidates to embrace the campaign.   ''They're going to get beaten so badly,'' he said in early July.   [How ''Abolish ICE'' went from social media to progressive candidates' rallying cry.]   After being caught flat-footed by the Internet Research Agency's efforts ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Facebook has expanded its security team, hired counterterrorism experts and recruited workers with government security clearances.   The company is using artificial intelligence and teams of human reviewers to detect automated accounts and suspicious election-related activity. It has also tried to make it harder for Russian-style influence campaigns to use covert Facebook ads to sway public opinion, by requiring political advertisers in the United States to register with a domestic mailing address and by making all political ads visible in a public database.   Despite Facebook's efforts, stopping coordinated influence campaigns has proved difficult. False news flourished before the Mexican elections in July, and the company has been cracking down on misinformation ahead of Brazil's national elections in October.   The American midterms, though, are a major test for the company, which is trying to show that it can handle its role as a global arbiter of conversation and commerce -- even with interference by others.   Earlier in July, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, warned that Russian interference remains an active threat to November's elections.   ''The warning lights are blinking red again,'' he said.   Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.    "
Corrections,"INTERNATIONAL An article on Monday about enrollment at the European University at St. Petersburg referred incorrectly to Vladimir Y. Gelman. He is a political scientist, not a political theorist.    NATIONAL    An article on Monday about Joe Arpaio misstated the first name of the Democrat who was elected Maricopa County sheriff in 2016. He is Paul Penzone, not Peter.    An article on Monday about the surge in female politicians winning primaries misspelled the name of a congressional candidate in New York. It is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, not Alexandra.   BUSINESS DAY   An entry in the Week Ahead report on Monday about a review of Volkswagen since its emissions scandal referred incorrectly to the review. It is expected to detail the extent to which the carmaker has complied with the terms of a civil settlement with the United States, not the terms of a plea agreement in a criminal case.    An article on Monday about legacy brands marketing to younger generations misidentified the business unit that SunnyD merged with when it was acquired by Brynwood Partners in 2016. It is Harvest Hill, not Heritage Hill.    An article on Thursday about a suspected hacking of the Democratic National Committee misstated what cybersecurity officials said about hackers' efforts to gain access to the organization's voter database. The officials said the hackers may have sent so-called spearphishing emails to D.N.C. officials, not that they did send such emails.    An article on Aug. 18 about economic stress in Turkey misstated Ugur Dalbeler's position with the Turkish Steel Exporters' Association, an industry group. He is a board member, not the president.   OBITUARIES   An obituary on Monday about the playwright Neil Simon contained an incomplete credit for the original Broadway production of the musical ''Little Me,'' for which he wrote the book. It was directed by Cy Feuer and Bob Fosse, not just by Mr. Fosse. In addition, a picture caption with the obituary, using information from Getty Images, misidentified one of the writers pictured with Mr. Simon and Sid Caesar.

Self-Improvement Project Inspires Wall Street's Elite,"Shane Parrish was a cybersecurity expert at Canada's top intelligence agency and an occasional blogger when he noticed something curious about his modest readership six years ago: 80 percent of his followers worked on Wall Street. The blog was meant to be a method of self-improvement, helping Mr. Parrish deal with a job whose pressures had increased with the growing threat of global hacking. But his lonely riffs -- on how learning deeply, thinking widely and reading books strategically could improve decision-making skills -- had found an eager audience among hedge fund titans and mutual fund executives, many of whom were still licking their wounds after the financial crisis.    ''People just found us,'' Mr. Parrish said. ''We became a thing on Wall Street.''   His website, Farnam Street, urges visitors to ''Upgrade Yourself.'' In saying as much, Mr. Parrish is promoting strategies of rigorous self-betterment as opposed to classic self-help fare -- which appeals to his overachieving audience in elite finance, Silicon Valley and professional sports. His many maxims cite Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bertrand Russell and even Frank Zappa. (''A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open.'')    Today, Mr. Parrish's community of striving financiers is clamoring for more of him. That means calling on him to present his thoughts and book ideas to employees and clients; attending his regular reading and think weeks in Hawaii, Paris and the Bahamas; and in some cases hiring him to be their personal decision-making coach.   ''These guys are driven to get that incremental edge -- they are competitive, gladiatorial in that respect,'' said Mr. Parrish, 39. ''We are trying to get people to ask themselves better questions and reflect. If you can do that, you will be better able to handle the speed and variety of changing environments.''   To do that, Mr. Parrish advises investors like Scott Miller, the founder of Greenhaven Road Capital, to disconnect from the noise and read deeply.   ''I will leave my computer and go into a separate room to read,'' said Mr. Miller, an early sponsor of Farnam Street who is currently reading ''Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones,'' by James Clear. ''It feels weird to do this in the middle of the day -- but I do it.''   Mr. Parrish's site has drawn the attention of some of the biggest names in finance. Dan Loeb, one of the more prominent hedge fund executives on Wall Street, is a big fan. And Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund, recently did a podcast with him.   ''Shane is a special person,'' Mr. Loeb said via email.   Few Wall Street obsessions surpass the pursuit of an investment edge. In an earlier era, before computers and the internet, this advantage was largely brain power: Warren Buffett plucking a nugget from an annual report or George Soros making a seismic bet against a currency.   Today, information is just another commodity. And the edge belongs to algorithms, data sets and funds that track indexes and countless other investment themes. This has been devastating for hedge fund and mutual fund managers who make their living trying to outsmart the stock market.   With their business models under attack, they are searching for answers. And Mr. Parrish has a simple solution: reading, reflection and lifelong learning.   ''These days, if you are not getting better you are falling behind,'' said Mr. Parrish, who is reading ''The Laws of Human Nature,'' an examination of human behavior that draws on examples of historical figures by Robert Greene. ''Reading is a way to consume people's experiences, to learn something timeless and then apply it to your life.''   Chuck Royce, the founder and former chief executive officer of Royce mutual funds, who oversees $4 billion in investments, said he stumbled on Mr. Parrish's site and related to it immediately.   Mr. Royce developed a reputation as one of the industry's most astute fund managers, specializing in small, high-quality companies in the 1970s. But in the recent period of low interest rates, his main mutual fund's performance has suffered.   ''I failed to understand that in this period of zero rates, inferior companies would outperform high-quality companies,'' said Mr. Royce, who was part of a group that spent a long weekend talking books and big ideas with Mr. Parrish in Hawaii two years ago.   Mr. Royce has embraced Mr. Parrish's core principles. He gets up at 5:30 every morning to do his daily reading, which currently includes ''Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Bets When you Don't Have All the Cards'' by Annie Duke, a former poker champion -- and a big favorite among investors these days. At the office, Mr. Royce works from a couch strewn with papers. His Bloomberg terminal is in another room.   ''It is all about habits,'' Mr. Royce said. ''Setting goals is easy -- but without good habits you are not getting there.''   Some executives have long sought insight from the printed page -- and not just in the business section. Emmanuel Roman, the chief executive officer of the bond giant Pimco -- who is reading ''On Grand Strategy,'' an assessment of the decisions of notable historical leaders by the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer John Lewis Gaddis -- called reading ''a pure passion.'' And Lloyd Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs, has talked up the benefits of reading books, especially those not related to economics or finance.   Mr. Parrish is an unlikely guru, a computer scientist from Halifax, Nova Scotia, who seems bemused by his sudden cachet. On a recent swing through New York to meet with clients, Mr. Parrish was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts and carried a worn backpack. Slight and balding, he looked more like an unhurried graduate student than a counselor to some of the wealthiest executives on Wall Street.   Mr. Parrish joined the Communications Security Establishment, a division of Canada's Defence Department, straight out of college. His first day was Aug. 28, 2001, and he was soon promoted in the tumult that followed the Sept. 11 attacks. Suddenly, he was managing a large staff at the age of 24.   Wanting to improve his decision-making skills, Mr. Parrish found inspiration in Charlie Munger -- Warren Buffett's longtime investment partner. Mr. Parrish quickly became an acolyte, drawn to Mr. Munger's thoughts on multidisciplinary thinking and mental models.   He pored over Berkshire Hathaway annual reports and became a regular attendee of Mr. Buffett's yearly meetings in Omaha. The name of his site is another tribute to the billionaire investor: Berkshire Hathaway's address in Omaha is 3555 Farnam Street.   Last year, Mr. Parrish left intelligence work to tend to the site full time. He would not disclose how much his various projects were making. Farnam Street now consists of book lists, essays, podcasts and a vibrant social network -- all of which are anchored by Mr. Parrish's self-improvement musings. There are also branded goodies to be had, such as a decision-making journal and a Farnam Street thinking cap.   Some 190,000 people have signed up to Brain Food, his free weekly newsletter. Mr. Parrish's more dedicated followers pay $250 a year to become part of his ''knowledge community'' -- a premium site with a private discussion forum and additional content. They have flocked to his social network, trading book ideas and meet-up suggestions in Toronto, Dubai and London.   James Aitken, an independent investment adviser in London who counsels some of the world's largest investors, was among the readers that came upon Mr. Parrish in 2012. Since then, Mr. Aitken has revamped his work habits, pushing himself to disconnect from all his screens and read books -- ideally for at least two hours a day.   ''He is so indispensable to me that, beyond becoming a part of his network, I will occasionally write him a check at the end of the year,'' Mr. Aitken said.   Mr. Aitken now pushes his clients to increase the time they spend reading and thinking away from their screens. Twice a year he sends out a list of books -- including history, biography, finance and economics, self-help, and more -- from which clients can choose a number of books as gifts. He has sent out about 2,300 over the past 10 years.   ''Every world-class investor is questioning right now how they can improve,'' he said. ''So, in a machine-driven age where everything is driven by speed, perhaps the edge is judgment, time and perspective.''    "
Senators Warn About Russian Election Meddling and Call for Paper Ballots,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate Intelligence Committee offered recommendations on Tuesday for securing American elections from foreign attacks, pressing states to buy voting machines that produce paper ballots and to secure voter databases, and calling for better cooperation between state and federal elections officials ahead of November's midterm elections. The committee's recommendations -- the first such disclosure in its year-old investigation into Russia's 2016 election meddling -- covered much of what experts and intelligence officials have been urging elections authorities to do for months. Yet the panel also urged the Trump administration to make clear that it would not tolerate any attacks on systems used to run elections.  ""The U.S. government should clearly communicate to adversaries that an attack on our election infrastructure is a hostile act, and we will respond accordingly,"" the committee's Republican chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, and Democratic vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said in a statement. The administration has been criticized for what many consider a tepid response to Russian interference in 2016 election and warnings about Moscow targeting this November's elections. Top American intelligence officials have warned that Russia sees its digital campaign to fan the country's social and political divisions in 2016 as a success, and is already meddling in the midterm elections. A central focus of the campaign -- the use of fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and disinformation -- has carried on unabated, the officials said. Federal officials have also concluded that Russian hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and breached that of at least one, Illinois, during the last election cycle. No votes were changed, though. Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, told the Senate committee at a hearing last month that the intelligence agencies were still grappling with these twin challenges: neutralizing Moscow's disinformation campaign and securing the integrity of vulnerable election systems around the country. The senators shared that assessment. ""The Russians were relentless in attempting to meddle in the 2016 elections, and they will continue their efforts to undermine public confidence in Western democracies and in the legitimacy of our elections,"" Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, told reporters on Tuesday after the recommendations were released. The senators called on Congress to ""urgently"" make available funds and other resources for states to update voting software and systems, institute vote audits and hire additional staff and contractors focused on cybersecurity. The senators said 14 states had used at least some machines in 2016 without a paper trail that could be audited. Five states used only those machines. At the same time, they took pains to make clear that while it was the states' responsibility to run their own elections, the federal government should play a significant role in monitoring threats and providing resources. Both were to blame for missteps in 2016, they said. ""We were all disappointed that states, the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security were not more on their game in advance of the 2016 elections,"" Mr. Warner said. While the department had made important improvements since then, he added, it was still a work in progress. The senators pointed to top state election officials, who have complained in recent weeks that the federal government has left them in the dark on specifics of the threat to voter databases, machines and other systems. The Intelligence Committee is likely to try to illustrate those breakdowns and possible solutions on Wednesday during a hearing with Homeland Security and state election officials on attempted attacks by the Russians on state election systems in 2016 and the federal response. The committee has also assembled a classified written report on election security. But the document has to be submitted to the intelligence agencies for review and declassification before it can be released publicly, which could take weeks or months. More than a year into its investigation into Russia's meddling, the Intelligence Committee has thus far offered little visibility into its work. Witnesses have come and gone in relative secret. Staff members and lawmakers have pored over thousands of pages of documents related to the Trump campaign, as well as sensitive government secrets. And while the House Intelligence Committee shut down its investigation last week amid rancorous partisan disputes, the Senate panel is said to be nowhere near completion, with months of work left to go. Whether the increased scrutiny that comes with being the only remaining investigation on Capitol Hill will change that remains unclear. In a show of bipartisan resolve, nearly every member of the committee took part in Tuesday's announcement and those who spoke endorsed the committee's findings. The committee's leaders had last updated the public on the investigation in October, when they said that a review had broadly confirmed the conclusions of American spy agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a campaign of hacking and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. They said then that their investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian effort was still open. Mr. Burr said that Tuesday's recommendations and the accompanying report would be the first in a series of findings that the committee would release in the coming months, as it closed out portions of the investigation. He said to expect the next update from the committee in about a month. The panel does not plan to draft specific legislation related to its election security findings given its lack of jurisdiction, but Mr. Burr said its members would work with the relevant committees to implement the recommendations. Lawmakers in both chambers have introduced competing bills to address security at the ballot box and cyberdefenses, but Republican leaders who control the House and Senate have shown little interest in advancing them. The House panel, for its part, is scheduled to vote on Thursday to release a final report drafted by Republicans that includes more than 20 election-related recommendations.

American Is Detained After Joining Protest in Vietnam,"HONG KONG -- An American citizen was among dozens of people arrested in Vietnam this week during protests against proposed special economic zones that have raised fears of Chinese encroachment. The American, Will Nguyen, was visiting Ho Chi Minh City ahead of his graduation this summer from a master's program at the University of Singapore, according to a statement from his family and friends. Mr. Nguyen, 32, a Houston native who graduated from Yale, took part in protests on Sunday. He was ""beaten over the head and dragged into the back of a police truck,"" after the authorities moved to quash the demonstrations that day, according to the statement.  A video from the protests shows Mr. Nguyen, with blood smeared across his face, being dragged by a group of men. He is later shown standing in the bed of a pickup truck topped with emergency lights. He was taken to a police station, but his current whereabouts and physical condition are not known, the statement said. Mr. Nguyen's family fled South Vietnam after the war that led to its collapse, he wrote in a recent piece for the website New Naratif that discussed the conflict and the country's history of divisions between North and South. ""He is a proud Vietnamese-American, and passionate about his studies, specifically Southeast Asian studies, in which he majored,"" his sister, Victoria Nguyen, said by email. Pope Thrower, spokesman for the United States Embassy in Hanoi, said the embassy was ""aware of media reports that a U.S. citizen was arrested in Vietnam."" ""When a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, the U.S. Department of State works to provide all appropriate consular assistance,"" he added. ""Due to privacy considerations, we have no further comment."" From Ho Chi Minh City, commonly called Saigon, Mr. Nguyen posted a series of tweets documenting the protests on Sunday, with crowds of people marching down city streets. ""I can't stress how enormous of an achievement this is for the #Vietnamese people,"" he wrote. ""The communist government is allowing people to assemble peacefully and the people are exercising their civic duty to protest injustice."" One image he posted shows a protester who was struck by police officers lying on the street while another person helps him. Mr. Nguyen's family has not been able to reach him, but his hosts at an Airbnb rental did reportedly speak with him shortly after his detention. Police officers showed up at the apartment two days later to confiscate his laptop, passport and credit cards, and a change of clothes, his family said. In addition to the special economic zones, protesters said they were concerned about a proposed cybersecurity law. The state-controlled news media in Vietnam reported that 102 people were arrested Sunday in the southeastern province of Binh Thuan, where thousands of protesters blocked a highway and later set fire to public buildings. Protests were also reported in Hanoi, the capital. The proposed special economic zones would give leases of up to 99 years to foreign investors in three areas that would have fewer administrative restrictions than the rest of the country. The proposal has stirred fear that it would undermine national security by giving China control over parts of Vietnamese territory. Vietnam and China have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, and Chinese efforts to extend control have set off protests in Vietnam. In 2014, China moved an offshore drilling rig into waters that Vietnam considers part of its exclusive economic zone, which prompted large demonstrations and efforts by Vietnam to force the rig to move. The two countries fought a brief but bloody border war in 1979, when China invaded Vietnam in an attempt to punish its neighbor for toppling the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

"A Cyberattack Hobbles Atlanta, and Security Experts Shudder","ATLANTA -- The City of Atlanta's 8,000 employees got the word on Tuesday that they had been waiting for: It was O.K. to turn their computers on. But as the city government's desktops, hard drives and printers flickered back to life for the first time in five days, residents still could not pay their traffic tickets or water bills online, or report potholes or graffiti on a city website. Travelers at the world's busiest airport still could not use the free Wi-Fi. Atlanta's municipal government has been brought to its knees since Thursday morning by a ransomware attack -- one of the most sustained and consequential cyberattacks ever mounted against a major American city. The digital extortion aimed at Atlanta, which security experts have linked to a shadowy hacking crew known for its careful selection of targets, laid bare once again the vulnerabilities of governments as they rely on computer networks for day-to-day operations. In a ransomware attack, malicious software cripples a victim's computer or network and blocks access to important data until a ransom is paid to unlock it.  ""We are dealing with a hostage situation,"" Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said this week. The assault on Atlanta, the core of a metropolitan area of about six million people, represented a serious escalation from other recent cyberattacks on American cities, like one last year in Dallas where hackers gained the ability to set off tornado sirens in the middle of the night. Part of what makes the attack on Atlanta so pernicious are the criminals behind it: A group that locks up its victims' files with encryption, temporarily changes their file names to ""I'm sorry"" and gives the victims a week to pay up before the files are made permanently inaccessible. Threat researchers at Dell SecureWorks, the Atlanta-based security firm helping the city respond to the ransomware attack, identified the assailants as the SamSam hacking crew, one of the more prevalent and meticulous of the dozens of active ransomware attack groups. The SamSam group is known for choosing targets that are the most likely to accede to its high ransom demands -- typically the Bitcoin equivalent of about $50,000 -- and for finding and locking up the victims' most valuable data. In Atlanta, where officials said the ransom demand amounted to about $51,000, the group left parts of the city's network tied in knots. Some major systems were not affected, including those for 911 calls and control of wastewater treatment. But other arms of city government have been scrambled for days. The Atlanta Municipal Court has been unable to validate warrants. Police officers have been writing reports by hand. The city has stopped taking employment applications. Atlanta officials have disclosed few details about the episode or how it happened. They have urged vigilance and tried to reassure employees and residents that their personal information was not believed to have been compromised. Dell SecureWorks and Cisco Security, which are still working to restore the city's systems, declined to comment on the attacks, citing client confidentiality. Ms. Bottoms, the mayor, has not said whether the city would pay the ransom. The SamSam group has been one of the more successful ransomware rings, experts said. It is believed to have extorted more than $1 million from some 30 target organizations in 2018 alone. It is not ideal to pay up, but in most cases, SamSam's victims have said that they can more easily afford the $50,000 or so in ransom than the time and cost of restoring their locked data and compromised systems. In the past year, the group has taken to attacking hospitals, police departments and universities -- targets with money but without the luxury of going off-line for days or weeks for restoration work. Investigators are not certain who the SamSam hackers are. Judging from the poor English in the group's ransom notes, security researchers believe they are probably not native English speakers. But they cannot say for sure whether SamSam is a single group of cybercriminals or a loose hacking collective. Ransomware emerged in Eastern Europe in 2009, when cybercriminals started using malicious code to lock up unsuspecting users' machines and then demanding 100 euros or similar sums to unlock them again. Over the past decade, dozens of online cybercriminal outfits -- and even some nation states, including North Korea and Russia -- have taken up similar tactics on a larger scale, inflicting digital paralysis on victims and demanding increasing amounts of money. Cybersecurity experts estimate that criminals made more than $1 billion from ransomware in 2016, according to the F.B.I. Then, last May, came the largest ransomware assault recorded so far: North Korean hackers went after tens of thousands of victims in more than 70 countries around the world, forcing Britain's public health system to reject patients, paralyzing computers at Russia's Interior Ministry, at FedEx in the United States, and at shipping lines and telecommunications companies across Europe. A month later, Russian state hackers deployed similar ransomware to paralyze computers in Ukraine on the eve of the country's independence day. That attack shut down automated teller machines in Kiev, froze government agencies and even forced workers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to monitor radiation levels manually. Collateral damage from that attack affected computers at Maersk, the Danish shipping conglomerate; at Merck, the American-based pharmaceutical giant; and even at businesses in Russia. Attempted ransomware attacks against local governments in the United States have become unnervingly common. A 2016 survey of chief information officers for jurisdictions across the country found that obtaining ransom was the most common purpose of cyberattacks on a city or county government, accounting for nearly one-third of all attacks. The survey, conducted by the International City/County Management Association and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, also found that about one-quarter of local governments reported that they were experiencing attacks of one kind or another, successful or not, at least as often as once an hour. Yet less than half of the local governments surveyed said they had developed a formal cybersecurity policy, and only 34 percent said they had a written strategy to recover from breaches. Experts said government officials needed to be more aggressive about preventive measures, like training employees to spot and sidestep ""phishing"" attempts meant to trick them into opening the digital door for ransomware. ""It's going to be even more important that local governments look for the no-cost/low-cost, but start considering cybersecurity on the same level as public safety,"" said David Jordan, the chief information security officer for Arlington County, Va. ""A smart local government will have fire, police and cybersecurity at the same level."" Ms. Bottoms, who took office as mayor of Atlanta in January, acknowledged that shoring up the city's digital defenses had not been a high priority before, but that now ""it certainly has gone to the front of the line."" ""As elected officials, it's often quite easy for us to focus on the things that people see, because at the end of the day, our residents are our customers,"" Ms. Bottoms said. ""But we have to really make sure that we continue to focus on the things that people can't see, and digital infrastructure is very important."" During the ransomware attack, local leaders have sometimes been able to do little but chuckle at a predicament that was forcing the city to turn the clock back decades. Asked on Monday how long the city might be able to get by doing its business strictly with ink and paper, Ms. Bottoms replied: ""It was a sustainable model until we got computer systems. It worked for many years. And for some of our younger employees, it will be a nice exercise in good penmanship."" Security researchers trying to combat ransomware have noticed a pattern in SamSam's attacks this year: Some of the biggest have occurred around the 20th of the month. Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future who has been tracking the group, said in an interview that he believed that SamSam gains access to its victims' systems and then waits for weeks before encrypting the victims' data. That delay, Mr. Liska said, makes it harder for responders to figure out how the group was able to break in -- and easier for SamSam's hackers to strike twice. The Colorado Department of Transportation was able to restore its systems on its own after a SamSam attack, without paying SamSam a dime. But a week later, the hackers struck the department again, with new, more potent ransomware. ""They are constantly learning from their mistakes, modifying their code and then launching the next round of attacks,"" Mr. Liska said. Alan Blinder reported from Atlanta, and Nicole Perlroth from Boulder, Colo.

Battling Adware That Redirects Your Browser; TECH TIP,"Q. I keep getting pop-ups in my browser search bar and sent to a site I've never heard of. What is this, a scam? A. If you are experiencing constant pop-up ads, trips to websites you didn't intend to visit, a frequently changing home page, ads trying to sell you obscure security software or other odd browser behavior, your computer is probably infected with an aggressive adware program. These types of invasive programs -- which can affect Macs along with PCs -- often redirect your browser to certain pages so those sites can get revenue by showing advertisements to (unwilling) visitors.  The adware program may have been bundled with other software you installed on the computer, like a ""free"" tool bar extension or game. Visiting a web page rigged with malicious code can also infect a computer. Using a malware-scanning app to locate and remove the adware hiding on your computer is probably the easiest way to get rid of the unwanted software. Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, recommends the Malwarebytes program for both Windows and Mac computers; a free trial is available. HitmanPro is another anti-malware program for Windows that offers a free trial.  Microsoft also has its own Malicious Software Removal Tool that can catch and delete some types of malware. Many security programs are available around the web, but be sure to read reviews of any products you are considering -- some apps may actually be of a dubious nature themselves.  Manually removing the unwanted program is also possible, although this approach takes time and technical prowess. You can sometimes spot adware and spyware apps in your computer's list of programs and uninstall them as you would any other software.  You should also check your browser's settings for unfamiliar add-ons and extensions -- and remove any you find. In some cases, resetting your browser can also flush out unwanted software.  The reset option restores the program to its default state, but it should preserve your bookmarks and passwords. You can find your reset controls in the Settings or Options for Google Chrome (which also includes a malware scanner for Windows), Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, and Mozilla Firefox. Apple has its own guide for troubleshooting the Safari browser. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

"Cyberattacks Put Russian Fingers on the Switch at Power Plants, U.S. Says","The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will. United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West's critical facilities in the event of a conflict. They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated. In the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants.  Still, new computer screenshots released by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday made clear that Russian state hackers had the foothold they would have needed to manipulate or shut down power plants. ""We now have evidence they're sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,"" said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, a digital security firm. ""From what we can see, they were there. They have the ability to shut the power off. All that's missing is some political motivation,"" Mr. Chien said. American intelligence agencies were aware of the attacks for the past year and a half, and the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. first issued urgent warnings to utility companies in June. On Thursday, both agencies offered new details as the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations it accused of election meddling and ""malicious cyberattacks."" It was the first time the administration officially named Russia as the perpetrator of the assaults. And it marked the third time in recent months that the White House, departing from its usual reluctance to publicly reveal intelligence, blamed foreign government forces for attacks on infrastructure in the United States. In December, the White House said North Korea had carried out the so-called WannaCry attack that in May paralyzed the British health system and placed ransomware in computers in schools, businesses and homes across the world. Last month, it accused Russia of being behind the NotPetya attack against Ukraine last June, the largest in a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine to date, paralyzing the country's government agencies and financial systems. But the penalties have been light. So far, Mr. Trump has said little to nothing about the Russian role in those attacks. The groups that conducted the energy attacks, which are linked to Russian intelligence agencies, appear to be different from the two hacking groups that were involved in the election interference. That would suggest that at least three separate Russian cyberoperations were underway simultaneously. One focused on stealing documents from the Democratic National Committee and other political groups. Another, by a St. Petersburg ""troll farm"" known as the Internet Research Agency, used social media to sow discord and division. A third effort sought to burrow into the infrastructure of American and European nations. For years, American intelligence officials tracked a number of Russian state-sponsored hacking units as they successfully penetrated the computer networks of critical infrastructure operators across North America and Europe, including in Ukraine. Some of the units worked inside Russia's Federal Security Service, the K.G.B. successor known by its Russian acronym, F.S.B.; others were embedded in the Russian military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. Still others were made up of Russian contractors working at the behest of Moscow. Russian cyberattacks surged last year, starting three months after Mr. Trump took office. American officials and private cybersecurity experts uncovered a series of Russian attacks aimed at the energy, water and aviation sectors and critical manufacturing, including nuclear plants, in the United States and Europe. In its urgent report in June, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. notified operators about the attacks but stopped short of identifying Russia as the culprit. By then, Russian spies had compromised the business networks of several American energy, water and nuclear plants, mapping out their corporate structures and computer networks. They included that of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear plant near Burlington, Kan. But in that case, and those of other nuclear operators, Russian hackers had not leapt from the company's business networks into the nuclear plant controls. Forensic analysis suggested that Russian spies were looking for inroads -- although it was not clear whether the goal was to conduct espionage or sabotage, or to trigger an explosion of some kind. In a report made public in October, Symantec noted that a Russian hacking unit ""appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so."" The United States sometimes does the same thing. It bored deeply into Iran's infrastructure before the 2015 nuclear accord, placing digital ""implants"" in systems that would enable it to bring down power grids, command-and-control systems and other infrastructure in case a conflict broke out. The operation was code-named ""Nitro Zeus,"" and its revelation made clear that getting into the critical infrastructure of adversaries is now a standard element of preparing for possible conflict. The Russians have gone farther. In an updated warning to utility companies on Thursday, Homeland Security officials included a screenshot taken by Russian operatives that proved they could now gain access to their victims' critical controls. American officials and security firms, including Symantec and CrowdStrike, believe that Russian attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and 2016 that left more than 200,000 citizens there in the dark are an ominous sign of what the Russian cyberstrikes may portend in the United States and Europe in the event of escalating hostilities. Private security firms have tracked the Russian government assaults on Western power and energy operators -- conducted alternately by groups under the names DragonFly, Energetic Bear and Berserk Bear -- since 2011, when they first started targeting defense and aviation companies in the United States and Canada. By 2013, researchers had tied the Russian hackers to hundreds of attacks on energy grid and oil and gas pipeline operators in the United States and Europe. Initially, the strikes appeared to be motivated by industrial espionage -- a natural conclusion at the time, researchers said, given the importance of Russia's oil and gas industry. But by December 2015, the Russian hacks had taken an aggressive turn. The attacks were no longer aimed at intelligence gathering, but at potentially sabotaging or shutting down plant operations. At Symantec, researchers discovered that Russian hackers had begun taking screenshots of the machinery used in energy and nuclear plants, and stealing detailed descriptions of how they operated -- suggesting they were conducting reconnaissance for a future attack. As the American government enacted the sanctions on Thursday, cybersecurity experts were still questioning where the Russian attacks could lead, given that the United States was sure to respond in kind. ""Russia certainly has the technical capability to do damage, as it demonstrated in the Ukraine,"" said Eric Cornelius, a cybersecurity expert at Cylance, a private security firm, who previously assessed critical infrastructure threats for the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. ""It is unclear what their perceived benefit would be from causing damage on U.S. soil, especially given the retaliation it would provoke,"" Mr. Cornelius said. Though a major step toward deterrence, publicly naming countries accused of cyberattacks still is unlikely to shame them into stopping. The United States is struggling to come up with proportionate responses to the wide variety of cyberespionage, vandalism and outright attacks. Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, who has been nominated as director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, the military's cyberunit, said during his Senate confirmation hearing this month that countries attacking the United States so far have little to worry about. ""I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,"" General Nakasone said. He later added, ""They don't fear us.""

"After Obtaining Real Personal Data, A Political Firm Explores Virtual Currency","Follow Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore on Twitter: @nathanielpopper and @nickconfessore. SAN FRANCISCO -- The embattled political data firm Cambridge Analytica quietly sought to develop its own virtual currency in recent months through a so-called initial coin offering, a novel fund-raising method that has come under growing scrutiny by financial regulators around the world. The offering was part of a broader, but still very private push that the firm was making into the nascent world of cryptocurrencies over the last year.    Much like its acquisition of Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, the new business line pushed the firm into murky ethical and legal situations. Documents and emails obtained by The New York Times show that Cambridge Analytica's efforts to help promote another group's digital token, the Dragon Coin, associated the firm with a famous gangster in Macau who has gone by the nickname Broken Tooth.   The goal of Cambridge Analytica's own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.    ''Who knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?'' Ms. Kaiser said. ''So why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?''   The effort was overseen by Cambridge Analytica's British chief executive, Alexander Nix, who was forced out of the company in March after he was caught on tape bragging about his company's approach to political work in other countries, including the use of shell companies and strategies designed to entrap opponents. The Facebook data revelations and Mr. Nix's comments appear to have put the virtual currency work, which was still in the early stages, on hold.   Initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, are a method of fund-raising in which companies sell their own virtual currencies. The tokens are generally structured like Bitcoin, using a so-called blockchain to record transactions. The coins are usually designed to be used as an internal payment method in software that the start-ups are building. Over the last year, companies have raised over $6 billion through I.C.O.s.   Coin offerings generally avoid the regulatory oversight that accompanies traditional fund-raising methods, opening the door for significant fraud. A number of coin offerings have been shut down by law enforcement, and there are several broad investigations of the industry by regulators around the world.   ''There are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into,'' said Tim Swanson, a consultant to companies in the industry, who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offering.   A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for comment.   Cambridge Analytica began working with coin offerings in the middle of last year. The business was guided by Ms. Kaiser, an American who led the company's business development and previously appeared at a press event with organizers of the ''Brexit'' campaign to get Britain out of the European Union.   Cambridge Analytica boasts that its ''psychographic profiles'' of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising. In marketing material sent to investors, the firm said Ms. Kaiser was ''helping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token sales.''   Jill Carlson, a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies, attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies, including one that Mr. Nix attended.   Ms. Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like Facebook.   She also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns. The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in far-flung regions of Mexico. The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidates.   Ms. Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin.   ''The way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,'' she said.   Cambridge Analytica did win over some clients. Last summer, Ms. Kaiser's team began working with Dragon Coin, a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers. The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau, an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structures.   Cambridge Analytica had little public role in promoting Dragon Coin. But behind the scenes the company emailed potential partners and investors and arranged for some of them to take all-expenses-paid trips to a glitzy Dragon Coin event in Macau.   The South China Morning Post published a photo from the event showing Wan Kuok-koi in attendance. Mr. Wan is known as Broken Tooth Koi from his days as the leader of the famous 14K gang in Macau. He was released from prison in 2012 after serving a 14-year term.   The founder of Dragon Coin, Chris Ahmad, told Business Insider at the time that Mr. Wan ''is not involved in Dragon, and he is not financing Dragon in any way.''   But documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coin's co-founder Paul Moynan listed Mr. Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture. Ms. Kaiser was included in the email. A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr. Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr. Wan as one of a few high-profile supporters of the project.   When reached recently, Mr. Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents. He later said the documents were a ''hypothetical wish list'' of a ''junior staff'' member.   ''We will be conducting an internal investigation, as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships,'' he said.   Ms. Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity, and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr. Wan was not involved with the project.   Dragon Coin claimed it raised more than $300 million from investors last fall. That total has been hard to verify. Like many coin offerings, Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promises.   The document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network. A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved, as is necessary for a card to be issued.   The documents last summer also said the Dragon app, which would let investors use its virtual coin, would be available in September. When that didn't happen, the company promised the app in January -- but it still has not appeared. In the meantime, the company has spent its money sponsoring a Formula E car racing team and a team climbing Mount Everest.   The setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm. The company's New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners, emails show. And in January, Ms. Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects, known as CryptoHQ, at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nix spoke on a panel at the event.   He said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of -- the abuse of online personal data.   ''We're going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data,'' Mr. Nix said, according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account. ''And that is only possible through the blockchain.''   The virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem, and would have also helped the company raise money from investors.   The company wrote a document describing the technical specifications of the coin, Ms. Kaiser said. Her account was confirmed by another person who worked on the project and agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. The work was overseen by Alexander Tayler, the firm's chief data scientist and briefly the interim chief executive after Mr. Nix stepped down.   Ms. Kaiser left Cambridge Analytica in February and has been sharply critical of the company since then. As far as she knows, the coin offering has not moved forward. But she is still working on similar concepts at her new consulting firm, Bueno Capital.    "
"North Korean Defectors' Personal Data Was Stolen by Hackers, South Says","SEOUL, South Korea -- The personal information of nearly 1,000 North Koreans who defected to South Korea has been leaked after unknown hackers gained access to a resettlement agency's database, the South Korean Unification Ministry said on Friday.  The ministry said it discovered last week that the names, birth dates and addresses of 997 defectors had been stolen through a computer infected with malicious software at an agency called the Hana center, in the southern city of Gumi. A ministry official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, told reporters that the malware had been planted through emails sent from a Hana center email account. The Hana center is among 25 institutes that the Unification Ministry runs across South Korea to help some 32,000 defectors adjust to life in the country by providing jobs, medical and legal support. Defectors, most of whom risked their lives to flee poverty and political oppression, are a source of shame for North Korea. Its state media often denounces them as ""human scum"" and accuses South Korean spies of kidnapping some of them. The ministry official declined to say if North Korea was believed to have been behind the hacking or what the motive might have been, saying that a police investigation was underway. The Unification Ministry said that it was notifying the defectors whose data was stolen and that there had been no reports of consequences from the breach. North Korean hackers have been accused of staging cyberattacks on South Korean state agencies and businesses before, and of being behind the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as attacks on financial institutions around the world. In South Korea, the North is believed to have stolen classified documents from the Defense Ministry and a shipbuilder last year, and a cryptocurrency exchange filed for bankruptcy after a cyberattack linked to the North. North Korean state media has denied that the country was behind those cyberattacks. The latest data breach comes at a delicate time for the two Koreas, which have been rapidly improving their relations after years of confrontation. Several defectors, including one who became a South Korean television celebrity, have disappeared in recent years, only to turn up later in North Korean state media criticizing the South.

Was Your Laptop Stolen? All Is Not Necessarily Lost,"Whitson Gordon is a writer and editor in San Diego. Follow him on Twitter: @whitsongordon When your laptop is lost or stolen, you aren't just out $800 (or more). Your personal information is also accessible to whoever takes it, even if you have a password. ''Unfortunately, a typical password-protected user account does nothing to protect your data,'' says Dennis Stewart, a security engineer at CipherTechs. ''While the password will prevent someone else from logging into your computer, an attacker can still use other methods to copy files off.'' If thieves remove the hard drive and put it into another computer, they have access to any files you have stored on it. In some cases, they can even reset the password on your PC and gain access to your email, passwords and other personal information.    Thankfully, you can protect your data against both of these types of attacks with encryption. ''Encryption is a mathematical process used to jumble up data. If important files or whole devices are encrypted, there is no way to make sense of them without the key,'' Mr. Stewart said. That means if thieves try to access your information, they'll find only a jumbled mess unless they have your password, and they won't be able to simply reset that password if the device is encrypted.    Encrypting your hard drive isn't some super-technical process that only security experts can perform, either -- anyone can do it on his or her computer at home, and it should take only a few minutes to get up and running.   How to Encrypt Your Hard Drive   If you have a Windows laptop, you have a few options. Some Windows 10 devices come with encryption turned on by default, and you can check this by going to Settings > System > About and scrolling down to ''Device Encryption.'' You'll need to log into Windows with a Microsoft account in order for this feature to work, but if your laptop offers it, it's an easy and free way to protect your data.   If your laptop doesn't support Device Encryption, you can use Windows' other built-in encryption tool: BitLocker. BitLocker is available only on Professional versions of Windows and above (a $99 upgrade for Home edition users), but it's incredibly easy to set up. Just head to Windows' Control Panel > System and Security > Manage BitLocker. Select your operating system drive and click the ''Turn On BitLocker'' button, following the prompts to create a password that will function as your encryption key. Be sure to store your BitLocker key in a safe place -- somewhere not on that computer -- in case something goes wrong!   If neither of those is an option, a free program called VeraCrypt can encrypt your entire hard drive, requiring your password when you boot your computer. It's not quite as simple, straightforward and built-in as Windows' Device Encryption and BitLocker, but if it's your only option, it's worth looking into.   Mac laptops are much more straightforward: All modern Macs (since about 2003) have a feature called FileVault that encrypts your entire system drive. Just open your Mac's System Preferences, head to Security & Privacy and select the FileVault tab. Click the ''Turn On FileVault'' button to create a password and begin the encryption process. Store your key in a safe place (not on that computer) in case you ever get locked out.   Thankfully, modern iPhones and Android phones will automatically encrypt your data as long as you use a PIN or password, so you need to worry about enabling the feature only on your desktop and laptop computers. If you have an Android phone with an SD card, however, you can enable encryption for the SD card manually from the Lock Screen and Security settings.    Don't Forget Your Password   There is one catch to encryption: Your password is much, much more important to remember. Data may be protected from intruders, but it's also impossible for you to access should you forget your password or recovery key. ''If a user forgets or loses their key, they're out of luck,'' says Mr. Stewart. ''If a bad actor can't get at your data without the key, you can't, either.'' Some businesses may grant IT departments a master key, but not all do, and this can't be done retroactively.   So if you're the type of person who forgets passwords often, it's incredibly important you write it down -- along with the recovery key you were given when you performed the above steps -- and keep it in a safe place. Don't keep it on the computer you encrypted and don't keep it out in plain sight -- put it in a physical safe that only you can access. And no matter what, always keep a good backup of your data, either on another hard drive (which you should also encrypt) or with a cloud service like Backblaze that keeps your data secure.    "
S.E.C.'s New Cybersecurity Guidance Won't Spur More Disclosures,"Agatha Christie's fictional sleuth Miss Marple once said in a BBC adaptation that ''good advice is almost certain to be ignored, but that's no reason for not giving it.'' That may reflect how companies will respond to guidance recently issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission about how companies should deal with cybersecurity threats. Security breaches at companies like Equifax, Target and Yahoo over the past few years have exposed the personal information of millions of consumers. The federal government isn't immune to hackers, either. The systems of the Office of Personnel Management and even the S.E.C. have been breached.     The response from companies usually seems to be about keeping a lid on the hack. That's something the S.E.C. would like to end, but its guidance may not go very far in changing how companies deal with cybersecurity issues.   The S.E.C.'s guidance is full of good advice. The regulator tells companies that they need to have in place ''disclosure controls and procedures that provide an appropriate method of discerning the impact that such matters may have on the company and its business, financial condition and results of operations.'' Just as important, companies are expected ''to disclose cybersecurity risks and incidents that are material to investors, including the concomitant financial, legal or reputational consequences.''   Those are worthwhile reminders, but the S.E.C. has yet to institute any direct measures to compel companies to reveal the nature and scope of a cybersecurity breach.   The Equifax breach, which affected more than 140 million people, came to the company's attention in late July, but the public didn't learn of it until early September. Whether keeping quiet for almost six weeks can be considered timely disclosure is an open question, but nothing happened to the company because of the delay.   There will always be at least some lag time between discovering a theft of information and an assessment of its extent. Hackers don't want to be discovered, so the scope of a breach may not be immediately apparent. But the S.E.C. pointed out that ''an ongoing internal or external investigation -- which often can be lengthy -- would not on its own provide a basis for avoiding disclosures of a material cybersecurity incident.''   The S.E.C. also warns companies about the potential for insider trading when they learn about a breach, which inevitably has a negative effect on the stock price once it is disclosed. It cautioned that ''companies would be well served by considering how to avoid the appearance of improper trading during the period following an incident and prior to the dissemination of disclosure.''   For example, just a few days after the breach at Equifax came to the company's attention, four members of management, including the chief financial officer, sold $1.8 million worth of shares. An investigation by a special committee of the board of directors exonerated them, finding that none knew about the breach at the time, a key requirement to prove insider trading.   The problem is that even the perception that corporate executives sold shares ahead of disclosing a cybersecurity problem can compound the negative publicity surrounding a breach.   The S.E.C.'s guidance is certainly welcome, and it may nudge companies to be more aggressive in policing stock sales when a cybersecurity problem comes to light. The problem is that the advice can be easily ignored when a breach occurs. If the S.E.C. wants to send a message to companies, it may need to ratchet up the pressure by pursuing an enforcement action.   Nothing gets the attention of corporate directors and executives like a case that describes how a failure to respond in a timely fashion resulted in a violation of disclosure requirements.   The problem is that proving a case can be difficult because the standard for when information must be revealed is so elastic. Companies must reveal ''material'' information in a timely manner, which the Supreme Court said in Basic v. Levinson depended ''on the significance the reasonable investor would place on'' it. The point at which a cybersecurity breach reaches that level is almost impossible to describe with any precision.   And that gives companies flexibility in deciding when the handiwork of hackers becomes material information for investors, despite the S.E.C.'s push for earlier disclosure.    "
Legal Sports Betting Intensifies A Cat-and-Mouse Data Game,"Every weekend during soccer season in Britain, security personnel find them in stadiums, tapping furiously at their phones or talking nonstop into a mic -- mysterious customers often wearing hoodies to conceal earpieces and their identity. While focused with unwavering intensity on the action of the game, they show none of the engagement and excitement of the ordinary fans around them. The unofficial data scouts -- or data thieves, depending on who is describing them -- are quickly ejected once they are discovered.    The fleeting data they are collecting -- the minutia of what is happening in the game -- is the lifeblood of sports betting, perhaps the most crucial and valuable element of the entire industry. If gambling operators are to monetize sports betting fully, they have to offer wagers on far more than the outcomes of games. Data on the second-by-second action -- exactly when a goal is scored, where it landed in the net, who had the assist -- creates manifold betting opportunities.    In Britain, this so-called in-play betting market is robust. In the United States, it may be the greatest hope for betting operators after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting and as states scramble to accept wagers. That means accurate and reliable data must get to betting operators like casinos, websites and phone apps fast, usually in a second or two -- well ahead of the roughly five-to-10-second delay baked into television broadcasts.   ''For betting, it's the difference between having value and having no value at all,'' Steven Burton, a veteran lawyer in the rarefied field of collecting, using and protecting sports data, said about the necessity of rapid data distribution.   The sudden premium on sports data is likely to set up an array of conflicts in the betting industry that have been mostly unknown in the United States. Adrian Ford, general manager of Football DataCo, the official handler of data for the English Premier League and others in Britain, said that in dozens of stadiums each weekend, the hooded scouts show up for companies aiming to collect the data and sell it to betting operators without buying rights to the league-approved stream originating in the press box.   ''It goes to the heart of this issue, the data debate,'' Mr. Ford said. ''Clearly the data from the source, a stadium, it's valuable. Some people believe it's appropriate to cheat.''   That shadowy cat-and-mouse game in Britain gives a small preview of battles to come in the United States over how the data should be collected and whether the gambling industry should be required to use ''official data,'' a league-approved tabulation of what happened in a sports competition.   The debate over official data is one facet of a still broader set of questions: How should sports data from any source, official or unofficial, be regulated, monitored and purchased? Who should settle a dispute over whether an in-play bet was won or lost? Does real-time data from a sporting event, like the sounds of a musical performance, have a claim to royalties and copyright protection for those who produce it? By creating a sort of monopoly, could a mandate for official data actually do more harm than good?   Feeding Betting Sites   Like electricity in a city, oxygen in a submarine or rubber at a tire factory, whoever controls the crucial element determines how the entire system works. Decades after the days of corner bookies and betting odds in the afternoon paper, data has taken on that dominant role in betting.   ''When I started, it was loose-leaf notebooks and colored pens,'' said Roxy Roxborough, a legendary bookmaker who began working in Las Vegas in the 1970s.   Computers began showing up in his betting shop in the early 1980s, Mr. Roxborough said. By the late 1990s, the speed and quantities of data in the operation had reached formerly unimaginable levels.   ''I looked around the room and we had more guys in the tech department than making odds,'' Mr. Roxborough said, ''and I knew it was over for me.''   Because sports betting has been illegal in most states, wagering money has flowed offshore -- fueling an illicit industry estimated to generate $150 billion a year. Some kind of data distribution system has to feed those offshore betting sites. They couldn't exist without it. As sports betting moves out of the shadows in the United States, strange bedfellows might be exposed.   Some of the companies that have supplied data to sites at the center of multiple federal gambling investigations now would like to become part of the new, regulated United States market.   One of those companies, Sportradar, is already working -- legally -- with several major sports leagues and is seen as well positioned to purchase rights as a provider of official data, should it decide to do so. Dissonances like that draw warnings from both critics and supporters of official data.   ''You have this completely unbelievable, upside-down situation,'' said Carl Mergele, chief executive of Stats, a sports data and technology company that was founded in 1981. The company has been at the forefront of the statistical revolution in sports and, by its own measure, collects more than 30 million data points a year. (Stats provides live scores and statistics to The New York Times.)   Mr. Mergele said that while he was not referring to any specific competitor, if official data is mandated, it would likely be controlled by companies that fuel illicit markets. It would be affordable, he said, only to ''those that monetize that data in the global betting market, often in unregulated, offshore, gray, illegal markets.''   For that reason, Mr. Mergele said, requiring the use of official data in sports betting would be ''enabling the very people and companies that have been circumventing U.S. law.''   Even supporters of official data recognize offshore books as the dominant player. ''The reality is, legalized betting is going to be a late entrant in this market,'' said Mr. Burton, who is now managing director of Genius Sports, which provides data collection technology and other services to sports leagues. Without agreement on a fast, common source of data among the leagues, betting houses and legislators, Mr. Burton said, the legal product risks being less than compelling and ''won't make much of a dent.''   ''The idea of building the U.S. sports betting industry on unofficial data, it's kind of putting it on a par with pirated DVDs and sidewalk hustlers and illicit streaming sites,'' Mr. Burton said. ''It's all that grubby underworld.''   Mr. Burton added that ''as the world moves into this in-play betting market, I think official data becomes even more important.''   The United States affiliate of Switzerland-based Sportradar has raised its profile considerably by populating its advisory board with prominent team owners like Michael Jordan, Ted Leonsis and Mark Cuban. The company has announced data deals of various kinds with the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, the National Hockey League and Nascar.   Laila Mintas, deputy president of Sportradar U.S., said in a statement that among those deals are agreements with the N.B.A. and the N.H.L. ''to distribute sports data around the world for betting purposes.'' Distribution of data in the N.B.A. deal is strictly limited to legal bookmakers overseas, the league says; the deal does not include United States sports betting outlets. The N.H.L. did not respond to a request for comment.   Sportradar said in a statement that it provides data and betting services only to licensed bookmakers. A 2015 investigation by The Times showed how the offshore gambling websites serve a United States audience, and found that Sportradar works with one that has been identified in multiple federal gambling investigations. (Sports gambling with offshore books has long been illegal in the United States, and is likely to remain so, even after the Supreme Court ruling.)   A website called BetCris is among those linked to offshore betting operations. A recent examination of the underlying code that powers the BetCris website revealed that Betradar, the arm of Sportradar that works with gambling companies, is still providing live game statistics to BetCris.   In response to questions from The Times, a Sportradar spokesman said, ''We confirmed with senior management at BetCris today that they stopped servicing the U.S. in early 2007.''   Still, the site has frequently been named in federal indictments before and after that date. For example, BetCris was described in a 2015 Justice Department news conference on a major gambling conviction as a conduit for illegal bets in the United States. In wiretaps for a sprawling federal indictment in 2013, bookies were caught repeatedly referring to BetCris as one of their tools for making large bets.   In a $178 million case in 2010, among the 38 people indicted was Michael Flynn III, a.k.a. Mickey Richardson, described as a fugitive in Central America who essentially ran BetCris, which is thought to be based in Costa Rica. Mr. Flynn is still at large, according to the district attorney's office in Queens, whose organized crime and rackets bureau was involved in the case.   In a statement to The Times, BetCris stood by the assertion that it stopped accepting customers in the United States in 2007, and said it has ''maintained diligent efforts since then to ensure only customers in lawful jurisdictions place bets through the site.''   The company also said it does not believe that ''the reference to BetCris in indictments is of any moment,'' in part because, the company claimed, the indictments contain ''a notable lack of detail as to how and to what extent BetCris actually -- and knowingly -- accepted U.S.-based customers.''   ''Unfortunately, because most of the U.S. continues to prohibit a recreational activity that customers enjoy, many Americans seek out different ways to access offshore sites,'' the company said. It added that ''BetCris strives to stay one-step ahead of such attempts.''   The company also pointed out that, in most indictments involving BetCris, that is not the only website mentioned by prosecutors. In those instances, the company said, it ''sees general statements in which the Government has merely lumped all offshore sites together as the same bad actors, without specifying the actual culpability of any single site, let alone BetCris.''   When presented with the recent federal record involving BetCris, a Sportradar spokesman said, ''We obviously cannot comment on another company's legal matters of which we're uninvolved, and simply put, it is not our place.''   ''All businesses evolve over time, and it's shortsighted to assess a partner only on past issues,'' the spokesman added. ''The converse is true as well: It would be reckless to automatically approve those with 'spotless' history, as there is no guarantee of current or future behavior.''   Official Data Monopolistic?   In regard to the data scouts being ejected from soccer stadiums in Britain, the Sportradar spokesman said that the company ''has always been transparent that we collect data from venues in the U.K. and elsewhere,'' and that the company believes that the British soccer leagues' ''attempts to prevent us from collecting data'' are in violation of British and European antitrust law. Sportradar previously lost a landmark case in Europe when it was found to be improperly copying DataCo's feeds to sports websites and selling them to betting operators.   As to the specific issue of whether United States law should mandate the exclusive use of official data, Ms. Mintas came straight down the middle. ''Sportradar uses both unofficial and official data as market dynamics dictate, and we are fully transparent about the way we do business,'' she said.   Some legal experts, like Ryan Rodenberg, an associate professor of sports law at Florida State University, believe that, as with musical recordings and other copyrighted material, courts will find that real-time sports data is owned by those who produce it: the leagues and their players.   Others dismiss that view. Marc Edelman, a professor of law at Baruch College, said he believed that only ''pre-scripted'' events were subject to copyright -- meaning that while professional wrestling performances might qualify, football, basketball and other true competitions would not.   There is little question that the leagues riled the gambling industry with their initial proposal for requiring the use of official data and royalty fees, which could have added up to around 20 percent of revenues, said Joe Asher, chief executive of the United States arm of William Hill, an international sports betting book. Mr. Asher said he learned to count cards in blackjack at age 10, was working at a racetrack in Delaware, where he grew up, at 16, and, after practicing law in New York, left the profession and opened his own sports book; he later sold it to William Hill.   Several of the leagues initially cast the royalties as an ''integrity fee'' that would help them pay for things like policing match fixing and point shaving. In addition to those royalties, betting houses could also be limited in where they buy sports data. A legislative mandate for official data ''sets up monopoly pricing power,'' Mr. Asher said. ''This whole thing of official league data is like a smoke screen.''   Over the past year, at least 17 states have considered new laws on sports betting, including at least six where official data is in play, said James Kilsby, managing director of Gambling Compliance, an independent research service. Of those 17 states, roughly a half-dozen, including New Jersey and Rhode Island, have passed laws legalizing sports betting, or are close to doing so, Mr. Kilsby said.   For proponents of official data, New York and Pennsylvania are potential bellwethers, Mr. Kilsby said.   The proposed New York law would require official data for in-play betting, and mandate what the bill calls a ''commercially reasonable'' subscription fee for the data. There would also be a royalty fee that all sports betting operators would pay to the leagues.   Mr. Kilsby said the proposal in New York may be more palatable from an economic standpoint, with a royalty fee that rough calculations suggest might amount to something closer to 4 percent of revenues.   New York's law did not pass before the legislative session expired last month, but could be revisited in January. State regulators are working out details of a law passed in Pennsylvania. Comments sent to those regulators by Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and the PGA Tour push for official data and raise concerns about the data scouts, also called courtsiders, who could soon be as common in the United States as they are in Britain.   Covert 'Courtsiders'   Unofficial data ''is often collected by 'courtsiders,' who covertly collect data in arenas and stadiums,'' the leagues said. ''These courtsiders and scrapers operate in the shadows, compromise the legal market, fuel the illegal market and have no vested interest in the integrity of sports.''   The huge scale of the expected markets in New York and Pennsylvania would make a victory for the leagues here ''an influential precedent,'' Mr. Kilsby said. ''I don't think those states will give us a definitive answer to this question either way,'' he said. But he added that ''a lobbying victory for the leagues would put them on the board.''   Scott Kaufman-Ross, an N.B.A. vice president, said: ''For sports betting, official data should be the data that's used. People are putting money on the line. It's a real problem if they're not getting the most accurate, up-to-date information.'' Others, like Mr. Mergele of Stats, dismiss that notion, asserting what would amount to a league monopoly on data would be neither workable nor particularly accurate.   Lost in the legislative contests are the elaborate technical measures leagues have already put together to collect data they would like to see feeding betting sites across the United States.   During the most recent N.B.A. season and the finals, at least four people assigned by the teams sat courtside or at the top of the lower bowl of seats tapping on touch screens as the action proceeded in the games. Using a system developed by Genius Sports, three of those people entered the second-by-second statistics -- Steph Curry shooting a 3-pointer from a certain distance, a cross-court assist by LeBron James -- while the fourth acted as an initial quality-control spotter.   The data sped across the Hudson River to a room in Secaucus, N.J., next to the ''replay center'' that appeared occasionally on television during the finals. There, an N.B.A. monitoring group did a last check, and Sportradar sent the data to media outlets like television broadcasts and -- only outside the United States -- betting operators. The N.B.A. says that its deal with Sportradar strictly requires the data to be distributed only to licensed bookmakers abroad. Perhaps, though, the data will soon go to bookmakers in the United States.   ''I think that we have taken the time, the effort and the money to construct the best statistical system for the N.B.A. in the world,'' said Steve Hellmuth, N.B.A. executive vice president for media operations and technology, who has been instrumental in the creation of the league's statistics and player-tracking systems.   ''We didn't really construct this for betting,'' Mr. Hellmuth said, ''because when we constructed it, betting didn't exist. And then here comes gambling.''    "
Iran Denies Israeli Claim Of Data Theft,"Iran has denied as ''laughably absurd'' a detailed Israeli claim that intelligence agents stole clandestine Iranian documents this past winter that reveal what Israel has called Iran's extensive past research on nuclear bombs.  The Iranian denial, issued by the country's United Nations mission, was in response to articles in The New York Times and other publications in recent days about the detailed claim by Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous foreign threat.    The Times article, published in Monday's print editions, and similar accounts in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, were based on a partial viewing of the documents by journalists from those publications at the invitation of the Israeli government.   Israeli officials also provided new details on how they said the documents had been obtained -- through a secret raid on a Tehran warehouse on Jan. 31 by agents of the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, equipped with blowtorches.   The trove included what the Israelis described as 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans for building weapons.   There was nothing in Israel's claim that suggested the Iranians were still engaged in such activity, which American intelligence reports have said ended in 2003.   But the documents suggested not only that Iran had been deceitful but also that its work in weaponizing nuclear power had been far more sophisticated and organized than initially suspected.   The authenticity of the documents, which purport to be at least 15 years old, has not been independently confirmed.   Iran has always denied accusations by Israel and others that Iranian nuclear work was meant for military purposes, a denial that Iran's United Nations mission reiterated in response to Israel's latest claim.   ''Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country, and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd,'' a spokesman for the Iranian mission, Alireza Miryousefi, said in an emailed statement. ''It's almost as if they are trying to see what outlandish claims they can get a Western audience to believe.''   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel first announced the results of the seizure in April after he had given President Trump a private briefing.   Just days later, Mr. Trump made good on his longstanding vow to renounce the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that was negotiated by the Obama administration and the governments of five other major powers, including major European allies of the United States.

Don't Overlook the Security of Your Wi-Fi,"Chances are that when you bought a Wi-Fi router, you probably did not prioritize strong network security. After all, when we think about wireless connectivity in our homes, most of us generally care more about speed of data transmissions and how much range the router can cover.    But it's time to change our views. Network security needs to be high on our list of considerations because a Wi-Fi station is the gateway for devices to get on the internet. If your router is infected with malicious software, all your internet-connected devices become vulnerable, including your smartphone, computer, smart watch, television and Amazon Echo.   A recent cyberthreat underscores the need to take network security more seriously. Last month, Cisco's threat research arm, Talos, in collaboration with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, discovered that a malware system with links to Russia had infected hundreds of thousands of Wi-Fi routers made by popular brands like Netgear, TP-Link and Linksys. This month, Talos revealed the problem was even worse than initially thought: Routers from other brands like Asus and D-Link had also been infected.    That means base stations from every well-known router brand were a target for this malware, known as VPNFilter, which is capable of manipulating your web traffic. Attackers could use it to load a fake banking site on your computer browser that looks like the one you normally use and steal your credentials and clean out your bank accounts. They could also load spoof versions of an email site you use to steal your password and gain access to your communications.   Netgear, D-Link and Linksys said they advised people to install the latest security updates and to choose strong usernames and passwords. TP-Link and Asus did not respond to requests for comment.   Our remedy? For starters, make sure your Wi-Fi station is always running the latest version of its ''firmware,'' or software system, just as you are supposed to keep operating systems up-to-date for your smartphone and computer. In a 2014 survey of I.T. professionals and employees who work remotely conducted by the security firm Tripwire, only 32 percent said they knew how to update their routers with the latest firmware.   ''Most consumers don't know to patch these things,'' said Matt Watchinski, a senior director of Cisco Talos, who helped research the VPNFilter malware. ''They don't treat it like they do their air-conditioner or refrigerator, where we all know we should change the filters.''   Here's a guide to some of the best practices you can embrace to ensure that your router -- and, by extension, all your internet gadgets -- is safe.   Routinely update the firmware   Even though a router lacks moving parts, it needs to be maintained with the latest security updates. Easier said than done, right? Here is a basic step-by-step for how to do that:   â-  Consult the instruction manual for your router to get its IP address, a string of numbers that you will punch into a web browser for access to the router's web dashboard. Jot down the number and store it somewhere safe like your filing cabinet.   â-  After entering the router's IP address into a web browser, log in to the base station with your username and password. In the router's web dashboard, click on the firmware settings. Look for a button that lets you check for the latest firmware version.   â-  If an update is available, choose to install it and let the router restart. Repeat this process every three to six months.   Set a unique username and password   When you log in to your router, if your username and password are something like ''admin'' and ''password,'' you have a problem. Many Wi-Fi stations come with weak, generic passwords by default that manufacturers intend for you to change.   The problem with having a weak username and password is that anybody within range of your router could log in to it and change its settings, potentially opening it up to the outside world, said Dave Fraser, chief executive of Devicescape, a company that helps make public Wi-Fi networks more reliable for mobile phone service.   So while you are checking for firmware updates in your router's web dashboard, make sure to also check your security settings and change the username and password to something strong and unique. Security experts recommend creating long, complex passwords consisting of nonsensical phrases and added numbers and special characters. (Examples: My fav0rite numb3r is Gr33n4782# or The cat ate the C0TT0n candy 224%.) Write down these credentials on the same piece of paper where you recorded your IP address.   Replace your router every few years   Even if your router still appears to work properly, the device has reached the end of its life when manufacturers stop supporting it with firmware updates, leaving it vulnerable to future cyberthreats. You can expect this to happen every three to five years. At that point, it is crucial to upgrade to a new piece of hardware.   The best way to check is to look up your router on the manufacturer's website and read notes about its firmware releases. If there hasn't been a firmware update in the last year, the router has probably been discontinued.   Among the routers affected by the VPNFilter malware, a significant portion of them were more than five years old, said Cisco's Mr. Watchinski.   How did we get here in the first place? Historically, manufacturers have designed routers by cobbling together open-source software platforms with commodity components to produce base stations as cheaply as possible -- with little care for long-term security, Mr. Fraser said.   ''It is a miserable situation, and it has been from day one,'' he said. But Mr. Fraser added that there were now ''new world'' routers with operating systems, tougher security and thoughtful features to make network management easy.   If it is time to update your router, rid yourself of some of these headaches by looking for a smarter router. Check for Wi-Fi systems that offer automatic updates to spare you the headache of having to check and download updates periodically. Many modern Wi-Fi systems include automatic updates as a feature. My favorite ones are Eero and Google Wifi, which can easily be set up through smartphone apps.   The caveat is that smarter Wi-Fi systems tend to cost more than cheap routers that people are accustomed to. Eero's base stations start at $199, and a Google Wifi station costs $119, compared with $50 for a cheap router. For both of these systems, you can also add base stations throughout the home to extend their wireless connections, creating a so-called mesh network.   Another bonus? Mr. Fraser noted that more modern Wi-Fi systems should have longer life spans because the companies sometimes relied on different revenue streams, like selling subscriptions to network security services.

Putin Is Running a Destructive Cybercrime Syndicate Out of Russia,"The indictment of a dozen Russian military intelligence officers by my former boss, Robert Mueller, instantly reshaped the geopolitical backdrop of President Trump's summit meeting with Vladimir Putin. But the sad truth is that it's just more evidence of what we've known for years: Online, Russia is increasingly a rogue state, a country that plays by its own rules in cyberspace and today stands as the world's largest safe haven for cybercriminals -- not just protected but also aided and abetted by the state.   Recent headlines have focused on the attacks of the 2016 election, but every day Russian crooks inflict immense harm on real victims across our country and around the world, causing billions of dollars in losses.   Why won't President Trump call out Mr. Putin for Russia's rogue behavior in cyberspace?  Russia today hosts a ""who's who"" of the world's most wanted hackers, and the list grows almost monthly. The scale of their theft and damage is staggering. In February, the United States indicted 36 individuals for running Infraud, an online criminal enterprise whose brazen name made clear its intentions: ""In fraud we trust."" The Infraud website, which trafficked in stolen identities, financial information and malware, facilitated more than $530 million in losses over its seven years in operation; its ringleader, a Russian named Sergei Medvedev, was arrested in Thailand.  Because Russia shields and supports the thugocracy operating within its borders, in order for law enforcement to capture them, they have no choice but to wait for the hackers and criminals to travel overseas. Even then, the Russian state fights tooth and nail to protect crooks.   Through exemplary international law enforcement cooperation, the notorious Russian spam king Peter Levashov -- who was ranked sixth on a global most-wanted list of spammers -- was arrested last spring when he traveled to Spain for vacation. Russia fought his extradition, issuing its own arrest warrant for him in a ploy to bring him back home safely and stop him from being brought to justice. (Spanish authorities resisted, and a Spanish court allowed him to be extradited to Connecticut to stand trial.)  Russian obstruction efforts often succeed: In recent years, Russia persuaded a Cyprus court to return a hacker wanted by the United States for attacking an American Fortune 100 company; it also fought in Greece to bring home a hacker indicted in the United States for a $4 billion Bitcoin-laundering scheme. One reason Russia likes to bring its hackers back home is that it looks to these actors as potential recruits for state business. Alexsey Belan, currently one of the F.B.I.'s most-wanted cybercriminals, faces multiple indictments in the United States for major fraud schemes. In 2012 and again in 2013, he was charged with identity theft and intrusions against e-commerce companies in the United States. Last year he was indicted on a charge of leading, along with two F.S.B. -- a successor intelligence agency to the K.G.B. -- intelligence officers, a devastating assault on Yahoo that saw the theft of billions of user names. As outlined in the charging documents, instead of responding to requests for law enforcement cooperation, Russia signed him up as an intelligence asset.   Mr. Belan is hardly the only criminal recruited by the government: Another most-wanted man, Evgeniy Bogachev, was indicted on a charge of running the GameOver Zeus botnet, which stole more than $100 million from United States banks and businesses, crippling some of the small businesses he targeted. In 2014, investigators watched with amazement as Mr. Bogachev, apparently in cooperation with Russian intelligence, used his botnet (a remote-controlled network of compromised computers) to target Ukraine, Turkey, Georgia and other Russian adversaries to steal classified information. Given the increasing damage these activities inflict and the threat they pose to world commerce and order, in Helsinki, President Trump needs to call out Russia as the globe's worst actor online.   Both in my previous role in government and in my current practice, I am regularly approached by victims of this behavior -- companies or individuals whose losses count in the billions. They can't defend themselves alone; they need the United States government to stand up for them. President Trump has been silent on the issue, but not the rest of his administration, including his own White House. In February, Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a statement attributing the ""NotPetya"" ransomware attack in June 2017 to Russia, saying, ""The Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyberattack in history,"" which caused ""billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the Americas.""   Damage from that cyberattack alone stretched into the billions; FedEx reported that it suffered more than $300 million in damage. Merck, which had to replace more than 45,000 computers and 4,000 servers after being hit by the ransomware, suffered about $310 million in damage.  If Russia physically attacked the corporate headquarters of either Merck or FedEx, causing an equivalent amount of damage, the president would not remain silent. In the past week, Mr. Trump has called out countries including China, Canada and our closest NATO allies for actions that he believes harm United States businesses and interests. So it's inexplicable that the president has remained silent in the face of Russian actions to enable actors who prey on the very American companies and their employees and customers whom the administration claims to champion.   Cyberspace remains a new frontier where global rules and norms are still being established. There is nothing inherent about cyberspace that makes it impervious to law and order. Hard work by investigators and prosecutors around the world has shown time and again that cybercriminals are not anonymous -- a lesson underscored by Mr. Mueller's ability to name 12  Russian intelligence officers responsible for the 2016 election attacks -- and that the perpetrators of such crimes can be brought to justice.  Mr. Putin's Russia is the obstacle standing between the world's most notorious cybercriminals and a prison cell. It's time to say stop.

How Bitcoin Trips Up Hackers,"Kevin Werbach is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the forthcoming book ''The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust.'' The Russian operatives accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee in 2016 didn't use cash or credit cards. To pay for servers and domain names, they turned to Bitcoin, a digital currency that allows for secure payments without banks, government authorization or verified identities. Yet what makes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appealing to criminals also limits their usefulness to them. Bitcoin transaction records helped investigators find the Russian agents under indictment. To cover their tracks, the perpetrators of the hacking scheme would have been better off using briefcases full of cash.     The details of this case are an encouraging sign. Cryptocurrencies are part of a global experiment in making money -- the secure exchange of value -- as decentralized as information on the internet. Just as anyone can put up a blog without going through traditional media, cryptocurrencies can remove control from financial intermediaries.   And like the internet, cryptocurrencies are not inherently a force for lawlessness. Nor is their legitimacy guaranteed. Governments and the private sector must make existing gateways between cryptocurrency and the traditional financial world, such as Bitcoin exchanges, more transparent. And they must adopt mechanisms to limit illegal activity, fraud and regulatory evasion, while preserving the freedom to innovate.   Ironically, Bitcoin's success depends on the same critical factor as a state-issued ''fiat'' currency: the collective trust of its community of users. Their confidence in the accuracy of the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions is what makes the currency viable. Law-abiding citizens want efficient, reliable payments. Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, realized this. His 2008 white paper said a great deal about cutting out banks; it said nothing about evading the rule of law.   Cryptocurrencies make transactions trustworthy without relying on private intermediaries or central banks. Banks know your public identity, but they keep transaction specifics secret. Bitcoin does the opposite. Identities are represented with private, seemingly arbitrary strings of letters and numbers known as cryptographic keys. Transactions, however, are public. Anyone can see how the money flows. That's necessary for Bitcoin's security model, which relies on a public network of computers collectively validating transactions.   The problem for criminals is that it's possible to reconstruct Bitcoin identities from transaction patterns. The currency moves through gateways, exchanges and wallet systems, which makes it easier for people to acquire, store and use cryptocurrency in a world that still speaks dollars and euros. However, these systems are usually centralized, so they can be traced, and their administrators can be asked to cooperate with law enforcement. That is likely what happened in the Russian hacking case.   That is also what helped lead to the takedown in 2013 of Silk Road, a widely used online marketplace for drug transactions and other illegal purchases. BTC-E, a Russian cryptocurrency exchange, later became the platform of choice for criminals because it did not collect identification documents from its customers. BTC-E was shut down by American law enforcement agencies last year.   As these examples show, governments have more leverage over cryptocurrency markets than one might expect. In 2013, the Treasury Department issued guidelines requiring exchanges to verify customer identities. As a result, the volume of cryptocurrency obtained from illegal activity and laundered through Europe between 2013 and 2016 was five times as much as the amount that went through North America, according to a study published in January by the analytics firm Elliptic and the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance. Similar requirements will take effect in Europe next year.   There are ways to make cryptocurrency activity harder for law enforcement to track. But hiding transactions adds cost and complexity. More important, decentralized cryptocurrency networks still require trust in the software developers, transaction validators and other support organizations that work with them. These partners have to be responsible if they want to support large markets.   To be sure, there is still substantial illegal activity involving cryptocurrencies. Much of it, though, involves thefts and swindles from legitimate cryptocurrency users. Unless law enforcement and regulation weed out these bad actors, cryptocurrencies will not become mainstream.   The miracle of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they can create trustworthy transactions in the absence of financial institutions and processes that the world has relied on for centuries. Bitcoin took hold, in part, because the 2008 financial crisis shook so many people's faith in the status quo. Trust, however, is a fickle thing. Both cryptocurrency proponents and governments must sustain it to create a viable environment for the money of the future.

We Can't Stop the Hackers,"David E. Sanger is a national security correspondent for The New York Times. This article is adapted from his forthcoming book, ''The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age.'' WASHINGTON -- Ask finance ministers and central bankers around the world about their worst nightmare and the answer is almost always the same: Sometime soon the North Koreans or the Russians will improve on the two huge cyberattacks they pulled off last year. One temporarily crippled the British health care system and the other devastated Ukraine before rippling across the world, disrupting shipping and shutting factories -- a billion-dollar cyberattack the White House called ''the most destructive and costly in history.'' The fact that no intelligence agency saw either attack coming -- and that countries were so fumbling in their responses -- led a group of finance ministers to simulate a similar attack that shut down financial markets and froze global transactions. By several accounts, it quickly spun into farce: No one wanted to admit how much damage could be done or how helpless they would be to deter it.     Cyberattacks have been around for two decades, appearing in plotlines from ''Die Hard'' movies to the new novel by Bill Clinton and James Patterson. But in the real world, something has changed since 2008, when the United States and Israel mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history on Iran's nuclear program, temporarily crippling it in hopes of forcing Iran to the bargaining table. (The two countries never acknowledged responsibility for the attack.)   As President Barack Obama once feared, a cyberarms race of historic but hidden proportions has taken off. In less than a decade, the sophistication of cyberweapons has so improved that many of the attacks that once shocked us -- like the denial-of-service attacks Iran mounted against Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and other banks in 2012, or  North Korea's hacking of Sony in 2014 -- look like tiny skirmishes compared with the daily cybercombat of today.   Yet in this arms race, the United States has often been its own worst enemy. Because our government has been so incompetent at protecting its highly sophisticated cyberweapons, those weapons have been stolen out of the electronic vaults of the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. and shot right back at us. That's what happened with the WannaCry ransomware attack by North Korea last year, which used some of the sophisticated tools the N.S.A. had developed. No wonder the agency has refused to admit that the weapons were made in America: It raised the game of its attackers.   Nuclear weapons are still the ultimate currency of national power, as the meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last week showed. But they cannot be used without causing the end of human civilization -- or at least of a regime. So it's no surprise that hackers working for North Korea, Iran's mullahs, Vladimir V. Putin in Russia and the People's Liberation Army of China have all learned that the great advantage of cyberweapons is that they are the opposite of a nuke: hard to detect, easy to deny and increasingly finely targeted. And therefore, extraordinarily hard to deter.   That is why cyberweapons have emerged as such effective tools for states of all sizes: a way to disrupt and exercise power or influence without starting a shooting war. Cyberattacks have long been hard to stop because determining where they come from takes time -- and sometimes the mystery is never solved. But even as the United States has gotten better at attributing attacks, its responses have failed to keep pace.   Today cyberattackers believe there is almost no risk that the United States or any other power would retaliate with significant sanctions, much less bombs, troops or even a counter cyberattack. And though Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has said the United States should be prepared to use nuclear weapons to deter a huge non-nuclear attack, including using cyberweapons, against its electric grid and other infrastructure, most experts consider the threat hollow.   At his confirmation hearings in March to become director of the N.S.A. and commander of the United States Cyber Command, Gen. Paul Nakasone was asked whether our adversaries think they will suffer if they strike us with cyberweapons. ''They don't fear us,'' General Nakasone replied.   So while the United States remains the greatest cyberpower on earth, it is increasingly losing daily cyberconflicts. The range of American targets is so wide and deep that it is almost impossible to understand all of the vulnerabilities. And because most of those targets don't belong to the government -- banks, power grids, shipping systems, hospitals and internet-linked security cameras, cars and appliances -- confusion reigns over who is responsible for defending them and who will decide when to strike back. We have the most fearsome cyberweaponry on the planet, yet we're afraid to use it for fear of what will come next.   Consider the Russian cyberattacks that preceded the well-known hacking of the Democratic National Committee's computers in 2015 and 2016. Just before, Russian hackers had taken up residence in the unclassified servers at the State Department and the White House, and later deep inside the systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   At the State Department, the eviction took weeks, shutting down systems during negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal. The hackers were even bolder at the White House. Instead of disappearing when they were exposed, they fought back, looking to install new malware as soon as the old versions were neutralized. ''It was basically hand-to-hand combat,'' recalled Richard Ledgett, the deputy director of the N.S.A. at the time. It appears the attackers just wanted to prove they could go, and stay, anywhere in the American government's network.   Yet out of a reflexive secrecy about cyberoperations -- motivated by an unwillingness to acknowledge both our vulnerabilities and our detection abilities -- the United States never called out the Russians for what they were doing. Nor did we exact any punishment. That proved to be a huge mistake.   If Mr. Putin thought there was no price to be paid for invading White House systems, why wouldn't he attack the Democratic National Committee? And as the Russian attacks continued, no one in the American government detected the larger pattern or Russia's ambitions to affect the election. Most officials assumed it was plain old espionage.   ''It wasn't that we had our radar off to these kinds of attacks,'' a senior official told me. ''We hadn't even built the radar.''   By the summer of 2016, some Obama administration officials, waking to the threat, proposed counterstrikes that included exposing Mr. Putin's hidden bank accounts and his ties to the oligarchs and cutting off Russia's banking system. But the potential for escalation caused Mr. Obama and his top aides to reject the plan.   ''It was an enormously satisfying response,'' a senior American official told me later, ''until we began to think about what it would do to the Europeans.''   Mr. Obama also understandably feared that anything the United States did might provoke Mr. Putin to tinker with election systems just enough to give credence to Donald Trump's warning that the system was ''rigged.''   Since the election, the American retaliation has included closing some Russian consulates and recreation centers and expelling spies -- actions one Obama national security official called ''the perfect 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problem.'' President Trump has signed off on some additional economic sanctions against individual Russians.   But the United States' problem isn't toughness -- it's an absence of strategy. The larger lesson of the past few years is that unless we get smarter a lot faster about deterring these pernicious, hard-to-find forms of cyberaggression, much of what binds our digitally connected society will be eaten away. We have spent so much time worrying about a ''cyber Pearl Harbor,'' the attack that takes out the power grid, that we have focused far too little on the subtle manipulation of data that can mean that no election, medical record or self-driving car can be truly trusted. And ultimately that absence of trust will destroy the glue of American society the way the Stuxnet computer worm destroyed those Iranian centrifuges. It will cause them to spin out of control.   So what is to be done?   First, the United States must significantly improve its cyberdefenses. The wide-open vulnerabilities in America's networks have essentially deterred the United States from credibly threatening retaliation against the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians. One way to start is to make sure no new equipment goes on the market unless it meets basic security requirements. We won't let cars on the road without airbags, so why do we do less with the systems that connect them to the internet?   Second, we must decide what networks we care most about defending -- and make those priorities clear. Mr. Mattis's threat to turn to nuclear weapons hardly seems credible -- unless the cyberattack would create an existential threat to America. That requires an intensive public review of what is critical to our nation's survival. President Trump forfeited the perfect opportunity when he decided against a commission to learn the larger lessons from the 2016 election. Our politics have gotten in the way of our safety.   Finally, the United States needs to end the reflexive secrecy surrounding its cyberoperations. We need to explain to the world why we have cyberweapons, what they are capable of and, most important, what we will not use them for. Clearly, it is in the nation's interests to develop global norms clarifying that some targets are off limits: election systems, hospitals and emergency communications systems, and maybe even electric power grids and other civilian targets.   Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, has proposed digital Geneva Conventions that begin to establish those norms, outside the structure of governments and treaties. It's an imperfect solution, but a start. Intelligence agencies hate this idea: They want the most latitude possible for future operations in an uncertain world. But in any arms control negotiation, to create limits on others, you need to give up something. Otherwise, we will remain trapped in an endlessly escalating war, one we may well lose.

Why Hackers Aren't Afraid of Us; News Analysis,"WASHINGTON -- Ask finance ministers and central bankers around the world about their worst nightmare and the answer is almost always the same: Sometime soon the North Koreans or the Russians will improve on the two huge cyberattacks they pulled off last year. One temporarily crippled the British health care system and the other devastated Ukraine before rippling across the world, disrupting shipping and shutting factories -- a billion-dollar cyberattack the White House called ""the most destructive and costly in history."" The fact that no intelligence agency saw either attack coming -- and that countries were so fumbling in their responses -- led a group of finance ministers to simulate a similar attack that shut down financial markets and froze global transactions. By several accounts, it quickly spun into farce: No one wanted to admit how much damage could be done or how helpless they would be to deter it. Cyberattacks have been around for two decades, appearing in plotlines from ""Die Hard"" movies to the new novel by Bill Clinton and James Patterson. But in the real world, something has changed since 2008, when the United States and Israel mounted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history on Iran's nuclear program, temporarily crippling it in hopes of forcing Iran to the bargaining table.

A Rush to Track Digital Villainy,"Utah's chief law enforcement officer was deep in the fight against opioids when he realized that a lack of data on internet sales of fentanyl was hindering investigations. So the officer, Keith D. Squires, the state's public safety commissioner, created a team of analysts to track and chronicle online distribution patterns of the drug. In Philadelphia, hidebound ways of confronting iPhone thefts let thrive illicit networks to distribute stolen cellphones. Detectives treated each robbery as an unrelated street crime -- known as ''apple picking'' -- rather than a vast scheme with connected channels used by thieves to sell the stolen phones.    And in Nashville, investigators had no meaningful statistics on a nasty new swindle of the digital age: the ''cheating husband'' email scheme. In it, anonymous extortionists mass-email large numbers of men, threatening to unmask their infidelities. The extortionists have no idea if the men have done anything wrong, but enough of them are guilty, it turns out, that some pay up, sometimes with Bitcoin.    Each case demonstrates how the tools used to fight crime and measure crime trends in the United States are outdated. Even as certain kinds of crimes are declining, others are increasing -- yet because so many occur online and have no geographic borders, local police departments face new challenges not only fighting them, but also keeping track of them. Politicians often promote crime declines without acknowledging the rise of new cybercrimes.   Detectives only learned of the ''cheating husband'' scheme from faithful spouses who were not victims. The crime did not fit into any existing category, and since the police had made no arrests, they had no statistics to feed to a national crime database in Washington that can prepare other jurisdictions for the scheme.   ''Suspects take advantage, knowing that 'Hey, I'm basically committing crimes blindly,' without the fear of prosecution,'' said Capt. Jason M. Reinbold, commander of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department's criminal investigations division. ''And I can't analyze something if I don't have data.''   Many of the offenses are not even counted when major crimes around the nation are tallied. Among them: identity theft; sexual exploitation; ransomware attacks; fentanyl purchases over the dark web; human trafficking for sex or labor; revenge porn; credit card fraud; child exploitation; and gift or credit card schemes that gangs use to raise cash for their traditional operations or vendettas.   In a sense, technology has created an extraordinary moment for industrious criminals, increasing profits without the risk of street violence. Digital villainy can be launched from faraway states, or countries, eliminating physical threats the police traditionally confront. Cyberperpetrators remain unknown. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, ask themselves: Who owns their crimes? Who must investigate them? What are the specific violations? Who are the victims? How can we prevent it?   ''It's incredibly challenging,'' the police chief in Tucson, Chris Magnus, said. ''There's such a lack of clarity.''   The rise of the crimes flies in the face of the proclamations of politicians who declare crime an all but defeated societal ill.   ''You have to go back to the 1950s to see crime this low,'' Bill de Blasio, New York City's second-term Democratic mayor, said recently on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe.'' His comments reflected last year's historically low numbers of murders and shootings, burglaries, robberies and auto thefts -- offenses measured by the police CompStat tracking program.   But to many criminologists, academics and law enforcement leaders, crimes like car theft are anachronisms in a modern era in which the internet's virtual superhighways have supplanted brick-and-mortar streets as the scenes for muggings, prostitution rings or commercial burglaries. They see dips in traditional violence and larceny as offset by a twin phenomenon: A surge in the evolving crimes of the digital era, and the fact that they are not fully captured in law enforcement's reporting systems.   ''It's the old iceberg metaphor,'' said Nola Joyce, a former deputy commissioner of Philadelphia's police department. ''What we know about is above the surface. But in terms of value, and in terms of harm, a lot of that crime is below the surface.''   ''There's an old saying that came out of the Vietnam War,'' she added, ''that said, `If you can't measure what matters, what you measure matters a great deal.''   Ms. Joyce is working with others on a panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, to modernize local and federal crime-classification systems.   New solutions are a priority, too, for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and progressive police commanders. They say that without timely, accurate data on crime, criminal justice leaders cannot see and respond coherently to national trends or make informed policy and spending decisions or tailor deployment strategies to best battle them.   As Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group that has studied the issue, put it: ''The problem is, to use an overused expression, `You don't know what you don't know,' and by that I mean we don't know the extent of these incidents in our communities or from a national perspective.''   Indeed, an Internet Crime Complaint Center established by the F.B.I. in 2000, to capture internet crime, received 298,728 complaints in 2016, reflecting $1.3 billion in combined losses, according to a new report by Mr. Wexler's group. But Donna Gregory, the head of the center, said that number of complaints only represented about 10 to 12 percent of all estimated cybercrime victims in the United States in 2016, and a fraction of all victims worldwide. In fact, a single category of internet crime -- identify theft -- generated $15.4 billion in losses in 2014, according to a crime victimization survey by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.   In its report, Mr. Wexler's group said its findings represented a wake-up call for the nation's 18,000 policing agencies facing an increase in technology-based crimes, that sprawl across jurisdictions, and recommended they fight back with similar tools by: developing their own digital expertise; hiring civilian analysts; mining technology, to help solve crime; encouraging banks to forward reports of theft rather write off their losses.   Above all, policing needs ''better systems for gathering data,'' the report said.   It is an issue that dates back to 1929, when the F.B.I. first rolled out its Uniform Crime Reporting system that still stands today. Designed as a summary count, it mainly tracks a handful of so-called Part One index crimes: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, arson and auto theft. The counts include only the top charge in a given episode.   In the 1980s, the F.B.I., with Bureau of Justice Statistics, tried to improve the reporting by building the so-called National Incident-Based Reporting System to capture deeper levels of data across more categories. It created, for instance, ''crimes against a person'' which includes: assault, murder, kidnapping, abduction and sexual offenses. Each act is counted separately, within an incident or a crime that encompasses several criminal elements.   But 40 years later, data collection is still haphazard as policing agencies that protect just 31 percent of the country's population volunteer to abide by the deeper reporting standards. (An example: There is no national database of police officers' use of deadly physical force.) Still, the F.B.I. is charging forward, vowing to move fully to its 1980s-era vision by 2021. Only last year did it began collecting data on two new offenses in its fraud category: hacking/computer invasion and identify theft.   ''Crime data reporting -- in its current state -- is not collecting the right information to understand and analyze current events,'' Stephen G. Fischer Jr., an F.B.I. spokesman, said. ''Today's information age has changed how we see the world and what the world expects from policing.''   The panel of the National Academy of Sciences is looking past the F.B.I.'s unmet goals -- which it sees as one component of a new approach. The panel wants a fresh system for understanding the nature and extent of crime today, said Janet L. Lauritsen, the panel's chair and a criminology professor at the University of Missouri.   It envisions a format modeled in part, on an international framework organized by the United Nations that would reflect 11 prime categories of crime and 189 sublevels, including many that ''are just not even part of the national conversation on crime,'' Ms. Lauritsen said. It would, for instance, capture reports from federal agencies, she said, that have never reported crime data to the F.B.I., ''even though there is actually a law on the books,'' the Uniform Federal Crime Reporting Act, from 1988, that compels it.   Better data fosters transparency, which can build trust with civilians even if it yields statistical crime increases, said Col. Edwin C. Roessler Jr., the police chief in Fairfax County, Va., who is the F.B.I. director's chairman for converting policing to a new crime classification system. Data offers the evidence to lobby government for more money or better laws, he said. In fact, when Colonel Roessler demonstrated how each gang homicide, on average, required 25 search warrants for ''cyberdata, cellphones and other social media,'' it helped win financing for a new Cyber Bureau and new ''cyberexperts'' to work gang cases and build meaningful statistics and intelligence.   ''We've got gaps here, where we're not catching the root causes of all kinds of criminal activity,'' the colonel said, a flaw with real-life consequences.   So too, for Chief Magnus, in Tucson, who sees the lack of modern-day crime classification as ''one of our biggest frustrations.'' As he leads a force of 850 officers patrolling 300 square miles, lapses in accurate statistics on property crime, fraud, human trafficking and digital crime hurt his ability to deploy thin resources.   ''Once you get into cyberspace,'' he said, ''data about anything is so limited that it's really, really hard to figure out even what might be happening locally that impacts that crime.''    "
How Will We Outsmart A.I. Liars?; 11 Things We'd Really Like to Know,"During the summer before the 2016 presidential election, John Seymour and Philip Tully, two researchers with ZeroFOX, a security company in Baltimore, unveiled a new kind of Twitter bot. By analyzing patterns of activity on the social network, the bot learned to fool users into clicking on links in tweets that led to potentially hazardous sites. The bot, called SNAP_R, was an automated ""phishing"" system, capable of homing in on the whims of specific individuals and coaxing them toward that moment when they would inadvertently download spyware onto their machines. ""Archaeologists believe they've found the tomb of Alexander the Great is in the U.S. for the first time: goo.gl/KjdQYT,"" the bot tweeted at one unsuspecting user. Even with the odd grammatical misstep, SNAP_R succeeded in eliciting a click as often as 66 percent of the time, on par with human hackers who craft phishing messages by hand.  [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The bot was unarmed, merely a proof of concept. But in the wake of the election and the wave of concern over political hacking, fake news and the dark side of social networking, it illustrated why the landscape of fakery will only darken further. The two researchers built what is called a neural network, a complex mathematical system that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. A neural network can learn to recognize a dog by gleaning patterns from thousands of dog photos. It can learn to identify spoken words by sifting through old tech-support calls. And, as the two researchers showed, a neural network can learn to write phishing messages by inspecting tweets, Reddit posts, and previous online hacks. Today, the same mathematical technique is infusing machines with a wide range of humanlike powers, from speech recognition to language translation. In many cases, this new breed of artificial intelligence is also an ideal means of deceiving large numbers of people over the internet. Mass manipulation is about to get a whole lot easier. ""It would be very surprising if things don't go this way,"" said Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. ""All the trends point in that direction."" Many technology observers have expressed concerns at the rise of A.I. that generates Deepfakes -- fake images that look like the real thing. What began as a way of putting anyone's head onto the shoulders of a porn star has evolved into a tool for seamlessly putting any image or audio into any video. In April, BuzzFeed and comedian Jordan Peele released a video that put words, including ""we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet,"" into the mouth of Barack Obama. The threat will only expand as researchers develop systems that can metabolize and learn from increasingly large collections of data. Neural networks can generate believable sounds as well as images. This is what enables digital assistants such as Apple Siri to sound more human than they did in years past. Google has built a system called Duplex that can phone a local restaurant, make reservations, and fool the person on the other end of the line into thinking the caller is a real person. The service is expected to reach smartphones before the end of the year. Experts have long had the power to doctor audio and video. But as these A.I. systems improve, it will become easier and cheaper for anyone to generate items of digital content -- images, videos, social interactions -- that look and sound like the real thing. Inspired by the culture of academia, the top A.I. labs and even giant public companies such as Google openly publish their research and, in many cases, their software code. With these techniques, machines are also learning to read and write. For years, experts questioned whether neural networks could crack the code of natural language. But the tide has shifted in recent months. Organizations such as Google and OpenAI, an independent lab in San Francisco, have built systems that learn the vagaries of language at the broadest scales -- analyzing everything from Wikipedia articles to self-published romance novels -- before applying the knowledge to specific tasks. The systems can read a paragraph and answer questions about it. They can judge whether a movie review is positive or negative. This technology could improve phishing bots such as SNAP_R. Today, most Twitter bots seem like bots, especially when you start replying to them. In the future, they will respond in kind. The technology also could lead to the creation of voice bots that can carry on a decent conversation -- and, no doubt one day, will call and persuade you to divulge your credit-card information. These new language systems are driven by a new wave of computing power. Google engineers have designed computer chips specifically for training neural networks. Other companies are building similar chips, and as these arrive, they will accelerate A.I. research even further. Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, can see a not-too-distant future in which governments create machine-learning systems that attempt to radicalize populations in other countries, or force views onto their own people. ""This is a new kind of societal control or propaganda,"" he said. ""Governments can start to create campaigns that target individuals, but at the same time operate across many people in parallel, with a larger objective."" Ideally, artificial intelligence could also provide ways of identifying and stopping this kind of mass manipulation. Mark Zuckerberg likes to talk about the possibilities. But for the foreseeable future, we face a machine-learning arms race. Consider generative adversarial networks, or GANs. These are a pair of neural network systems that can automatically generate convincing images or manipulate existing ones. They do this by playing a kind of cat-and-mouse game: the first network makes millions of tiny changes to an image -- snow gets added to summery street scenes, grizzlies transform into pandas, fake faces look so convincing that viewers mistake them for celebrities -- in an effort to fool the second network. The second network does its best not to be fooled. As the pair battle, the image only gets more convincing -- the A.I. trying to detect fakery always loses. Detecting fake news is even harder. Humans can barely agree on what counts as fake news; how can we expect a machine to do so? And if it could, would we want it to? Perhaps the only way to stop misinformation is to somehow teach people to view what they see online with extreme distrust. But that may be the hardest fix of them all.

Will China Hack the U.S. Midterms?,"President Trump recently accused the Chinese of interfering in American politics ahead of the midterm elections. ""They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade,"" he said, addressing the United Nations Security Council. He provided no evidence, and appeared to be complaining mostly about retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese government, which may hurt constituencies that support him, and an advertorial touting U.S.-China trade in an Iowa newspaper. In a speech to the Hudson Institute on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence doubled down on the accusation, arguing that China ""has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential elections."" Neither the president nor the vice president charged China with stealing and releasing politically sensitive emails or manipulating social media, as the Russian government appears to have done to sway the 2016 presidential election. And the Chinese government has not yet tried to use cyberspace to disrupt American elections, it seems. Yet the threat is real.  China has both the playbook and the capacity to interfere. Chinese entities operating with the assent of the government in Beijing already have mounted long-running cyberespionage campaigns against United States government agencies, the defense industry and American private companies. And they have conducted disruptive cyberattacks on political processes and social media campaigns in targets the Chinese government considers internal: Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In 2012, during a wave of self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese repression, online discussions using the hashtag #FreeTibet were often drowned out by bots and fake Twitter accounts. It is difficult to tie Beijing directly to the bots, but there is good reason to suspect a connection given that government-supported hackers have targeted Tibetan activists and exiles before then and since. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a series of protests calling for more direct democracy in Hong Kong, Chinese hackers with suspected ties to intelligence agencies infected the devices of activists with spyware. They also conducted denial-of-service attacks on Apple Daily, a newspaper critical of Beijing, and on an academic website that was carrying out a civic referendum about expanding voting rights in Hong Kong. Chinese hackers have often used Taiwan to test cyber espionage techniques that are later deployed against other targets, and they appear to being doing the same with online influence operations. Beijing is suspected of being behind a disinformation campaign last year that claimed that the government of President Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan. was planning tostrictly regulate Buddhist and Taoist temples and ban the burning of incense. The government denied having any such intentions, but temple owners from across the island held protests in Taipei, believing the fake policy announcement. In July, the website of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party was hacked. Legislators from the party have complained about the proliferation of online trolling and fake news campaigns originating from China in the run-up to local elections -- and ahead of Taiwan's 2020 presidential race. Seen from Beijing's vantage point, these operations are responses to internal threats. And so far China doesn't seem to have intervened in another country's elections through online attacks. Perhaps this is because it has other means of influence at its disposal. Money, political and academic exchanges, the mobilization of Chinese communities overseas, the expanding reach of state media -- all have been effective ways of promoting China's interests abroad. Compared with their Russian counterparts, Chinese intelligence officers historically have pursued their country's foreign policy objectives by cultivating long-term relationships rather than through disinformation. Russian operations tend to heighten political divisions to drive a wedge in the target society: Russia-linked bots pushed both pro- and anti-vaccination information in the United States between 2014 and 2017, and a Russian agency with ties to the Kremlin bought Facebook ads about divisive issues such as race, abortion and gender equality ahead of the 2016 election. Chinese operations aim instead to cultivate common interests with powerful actors. China's and Russia's influence techniques differ because their strategic goals do. Both governments may want to weaken the United States and its alliances, but Beijing seems more intent than Moscow on bending institutions to meet its interests: Perhaps it hopes to supplant the current international order, but not by completely disrupting it. For example, Chinese officials have proposed new rules for governing cyberspace, arguing that each country should be able to regulate its internet, free of outside intervention. In the past, Beijing has denied claims by the United States government and American cybersecurity firms that it uses the Ministry of State Security, the People's Liberation Army and private actors for cyber espionage. Anyway, there are no international agreements restricting such spying. Revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that American government agencies have also engaged in hacking only make Washington's complaints seem hypocritical. When Americans accuse the Russian government of meddling, it simply refutes the charges, with little concern about being believable, or anything other than its power relative to Washington's. Getting caught using cyberattacks to disrupt an election would seriously undermine both Beijing's narrative that it has an alternative but cooperative model of international governance to offer and its vision of itself as a rising power committed to not interfering in other countries' internal affairs. China's continued restraint, however, is not guaranteed. Beijing has invested heavily in artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies that could boost its ability to manipulate information in the future. There is a growing pushback against all forms of Chinese influence in Australia, Europe, New Zealand and the United States. In addition, the Chinese leadership increasingly believes that Washington is moving away from a strategy of engaging China toward a policy designed to contain its rise. The loss of traditional means of influence and a more conflictual relationship with liberal democracies may eventually convince Beijing that it stands to gain from resorting to more aggressive methods online. If so, the tactics it has deployed in Taiwan may provide a model for any operations in the United States. For example, Chinese hackers could steal and release documents and emails from congressional staffers or State Department officials to, say, expose and embarrass supporters of closer relations with Taiwan or critics of America's allies. As it watches Washington struggle to find a coherent response to Russian interference in 2016, the Chinese government is likely to think that it could avoid serious repercussions if it ever launched similar cyberattacks in the United States. Were China's strategic calculations to change, there would be little to stop it from entering the online fray.

Monitoring the Health of a Backup Drive,"Q. I've been backing up my computer to two different external hard drives -- one made by Seagate and the other by Western Digital. The backup drives are now six years old. I know hard drives fail after a while, so when should I replace these drives with new ones?  A. The life span of hard disk drives, both internal and external, can be difficult to predict. The mechanical state of the drive's motor, the number of hours the drive has been in use and its environmental conditions are just a few factors that could alter its condition. Manufacturer warranties on the hardware -- often two or three years for consumer-focused products -- are no guarantee of the drive's life expectancy, either.    While it may not be possible to predict exactly when an external drive will fail, closely monitoring the device for grinding noises or other erratic behavior (like unusual slowness) can offer clues to its health. Many manufacturers, including Seagate and Western Digital, offer utility and diagnostic programs in the support areas of their sites. You can use these programs to periodically test the health and file systems of your drives.   Backing up the computer is vital if you have your digital life stored there in documents, photos, videos and other files. If you are getting concerned about the age of your backup drives, swapping them out for new hardware might provide peace of mind. Wirecutter, a product review and recommendation site owned by The New York Times, has done extensive testing on external desktop hard drives and currently favors a 4-terabyte Seagate Backup Plus Desktop model.   Mixing in cloud-based backup along with alternating external drives also adds a layer of data protection. Depending on your system, you might be able to back up your photos and files to services like Apple's iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive or another third-party file-sharing service.   Dedicated online backup services are another option to supplement your data security. Backblaze, in addition to being Wirecutter's pick for best online backup service, has been running an independent study on hard drive reliability since 2013. The Hard Drive Stats survey can get a bit technical, but it does provide a snapshot of drive failure rates over a period of several years -- if you want to see one attempt to collect information about the life of the average hard drive.

Locked Out of Your iPhone? Here's What to Do; TECH TIP,"Q. What do you do if you forget your iPhone passcode and get a message on the lock screen saying the phone is disabled? What is disabling it? A. The passcode and other security protections that Apple builds into its iOS software are designed to prevent anyone but the owner (or trusted associate) from using the device. In more recent versions of the system, a tool called Find My iPhone Activation Lock prevents thieves from erasing and selling stolen iPhones and other gear by requiring the Apple ID name and password of the rightful owner -- if the Find My iPhone location-tracking service is enabled.  However, all of these measures can also lock out the gadget's rightful owner if the passcode is forgotten or entered incorrectly too many times. If that happens, your phone displays the ""disabled"" message.  Even if you cannot remember the passcode, you should be able to get the iPhone working again. But to do that, you usually have to erase its contents first and then restore a backup of your personal information on the device.  The steps for erasing and restoring the phone depend on how (and if) you backed up its contents. You will also need an internet connection to download any required software updates and to reactivate the phone. If you used Apple's iTunes program on your Mac or Windows computer to synchronize and back up the iPhone, you can use iTunes to ditch the passcode and restore your data. Start by connecting the iPhone to the computer you used for backing it up and let iTunes sync up with it. Click the iPhone icon in the iTunes window and select the Restore iPhone button.  The iTunes software may want to download the latest version of iOS, but follow the steps on the screen to start the process. When the iPhone has been erased and you are to the point where the program sees it as a new phone to set up, select Restore from iTunes Backup and install the most recent backup to return your personal information to the device. (You can also restore your data from an iCloud backup, but you need to erase the phone first, and that requires the passcode or Apple ID credentials.) If you never backed up the iPhone with iTunes, you can still use the program to regain control of the device, but you first need to erase the phone with its Recovery Mode tool. Use the USB cable that came with the phone and connect it to a computer with iTunes installed and open on screen. Next, reboot the iPhone by holding down a combination of buttons, which vary by model. For the latest versions (the iPhone X, iPhone 8, or iPhone 8 Plus), quickly press and let go of the Volume Up button, and then do the same thing with the Volume Down button. Next, press and hold down the iPhone's Side button until the Recovery Mode screen with an iTunes icon appears. On the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus models, press and hold down the Volume Down and Side buttons simultaneously until the phone boots into the Recovery Mode screen. If you have an iPhone 6s or older model (or an iPad or iPod Touch), press and hold down the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button on the top or side until the Recovery Mode screen appears. With the phone in recovery mode, you should see an iTunes message on the computer offering to Restore or Update the device. Click Restore and wait for iTunes to download the necessary software. (If you have a slow internet connection, you may have to restart the phone in Recovery Mode again after 15 minutes.) Once the software downloads, follow the steps on screen to restore your device. If you select a new passcode, write it down or save it in a password-manager app. You will most likely be asked to enter your Apple ID name and password as part of the restoration process, especially if the Activation Lock setting was enabled. If you have been backing up the phone to your iCloud account, your contacts and other data should download again to the phone.

Facebook Isn't Silicon Valley's Only Problem,"Over the past several months, there has been an onslaught of alarming news about Facebook's collection and sharing of users' personal data. The resulting public scrutiny of Facebook is well deserved. But as we scramble to understand the societal harms caused by one Silicon Valley behemoth, we mustn't turn a blind eye to those instigated by the rest of the technology industry. Facebook is deservedly the most visible public target right now. In March, the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie revealed that the British political advisory firm Cambridge Analytica had illegitimately gained access to more than 50 million people's Facebook data through the efforts of a foreign academic, Aleksandr Kogan. The next month, it was reported that the real number was 87 million. Weeks later, Facebook confirmed that it had entered into many more data partnerships with questionable applications, around 200 of which the company suspended. And last month, it came to light that Facebook has had longstanding data-sharing arrangements with no fewer than 60 manufacturers of device technology, partnerships about which political leaders have expressed deep reservations.  But the reality is that the digital wilderness stretches far beyond Facebook, to a much larger tech ecosystem that deserves holistic examination and, potentially, regulation in the days ahead. Take, for instance, the industry's widespread but largely nontransparent partnerships with data brokers -- companies that are in the business of quietly collecting an enormous amount of sensitive personal data and selling it to whoever will pay for it. Facebook announced recently that it will shut down Partner Categories, the feature that allows data brokers to pipe sensitive information -- like your personal interests and behaviors -- into Facebook's advertising management system. That allows marketers like Chanel or the N.B.A. to target you with digital ads that they predict you will find relevant. Facebook's pivot was both necessary to protect individual privacy and long overdue. But the use of data provided by leading data brokers like Acxiom, Experian and Oracle -- which typically disclose very little about what kinds of personal data they have and how they use it -- is still commonplace across the internet, and most tech companies are willfully uncommunicative about the nature of their commercial partnerships with data brokers. Digital marketers still purchase access to tools and products provided by data brokers and apply them in ad campaigns on major internet platforms as a matter of everyday business. Consider, too, that most Silicon Valley giants invite third-party developers to create executable programs -- like mobile applications and internet-based games -- that sit atop their platforms. Facebook recently disclosed that it would be suspending around 200 such partnerships with third-party applications in light of its internal post-Cambridge Analytica investigation. One can only imagine what policies these developers might have breached, but given that the investigation was designed to uncover data misuse, it is likely that they had access to large amounts of Facebook user data and used or shared it without any sort of oversight or restriction. Facebook's internal review, even if it was undertaken in response to external criticism, is vital to ensure that personal data is not used inappropriately. And that is precisely why we should also take the magnifying glass to Google, Apple and others that similarly partner with vast developer communities that receive special access to inordinate amounts of sensitive user data. Another example of common practice across the American technology industry is the cultivation of commercial partnerships with foreign companies in ways that present significant national security concerns. Internet companies often make business decisions that cause the United States intelligence community great consternation. Reports about Facebook's data-sharing arrangements with manufacturers were especially alarming because some of them were Chinese companies, including Huawei, which reportedly has close relations with China's government. This raised serious national security concerns: Could the Chinese government have had access to the Facebook data of American citizens? This line of thinking has spurred new inquiries and more policy responses from Facebook -- including the recent announcement that it will end its partnership with Huawei. But Facebook is not the only company that should present such concerns. Just last year, for example, Apple complied with a new Chinese law that required foreign businesses that wish to hold data on Chinese citizens to open a data center in China, enter into commercial partnership with a local Chinese technology company and give the Chinese security authorities access to user data should they demand it -- practices that contradict ethical standards. All internet companies must place humanity first and profits second. The public scrutiny of Facebook has led it to make positive changes in that direction, but we can't forget to hold the broader industry accountable, too.

Greek Court Rules for Russia in Fight Over Cybercrime Suspect,"MOSCOW -- A Greek Supreme Court ruling Tuesday in a computer crime case may return to Russia, rather than extradite to the United States, a potential witness in the investigation into Russian hacking during the 2016 American presidential election. The Greek police detained the man, Aleksandr V. Vinnik, last year on an American warrant that accuses him of running a Moscow-based Bitcoin exchange that laundered as much as $4 billion in illegal funds. The warrant made no mention of election hacking. But Mr. Vinnik is accused of operating the exchange, BTC-e, at a time when, American prosecutors say, hackers used such funds to finance the electronic break-in at the Democratic National Committee and other targets. The practice was described in an indictment obtained by the special counsel investigating Russian election meddling, Robert S. Mueller III.  Mr. Vinnik has been languishing in a Greek jail cell since July 2017, when the authorities arrested him as he was vacationing in a small beachside village in northern Greece. It was one of a series of American moves against Russians described as cybercriminals as they traveled. In Mr. Vinnik's case and in two others in Spain and the Czech Republic, the Russian authorities countered with competing extradition requests asserting that the Russians had also committed crimes at home, and that they had not come to light before they left the country. Far-fetched as it may seem, the legal maneuver has worked. And it put European governments in a tug of war between Moscow and Washington over Russians suspected of being computer criminals. Spain and the Czech Republic eventually extradited the suspects to the United States. The American authorities had been pressing Greece to hand over Mr. Vinnik, and Greece initially appeared willing to comply. In October, a three-member panel of judges in the northern city of Thessaloniki backed the American extradition request. But since then, the case has taken on a series of unusual twists. After Mr. Vinnik's lawyers filed an appeal to the Greek Supreme Court, France also demanded his extradition, claiming he had bilked around 100 French citizens by launching cyberattacks through his Bitcoin platform. In July, the judges in Thessaloniki reversed course and agreed to extradite him to France. That ruling dealt a fresh blow to the tenuous relations between Moscow and Athens, which has long courted Russia as an ally. Earlier that month, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had drawn Vladimir V. Putin's wrath by expelling two Russian diplomats and refusing entry to two others. He acted after Athens said it had uncovered evidence of a Kremlin-backed campaign to manipulate regional politics. Mr. Tsipras accused Russia of fomenting raucous protest rallies in Greece and Macedonia over a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which would put it on a path to join NATO. Russia, which vigorously opposes an enlargement of the Western alliance, retaliated by expelling Greek diplomats, and accused Washington of ""putting pressure"" on Greece. When the Thessaloniki court then refused to hand Mr. Vinnik to Moscow, Russia's foreign ministry warned it would consider reprisals. Mr. Tsipras's government insisted it wanted to maintain friendly relations. And less than a month later, on July 30, the Thessaloniki court changed course again and accepted Russia's request that Mr. Vinnik be extradited to Russia. On Tuesday, the Greek Supreme Court issued a preliminary ruling backing the decision. The court is scheduled to issue a final ruling next week. Greece's justice minister will make the final decision on where Mr. Vinnik will be extradited. In an interview last year, Mr. Vinnik's Russian lawyer, Timofey S. Musatov, said his client's case in the United States was unrelated to electoral hacking. Russian prosecutors filed an extradition request on a fraud charge. Mr. Musatov could not be reached for comment Tuesday. In July, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers and revealed details of their operation, including the use of computer servers paid for ""using cryptocurrency."" At the time, Mr. Vinnik's BTC-e platform was the largest virtual currency exchange in Russia. In the cases in Spain and the Czech Republic, relatives and Russian lawyers said the American authorities were seeking access to the suspects for information about election hacking, though the Department of Justice made no such assertions in indictments. A Russian lawyer representing one suspect, Yevgeniy A. Nikulin, wrote an open letter to President Trump warning that his client would be forced to falsely confess to election meddling if extradited to the United States from the Czech Republic. The wife of another suspect, Pyotr Y. Levashov, said the Spanish police told her at the time of the arrest that he was wanted in the United States for election hacking. The Department of Justice sought Mr. Nikulin over accusations that in 2012 he hacked three American technology companies: LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring. The allegations against Mr. Levashov related to the spam promotion of penny stocks and pharmaceuticals. Liz Alderman reported from Paris.  PHOTO: The Greek police detained Aleksandr V.

"Why It's Called Blockchain, and Other Answers","A blockchain is a relatively new kind of database that has become the trendy solution for storing digital information more securely. The International Data Corporation recently forecast that companies and governments will spend $2.1 billion on blockchains in 2018, more than double what was spent last year. But if you ask even the people who work with blockchains to define the technology, you are likely to get a stuttering response.    Don't blockchains have something to do with Bitcoin?   Indeed. The first blockchain was the database on which every Bitcoin transaction was stored. Since Bitcoin began in 2009, the blockchain has come to hold over 160 gigabytes worth of data about every time a Bitcoin is sent between two digital wallets.    Why is it called a blockchain?    In the original documents describing Bitcoin, the virtual currency's new database was not referred to as a blockchain. But it got that name over time because all of the transactions coming onto the network were grouped into blocks of data and then chained together using sophisticated math. That makes it hard to go back and rewrite or monkey with the older records. Academics have pointed out that this design existed before Bitcoin, but Bitcoin brought it to prominence.   How is the blockchain different than other databases used to store transactions?   Most databases used to keep financial records are maintained by a central institution. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is responsible for keeping track of how much money is in all of its customers' accounts. With Bitcoin's blockchain database, the ledger is kept and updated communally by all the computers that are hooked into the Bitcoin network. The communally maintained nature of the Bitcoin blockchain has brought it comparisons with Wikipedia, which relies on a broad network of contributors rather than one author.   The shared nature of the Bitcoin blockchain was useful for the virtual currency because the shadowy creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, wanted to create a currency with no central authority involved. Because the records are kept communally, no one computer or institution is in charge. If any one computer keeping the records is hacked or knocked offline, the other computers can go on without it.   Are all the blockchain projects tied to Bitcoin in some way?   No. Most blockchains have nothing to do with Bitcoin.   After the Bitcoin blockchain had operated for a number of years -- successfully storing every Bitcoin transaction and surviving numerous attacks from hackers -- many programmers and entrepreneurs wondered if the design of the Bitcoin blockchain might be replicated to create other kinds of secure ledgers, unrelated to Bitcoin.   Are blockchains used only for recording virtual currency transactions?   No. Most of the early efforts to imitate the Bitcoin blockchain were done by programmers looking to create virtual currencies with slightly different characteristics from Bitcoin, and that needed their own databases to store all the transactions. Over time, some of these new virtual currencies added on significant new features that updated the blockchain concept so that it could handle more kinds of information.   The most valuable virtual currency other than Bitcoin is Ether, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition to recording virtual currency transactions, the Ethereum blockchain can record and execute simple programs. It is possible, for instance, to create a program on the Ethereum blockchain that will move Ether between wallets only after a specific event.   More recently, many companies and governments have been interested in using blockchains to store data that has nothing to do with virtual currency transactions, or transactions of any sort. While banks are building blockchains that can track payments between accounts, governments are experimenting with using blockchains to store property records and votes.   Why is this unusual way of storing data something that companies are excited about?   There are several limitations that come with the old way of keeping data, with a single authority responsible for all the updates.   When a database is maintained by a single authority, if that authority gets compromised by a hacker, or even by natural disaster, the people relying on that database can lose access to all their data. With a blockchain, all the people relying on the database can keep and update their own copy of the data.   Apart from the security, a lot of data is kept in a way that requires all the players to separately keep track of the records themselves. Banks, for instance, keep track of every transaction they do with other banks, even though the other banks are also keeping track of the same records. It costs a lot to make sure everyone's records are in sync. Blockchains can potentially provide a more efficient way to do this so that everyone is always on the same page.   If blockchains involve multiple computers all keeping track of data, what if they disagree?    This issue, of how to keep everyone on the same page, is what the most important, but also the most confusing, bits of blockchain technology are aimed at resolving.   In Bitcoin, the process of mining, or creating new Bitcoin, also has a second purpose of making sure everyone is making the same updates to their copy of the blockchain. Most virtual currencies have used this process to coordinate everyone on the blockchain.   When blockchains don't have a virtual currency, they have to find a different mechanism to get everyone to agree on new additions to the ledger. These mechanisms are called consensus algorithms, and they are among the most contentious pieces of blockchain design.   Can anyone join any blockchain and help update the records?   With most large virtual currencies, anyone can join in and see and help maintain the records. These are called public blockchains.   This system has made many big players looking at the technology uncomfortable. Consequently, most corporations and governments have worked with so-called private blockchains, which only approved computers can see and join.   Haven't all the thefts involving Bitcoin shown that blockchains aren't secure?   Most of the thefts involving virtual currencies are a result of people's having the password, or private key, to a virtual currency wallet stolen or hacked. Virtual currencies are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because once a hacker moves money out of a wallet, there is no central authority to move it back. Any blockchain wallet or account is generally only as secure as its private key.   While private keys are a security vulnerability, blockchains are generally more secure against attacks in which a bad actor tries to change the records in the database. Because of the way blocks are chained together, it is obvious when someone has tampered with old records.   Do we know if blockchains really are better than old ways of recording data?    We don't, really. Virtual currencies have shown that blockchains can work at some level, but they also come with significant downsides. Because all the computers on the network have to record every transaction, there are limits to how much data blockchains have been able to process. There are many efforts to fix this, but none have been proven to work.   Many critics of the blockchain design have said the inefficiencies in keeping data communally are likely to make blockchains unattractive except in cases where centrally kept databases are a major liability.   At this point, aside from the big virtual currencies, few blockchains have been used and battle tested in the real world for any amount of time, which leaves significant questions about how they will perform once they make it into use.

The Trouble With Cryptocurrency's Viral Growth,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have lost over half their value so far in 2018, and more than that since late 2017. These virtual currencies have crashed before, but this time they seem in no hurry to gain back lost ground, largely because recent evidence has revealed problems with the new technology.  In one recent study, a team of academic researchers said that market manipulation might have been behind Bitcoin's steep increase in value in 2017. And a recent report by the New York attorney general's office found substantial risk that consumers who invested in cryptocurrency could lose access to it, either temporarily or permanently, if there were problems at their exchange. The report also uncovered that many of the exchanges had traded on their own markets, essentially creating a conflict of interest in which they were trading against their own customers.  It wasn't supposed to be like this. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were started not as a way to get rich but to provide an electronic payment system that was more secure and resistant to fraud than credit cards and eliminated the need for trusted intermediaries like financial institutions. Because cryptocurrencies were not controlled by a central institution like a government or even a governing nonprofit, they were supposed to give the holder the reliability of gold, without the inconvenience of having to transfer a physical item to make a transaction.  Large organizations and technically savvy users may have valid reasons for using cryptocurrencies, especially for transactions between governments or large multinational corporations. However, for the ordinary citizen, cryptocurrency is in fact less secure, more vulnerable to sudden drops in value and -- surprisingly -- more dependent on trust in an intermediary institution than fiat currency like the United States dollar.  In the world of cryptocurrency, there are two categories of intermediary institutions. The first category contains the exchanges where users buy, sell and store their virtual currency. These exchanges include Coinbase, which the New York attorney general's report claimed traded on its own platform, and the now-bankrupt Mt. Gox exchange, which lost over 700,000 of its users' Bitcoins to hackers in 2014. The second category is made up of the people and companies who create and sell their own cryptocurrency, using initial coin offerings. This year, two founders of a virtual currency called Centra were arrested and charged with ""conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud."" In May, The Wall Street Journal found that hundreds of initial coin offerings were ""using deceptive or even fraudulent tactics to lure investors."" More recently, social networks such as Facebook promised to connect everyone in the world and give users a platform to speak freely. As we've seen, they did not make things free; they opened us up to manipulation by anyone, anywhere. There is a feeling I get when I log in to Facebook and am assaulted by clickbait news, overly intrusive ads and a confusing inability to configure my feed to show me the updates from friends that I came here to Facebook to read. ""Free"" is not the word for it. Facebook has become less free than an ordinary real-life conversation, not despite the ability to connect to to anyone but because of it. We saw something similar in peer-to-peer lending, where people could take the savings of one person who needed to invest and transfer it to another person who needed to borrow. The system was supposed to make the economy work more fairly, by removing the arbitrary and inefficient banker middlemen. Instead of following through on its promise, peer-to-peer lending in China has resulted in a lot of lost money for ordinary citizen savers, creating an unstable financial sector.  In software engineering, we have a phrase for this: ""That's not a bug, it's a feature."" Established systems (such as customs, regulations or software) are the way they are, for many reasons, some of them now forgotten. Sometimes we never know all the reasons a system needed restrictions or limitations until we discover a way to make new systems without them and discover (for better or for worse) what happens without those constraints. Cryptocurrency, peer-to-peer lending, and anonymity and pseudonymity in communication are all impressive feats of engineering. They are also all excellent at showing us the value of a society that requires a stable identity, government support of a currency and oversight of its financial systems.  Bitcoin's first commercial transaction was in 2010; by late 2017 it had grown to a value of over $100 billion. Facebook grew to one billion users in about the same amount of time. The word ""viral"" is often used to describe such exponential growth, but viruses grow exponentially for a reason, and it has nothing to do with a benefit to the host. If a new technology grows exponentially, that ought to make us wary, not excited.  We need time to discover and address the problems in any new system. We also need time to revisit the restrictions and limitations of established systems, and see if they still apply. The underlying danger is that some of these new systems and technologies have grown too fast and have been adopted for general use before we recognize the problems caused by their lack of restrictions.  Many of the so-called limitations of government-regulated currencies are features, not bugs. There is a place for cryptocurrency, though I don't believe it's for the average, nontechnical user. In general, cryptocurrencies are not a replacement for ordinary currencies. That's not in spite of their freedom from government control but precisely because of it.

A Perfect Target for Cybercriminals,"When hackers went after the Onslow Water and Sewer Authority last month, it was the second cyberattack on a North Carolina utility within a year. The hackers, who timed this attack for the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, caused ""a catastrophic loss"" by encrypting databases and locking out employees. Rather than pay a ransom to the hackers, the utility is rebuilding its information technology systems from scratch. We need water for everything from cooking to manufacturing. Technological advances that make our water supply smarter -- automating chemical treatment, for example, or enabling electronic billing --  also make it more vulnerable to cyberattacks.   According to the Department of HomelandSecurity, more than 150,000 systems deliver clean water to Americans and dispose of wastewater. Drinking water is delivered by more than a million miles of pipes -- four times the length of the national highway system. The New York City government controls America's largest single-source water supply -- a reservoir system supplying 1.2 billion gallons of water a day -- and the city's Department of Environmental Protection employs nearly 200 officers to protect the system. Each water system is operated by its own industrial control system, which in most cases evolved over decades with a hodgepodge of functions and technologies layered on top of older infrastructure. For example, water can travel up to 125 miles within New York City's system before it reaches a faucet. Along the way, it's disinfected with chlorine and then slowed down to pass through 56 containers holding ultraviolet lights in quartz tubes. The water gets fluoride to protect teeth and phosphoric acid to protect the distribution pipes. Throughout the process, a centralized computer system gathers data and creates detailed projections.  In our complex and aging chain of reservoirs, aqueducts, tunnels and pipes, the weakest link could actually be the newest additions. Until recently, water systems were typically ""air-gapped,"" meaning they were physically separated from the internet and from any computer connected to the internet. This held a twofold advantage: The systems didn't require network connectivity to function, and they were harder to attack. But as water systems modernize their purification, distribution and maintenance, their industrial control systems have started to lose their air gaps -- and have increasingly become potential targets. The specter of operational attacks isn't theoretical. In 2016, Syrian-linked hackers attacked an American water district's industrial control systems. After two months of inexplicable valve and duct movement and millions of data records were stolen, the operators undertook a forensic investigation. Verizon Security Services reported that the hackers ""managed to manipulate the system to alter the amount of chemicals that went into the water supply."" The utility had a single, antiquated computer system, and hadn't adequately protected the administrator login credentials. No one was harmed, but we won't always be so lucky.  Fortunately, there are many steps that both the private and public sectors can take to reduce their dependence on sheer luck. Many water utilities still need to adopt ""defense in depth"" approaches that create multiple layers of security, instead of relying on passive defenses like antivirus software, email filters and firewalls. The post-air-gap environment requires constant scanning for anomalous network activity as well as rigorous patch management and security upgrades. Utilities need to segregate their consumer and industrial control networks as much as possible and develop contingency plans for operating water systems without computers. Device manufacturers also have a critical role to play by producing more secure hardware for monitoring and managing things like water pressure, leakage and chemical levels. Many industrial internet-connected devices are built much like their consumer counterparts, like web-connected toasters and wearable health monitors. As a result, they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a wide range of hackers, from hostile governments to sophisticated criminals. Devices often are too small to include the necessary security hardware, lack the computing power to host security software or can't be updated when flaws are discovered. Utilities also need more practical cybersecurity guidance from federal agencies, warnings that go beyond the typical bulletin identifying the kind of attack and its source. Depending on the threat, that guidance might be hardware instructions -- like closing unused ports or using single-direction gateways that don't allow information to flow inward. Or it might point to organized phishing attacks and recommend specific filters for emails and attachments. The more utilities know about threats, the better their chances of defending themselves. Finally, utilities also need to trust the government channels available to them to report attacks. Robust cybersecurity depends on real-time updates about threats and tactics. So if one utility reports an attempted hack of a particular part of its system, utilities everywhere would know to how to fortify that portion of their network. In 2015, Congress gave companies legal protection to share sensitive customer data with the government when it relates to cyberthreats; only six companies have done so.  But there is reason for optimism that this number will grow. The F.B.I. has an online portal for this purpose under the InfraGard program; the Department of Homeland Security recently formed the National Risk Management Center to coordinate private- and public-sector defense of infrastructure.  The concept of damaging a society by attacking its water supply is as old as warfare itself. In the sixth century B.C., Assyrianspoisoned enemy wells with fungal disease. In 1939, Nazi Germany plotted to blow up the Hoover Dam. More recently, the Islamic State prioritized seizing dams as it expanded its territorial control. These days, the threat is more pernicious than ever: Destruction and disruption that once required explosives can be achieved with keystrokes. This threat of an attack that cascades across regions and sectors of the economy significantly changes the stakes for government officials and businesses alike, and it demands dedicated action.

Dodging Fake Fraud Alerts,"Q. Do scammers send unsolicited text messages about credit card fraud? How do I know what is real? A. Scammers will try just about anything to steal your money or your identity, so bogus credit card fraud alerts are certainly possible.   Many credit card companies have a warning system in place to automatically notify you of suspicious activity on your account, and will contact you by the method specified in your account settings -- usually by text message, telephone call or email. If you get a text message or email alert about fraud out of the blue and want to confirm its authenticity, call the customer-service number on the back of your card and ask to speak to a representative. If you prefer an online approach, log into your account on the company's website (or mobile app) over a secure network connection and check for notifications about suspicious account activity. To be on the safe side, do not call the number or open any links that may have been included with the message, even though some can be legitimate. Many financial institutions have sophisticated and automated fraud-detection algorithms that can quickly detect signs of unusual activity on your account -- often before you are aware of it. Your purchasing history, geographic location of the charge, merchant choice and spending amounts are some factors typically used in fraud-detection systems. If you want to see what other account protections are available from your bank or credit-card company, browse its website and look for its safety and security section. American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa all offer alerts and other security tools, as do many banks that issue cards, like Chase and HSBC. Fraud happens year round, but because the Internal Revenue Service is on many people's minds this month, also be on guard for tax-related scams. The IRS.gov site has information on the latest ruses and how to report them. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Russia Attacks America's Election System. Trump Shrugs.,"With fewer than 100 days to go until the midterms, the evidence continues to pile up that America's electoral system remains a hot target for hackers, most notably agents of the Russian government.  Last Thursday, Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat up for re-election this year, confirmed that she was one of two or possibly three congressional candidates whose computer networks had been unsuccessfully targeted by the Russians last year. The phishing attack, which occurred last August, was thwarted by Microsoft, which subsequently alerted her to the attempt. ""While this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this,"" said Ms. McCaskill in a statement.  Three days later, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat,acknowledged that, in an unrelated episode, her office also had been a target of multiple spear-phishing attacks, the origins of which have yet to be officially determined. The effort bears similarities to Russia's handiwork, but the matter is still under investigation. Ms. Shaheen said she had been told that this problem ""is widespread, with political parties across the country, as well as with members of the Senate."" (Ms. Shaheen, a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, also received a phone call in November from someone impersonating a Latvian official and hoping to gain inside information on American sanctions against Russia. The F.B.I. is looking into that episode as well.) Attempts to disrupt America's government and electoral system are widespread and multifaceted. This week, in fact, Facebook announced that it had identified and removed dozens of pages and accounts linked to a coordinated effort aimed at influencing the November elections.  But it's no mystery why Russia and other bad actors would assume they could get away with such incursions. Despite repeated warnings from United States intelligence agencies regarding the nation's vulnerabilities, there remains no focused, coordinated plan by the White House for dealing with this crucial security issue. Nor does President Trump seem comfortable criticizing, much less holding accountable, the baddest of bad actors identified by American intelligence agencies -- Mr. Putin. Quite the opposite: When it comes to cyberattacks on American democracy, the message coming from this president reeks of confusion, equivocation and weakness.  After the humiliating Trump-Putin cuddlefest in Helsinki, Finland, one might have expected Mr. Trump to clarify America's displeasure regarding Moscow's meddling. Instead, the president continues to dither and blow smoke. One minute he's insisting that he supports the findings of American intelligence, the next he's tweeting that the notion of Russian meddling is ""all a big hoax.""  No matter how many members of his own team warn that the Russian president is not to be trusted, Mr. Trump simply can't quit Mr. Putin. First he invited him for a White House visit this fall. A few days later, after receiving no response from Mr. Putin -- who is the much cooler character in this relationship -- Mr. Trump decided to postpone the visit until, as his national security adviser, John Bolton, so trenchantly put it, ""after the Russia witch hunt."" When Mr. Putin then floated the possibility of Mr. Trump calling on him in Moscow, it took Mr. Trump just a few hours to proclaim himself ""open"" to the idea -- assuming he receives a proper invitation, of course. More broadly, Mr. Trump cannot seem to muster much interest in making cybersecurity a priority. The White House made a big to-do last week about the president convening the first-ever meeting of his National Security Council specifically dedicated to election security. Afterward, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, trumpeted that Mr. Trump had ""made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation-state or other malicious actors.""  But ""made it clear"" is a matter of opinion. The high-level, closed-door meeting clocked in at well under an hour and, according to officials, was not a strategy session but rather a basic review of measures already adopted by various agencies absent direction from the White House. No coordinated plan was discussed, nor were any new steps for countering or deterring future attacks.  For all of Mr. Trump's tough-guy bluster, his message to Mr. Putin -- and whoever else might be interested in hijacking America's electoral system -- continues to be: Eh, whatever.  Fortunately, plenty of administration officials are less sanguine, with various agencies working to shore up the system; the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security have formed task forces to that end. And up on Capitol Hill, senators are pushing bipartisan bills aimed at tackling this problem from multiple angles. (Legislation being championed by James Lankford, a Republican, and Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, received a mini-lift when Mr. Trump's performance in Helsinki nudged a few more members, including two Republicans and an independent, into signing on as co-sponsors.) But without the clear backing of the president, it will be tough to rally enough Republican support to drag any of these measures over the finish line.  At the very least, Mr. Trump could stop being so squishy about Russia. Mr. Putin is a coldly calculating politician. If he draws the lesson that his country's bad behavior will go largely unpunished -- and thus far, why wouldn't he? -- what's to stop him from pushing the envelope even further next time? At this point, pretty much everyone in Washington aside from Mr. Trump -- and a smattering of his congressional toadies -- acknowledges the threat Russia poses. Post-Helsinki, even Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security and one of the president's most reliable water carriers, felt compelled to note that ""Russia was absolutely attempting to interfere in our election systems"" in 2016 and that it would be ""foolish"" to assume it wouldn't try again. ""They have capability. They have the will. We've got to be prepared,"" she said. Likewise, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, asserted that Moscow's efforts to infiltrate our electoral system ""are persistent, they are pervasive and they are meant to undermine America's democracy."" The biggest hurdle to combating this threat seems to be America's president. PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Rebekka Dunlap FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) "
Chinese Hackers Steal Naval Warfare Information,"WASHINGTON -- China has stolen sensitive data related to naval warfare from the computers of a Navy contractor, American officials said on Friday, in another step in the long-running cyberwar between two global adversaries. The breach occurred this year, the officials said, when Chinese government hackers infiltrated the computers of a company working on a Navy submarine and underwater programs contract. The company, which was not identified, was doing work for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which is based in Newport, R.I.    Officials said that the data gleaned by China was unclassified.    Navy officials declined to speak publicly about the hack, which was first reported by The Washington Post.   But in a statement, Lt. Marycate Walsh, a Navy spokeswoman, cited ''measures in place that require companies to notify the government when a cyberincident has occurred that has actual or potential adverse effects on their networks that contain controlled unclassified information.''   She said it would be ''inappropriate to discuss further details at this time.''   China and the United States have been locked in an escalating fight over cyber and military technology, with Beijing making rapid gains in recent years. American officials -- from both the Trump administration and the Obama administration before it -- concede that Washington has struggled to deter Chinese hacking, and have predicted the cyberattacks will increase until the United States finds a way to curb them.   The theft of the Navy system is hardly the largest, or the most sensitive, of the designs and systems stolen by Chinese hackers over the years. But it underscores a lesson the American government keeps learning: No matter how fast the government moves to shore up it cyberdefenses, and those of the defense industrial base, the cyberattackers move faster.   The plans for the F-35, the nation's most expensive fighter jet in history, were taken more than a decade ago, and the Chinese model looks like an almost exact replica of its American inspiration.   A People's Liberation Army unit, known as Unit 61398, was filled with skilled hackers who purloined corporate trade secrets to benefit Chinese state-owned industry. But many of its targets were defense related as well. Members of the unit were indicted in the last two years of the Obama administration, but none are likely to come back to the United States to stand trial.   The most sophisticated hack of American data took place at the Office of Personnel Management. It lost the files of about 21.5 million Americans who had filed extensive questionnaires for their security clearances. The forms listed far more than Social Security numbers and birth dates. They detailed medical and financial histories; past relationships; and details about children, parents and friends, particularly non-United States citizens.   The office stored much of the data at the Interior Department and encrypted nearly none of it. So when the Chinese copied it in a highly sophisticated operation, they were prepared to use big data techniques to draw a map of the American elite, who worked on which projects and who knew whom. The loss was so severe that many American intelligence agencies canceled the deployment of new officers to China.   But the United States is unlikely to retaliate. To most intelligence officials this is just another espionage case, bearing similarities to what the United States does around the world.   Lieutenant Walsh said that the Navy treated ''the broader intrusion against our contractors very seriously.''   ''If such an intrusion were to occur, the appropriate parties would be looking at the specific incident, taking measures to protect current info, and mitigating the impacts that might result from any information that might have been compromised,'' she said.   The United States and China are wrangling over trade issues but also jointly looking to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions. President Trump is headed to Singapore this weekend for a June 12 summit meeting with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.   The United States and China are also tangling over Beijing's militarization of disputed islands in the South China Sea.   Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis harshly criticized the Chinese government for continuing to militarize a string of islands in the South China Sea, calling the presence of advanced military equipment and missiles there a flagrant show of military power.   To add muscle to American complaints, Mr. Mattis recently disinvited the Chinese military from a large, multinational naval exercise this summer -- in part because of the anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, and other weapons, that China has positioned on the Spratly Islands.   A United States official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to be identified in discussing the issue, said the Navy was investigating the breach with the help of the F.B.I.

Cyberattack Disrupts Printing of Major Newspapers,"The Los Angeles Times says an unusual cyberattack that disrupted its printing operations and those at newspapers in San Diego and Florida over the weekend came from outside the United States, but it stopped short of accusing a specific foreign government. Computer malware attacks on infrastructure, while relatively rare, are hardly new: Russia has been credibly accused of shutting down power grids in Ukraine and a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia, Iran crippled a casino in Las Vegas, and the United States and Israel attacked a nuclear enrichment plant in Iran. But this would be the first known attack on major newspaper printing operations, and if politically motivated, it would define new territory in recent attacks on the media.  The malware was focused on the networks used by Tribune Publishing, which until recently owned The Los Angeles Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune. The two papers still share their former parent company's printing networks. The Los Angeles Times said the attack also affected the Saturday distribution of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, which share use of a large printing plant in Los Angeles for their West Coast editions. Both appear to have been collateral damage; there was no evidence that they were hit by the same malware aimed at the Tribune company. The online editions of the news organizations were not affected, and Tribune Publishing said no data about its subscribers was compromised. ""Every market across the company was impacted,"" Marisa Kollias, a spokeswoman for Tribune Publishing, told The Los Angeles Times. The Tribune's remaining publications include its flagship, The Chicago Tribune, and newspapers in Florida, Hartford and Maryland. It also owns The Daily News in New York. Missing from Tribune's statements were any details about the nature of the malware or evidence for its assertion that the attack originated overseas. Anonymous sources cited by The Los Angeles Times suggested that the malware may have been a form of ransomware -- a pernicious attack that scrambles computer programs and files before demanding that the victim pay a ransom to unscramble them. Even if the attack was the work of foreign hackers, that does not necessarily mean it was backed by a government. Ransomware attacks are frequently the work of criminal groups, with three notable exceptions: a huge attack by hackers in North Korea in 2017, an attack months later against Ukraine by Russian hackers and, more recently, attacks against American hospitals and even the City of Atlanta by hackers in Iran. Those latest attacks were believed to be the work of individuals and not directed by Tehran. Neither Tribune Publishing nor The Los Angeles Times said the attack was linked to a ransom demand. But a news article in The Los Angeles Times, and one outside computer expert, said the attack shared characteristics with a form of ransomware called Ryuk, which was used to target a North Carolina water utility in October and other critical infrastructure. Some experts have linked that malware to a sophisticated North Korean group, but CrowdStrike, a security firm that has been tracking the group behind Ryuk, said it believed cybercriminals in Eastern Europe were responsible. Adam Meyers, the head of threat intelligence at CrowdStrike, said cybercriminals appeared to have been infecting victims with Ryuk through a criminal tool called Trickbot. The tool was used in banking attacks and, more recently, attacks on major businesses and infrastructure in the United States, Canada and Britain. Sophos, another security vendor, said Ryuk's creators were selective about whom they targeted. They deploy the ransomware against victims that can pay large, often six-figure ransoms, particularly in the commodities, manufacturing and health care industries, Sophos said. Whoever is behind the ransomware, the attacks appear to have paid off. This month, the group, which goes by the name Grim Spider, received a ransom payment of nearly 100 Bitcoin, the equivalent of more than $380,000. It apparently took Tribune a while to understand the nature of the attack. The problem first appeared to be a malfunctioning computer server. The first evidence of the attack emerged Thursday night, The Los Angeles Times reported, and by Friday it appeared to have been contained. But it came back -- a frequent occurrence with sophisticated attacks -- and began to spread through the systems that govern the interface between the news content systems and the systems that control the printing of the newspapers. By late Friday, The Los Angeles Times said, ""the attack was hindering the transmission of pages from offices across Southern California to printing presses."" Among the hardest hit was the San Diego paper, whose production teams could not transmit the files that enable the making of page plates for the printing presses. As a result, delays cascaded across the printing schedules for other newspapers. The South Florida Sun Sentinel was also hit, the newspaper reported on its website. It said distribution of The New York Times and The Palm Beach Post had also been affected, because they share the same presses. On Sunday, Hillary Manning, vice president for communications at The Los Angeles Times, said, ""The presses ran on schedule, and papers were being delivered as usual today."" She added, ""The systems outage caused by a virus or malware has not been completely resolved yet."" About 20,000 copies of The New York Times from the Los Angeles plant were delivered a day late, a spokeswoman for the paper, Eileen Murphy, said. Colleen Schwartz, a spokeswoman for The Wall Street Journal, said she could confirm that The Journal ""was impacted in certain regions,"" though she did not have any details on which areas or the number of copies affected. Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.  PHOTO: The Los Angeles Times, whose printing operations were disrupted, said the cyberattack had come from outside the United States.

"To Hackers, We're Bambi In the Woods","If you're worried about terrorism, here's a bigger threat to lose sleep over: an all-out cyberattack. Suddenly, the electricity goes out at the office. Cellphone networks and the internet have also gone black, along with subways and trains.     The roads are jammed because traffic lights aren't working. Credit cards are now just worthless bits of plastic, and A.T.M.s are nothing but hunks of metal. Gas stations can't pump gas.    Banks have lost records of depositors' accounts. Dam floodgates mysteriously open. Water and sewage treatment plants stop working.   People can't reach loved ones. Phone systems are down, so 911 is useless. Looters roam the streets. Food and water soon run out in the cities.    And that's just the first week.   Security experts have nightmares like that. Countries like Russia and China have implanted malicious software in the American electrical grid, nuclear power plants and water systems to have the capacity to mount such attacks -- and we have done the same to them. Indeed, the U.S. prepared an extensive plan, Nitro Zeus, to unplug Iran through cyberattacks, but in the end we never implemented it.   These are some of the issues explored in an important -- and deeply sobering -- new book about cyberwarfare, ''The Perfect Weapon,'' by my Times colleague David Sanger. I've known Sanger since we joined our college newspaper together at the beginning of freshman year, and he has spent the decades since exploring the intersections of technology and international security -- and trying to alert us to our vulnerabilities.   The risks aren't just of a cyber-Pearl Harbor but also of a full spectrum of attacks. The Russian hack of Democratic emails should have been a wake-up call. A senior F.B.I. official told Sanger: ''These D.N.C. guys were like Bambi walking in the woods, surrounded by hunters. They had zero chance of surviving an attack. Zero.''   Even after the attacks we didn't learn, and much of the U.S. is still like Bambi. The Russian hack of the U.S. elections in 2016 should have us on our toes for 2018, but the Trump administration has done little to prepare to fight off new hacking.   Sanger describes a Russian cyberattack on the Ukrainian electrical grid shortly before Christmas 2015. Operators of the grid were bewildered: Nothing they clicked on their computers had any effect, and cursors dashed across their screens to disconnect circuits and delete backup systems. Finally, the hackers disconnected the backup electrical system, so that the operators in the control room were literally in the dark.   Hackers are increasingly brazen. When Russian hackers infiltrated State Department and White House computer systems in 2014, National Security Agency specialists tried to uproot them -- and the hackers fought back. ''It was basically hand-to-hand combat in a network,'' Rick Ledgett, a senior N.S.A. official, told Sanger.   Cyber is the ''perfect weapon,'' in Sanger's formulation, because attackers typically get off scot-free.   If North Korea had responded to the Sony Pictures movie ''The Interview'' by blowing up cinemas, it might have faced a strong response. Instead, it hacked into Sony's system, destroyed computers and paralyzed the company. In both the Sony and Democratic Party attacks, the hackers enlisted the American news media to magnify the damage; we in the media were used, and we should reflect on that.   Later, North Korean hackers pilfered $81 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank (they might have gotten away with almost $1 billion, but someone misspelled ''foundation''). For all this, North Korea faced no significant punishment.   Sanger writes that American officials debated whether to punish Vladimir Putin for his hacks by exposing his links to oligarchs, or even by making some of his money disappear. But Barack Obama balked, fearful of what Putin might do next, and Donald Trump has also dithered.   Gen. Paul Nakasone, head of the U.S. Cyber Command, was asked in his confirmation hearings this year what our adversaries think will happen if they attack us in cyberspace. ''They do not think much will happen,'' he replied. ''They don't fear us.''   As Sanger writes, ''Deterrence is not working in the cyber realm.'' Why wouldn't Putin interfere in our 2018 midterms since we're both vulnerable and not serious about responding?   We need to establish a cost to cyberattacks and help establish norms for cyber -- a Geneva Convention for hacking. The problem is that the U.S. also uses cyberwarfare (to destroy Iranian centrifuges and, apparently, North Korean missiles), and we don't want to constrain ourselves.   Meanwhile, we are becoming ever more vulnerable, partly because daily life is becoming more dependent on computers, and partly because cyber-offense is far ahead of cyber-defense. The U.S. started with a huge advantage, but Russia and China have nearly caught up, and Iran and North Korea don't seem far behind.   In the 1990s, we were too complacent about the risks of terrorism; it took the twin towers collapsing to galvanize us. In the world of cyberspace, we're still too complacent: Let's stop playing Bambi!   I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

What You Need to Do Because of Flaws in Computer Chips,"On Wednesday, a group of security experts revealed two security flaws that affect nearly all microprocessors, the digital brains of the world's computers. These flaws, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to lift passwords, photos, documents and other data from smartphones, PCs and the cloud computing services that many businesses rely on. Some of the world's largest tech companies have been working on fixes for these problems. But the researchers who discovered the flaws said one of them, Spectre, is not completely fixable. ""It is a fundamental flaw in the way processors have been built over the last decades,"" said Paul Kocher, one of the researchers who discovered these flaws. Here is a guide to what you need to know and what you should do.  Where exactly are these flaws? Both are issues with the way computer chips are designed. Meltdown affects most processors made by Intel, the company that supplies the chips for a majority of PCs and more than 90 percent of computer servers. Spectre is far more difficult for hackers to exploit. But it is even more pervasive, affecting Intel chips, microprocessors from the longtime Intel rival AMD and the many chips that use designs from the British company ARM. Your smartphone most likely contains an ARM chip. Why are they such a problem? Both flaws provide hackers with a way of stealing data, including passwords and other sensitive information. If hackers manage to get software running on one of these chips, they can grab data from other software running on the same machine. This is a particular issue on cloud computing services. Why are cloud computing services so important? Operated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, these are services where any business or individual can rent access to computing power over the internet. On a cloud service, each server is typically shared by many different customers. By exploiting the Meltdown flaw, a hacker can just load some software onto a cloud service and then grab data from anyone else who has loaded software onto the same server. What about phones and PCs? Phones and PCs are more difficult targets. Before they can exploit the chip flaws, hackers must find a way of getting their software onto your device. They could fool you into downloading an app from a smartphone app store. Or they could trick you into visiting a website that moves code onto your machine. But companies are fixing these flaws? They are trying. Meltdown can be fixed by installing a software ""patch"" on the machine. Microsoft has released a patch for PCs that use its Windows operating system. Apple said it had released software patches for iOS, Macs and the Apple TV that help mitigate the issue. Intel is also working on updates to help fix the problem. The onus is now on consumers and businesses to install the fix on their machines. What should I do as a consumer? Keep your software up-to-date. That includes your operating system and apps like your web browser and antivirus software. Microsoft, Mozilla and Google have already released patches for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome to help address the problem. Installing an ad blocker on your web browser is also a safeguard, according to security experts. Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites -- sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks. A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin. ""The real problem is ads are dangerous,"" said Jeremiah Grossman, the head of security strategy for SentinelOne, a computer security company. ""They're fully functioning programs, and they carry malware."" How do I update my software? Your operating system and apps typically have a button you can click to check for software updates. For example, in Google's Chrome browser on a computer, you can click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and click Update Google Chrome. To update Windows, click the Start button and click through these buttons: Settings, Update &amp; security, Windows Update and Check for updates. To update the Mac system, open the App Store app and check the Updates tab for the latest software. Don't procrastinate. Last year, a piece of malware called WannaCry infected hundreds of thousands of Windows machines worldwide. Microsoft had released an update before the attack, but many machines were behind on downloading the latest security updates. What about the cloud services? Amazon, Google and Microsoft said that they had already patched most of the of servers that underpin their cloud computing services, and that largely addresses the problem. But Amazon and Google also said customers might need to make additional changes. To share computing power with customers, cloud services offer ""virtual machines."" These are computers that exist only in digital form. Customers use these virtual machines to run their own software. After Amazon, Google and Microsoft update their machines, customers may have to update the operating systems running on their own virtual machines to guard against some exploits. If everybody updates his or her software, all is good? No. The researchers who discovered Meltdown said that patching systems would slow them down by as much as 30 percent in certain situations. That could be a problem for big cloud systems. Independent software developers also ran tests on a patched version of Linux, the open-source operating system that now drives more than 30 percent of the world's servers, and saw similar slowdowns. ""There are many cases where the performance impact is zero,"" said Andres Frome, a software developer who has tested the new code. ""But if you are running something like a payment system, where a lot of small changes are made to data, it looks like there will be a significant performance impact."" Consumers are less likely to be affected, and Mr. Kocher said slowdowns could dissipate over time as companies refined their patches. What about the Spectre flaw? According to the researchers who discovered these flaws, including security experts at Google, the memory chip maker Rambus and various academic institutions, Spectre can't be completely fixed. But patches can solve the problems in some situations. Intel and Microsoft and others said the same. Spectre can't be fixed? No, according to the researchers. But Spectre is much more difficult than Meltdown for hackers to exploit. Similar to Meltdown, Spectre can steal information from one application and share it with another. For example, an app you download from the web could steal information like passwords from other software on a computer. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert that said the only solution to the threats posed by Meltdown and Spectre would be a full replacement of the chips. But that does not seem feasible, given how many machines are involved. ""Spectre is going to be with us a lot longer,"" Mr. Kocher said. An Intel vice president, Donald Parker, is adamant that the company's chips will not need to be replaced. He said that with software patches and ""firmware updates"" -- a way of updating code on the chip itself -- Intel and other companies could ""mitigate the issues."" Follow Cade Metz and Brian X.

"Israeli Software Helped Saudis Spy on Khashoggi, Lawsuit Says","LONDON -- A Saudi dissident close to the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has filed a lawsuit charging that an Israeli software company helped the royal court take over his smartphone and spy on his communications with Mr. Khashoggi. The lawsuit puts new pressure on the company, the NSO Group, and on the government of Israel, which licenses the company's sales to foreign governments of its spyware, known as Pegasus. More broadly, the suit also calls new attention to Israel's increasingly open alliance with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies. Saudi Arabia and its allies like the United Arab Emirates have never recognized the Jewish state but have quietly found common cause with it in opposition to Iran. Since the Arab Spring uprisings, Israel and those monarchies also appear to have found an alignment of interest in defending the established Arab order. The lawsuit, filed in Israel by the Montreal-based Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, follows parallel suits by journalists, activists and others charging that the NSO Group improperly helped the governments of Mexico and the United Arab Emirates spy on their smartphones even though the individuals had no criminal records and posed no threat of violence.  The human rights group Amnesty International has also recently accused the NSO Group of helping Saudi Arabia spy on a member of the organization's staff. Amnesty said last week that it was considering legal action after the Israeli defense ministry rejected a request to revoke NSO Group's license to export its spyware. ""By continuing to approve of NSO Group, the Ministry of Defense is practically admitting to knowingly cooperating with NSO Group as their software is used to commit human rights abuses,"" said Molly Malekar, the programs director of Amnesty International's Israeli office. In a statement on Sunday, the NSO Group said its products were ""licensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime."" Contracts for use of its software ""are only provided after a full vetting and licensing by the Israeli government,"" the company said, adding: ""We do not tolerate misuse of our products. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract."" The spyware allows its customers to secretly listen to calls, record keystrokes, read messages, and track internet history on a targeted phone. It also enables customers to use a phone's microphone and camera as surveillance devices. Because of those sweepingly invasive capabilities, Israel classifies the spyware as a weapon. The company must obtain approval from the Defense Ministry for its sale to foreign governments. Saudi Arabia paid $55 million last year for its use, according to Israeli news reports. Mr. Abdulaziz, the plaintiff of the new lawsuit, is a 27-year-old Saudi who sought asylum in Canada and lives in Montreal. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings, he had become popular among Saudis for online videos and social media commentary criticizing the rulers of the kingdom for their authoritarianism. The consulting firmMcKinsey &amp; Company identified him as an influential driver of dissent on social media. Over the last two months, he has also gained international attention because of his friendship and collaboration with Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi exile living in Virginia who wrote columns for The Washington Post. Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered in October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. American intelligence agencies and many Western officials have concluded that Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, authorized the assassination. He has denied authorizing the killing, and Saudi officials have said that a team of agents sent to retrieve Mr. Khashoggi decided on their own to kill him instead. The lawsuit claims that in the months before the killing, the royal court had access to Mr. Khashoggi's communications about opposition projects with Mr. Abdulaziz because of the spyware on Mr. Abdulaziz's phone. Mr. Abdulaziz has said he was also targeted by some of the operatives close to Prince Mohammed who have been linked to the Khashoggi killing as part of a campaign to bring home or silence Saudi dissidents abroad. After pestering him for months with messages urging him to return to the kingdom, two Saudi emissaries met him in Montreal last May to pressure him in person. Mr. Abdulaziz covertly recorded the conversations. ""There are two scenarios,"" one of the agents told him, referring to him in the third person as Omar. In the first option, ""Omar is a beneficiary or a winner, because he is going back home,"" an emissary told him. ""The second side, the state, is a winner and is happy as well,"" the emissary added, suggesting that the kingdom might pay also Mr. Abdulaziz large sums of money. If he declined, however, ""Omar is a loser because he is going to jail,"" the emissary said, and he said Mr. Abdulaziz might be apprehended at an airport. The Saudi emissaries said falsely that Mr. Khashoggi was also considering returning to the kingdom. The emissaries said they had been sent by Saud al-Qahtani, a close adviser to the crown prince who has been the target of United States sanctions for his alleged role in the Khashoggi killing. A statement announcing the sanctions also identified him as the supervisor of the intelligence agent who led that operation. But the emissaries made clear that their orders had ultimately come from the crown prince. They promised Mr. Abdulaziz that the day after he landed in Saudi Arabia he would meet with Prince Mohammed and could ask him for anything. They said they had already booked a hotel room for Mr. Abdulaziz in Jeddah. Mr. Abdulaziz declined to return to the kingdom and also refused a request to visit the Saudi embassy in Ottawa for further discussions. That request began to look more ominous after Mr. Khashoggi's death in the Istanbul consulate, Mr. Abdulaziz has said. The next month, in June, he received a text message that looked like a link to track the shipment of a package but turned out to mask a link to the NSO Group's spyware, according to court papers filed with the lawsuit. In August, a research group at the University of Toronto that studies online surveillance notified Mr. Abdulaziz that his phone might have been hacked. The research group, Citizen Lab, later concluded that the Saudi government was behind it. Around the same time as the arrival of the fake text message, Saudi security forces carried out a raid with search dogs in the middle of the night at the home of Mr. Abdulaziz's family in Jeddah. Two of his brothers were arrested and remain in prison without charges, according to the court papers. Mr. Abdulaziz ""has also learned that the security personnel in the detention center are using torture against them and are subjecting them to inhumane and humiliating treatment, all in order to put pressure on the plaintiff to force him to stop his activism,"" the court papers state. It was also during the period after the spying began that Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi stepped up their plans for various social media campaigns to counter Saudi government propaganda. Mr. Khashoggi sent Mr. Abdulaziz $5,000 to subsidize that effort. The lawsuit was filed by an Israeli lawyer, Alaa Mahajna, in cooperation with Mazen Masri, a lecturer at the City University of London. The lawyers say in the court papers that they intend to argue that the resulting exposure of the collaboration between Mr. Abdulaziz and Mr. Khashoggi ""contributed in a significant manner to the decision to murder Mr. Khashoggi.""

"In Hacked Cables, E.U. Frets Over Russia, China and Trump","WASHINGTON -- Hackers infiltrated the European Union's diplomatic communications network for years, downloading thousands of cables that reveal concerns about an unpredictable Trump administration and struggles to deal with Russia and China and the risk that Iran would revive its nuclear program. In one cable, European diplomats described a meeting between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland, as ''successful (at least for Putin).''    Another cable, written after a July 16 meeting, relayed a detailed report and analysis of a discussion between European officials and President Xi Jinping of China, who was quoted comparing Mr. Trump's ''bullying'' of Beijing to a ''no-rules freestyle boxing match.''   The techniques that the hackers deployed over a three-year period resembled those long used by an elite unit of China's People's Liberation Army. The cables were copied from the secure network and posted to an open internet site that the hackers set up in the course of their attack, according to Area 1, the firm that discovered the breach.    Area 1 made more than 1,100 of the hacked European Union cables available to The New York Times. The White House National Security Council did not have an immediate comment on Tuesday.   [Read a selection of the cables here.]   The compromised material provides insight into Europe's struggle to understand the political turmoil engulfing three continents. It includes memorandums of conversations with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Israel and other countries that were shared across the European Union.   But it also revealed the huge appetite by hackers to sweep up even the most obscure details of international negotiations.   The cyberintruders also infiltrated the networks of the United Nations, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and ministries of foreign affairs and finance worldwide. The hack of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. focused on issues surrounding the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that excluded Beijing.   Part of the United Nations material focuses on months in 2016, when North Korea was actively launching missiles, and appears to include references to private meetings of the world body's secretary-general and his deputies with Asian leaders.    Some of the more than 100 organizations and institutions were targeted years ago. But many were not aware of the breach until a few days ago, when some were alerted by Area 1, a firm founded by three former officials of the National Security Agency.   The cables include extensive reports by European diplomats of Russia's moves to undermine Ukraine, including a warning on Feb. 8 that Crimea, which Moscow annexed four years ago, had been turned into a ''hot zone where nuclear warheads might have already been deployed.'' American officials say they have not seen evidence of nuclear warheads in Crimea.   The European diplomats' account of their private meeting in July with Mr. Xi quoted the Chinese president vowing that his country ''would not submit to bullying'' from the United States, ''even if a trade war hurt everybody.''   ''China was not a backward country anymore,'' the European note taker described Mr. Xi as saying.   In their conversations with American officials after the Helsinki meeting in July, European diplomats described efforts by the White House to engage in damage control after Mr. Trump had gone off-script during a joint news conference with Mr. Putin.   Mr.  Trump appeared to agree to allow Russians to question former American diplomats in exchange for the American interrogation of Russians who had been indicted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. According to a July 20 document describing their private exchanges, White House officials assured the Europeans that Mr. Trump's agreement would be ''nipped down'' to prevent the questioning of Americans.   A March 7 cable summarized the difficulties in relations between the United States and the European Union that had developed during the Trump administration. In it, a senior European official in Washington spoke of ''messaging efforts'' to deal ''with the negative attitude to the E.U. in the beginning, which had created a lot of insecurity.''   The official, Caroline Vicini, deputy head of the European Union mission in Washington, recommended that diplomats from the 28 member nations describe the United States as ''our most important partner'' even as it stood up to Mr. Trump ''in areas where we disagreed with the U.S. (e.g., on climate, trade, Iran nuclear deal).''   The cable also recommended working around Mr. Trump by dealing directly with Congress, and urged European diplomats in Washington to emphasize member state interest when pushing on a host of issues, including trade, renewable energy and Brexit.   In a statement on Tuesday night, the European Union's secretariat issued a statement saying it ''is aware of allegations regarding a potential leak of sensitive information and is actively investigating the issue.''   But it seemed to avoid the issues raised by the disclosure, saying it ''does not comment on allegations nor on matters relating to operational security.''   The trove of European cables is reminiscent of the WikiLeaks publication of 250,000 State Department cables in 2010. But they are not as extensive and consist of low-level classified documents that were labeled limited and restricted.   The more secretive communications -- including a level known as ''tres secret'' -- were kept on a separate system that is being upgraded and replaced, according to European officials. And cables that focused on decisions about world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran -- from which Mr. Trump withdrew the United States in May -- are walled off from the internet in an entirely different system.   Unlike WikiLeaks in 2010 or the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party leaders in 2016, the cyberattack on the European Union made no effort to publish the stolen material. Instead, it was a matter of pure espionage, said one former senior intelligence official familiar with the issue who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   It also displayed the remarkably poor protection of routine exchanges among European Union officials after years of embarrassing government leaks around the world.   In this case, the cables were exposed after a run-of-the-mill phishing campaign aimed at diplomats in Cyprus pierced the island nation's systems, said Oren Falkowitz, the chief executive of Area 1.   ''People talk about sophisticated hackers, but there was nothing really sophisticated about this,'' Mr. Falkowitz said. After getting into the Cyprus system, the hackers had access to passwords that were needed to connect to the European Union's entire database of exchanges.   Area 1's investigators said they believed the hackers worked for the Strategic Support Force of the People's Liberation Army, part of an organization that emerged from the Chinese signals intelligence agency that was once called 3PLA.   ''After over a decade of experience countering Chinese cyberoperations and extensive technical analysis, there is no doubt this campaign is connected to the Chinese government,'' said Blake Darche, one of the Area 1's experts.   The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls for comment on Tuesday.   After burrowing into the European network, called COREU (or Courtesy), the hackers had the run of communications linking the European Union's 28 countries, on topics ranging from trade and tariffs to terrorism to summaries of summit meetings, from the vital to the insignificant.   Many of the reports were the ordinary business of diplomacy -- weekly reports from missions from places like Kosovo, Serbia, Albania, Russia, China, Ukraine and Washington, and included descriptions of conversations with leaders and other diplomats or visits to non-European countries.   Among the cables were requests for authorization to finance exports to Iran, as well as details of efforts throughout 2018 to continue economic arrangements that might entice Tehran to comply with the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement's terms, even after Mr. Trump abandoned it.   There was also an inquiry about whether to allow Dmitry O. Rogozin, a former Russian deputy foreign minister who had called for the annexation of Crimea, to travel to Austria for an international meeting on ''the peaceful uses of outer space.'' At the time, Mr. Rogozin was under European financial sanctions.   There was much analysis in the cables of foreign policy and of Europe's strategies on issues of trade, counterterrorism, migration and enlargement that could be picked apart by China and other countries looking for an advantage.   Asked on Tuesday about the hack, the National Security Agency said it was still examining the discovery of the European trove. But the former senior intelligence official said that the European Union had been warned, repeatedly, that its aging communications system was highly vulnerable to hacking by China, Russia, Iran and other states.   The official said the warnings were usually received with a shrug.   European officials said they are now trying to overhaul their outdated and vulnerable networks -- an expensive process in which technological improvements usually cannot protect against flawed human judgment. They insisted that confidential, secret and ''tres secret'' material is handled differently than the cables seized by the hackers and noted that a new system, known as EC3IS, is being developed to handle the more sensitive documents that are shared among the diplomats.   For communications in capitals like Moscow and Beijing, yet another network, known as Zeus, is being installed for delegations of member states.   The Europeans appear, belatedly, to be waking up to the threat. Its senior staff members increasingly use encrypted telephones, and isolated ''speech rooms'' of Lucite are being installed in key posts. One such room is already used for a daily 8:30 a.m. meeting of senior staff members, and another is in use in the European Council building in Brussels for intelligence briefings.   ''Of course no security system is foolproof, and they must constantly be upgraded,'' one senior E.U. official said.    "
From Westworld to Best World for the Internet of Things,"Last month the F.B.I. issued an urgent warning: Everyone with home internet routers should reboot them to shed them of malware from ""foreign cyberactors."" Putting aside the strangeness that for once power-cycling a device could perform an effective exorcism upon it, the episode reveals more than just the potential for disruption of internet access for people using equipment they never expect to have to physically manage. It also underscores how unprepared we are to manage downstream-networked devices and appliances -- the ""internet of things"" -- that are vulnerable to attack. A longstanding ethos of internet development lets anyone build and share new code and services, with consequences to be dealt with later. I call this the ""procrastination principle,"" and I don't regret supporting it. But it's hard to feel the same way about the internet of things.  Worries about security for these devices have become widespread, and they fall roughly into two categories. First, compromised networked things can endanger their users. In 2015, Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles after researchers showed they could hack a Jeep and disable its brakes and transmission. Coffee makers and other appliances with heating elements could have safety features overridden, starting a fire. And an alert was issued on certain pacemakers last year after vulnerabilities were found that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and issue commands to the devices. Second, hacking even a tiny subset of the 10 billion and counting networked things can produce threats larger than any one consumer. Individually these devices may be too small to care about; together they become too big to fail. Security systems in a city could be made to sound an alarm simultaneously. Light bulbs can be organized into bot armies, directed to harm any other internet-connected target. And worse than a single Jeep executing an unexpected sharp left turn is a whole fleet of them doing so. Short of rejecting internet integration with appliances, dealing with this is not easy. As with home routers, we tend to keep appliances around for years, so vulnerabilities aren't phased out quickly. In fact, many vendors might stop issuing firmware updates for physical objects even while they're still widely in use -- abandoning the public to problems lurking in embedded code. And otherwise-valuable ""over the air"" security updates could also be a gateway to a hack, especially for small vendors of cheap if useful objects like $5 drones. The unusual problems of the internet of things call for unusual solutions. The first confronts the life-cycle problem. Companies making a critical mass of internet-enabled products should be required to post a ""networked safety bond"" to be cashed in if they abandon maintenance for a product, or fold entirely. Insurers can price bonds according to companies' security practices. There's an example of such a system for coal mining, to provide for reclamation and cleanup should the mining company leave behind a wasteland. For internet-connected appliances, ""reclamation"" can entail work by nonprofit foundations to maintain the code for abandoned products, creating an ""island of misfit toys,"" in the parlance of the famed 1964 Rankin/Bass stop-motion Christmas special. Proceeds from redeemed bonds would go to these foundations to maintain the products, like the way the Mozilla Foundation has transformed the 1998 Netscape browser long after its originators left the scene. A second intervention would require networked products modeled after analog counterparts to work even without connectivity. A smart coffee maker shouldn't be so clever that it can't make coffee without internet access. Switchover to non-connectivity mode will not merely help prevent things from becoming useless when the internet goes down, or if the original vendor disappears or jacks up service prices. It can also provide a soft landing for appliances that reach the end of their supported life cycles while still beloved by owners. Finally, networked devices made by different vendors need to be able to communicate with one another -- the way that, say, Mac and PC users seamlessly exchange email. That prevents a household from becoming locked into a single vendor for all its appliances. It also prevents us from flocking to one or two vendors whose compromise could cause widespread consequences. While procrastination around security has been vital to the expansion of the internet, ""later"" doesn't mean ""never."" We can create incentives to design networked devices for both interoperability and safety, and to plan for remediation when some things inevitably go wrong. We can enjoy the best rather than worst of both worlds.

Filling Out Forms on the Web,"Q. Can I make Microsoft Edge automatically fill in my address on shopping sites? A. Microsoft Edge, the default browser for Windows 10, has an AutoComplete function you can turn on in the program's settings. The AutoComplete tool remembers how you filled in a form on a previous web form and automatically replicates the information as you begin to enter your address again so you do not have to type it all over again.     To turn on Edge's automatic completion feature, open the browser and click or tap the More Actions menu (shown as an icon with three dots) in the top-right corner of the window. When the menu opens, select Settings and then Advanced Settings farther down the screen. On the Advanced Setting screen, flip the button on next to ''Save form entries.'' After you fill out an address form once, the browser should remember it for the next one and offer to finish entering the information for you.   AutoComplete is not quite the same thing as the ''autofill'' function available with some other browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (or, for Mac users, Apple's Safari browser). Instead of offering suggestions to complete web forms, the autofill tool stores address information -- and, in some browsers, credit-card numbers as well -- and then automatically fills in all the form fields with a click or a keystroke. Third-party programs like Fillr's AutoFill for Microsoft Edge, Dashlane and RoboForm can supply an autofill function for Microsoft's browser.   Keep in mind that the personal autofill data stored in a web browser can also be a target for hackers and malicious phishing scripts that can do things like quietly collect the information in web pages with invisible form fields. If you are concerned about online security, you may want to forgo convenience for safety.

What's 'Witch Hunt' in Russian?,"You might expect that an American president, presented with the indictment of a dozen Russian military officers for engaging in a concerted, yearslong cyberattack on American democracy, would be outraged and demand justice. Donald Trump is outraged, all right. But his anger is directed at his fellow Americans. He shows no sign of canceling his meeting scheduled for Monday with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, or insisting on, say, the extradition of the defendants to stand trial. He is instead reserving his fire and fury for the investigation itself -- which he prefers to call a ''hoax'' -- and for the American law-enforcement community that has been working to protect the nation ever since it first became aware of the Russian interference more than two years ago.    That's been Mr. Trump's reaction almost every time he's been confronted with evidence showing that the Russian government undertook a coordinated campaign to help swing the election in his favor. In July 2016, then-candidate Trump wrote on Twitter, ''The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.''    Mr. Trump, who was notified of the coming indictment earlier this week, kept up his mockery before it was announced, calling the special counsel's investigation a ''witch hunt'' on Friday morning.   So who are the witches this time? Twelve Russian military intelligence officials who, according to the indictment, hacked into the computer systems of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee, and state voter rolls and voting software, stealing emails and other documents and then posting them online under false identities, including Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, to hide their Russian origins.   The hackers used familiar techniques, like spearphishing (which tricks unwitting users into sharing personal information) and installing malware to monitor specific computers and steal their data. The hackers transferred those stolen documents to another organization that the indictment does not name. But it appears to be WikiLeaks, which was the source of many of the leaks of Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign, and was in regular contact with Mr. Trump's advisers.   The hackers also infiltrated state-level election systems, including the computer networks of state election boards and of a company that supplies software used to run elections. In one state, they stole half a million voters' personal information, including their names, addresses, birth dates and partial Social Security numbers.   Friday's indictment does not allege that any Americans knowingly broke the law or that the conspiracy changed the outcome of the election. Nor does it allege that the unnamed Americans it referred to were aware that they were corresponding with Russian officials -- a straw that Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, grasped as though his life depended on it. ''The Russians are nailed. No Americans are involved,'' Mr. Giuliani tweeted in a message as predictable as it was premature. A former federal prosecutor himself, Mr. Giuliani is well aware that the details of any specific indictment -- especially one that is part of a complex, long-running investigation -- have little bearing on what future indictments might bring.   In fact, there are already piles of evidence that Mr. Trump and top officials in his campaign were not only aware of the Russian hacking at the time, but were encouraging it. Remember the July 2016 news conference where Mr. Trump asked Russia to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails? ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,'' he said. Another ''joke,'' his defenders claimed at the time. On or about the same day, according to the indictment, the Russians tried to hack into multiple email accounts used by Mrs. Clinton's personal office, as well as dozens more associated with her campaign.   And then there was Donald Trump Jr.'s response to a June 2016 email offering ''dirt'' on Mrs. Clinton from a Russian government official. ''This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump,'' the message said. Donald Jr., who was one of his father's top campaign aides, immediately replied, ''If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.''   Friday's indictment included more than a few hints about the next targets of Mr. Mueller's investigation. For example, in August 2016, a candidate for Congress requested stolen documents from Guccifer 2.0, who sent documents related to that candidate's opponent.   On the same day, Guccifer wrote to a person ''in regular contact with senior members'' of the Trump campaign, apparently Roger Stone, ''thank u for writing back ... do u find anything interesting in the docs I posted?'' A couple of days later, Guccifer wrote, ''please tell me if i can help u anyhow ... it would be a great pleasure to me.''   Don't forget that Mr. Mueller has already secured guilty pleas showing ties between Mr. Trump's campaign and the Russian government, including from one foreign-policy adviser to the campaign who lied to authorities about his communications with a professor who offered damaging information on Mrs. Clinton -- a professor he knew was linked to Russian officials.   Responding to this shouldn't be difficult. Russian officials attacked American democracy in 2016, and the intelligence community has warned us that they're coming back for more. But Mr. Trump seems incapable of perceiving the threat, while Republicans in Congress spend their time fulminating not about the assault on American sovereignty, but about the private text messages of an F.B.I. agent investigating that attack.   As Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein rightly said after announcing the indictment, in the face of such an assault, ''it's important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans.''   Good advice. If only Mr. Trump and his servile defenders in Congress would heed it.

U.S. Charges 9 Iranians In Theft of Secret Data,"WASHINGTON -- Nine Iranians stole secrets from American government agencies, universities and companies in a yearslong cyberattack, federal law enforcement officials said on Friday, calling out Tehran amid fears that the Trump administration will dismantle the Iran nuclear deal. The suspects worked as managers, contractors, associates and hackers for hire at the Mabna Institute, based in Iran, a contractor for the Iranian government working on behalf of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which benefited from the sensitive information obtained in the hacking, the officials said.     The suspects live in Iran and will not be extradited; the United States and Iran have no diplomatic relations. Though they are unlikely to ever be arrested, the Justice Department has used indictments against foreign citizens to signal to outside powers that they have crossed a line, including the indictments against 13 Russians last month accusing them of interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.   Because of the indictments, the Iranians will not be able to travel abroad without risk of arrest, and the Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on them as well as on the Mabna Institute.   ''Hostile individuals, organizations and nation-states have taken note of our success,'' Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference on Friday. ''They increasingly attempt to profit from America's ingenuity by infiltrating our computer systems, stealing our intellectual property and evading our controls on technology exports.''   The hacking case comes at a tenuous time for the fragile relationship between the United States and Iran. The Trump administration is threatening to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, the accord reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers that limited nuclear programs in exchange for sanctions relief.   President Trump has said he wants to impose harsh sanctions on Iran, a move that could compel Iran to leave the agreement.   Security experts worry that if Mr. Trump follows through on his threats to dismantle the agreement -- he announced on Thursday that John R. Bolton, an opponent of the deal, would be his next national security adviser -- American companies will be targeted in an increasing number of cyberattacks from Iran.   ''The nuclear deal imposed a constraint on them, and when the deal goes away, so does their constraint,'' said James A. Lewis, a digital security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.   Targets could include critical infrastructure in the United States, in attacks like those on Saudi petrochemical companies over the past year that experts at Symantec suspect were the work of Iran.   The Iranian government first employed online breaches to combat domestic political opposition and then turned its focus overseas in a series of escalating attacks on private companies in the United States and its allies, according to multiple reports by American intelligence officials and private digital security firms.   Private security researchers and intelligence officials who have tracked Iranian cyberactivity say the country has increasingly relied on proxy forces -- a mix of contractors, volunteers, patriotic hackers and engineers at Iranian universities, and even its religious schools -- to strike at Iran's geopolitical enemies.   ''Relying on these irregulars and contractors gives the state some semblance of deniability,'' Mr. Lewis said.   Over the past five years, Iranian hackers demonstrated increasing sophistication, with a spate of attacks that took down the online banking websites of some dozen United States banks in late 2012. That same year, government officials and private researchers at CrowdStrike tied Iranian hackers to a digital strike at Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil company, which wiped data on some 30,000 Aramco machines, replacing it with an image of a burning American flag.   Less than two years later, Iranian hackers pulled off a similar feat at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, after its owner, Sheldon Adelson, advocated a nuclear strike on Iran. The hackers deployed malware that brought the casino's operations to a halt, wiped data off its machines, replaced websites with a photograph of Mr. Adelson with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and signed their online screeds the ''Anti W.M.D. Team.''   But security experts note that Iranian attacks have dropped off since the signing of the nuclear deal. ''They've been on their best behavior because of the nuclear deal,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''To avoid having the nuclear deal collapse, they have not been willing to risk it.''   But on Friday, the government said that a new group of hackers stole innovative work and intellectual property from the computer systems of 144 American universities, the Labor Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states of Hawaii and Indiana.   They also infiltrated the United Nations, 176 universities in 21 countries around the world, and dozens of domestic and foreign companies, some in banking, health care and the law, the officials said.   In a scheme that continued for more than four years, the Mabna Institute is accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, as well as the contents of employee email accounts. The hackers sent so-called phishing emails to unsuspecting people, who gave them access to their computers after opening those emails.   The scheme ''should send a message around the world about Iran's continued deceptive practices,'' Sigal P. Mandelker, the Treasury Department's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said during the news conference.

The Looming Digital Meltdown,"Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, is a contributing opinion writer and the author of ''Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.'' She is on Twitter (@zeynep). For computer security professionals, 2018 started with a bang. A new class of security vulnerability -- a variety of flaws that affect almost all major microprocessor chips, and that could enable hackers to steal information from personal computers as well as cloud computing services -- was  announced on Wednesday. The news prompted a rush of fixes, ruining the holiday vacations of system administrators worldwide. For an ordinary computer user, there is not much to panic about right now. Just keep your software updated so you receive the fixes. And consider installing an ad-blocker like uBlock Origin to protect against ads that carry malware that could exploit these vulnerabilities. That is about all you can do.     However, as a citizen of a world in which digital technology is increasingly integrated into all objects -- not just phones but also cars, baby monitors and so on -- it is past time to panic.   We have built the digital world too rapidly. It was constructed layer upon layer, and many of the early layers were never meant to guard so many valuable things: our personal correspondence, our finances, the very infrastructure of our lives. Design shortcuts and other techniques for optimization -- in particular, sacrificing security for speed or memory space -- may have made sense when computers played a relatively small role in our lives. But those early layers are now emerging as enormous liabilities. The vulnerabilities announced last week have been around for decades, perhaps lurking unnoticed by anyone or perhaps long exploited.   Almost all modern microprocessors employ tricks to squeeze more performance out of a computer program. A common trick involves having the microprocessor predict what the program is about to do and start doing it before it has been asked to do it -- say, fetching data from memory. In a way, modern microprocessors act like attentive butlers, pouring that second glass of wine before you knew you were going to ask for it.   But what if you weren't going to ask for that wine? What if you were going to switch to port? No problem: The butler just dumps the mistaken glass and gets the port. Yes, some time has been wasted. But in the long run, as long as the overall amount of time gained by anticipating your needs exceeds the time lost, all is well.   Except all is not well. Imagine that you don't want others to know about the details of the wine cellar. It turns out that by watching your butler's movements, other people can infer a lot about the cellar. Information is revealed that would not have been had the butler patiently waited for each of your commands, rather than anticipating them. Almost all modern microprocessors make these butler movements, with their revealing traces, and hackers can take advantage.   There has been a rush to fortify our computing systems, and it may work for the moment. But at best, potential temporary fixes will entail a performance cost, since they involve rolling back strategies for optimizing performance. And since the problem is built into the hardware -- billions of chips that cannot easily be replaced -- fixing this class of problems may also be prohibitively expensive.   At worst, these fixes are too late. The vulnerabilities announced last week were found by three independent teams whose investigations converged on the same flaw at the same time. It is possible that less-responsible actors were also converging on this flaw and may have already succeeded in exploiting it.   Modern computing security is like a flimsy house that needs to be fundamentally rebuilt. In recent years, we have suffered small collapses here and there, and made superficial fixes in response. There has been no real accountability for the companies at fault, even when the failures were a foreseeable result of underinvestment in security or substandard practices rather than an outdated trade-off of performance for security.   There are better ways to make systems more secure. For example, you can build more isolation and separation into our systems, moving security functions to properly audited hardware and away from software (which is always more vulnerable). Things cannot be hacked if they cannot be reached. This may mean that we have to sacrifice some speed for security.   But the truth is that our computers are already quite fast. When they are slow for the end-user, it is often because of ''bloatware'': badly written programs or advertising scripts that wreak havoc as they try to track your activity online. If we were to fix that problem, we would gain speed (and avoid threatening and needless surveillance of our behavior).   As things stand, we suffer through hack after hack, security failure after security failure. If commercial airplanes fell out of the sky regularly, we wouldn't just shrug. We would invest in understanding flight dynamics, hold companies accountable that did not use established safety procedures, and dissect and learn from new incidents that caught us by surprise.   And indeed, with airplanes, we did all that. There is no reason we cannot do the same for safety and security of our digital systems.

U.S. Accuses North Korea of Plot to Hurt Economy as Spy Is Charged in Sony Hack,"WASHINGTON -- North Korea engaged in a yearslong effort to hack into American companies and steal from financial institutions around the globe, the Justice Department charged on Thursday in a 174-page criminal complaint that detailed how hackers caused hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of damage to the global economy. Only one North Korean, Park Jin-hyok, was named -- charged with computer fraud and wire fraud in the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the complaint described a team of hackers for North Korea's main intelligence agency, in many cases operating out of China and other Asian nations, who crippled Britain's health care system in last year's WannaCry attack and stole $81 million from the Bangladeshi central bank -- a heist that would have reaped $1 billion, save for a spelling error -- before turning to vulnerable institutions from Vietnam to South Africa. North Korea seemed primarily motivated by its continuing need for cash, as other countries have refused to do business with Pyongyang, and a desire to control American corporate behavior through fear. WannaCry presented the possibility that the North also wanted to sow chaos.  The complaint was the most specific public accounting yet of North Korea's cyberattacks against other countries. The Justice Department has now brought charges against state actors from North Korea, China, Iran and Russia, the United States' most formidable cyberfoes. [Read the criminal complaint here.] The complaints and indictments have been seen as a key tool in deterring attacks; the Trump administration also imposed sanctions on Mr. Park as part of a broad punishment. But as officials tried to convey that North Korea would pay a high price for hacking American targets, President Trump undercut their effort with a friendly tweet about the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, hours before the complaint was announced. Mr. Trump wrote that Mr. Kim, whom he has sought to engage on nuclear talks, ""proclaims 'unwavering faith in President Trump.' Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!"" It was unclear whether Mr. Trump knew about the forthcoming complaint. A Justice Department official would not directly answer when asked whether he was briefed in advance. The complaint against Mr. Park was filed under seal on June 8, just four days before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim held a historic summit meeting in Singapore. Diplomacy between the two countries has been stalled since, with the president abruptly canceling a trip to North Korea last month by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Last week, Mr. Trump accused China of undermining American relations with the North. The complaint described only one side of the yearslong cyberconflict between North Korea and the United States. It made no mention of the American-led attacks on North Korea's missile program, ordered by President Barack Obama months before the Sony attack. And it omitted the source of some of the weapons in the WannaCry attack, which were leaked or stolen from the National Security Agency, though the United States has not publicly conceded that. Cyberattacks have not been a topic of the recent negotiations with North Korea. But as the complaint makes clear, such weapons have been the North's primary tool against American targets. ""The North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars' worth of damage,"" John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said in a statement. ""These charges will send a message that we will track down malicious actors no matter how or where they hide,"" he added. Mr. Park, who also went by the alias Pak Jin Hek, is unlikely to see the inside of an American courtroom. The United States has no direct, formal relations with North Korea and did not communicate with its reclusive government ahead of the charges. Adding him to the Treasury Department's sanctions list means that no financial institution that does business in the United States can also do business with or provide accounts to Mr. Park or Chosun Expo Joint Venture, the company he worked for that American officials said was a front for the government. He actually appeared to work for North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country's closest equivalent to the C.I.A., intelligence officials said. The sanctions are unlikely to have much effect on Mr. Park and are a less powerful tool than the criminal charges in ensuring that Mr. Park cannot travel far outside North Korea and outing him as a state-sponsored hacker. ""The currency of cyberhackers, whether individuals or nation states, is their anonymity,"" said David Hickton, the former United States attorney in Pittsburgh who oversaw a groundbreaking case against members of the Chinese military accused of cyberattacks. ""Unmasking them has value in and of itself."" In its complaint, the government mapped out a yearslong, brazen scheme to undermine institutions around the world and steal millions of dollars. North Korea broke into the systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014 in retaliation for the company's production of a comedic film, ""The Interview,"" that mocked Mr. Kim and depicted a plot to assassinate him. The attack wiped out 70 percent of the studio's computer capability, erasing all the data on about half of the company's personal computers and more than half of its servers. Sony was left without voice mail, email or production systems, essentially crippling operations. Vast amounts of stolen Sony files were publicly revealed -- emails, contracts, salary lists, film budgets, medical records, digital copies of five movies. Amy Pascal, then the studio's top film executive, lost her job. A month later, the F.B.I. pinned the crime on North Korea and the White House soon imposed sanctions on the country. The crime underscored how vulnerable the United States had become to cybercriminals and how malicious actors far away could cripple American corporations. Hackers from China, Russia and elsewhere would soon infiltrate other high-profile targets including the Office of Personnel Management, the White House email system and the I.R.S. Mr. Park and the other North Korean hackers would go on to engage in cyberattacks around the globe. From 2015 through 2018, they attacked banks to amass funds for North Korea, according to the complaint. They infiltrated Bangladesh Bank in 2016 by sending malware-ridden emails to employees, a practice known as phishing, and eventually gained access to computers connected to the global banking communication system. They directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer money from Bangladesh Bank to accounts in other Asian countries, stealing $81 million. Only because an alert official at the reserve bank noticed that the word ""foundation"" was spelled ""fandation"" did the transaction get additional scrutiny, and it was halted before more than an additional $900 million was transferred, the complaint said. Over the same time, the North unsuccessfully targeted American defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails, in which malicious files or links are sent in a seemingly innocuous message. The complaint gave the most detailed technical accounting yet of how the crippling WannaCry malware made its way around the globe. It also made clear that the malware turned into an unguided missile -- in which the British health care system, which used outdated Microsoft operating systems, turned out to be especially vulnerable. It acknowledged that some of the code, originally from the National Security Agency, was published by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. But the code's American roots went unmentioned in the complaint -- in essence, an extension of the American government's position that the North, rather than the American code makers who lost their weapons, bore complete responsibility for the attack. North Korea operated relatively freely in China, according to the complaint. Chosun Expo Joint Venture helped fund North Korean hacking organizations by doing legitimate programming work from an office in Dalian, China, a coastal city near North Korea. Some customers knew the employees ""were North Korean computer programmers connected to the government,"" the complaint said. Mr. Park, who worked there from 2011 to 2013, and his colleagues were overseen by a company manager and North Korean political attaché[#x301], the Justice Department said. Even though the Justice Department made clear that many North Koreans were involved in the attacks, only Mr. Park was charged because the government apparently believed it had evidence to convict only him beyond a reasonable doubt, said John Carlin, the former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division. The Justice Department said the investigation is continuing. The indictment took years to put together, in part because it covers multiple hacking campaigns and because the government cannot use classified information when it brings a criminal case against a nation-state. ""In order to get admissible evidence,"" Mr. Carlin said, ""prosecutors have to work through any issues the intelligence community might have.""

Student Targeted by 'Troll Storm' Hopes Settlement Will Send Message to White Supremacists,"An African-American student leader who was targeted by a racist ""troll storm"" says she hopes an unusual legal settlement with one of her harassers will send a strong message to white supremacists that they will be held responsible for online abuse. Taylor Dumpson had sued Evan James McCarty of Eugene, Ore., and two other defendants, including the publisher of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, after she was viciously harassed online. As part of the settlement, filed this past week, Mr. McCarty has agreed to apologize, renounce white supremacy, undergo counseling and help civil rights groups fight hate and bigotry.  ""People that decide to participate in this kind of activity, they should know that they're going to be held accountable,"" Ms. Dumpson said Friday. She added that the settlement gave her a sense of closure, and that she was proud that important educational and advocacy work would result from it. She called it a ""unique opportunity"" rooted in the principles of restorative justice, which focuses on rehabilitating offenders through reconciliation with victims. ""I'm using what was a traumatic experience for me to help promote racial justice,"" she said. Ms. Dumpson, now 22, was singled out after she became the first black woman to serve as American University's student body president in May 2017. The same day, bananas hanging from nooses were found around the campus. After news outlets reported on the nooses, Andrew Anglin, who runs The Daily Stormer, posted Ms. Dumpson's picture and personal information online and exhorted his followers to harass and bully her, a tactic he has also employed against Jewish and Muslim targets. One of the people who heeded his call was Mr. McCarty, also now 22, a student and actor who had been leading a secret life online, posting hateful messages and songs under the alias ""Byron De La Vandal,"" a reference to Byron De La Beckwith, the Ku Klux Klan member who assassinated the civil rights leader Medgar Evers. He was identified as Mr. McCarty by an anti-fascist group in April. The lawsuit stated that Ms. Dumpson constantly feared for her safety amid the relentless harassment, and was eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite that turmoil, she graduated from American University and is now enrolled in law school. As part of the settlement, Mr. McCarty agreed to assist Ms. Dumpson in her legal efforts against his two co-defendants, Mr. Anglin and Brian Andrew Ade. Mr. McCarty must also apologize to Ms. Dumpson in writing and on video. She may use his video for ""civil rights advocacy, outreach and educational activities,"" the settlement states. He agreed to undergo anti-hate training and at least a year of counseling, complete four academic courses on race and gender issues and do 200 hours of community service related to racial justice. Ms. Dumpson's legal team will monitor his compliance and can inflict monetary penalties if he does not comply. ""What we are doing here is pulling back the veil on online racist trolls,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which filed the lawsuit on Ms. Dumpson's behalf. ""For too long, they've been allowed to act with impunity,"" she said. The Lawyers' Committee is a nonprofit that was formed in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy, who sought to involve private lawyers in civil rights cases. Ms. Clarke said she hopes the agreement will have ""a chilling effect"" on white supremacists, and called on the Justice Department to do more to prosecute members of hate groups. In a statement, Mr. McCarty's parents, Deb and James McCarty, said they were ""profoundly sorry"" for the harm their son caused to Ms. Dumpson. They said their son ""feels deep regret"" about his actions and that he had ""disengaged in the ideology of the alt-right."" ""He is a different person than he was when he hid behind an alias and was persuaded into hateful activity on the internet, and recognizes its potential for harming others,"" they said. James Ralph, executive director of the John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts in Eugene, said he was shocked by the revelation of Mr. McCarty's online activities. Mr. McCarty had worked for the theater and performed in its productions of ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" among others. The organization severed ties after learning of Mr. McCarty's online activities in April. Afterward, Mr. McCarty called Mr. Ralph to apologize for damaging the institution, but Mr. Ralph was unsure how much he could believe him. ""The jury's always out,"" Mr. Ralph said. But he added that he has ""both hope and confidence that the terms of the settlement will be effective."" Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

Mr. Trump Has A Bad Word for Russia at Last,"The West's response to Russian aggression has usually been too little, too late, and devoid of the one voice that really matters -- President Trump's. But at last, his administration is taking action, and Mr. Trump has spoken out, tentatively. On Thursday the Treasury Department announced it was imposing sanctions for the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election. Officials have denounced the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain and Russia's devastating bombing missions in Syria.    While such steps are encouraging, only a more robust, unified response from the United States and its NATO allies would impede President Vladimir Putin from expanding his pattern of heinous behavior.    Before leaving office, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, seized two diplomatic properties and imposed sanctions in response to the election interference. Mr. Trump, for reasons that have never been made completely clear, has until now resisted a congressional mandate that he expand the penalties. This was despite the warnings of intelligence agencies that Russia is already trying to meddle in the 2018 election and Congress's near unanimous passage of the law demanding more sanctions.   The sanctions announced on Thursday affect five Russian organizations and 19 individuals cited for spreading disinformation and propaganda to disrupt the election.   While this was Mr. Trump's most significant anti-Russia move, these are the same entities identified by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling, in a recent indictment and only add two new senior Russian officials, with ties to military intelligence, to the list Mr. Obama sanctioned in 2016, according to Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.   The penalties need to go further, subjecting Mr. Putin's wealthy cronies and their families to sanctions like travel bans and asset freezes that would put even more pressure on the Russian leader.   The administration also took the unusual step of citing the Russian government for a previously unconfirmed series of intrusions into American power plants and the computer networks that control power grids that occurred about the time of the election. Those attacks suggest Russian state-sponsored hackers have been actively mapping out Western industrial, power and nuclear facilities for eventual sabotage, experts say.   While Mr. Trump said nothing on Thursday about either the sanctions or Russia's interference in the election, he did end days of silence about the attack with a military-grade nerve agent against the former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, despite Moscow's denials. ''It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,'' he told reporters in the Oval Office. ''Something that should never ever happen. We're taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.''   But Mr. Trump's comments came a full day after his United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, took the lead with a more powerful statement at the Security Council. She insisted the United States stands in ''absolute solidarity'' with Britain after the attack. Russia's use of chemical weapons on the soil of another United Nations member is a ''defining moment,'' she said, and there is a need to ''hold Russia accountable.''   And the piling on didn't stop there. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, whom Mr. Trump reportedly may fire, condemned Russia in a speech on Thursday for being ''complicit in Assad's atrocities'' in Syria and conducting more than 100 bombing missions in Eastern Ghouta, as well as being ''responsible'' for the Skripal poisoning.   All of this occurred after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to expel 23 Russian spies and suspend high-level contact with Moscow, and also joined the United States, France and Germany in a statement denouncing Russia's action as a clear violation of international law.   But the statement said nothing about joint action, and Mrs. May's measures either lacked details or didn't go far enough. Mr. Putin, an authoritarian leader who is expected to be re-elected easily to another six-year term on Sunday, has paid little or no price for his aggressions, including annexing Crimea, destabilizing other parts of Ukraine and enabling President Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.   He won't stop until he knows that the United States will stand up to him and work with its allies to impose stronger financial and diplomatic measures to rein him in.

U.S. Easing Reins On Cyberattacks,"This article is adapted from ''The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age,'' to be published on Tuesday by Crown, an imprint of Penguin Random House. WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon has quietly empowered the United States Cyber Command to take a far more aggressive approach to defending the nation against cyberattacks, a shift in strategy that could increase the risk of conflict with the foreign states that sponsor malicious hacking groups. Until now, the Cyber Command has assumed a largely defensive posture, trying to counter attackers as they enter American networks. In the relatively few instances when it has gone on the offensive, particularly in trying to disrupt the online activities of the Islamic State and its recruiters in the past several years, the results have been mixed at best.    But in the spring, as the Pentagon elevated the command's status, it opened the door to nearly daily raids on foreign networks, seeking to disable cyberweapons before they can be unleashed, according to strategy documents and military and intelligence officials.   The change in approach was not formally debated inside the White House before it was issued, according to current and former administration officials. But it reflects the greater authority given to military commanders by President Trump, as well as a widespread view that the United States has mounted an inadequate defense against the rising number of attacks aimed at America.    It is unclear how carefully the administration has weighed the various risks involved if the plan is acted on in classified operations. Adversaries like Russia, China and North Korea, all nuclear-armed states, have been behind major cyberattacks, and the United States has struggled with the question of how to avoid an unforeseen escalation as it wields its growing cyberarsenal.   Another complicating factor is that taking action against an adversary often requires surreptitiously operating in the networks of an ally, like Germany -- a problem that often gave the Obama administration pause.   The new strategy envisions constant, disruptive ''short of war'' activities in foreign computer networks. It is born, officials said, of more than a decade of counterterrorism operations, where the United States learned that the best way to take on Al Qaeda or the Islamic State was by destroying the militants inside their bases or their living rooms.   The objective, according to the new ''vision statement'' quietly issued by the command, is to ''contest dangerous adversary activity before it impairs our national power.''   Pushing American defenses ''as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity extends our reach to expose adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and capabilities, and counter attacks close to their origins,'' the document says. ''Continuous engagement imposes tactical friction and strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources to defense and reduce attacks.''   Another Pentagon document, dated May 2017, provides a legal basis for attacking nuclear missiles on the launchpad using ''nonkinetic options'' -- meaning a cyberattack or some other means that does not involve bombing a missile on the pad or otherwise blowing it up.   The policy was issued two months after The New York Times revealed that the Obama administration had developed an extensive ''left of launch'' capability to attack North Korea's missiles using cyber and electronic warfare, though it was unclear how well the strategy was working. The new Pentagon legal strategy was first reported by The Daily Beast.   As the Defense Department elevated the Cyber Command to a status equal to the Indo-Pacific Command, the European Command, the Space Command and the Joint Special Operations Command, among others, it declared that most of its 133 ''cyber mission teams'' were combat-ready after years of development.   But most of those teams protect Defense Department networks. Offensive cyberaction by the United States has been relatively rare, a reflection of the time it takes to mount operations and the fact that only the president can approve any use of a cyberweapon that is likely to have significant effects. Those operations have included disabling another nation's nuclear facilities or its missiles, as the United States has attempted in Iran and North Korea, or disrupting the communications of groups like the Islamic State.   The president's sole authority to authorize the use of those weapons is similar to his authority to launch nuclear weapons, a recognition that cyberweapons, even if less powerful than nuclear arms, can have broad, unintended effects.   Under the Trump administration, the traditional structure of White House oversight of American offensive and defensive cyberactivities is being dismantled. Days after taking office in April, the new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, forced out the homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, in part because of his discomfort that Mr. Bossert had direct access to the president.   Mr. Bolton then eliminated the position of White House cybercoordinator, who had overseen the complex mix of cyberactivities run by the American government.   The last person who held the job, Rob Joyce, had previously run the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency -- the covert ''special forces'' of America's cyberoperations, which has mounted attacks on critical foreign targets, from Iran's nuclear facilities to North Korean missile testing sites. Mr. Joyce returned to the N.S.A.   American intelligence agencies have identified cyberthreats as the No. 1 risk facing the United States -- it has ranked ahead of terrorism for years now in the annual assessment provided to Congress, even before the Russian intrusion into the election. But the White House declared that it did not need a separate cybercoordinator because the issues are included in many other programs. A young National Security Council staff member, with scant experience in the topic, now oversees offensive cyberissues.   The United States Cyber Command was created partly in response to a Russian hacking attack that long predated the 2016 election. In the fall of 2008, Russian intelligence agencies penetrated SIPRNet, the Pentagon's secret internal network; that led to a rush to consolidate several cyberprograms into a command. The Chinese, meanwhile, were stealing weapons designs, including blueprints for the F-35, America's most expensive fighter jet.   Cyber Command was placed at Fort Meade, Md., home of the National Security Agency, but it has been criticized for being far too dependent on the N.S.A.'s hacking skills.   A decade later, it is under new command, led by Gen. Paul Nakasone. He was a junior officer in the command's early days and was deeply involved in one of its first big classified projects, ''Nitro Zeus'': the plan to use cybertools, among other things, to take down Iran's air defenses, its communications systems and its power grid if a conflict broke out.   To prepare for that day, if it ever happened, the United States tunneled deep inside Iran's grids, and even Revolutionary Guards Corps command-and-control systems. It was a huge mission, involving hundreds of troops and civilians.   The program was never activated; the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement avoided conflict. But now that Mr. Trump has announced that he is abandoning the accord, many of those plans are being dusted off, according to several officials.   General Nakasone, in his confirmation hearings in March, made clear that a more aggressive approach to opponents in cyberspace would be needed, though he gave few details. ''By conducting operations to frustrate and counter adversary cyberactivities to decrease will, increase cost and deny benefits,'' he said, the United States could begin to deliver more decisive blows with its attacks.   The same month, Gen. John E. Hyten, the head of Strategic Command, said in testimony that if the United States was going to defend itself in cyberspace, it needed clear rules of day-to-day engagement.   ''Cyberspace needs to be looked at as a warfighting domain,'' he said, ''and if somebody threatens us in cyberspace, we need to have the authorities to respond.'' His statement seemed to reflect a view that the current legal authority is too slow.   There is little debate inside the government's sprawling community of cyberwarriors and defenders that the United States needs to step up its game: It did not see the Russian hack of the 2016 election coming, or North Korea's ''WannaCry'' attack last year, which crippled the National Health Service in Britain and rippled around the world, partly driven by stolen American cyberweapons.   But the risks of escalation -- of United States action in foreign networks leading to retaliatory strikes against American banks, dams, financial markets or communications networks -- are considerable, according to current and former officials. Mr. Trump has shown only a cursory interest in the subject, former aides say, not surprising for a man who does not use a computer and came of age as a business executive in a predigital era.   Efforts to rewrite the main document governing the presidential authorities in the cyberarena -- Presidential Policy Directive 20, signed by Barack Obama -- have faltered in the chaos of Mr. Bolton's decision to oust the key players.   ''It is essentially a 'forward defense' approach,'' Jason Healey, who runs the cyber initiative at Columbia University, said recently. ''Clearly, what we have been doing so far isn't working. But you want to think through the consequences carefully.''   The chief risk is that the internet becomes a battleground of all-against-all, as nations not only place ''implants'' in the networks of their adversaries -- something the United States, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have done with varying levels of sophistication -- but also begin to engage in daily attack and counterattack.

The objective, according to the new ""vision statement"" quietly issued by the command, is to ""contest dangerous adversary activity before it impairs our national power."" Pushing American defenses ""as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity extends our reach to expose adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and capabilities, and counter attacks close to their origins,"" the document says. ""Continuous engagement imposes tactical friction and strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources to defense and reduce attacks."" Another Pentagon document, dated May 2017, provides a legal basis for attacking nuclear missiles on the launchpad using ""nonkinetic options"" -- meaning a cyberattack or some other means that does not involve bombing a missile on the pad or otherwise blowing it up. The policy was issued two months after The New York Times revealed that the Obama administration had developed an extensive ""left of launch"" capability to attack North Korea's missiles using cyber and electronic warfare, though it was unclear how well the strategy was working. The new Pentagon legal strategy was first reported by The Daily Beast. As the Defense Department elevated the Cyber Command to a status equal to the Indo-Pacific Command, the European Command, the Space Command and the Joint Special Operations Command, among others, it declared that most of its 133 ""cyber mission teams"" were combat-ready after years of development. But most of those teams protect Defense Department networks. Offensive cyberaction by the United States has been relatively rare, a reflection of the time it takes to mount operations and the fact that only the president can approve any use of a cyberweapon that is likely to have significant effects. Those operations have included disabling another nation's nuclear facilities or its missiles, as the United States has attempted in Iran and North Korea, or disrupting the communications of groups like the Islamic State. The president's sole authority to authorize the use of those weapons is similar to his authority to launch nuclear weapons, a recognition that cyberweapons, even if less powerful than nuclear arms, can have broad, unintended effects. Under the Trump administration, the traditional structure of White House oversight of American offensive and defensive cyberactivities is being dismantled. Days after taking office in April, the new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, forced out the homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, in part because of his discomfort that Mr. Bossert had direct access to the president. Mr. Bolton then eliminated the position of White House cybercoordinator, who had overseen the complex mix of cyberactivities run by the American government. The last person who held the job, Rob Joyce, had previously run the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency -- the covert ""special forces"" of America's cyberoperations, which has mounted attacks on critical foreign targets, from Iran's nuclear facilities to North Korean missile testing sites. Mr. Joyce returned to the N.S.A. American intelligence agencies have identified cyberthreats as the No. 1 risk facing the United States -- it has ranked ahead of terrorism for years now in the annual assessment provided to Congress, even before the Russian intrusion into the election. But the White House declared that it did not need a separate cybercoordinator because the issues are included in many other programs. A young National Security Council staff member, with scant experience in the topic, now oversees offensive cyberissues. The United States Cyber Command was created partly in response to a Russian hacking attack that long predated the 2016 election. In the fall of 2008, Russian intelligence agencies penetrated SIPRNet, the Pentagon's secret internal network; that led to a rush to consolidate several cyberprograms into a command. The Chinese, meanwhile, were stealing weapons designs, including blueprints for the F-35, America's most expensive fighter jet. Cyber Command was placed at Fort Meade, Md., home of the National Security Agency, but it has been criticized for being far too dependent on the N.S.A.'s hacking skills. A decade later, it is under new command, led by Gen. Paul Nakasone. He was a junior officer in the command's early days and was deeply involved in one of its first big classified projects, ""Nitro Zeus"": the plan to use cybertools, among other things, to take down Iran's air defenses, its communications systems and its power grid if a conflict broke out. To prepare for that day, if it ever happened, the United States tunneled deep inside Iran's grids, and even Revolutionary Guards Corps command-and-control systems. It was a huge mission, involving hundreds of troops and civilians. The program was never activated; the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement avoided conflict. But now that Mr. Trump has announced that he is abandoning the accord, many of those plans are being dusted off, according to several officials. General Nakasone, in his confirmation hearings in March, made clear that a more aggressive approach to opponents in cyberspace would be needed, though he gave few details. ""By conducting operations to frustrate and counter adversary cyberactivities to decrease will, increase cost and deny benefits,"" he said, the United States could begin to deliver more decisive blows with its attacks. The same month, Gen. John E. Hyten, the head of Strategic Command, said in testimony that if the United States was going to defend itself in cyberspace, it needed clear rules of day-to-day engagement. ""Cyberspace needs to be looked at as a warfighting domain,"" he said, ""and if somebody threatens us in cyberspace, we need to have the authorities to respond."" His statement seemed to reflect a view that the current legal authority is too slow. There is little debate inside the government's sprawling community of cyberwarriors and defenders that the United States needs to step up its game: It did not see the Russian hack of the 2016 election coming, or North Korea's ""WannaCry"" attack last year, which crippled the National Health Service in Britain and rippled around the world, partly driven by stolen American cyberweapons. But the risks of escalation -- of United States action in foreign networks leading to retaliatory strikes against American banks, dams, financial markets or communications networks -- are considerable, according to current and former officials. Mr. Trump has shown only a cursory interest in the subject, former aides say, not surprising for a man who does not use a computer and came of age as a business executive in a predigital era. Efforts to rewrite the main document governing the presidential authorities in the cyberarena -- Presidential Policy Directive 20, signed by Barack Obama -- have faltered in the chaos of Mr. Bolton's decision to oust the key players. ""It is essentially a 'forward defense' approach,"" Jason Healey, who runs the cyber initiative at Columbia University, said recently. ""Clearly, what we have been doing so far isn't working. But you want to think through the consequences carefully."" The chief risk is that the internet becomes a battleground of all-against-all, as nations not only place ""implants"" in the networks of their adversaries -- something the United States, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have done with varying levels of sophistication -- but also begin to engage in daily attack and counterattack.

"Can Facebook, or Anybody, Solve the Internet's Misinformation Problem?; State of the Art","In theory, Facebook's announcement on Tuesday that it had discovered and shut down a wide-ranging Iranian misinformation campaign should make you feel better. The social network was slow to recognize such campaigns as threats before the 2016 presidential election, and it surely deserves some credit for what Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, described as the company's shift from ""reactive to proactive detection"" of coordinated propaganda operations. But it was not just Iran, and not just Facebook.  YouTube also said that it had removed content linked to the Iranian campaign. So did Twitter. And Facebook said that it had also removed pages stemming from a Russian propaganda operation that was unrelated to the Iranian campaign. And there's more: Microsoft announced this week that it had discovered a Russian hacking campaign aimed at conservative think tanks in the United States. And on Wednesday there was news that hackers had this week tried to penetrate the Democratic National Committee's voter database. All that in three days. (And Facebook took down another influence campaign last month that was of uncertain origin, but might have been operated by Russians.) Feeling better yet? Yeah, me neither. These drip-by-drip revelations inspire something like the opposite of confidence. Find one cockroach in the kitchen and you might feel better for having caught the sucker. Find another, and then another, and pretty soon you start to wonder if you should burn your house down. And these revelations of mischief underscore the novelty of the threats we are dealing with -- and how unprepared we might be to handle them. Some of these disclosures are about actual criminal activity. But others, like the Iranian campaign, describe a more fuzzy kind of misbehavior, one that is not obviously illegal, and whose tactics amount to something that lots of people do everyday: Lying on the internet. Given the gray area some of these activities occupy, figuring out what to make of each revelation -- how to assess its potential impact and our collective capacity to respond to it -- is going to be the next great task of digital society. And the task is far bigger than any of us realize now. ""The work you see now from Facebook, Microsoft and others to be more proactive is a trend that is positive -- it's part of the solution, and I would want to see that trend continue,"" said Graham Brookie, director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank that has been working with Facebook on election-security issues. But Mr. Brookie added: ""Is this a solution? No, definitely not."" A solution, he said, would involve a society-wide reckoning with the problem of the vulnerabilities that the internet has uncovered in democratic society. A solution would involve the federal government taking the lead in such an effort, which is not really happening at the moment. A solution would also involve citizens becoming far more vigilant about what they see online, how they respond to it, and the effect it has on their political lives. And even with all that, we may not really get an actual solution. Instead, the best we might hope for is something like an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between good and bad actors online: a fight that never ends, but whose damage we can at least hope to reduce. That's the long game. The short game is rather more depressing. Consider the most pressing question: How confident should you be that the coming midterm elections will be safe from hacking and propaganda operations online? The most likely answer: Nobody knows for sure, but probably not very confident. Facebook and other tech companies are stepping up their efforts to police their sites before the midterms. But some of the threats they have spotted so far have little to do with the election. The Iranian operation, for example, has been going on for years, and to judge by some of the content posted by these Facebook pages, was not aimed squarely at American elections, but instead American policy. In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that Facebook has been making progress on keeping elections safe, having learned from several races around the world since 2016. ""There was the French election, the German election, the Alabama special election, the Mexican election -- and in each of these elections, our systems have been able to find a lot of fake accounts that were attempting potentially to do bad things on the system,"" he said. Each time the company finds something, Mr. Zuckerberg added, ""We get better at identifying this kind of activity up front and putting barriers in place to those who would try to abuse these systems."" His words are somewhat reassuring, but only in that they feel like the bare minimum that a company like Facebook should do. Alex Stamos, who until recently was Facebook's chief security officer, has a dimmer view. In an article published on Wednesday on Lawfare, a news site that covers national security, Mr. Stamos wrote that the string of attacks revealed by Facebook, Microsoft and others were evidence that ""America's adversaries believe that it is still both safe and effective to attack U.S. democracy using American technologies and the freedoms we cherish."" The government's failure to address these threats have left the United States ""unprepared to protect the 2018 elections,"" Mr. Stamos said. He outlined a set of legislative, regulatory and law enforcement steps Americans might take to secure their digital house. If we move fast, he said, we might be able to salvage 2020.

Plunge in Value Makes the Frauds and Flaws in Virtual Currencies Harder to Ignore,"SAN FRANCISCO -- You did not have to be a technophobe to worry that the virtual-currency boom of the past year papered over plenty of problems. The scale of those problems is starting to become clear as digital tokens have slid more than 50 percent in value from their peaks in early January, with steep drops on Monday pushing the value of Bitcoin specifically below $7,000.    Hackers draining funds from online exchanges. Ponzi schemes. Government regulators unable to keep up with the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies. Signs of trouble have appeared at nearly every level of the industry, from the biggest exchanges to the news sites and chat rooms where the investment frenzy has been discussed.   On Tuesday, the leaders of the two main regulatory agencies in the United States that oversee the technology, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are to testify before the Senate banking committee about their efforts to police virtual currency markets. In the past two weeks, both have brought major cases, but people in the young industry said regulators had barely made a dent.    Some virtual currency enthusiasts argue that the problems are no different from what has happened in other booms, like the internet bubble of the 1990s. But even true believers say the design of virtual currencies -- meant to cut out middlemen and government authorities -- has made bad behavior more prevalent amid this particular bubble.   ''Cryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,'' said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ''The combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large. The fact that the money got huge almost overnight, before there were good regulatory or even self-regulatory models in place, made the problem acute.''   The fall from the peaks of early January has been dizzying. The value of all outstanding virtual currencies has been cut by more than half, down over $400 billion as of Monday, according to the website Coinmarketcap.com.   In January, the heads of the main regulators wrote  in The Wall Street Journal that the situation presented an unprecedented challenge. ''These markets are new, evolving and international,'' Jay Clayton, the Securities and Exchange Commission's chairman, and J. Christopher Giancarlo, his counterpart at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, wrote. ''As such they require us to be nimble and forward-looking.''   Government agencies in the United States have shut down a few notable frauds. Early last month, securities regulators in Texas and North Carolina issued cease-and-desist orders to BitConnect, an operation that had grown to be worth $3 billion.   But those moves only came after BitConnect had operated openly for months, collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from people around the world despite being labeled a Ponzi scheme by many prominent people in the virtual currency industry. BitConnect offered tokens on a decentralized network, similar to Bitcoin, but promised regular payouts to coin holders.   In January, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shut down  My Big Coin, a purported swindle that had attracted $6 million.   But regulators have not gotten near most of the brazen schemes that have popped up in the past year, many of which had been attacked by hackers first, or simply shut down by their operators after money had been raised.   A new virtual currency, Proof of Weak Hands Coin, whose creators referred to it as a Ponzi scheme on Twitter and use a pyramid as a website logo, raised $800,000 before hackers got into its systems last week and drained its funds. Another pyramid scheme, MMM, which was shut down in an earlier incarnation by the Russian government, has been revived thanks to the popularity of Bitcoin and is operating openly, with particular success in Africa.   One challenge facing regulators is that it is unclear how much of the deceptive activity they can legally control.   Some online groups openly try to manipulate the prices of digital tokens in what are known as pump-and-dump schemes. Similar schemes involving stocks are illegal, but people operating the groups recently told BuzzFeed that they did not think the same rules applied to virtual currencies.   Many schemes have been able to expand quickly because they do not use bank accounts and therefore do not have to win approval from established institutions. Instead, they are able to use virtual currency ''wallets'' without any approvals. And virtual currency transactions cannot be reversed like normal bank or even PayPal transfers.   With regulators slow to crack down, the private sector has taken on a more important role. Facebook announced last week that it would no longer allow advertisements for virtual currency projects. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said they would bar customers from using credit cards to purchase virtual currencies; Citigroup followed suit on Monday.   For investors, some of what has caused the most concern are well-intentioned businesses set up in a hurry with little outside oversight or time to work out kinks.   Coincheck, which until last month was one of the largest exchanges in Japan, announced on Jan. 26 that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars of a virtual currency known as NEM, in what appeared to be the largest hack to hit the industry.   Traders have been particularly worried about the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Bitfinex, an unregulated operation that has provided few details about its operations, raising concerns about whether it is insolvent or involved in price manipulation.   In the United States, even the most widely used virtual currency company, Coinbase, has struggled to keep up with demand, shutting down trading for hours at particularly important moments, and attracting widespread complaints about its customer service.   But the biggest number of incidents have cropped up around so-called initial coin offerings, in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies to investors to raise money for software they are building. About 890 projects raised over $6 billion last year, a 6,000 percent increase over the year before, according to Icodata.io, which tracks the offerings.   The $240 million raised through one of the most successful initial coin offerings last year, Tezos, is already frozen in a dispute between the founders of the project and the board they created in Switzerland.   Even established companies like Kodak have ended up chasing the riches without doing proper due diligence. The company delayed its own initial coin offering after it was revealed that the people assisting the venture had problematic histories and little relevant experience.   Most of the newer virtual currency projects borrow their basic design from Bitcoin, which uses a network of computers to maintain its records so that no central government or authority is needed.   That design has allowed Bitcoin and other virtual currencies to grow as fast as they have with no regard for international borders, attracting followers from Zimbabwe to South Korea. It has also allowed some of the most talked-about uses of the technology, helping people escape hyperinflation in Venezuela or transfer money across borders with lower fees. But it has also allowed in a lot of bad actors.   ''It is a perfect storm for the kind of scammy activity we are seeing, and it's not obvious to me how that is easily removed,'' said Fred Wilson, a partner at the venture capital firm Union Square Venture and one of the earliest advocates of Bitcoin in Silicon Valley. ''Regulation, ideally prudent and informed regulation, can help. But we may also need to have a big correction to really clean things up.''    "
Blockchain Cornerstone Is Put Into Place,"From the outside, 304 Troutman Street in Bushwick, Brooklyn, looks fairly ordinary. In most ways, it is. But this nondescript three-story, five-unit rental building is part of an experiment in using the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to transform the New York housing market. ''This is going to be a paradigm shift,'' said Mo Shaikh, a founder of Meridio, a Brooklyn-based company looking to introduce blockchain technology to real estate.    As a secure, decentralized way to register and store payments and transactions online through ''smart contracts,'' blockchain technology will give each of the eight investors who currently own the building cryptocurrency tokens that can be traded and secure access to a crypto-protected database that stores individual transaction data. In theory, the technology will make it nearly impossible for hackers to do widespread damage and will protect against the kind of identity theft that conventional investors might be vulnerable to.   ''Blockchain is just an efficient way of asset exchange: The assets can be cryptocurrency, stocks, bonds, art or real estate,'' said Corbin Page, Mr. Shaikh's partner in Meridio, an offshoot of a larger company called Consensys.    Blockchain is best known as the technology behind Bitcoin, but instead of tracking who owns a digital currency, Meridio's Troutman Street pilot project aims to demonstrate that blockchain can enable online sales of fractional shares of residential or commercial real estate properties.   The experiment at Troutman Street is one of many across the country attempting to move real estate records onto blockchain, and it is part of a larger movement in corporate America to transfer all kinds of records onto blockchain. Many of these experiments promise to fundamentally change industries, but many have also been plagued by delays and questions about whether and how they will actually be an improvement on the existing systems.   If words like cryptocurrency and blockchain make your eyes glaze over, blockchain boosters point out that a user-friendly system can mean you don't need to fully understand the technology any more than you understand the programming code that allows you to order from Amazon or follow politics on Facebook. You can buy or sell ''tokens'' -- which, in this case, represent shares of a building in cryptocurrency -- the same way you would trade online stocks.   Meridio's website will be as easy to use as eTrade and Zillow, Mr. Page said: ''We want it to be for everybody. We will have blockchain in the background, giving the efficiency without it being in your face.''   In real estate deals, he said, blockchain can reduce paperwork and the need for lawyers and other third parties by allowing people to buy and sell portions of buildings more efficiently than by crowdfunding or creating LLCs.   Blockchain proselytizers also say that the technology can reduce fraud, speed transactions, lower costs and help democratize real estate.   ''Real estate has been slow to adopt new technology, and this is bringing energy and excitement, which is welcome in a staid industry,'' said Jamie Wiseman, a founder of Cayuga Capital Management, a developer and property manager in Brooklyn and Queens whose holdings include 304 Troutman Street.   Doubters, however, point out that fraud cannot be eliminated so easily and that the primitive title recording system in the United States will thwart modernization efforts. They also raise questions about the effect on neighborhood development and gentrification.   ''I am skeptical of some of the claims about the impact of blockchain'' on real estate, said Aaron Wright, a professor who created the Blockchain Project at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and coauthored ''Blockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code.''   Mr. Wright said that the lack of regulation could lead to volatility in trading and cause rapid changes in neighborhoods. And claims that blockchain can dramatically reduce the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual real estate fraud, he added, may be overblown. While blockchain will make information much less vulnerable to hacks and its instantaneous transaction confirmation could cut down on scams, he said, if fraudulent information enters the system, blockchain is not designed to stop it.   The revolution, if it comes, will likely be gradual.   Mr. Shaikh said they are still teaching Blockchain 101 to most in the real estate industry, through conferences, blog posts and marketing campaigns. And after partnering with the brokerage Cushman & Wakefield, Mr. Page said, it took ''20 different conversations to find Cayuga, with executives who understood blockchain's potential and were willing to act.''   Cayuga bought 304 Troutman in 2005, and the eight initial investors in the building are now getting cryptocurrency tokens. Starting this summer, they will be able to trade with one another and sell to the tenants there. Meridio is already prepping more properties in New York and beyond, and expects to have them available for trading among accredited investors on their website this summer as well.   ''We think blockchain gives us the killer app to make that model work,'' Mr. Page said. There are no minimums and trading can be done immediately, with lower costs and possibly without a lawyer.   Mr. Shaikh and Mr. Page believe that blockchain will gain traction by allowing people to invest relatively small amounts of money in real estate -- unlike crowdfunding and LLCs, which often require a large minimum investment and have ''lockup periods'' before a property can be flipped. A long with large transfer costs, that has created a high bar for entry to the real estate investment market.   Natalia Karayaneva, the chief executive and founder of Propy, another blockchain company, said this fractionalization of properties could allow investors to buy a piece of high-end homes in Manhattan that are often owned by ultra-wealthy foreign oligarchs.   But Mr. Wright, the Cardozo professor, offered another perspective: The lack of regulation, he said, could mean that foreigners looking to move money out of their home countries and people with ''ill-gotten gains'' could use the technology to spread their dollars around multiple properties.   Ms. Karayaneva and Meridio's founders, however, believe the fractionalization will bring a bigger and broader pool of capital into real estate. ''If you don't have the money to buy your house or apartment, you can buy a piece of it, allowing you to build wealth,'' Mr. Shaikh said. ''That's exciting for middle-class Americans.''   There are potential pitfalls, of course -- among them, that cryptocurrency has proved quite volatile, and if the value of a home, apartment or retail building were to skyrocket or plummet the way Bitcoin has, the impact could ripple out through an entire neighborhood.   ''It depends on how the law plays out with the product, but if there's massive trading without sensible guardrails there'll be potential problems with volatility,'' Mr. Wright said.   Mr. Page argued that the large scale and tangible nature of real estate should make it less volatile than Bitcoin, and Mr. Shaikh said they would consider implementing rules, like one that allows only a certain number of trades on a property per day, to ease concerns.   But Mr. Wright pointed out that while more capital pouring in from around the world sounded good, if all those people decided New York was the place to invest and that helped drive prices up for local residents, it would ''lead to issues on the ground and change the character of a neighborhood.''   Mr. Wiseman agreed. ''Blockchain may bring costs down,'' he said, ''but it will accelerate gentrification.''   There is also the possibility that fractionalization could allow communities to band together to battle gentrification, Mr. Page suggested. Community groups or immigrant-centered organizations, he said, could help coordinate neighbors' efforts to buy up small chunks of apartments or houses, or even commercial real estate.   ''Maybe that is a solution,'' Mr. Wright said, noting that this would have multiple benefits in strengthening a sense of community, although it would take years before it could be widespread.   The effects on individual transactions, however, would be more immediate. Mr. Wright recently ran a demonstration in Australia that showed how smart contracts on blockchain could reduce the ''cumbersome half-day process'' of a transaction to a matter of minutes.   ''It was super exciting,'' he said, although it would be difficult to implement these changes in the United States, he added, because real estate records here are ''very, very fractured'' and governed on a county-by-county basis. ''Efforts to even digitize records that started in the 1980s haven't fully happened yet.''   That is sadly true, said John Mirkovic, deputy recorder of deeds for Cook County, Ill., which ran a pilot program in Chicago that successfully demonstrated how blockchain technology could be used to more safely and efficiently record real estate transactions.   But many counties around the country still use paper for record-keeping, Mr. Mirkovic said, while more technologically advanced ones may have upgraded to Windows 95.   ''Getting people to do something new is not easy,'' he said. Still, he added, citizens and politicians should push for blockchain as a ''good government'' issue, making it ''a populist technology.''

Block Stars,"The blockchain is a technology that is supposed to be all about distributing power and information away from central authorities. But many individuals have been crucial in pushing the technology forward. Here is a look at some of the most influential people in the industry today. Amber Baldet    While the JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon was bashing Bitcoin as a fraud, his employee Amber Baldet put the bank at the front of Wall Street's efforts to harness the blockchain. Ms. Baldet, 35 and until recently the head of the bank's blockchain lab, led a project to create a bank-friendly version of the Ethereum software, known as Quorum.   Quorum has since become one of the most popular places for corporations and governments to start building blockchain projects. But Ms. Baldet, who never stopped being an outspoken advocate for hackers and privacy on Twitter, always seemed too big a personality for an old-fashioned bank.   Earlier this year, she broke away and created her own start-up, Clovyr, which she is building with a partner from her days at JPMorgan. She has compared Clovyr to an app store for blockchains, open to the many competing approaches to blockchains today. It illustrates her unusual ability to bring together the corporate and hacker camps working on the technology.    Brian Behlendorf   Brian Behlendorf was a prominent name in the tech world long before his rather late arrival on the blockchain scene. In the early 1990s, he started one of the first companies that built websites, which led him to create the Apache software that is still used by many web servers.   His work on open source software was driven in part by his interest in alternative culture, which also made him an early player at the Burning Man festival. In 2016, he was brought in by the Linux Foundation to lead a nonprofit known as Hyperledger that aims to create standard blockchain software that anyone can use.   While the project was initially led by IBM, Mr. Behlendorf, 45, has helped bring in other big names who are helping to make Hyperledger the focus of much of the corporate and governmental interest in blockchains today. Hyperledger now oversees several different blockchain projects, but its biggest product is Fabric, which is being used by everyone from Walmart to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Mr. Behlendorf, meanwhile, has tried to make sure the technology has kept its open-source soul even as it has begun to go mainstream.   Vitalik Buterin   Aside from the blockchain inventor known as Satoshi Nakamoto, no name in the cryptocurrency world is more recognizable than that of Vitalik Buterin, the 24-year-old inventor of Ethereum. Mr. Buterin came up with the idea for Ethereum after dropping out of college, when he was only 19, and few imagined the awkward teenager could make it work.   His creation, though, is now home to the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Beyond that, Ethereum has pioneered a future direction for the blockchain -- serving as a new kind of shared global computing network. That has drawn in thousands of developers who are building on top of Ethereum.   The system has been buggy, and provided an opening for lots of bad actors. But Mr. Buterin's ideas have also been popular among many corporations and government agencies, who are now experimenting on their own versions of Ethereum. Many competitors have also raised money to build systems aimed at improving on the basic concepts laid out by Ethereum, but Mr. Buterin's soft-spoken leadership has so far kept Ethereum ahead.   Chris Dixon   There are few greater marks of prestige in the blockchain world than an investment from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. While it is the firm's co-founder Marc Andreessen who has gotten the most attention for his backing of the industry, it is Chris Dixon who is leading the firm's work in the area.   Mr. Dixon, who created start-ups that were acquired by eBay and McAfee before becoming a venture capitalist, was responsible for Andreessen's first big Bitcoin bet in 2013, when the firm became a lead investor in the Bitcoin brokerage Coinbase. That has ended up looking smart as Coinbase has risen to become the multibillion-dollar giant of the industry, with more customers than Charles Schwab and eTrade.   Since then, Mr. Dixon has spread the firm's money to a wide array of smaller projects in the industry, and recently created a $300 million fund that will focus exclusively on digital tokens. Mr. Dixon has also taken to Medium to pen essays explaining and advocating for the bigger ideas behind blockchain-based technologies -- most notably, the ability to create new decentralized computer protocols that can be governed by communities instead of companies.   Daniel Larimer   Daniel Larimer's libertarian politics drew him to Bitcoin in the early years. But the Virginia Tech graduate has made his name, and his fortune, by building new kinds of cryptocurrencies with more wide-ranging functions than Bitcoin.   This began with an exchange that was supposed to make it easier to trade Bitcoin, and that relied on its own internal currency, known as BitShares. He left that project before it took off to create Steemit, a new kind of social network, powered by its own, eponymous token.   Steemit is still working today, but Mr. Larimer's biggest success has come with his latest creation, Block.one, and its digital token, EOS, which is set to compete with Ethereum. Block.one, where Mr. Larimer, 35, is the chief technology officer, raised more than $4 billion from investors to build EOS, making it the most successful cryptocurrency fund-raising project by a good margin.   The start of the EOS currency was recently plagued by delays and technical snags. That, and Mr. Larimer's history of leaving projects unfinished, have drawn many skeptics. But if nothing else, Mr. Larimer and Block.one should have enough money to turn EOS into a contender in the crowded world of cryptocurrencies.   Jed McCaleb   Each one of the three things that Jed McCaleb has created in the last decade would be, on its own, enough to make him one of the most well-known and controversial figures in the cryptocurrency universe.   The soft-spoken native of Arkansas began in 2011 by acting on something of a whim and throwing together the website for Mt. Gox, the infamous Bitcoin exchange that became the largest in the world before imploding in 2014. Mr. McCaleb had gotten out of Mt. Gox relatively early and emerged mostly unscathed, allowing him to create Ripple, a cryptocurrency that was aimed at improving on Bitcoin by eliminating the arduous process of mining, among other things.   Ripple has become the third most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, and the one with the most links to the traditional financial world. Mr. McCaleb, 43, left Ripple before its most recent successes, after a falling out with his co-founders. But that has allowed him to create yet another new digital token, known as Stellar, that he envisioned as an upgrade of Ripple. It has already won partnerships with IBM and a number of Silicon Valley start-ups.   Michael Novogratz   While many on Wall Street have focused on the blockchain technology and dismissed cryptocurrencies, Michael Novogratz has led the camp -- and made a fortune -- betting that the real innovation is in Bitcoin and the other digital tokens it has spawned. In 2013, when he was at the private equity firm Fortress Capital, Mr. Novogratz -- a former military pilot and Goldman Sachs partner -- made the firm one of the first in the financial industry to actually purchase Bitcoins.   This bet gave Mr. Novogratz, 53, who was a wrestler at Princeton, a good shot at redemption after his big hedge fund at Fortress shut down. Last year, Mr. Novogratz started what he has described as a sort of full-service investment bank for cryptocurrency projects, called Galaxy Digital.   He had to reverse course on plans to open an enormous crypto hedge fund when the markets suddenly turned sour in December. But he is still putting his money where his mouth is, setting up what is likely to be the biggest institution selling Wall Street on the virtues of cryptocurrencies.   Elizabeth Stark   In the continuing struggle to get Bitcoin into mainstream use while staying true to its ideological roots, nobody is more crucial than Elizabeth Stark. Ms. Stark, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is the chief executive of Lightning Labs, a start-up that is building tools that can layer new capabilities -- and new transaction channels -- on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.   There is currently a hard limit on the number of transactions the Bitcoin blockchain can handle, which has led to significant battles between companies and developers over the best way to expand the network. Ms. Stark, who was already an advocate for a more open and egalitarian internet, became a leader of the camp that wanted to keep Bitcoin relatively small, true to its ideological roots as a decentralized network, with no one in control.   At the same time, she proposed and began building a method of adding layers on top of Bitcoin that can handle lots of new customers and transaction types. These ''layer two solutions,'' as she has called them, appear to be Bitcoin's best chance of expanding to take on the world, and are already being rolled out. The work has turned Ms. Stark into a leading public face of a far-flung Bitcoin community that often defies organization.   Valerie A. Szczepanik   As the cryptocurrency industry has looked for clarity on what the regulators will allow, no agency has been more important than the Securities and Exchange Commission, and no person at the S.E.C. has been more central than Valerie A. Szczepanik. A former patent lawyer who joined the S.E.C. in 1997, she was recently appointed to be the agency's senior adviser on digital assets and innovation.   But Szczepanik has been involved in the S.E.C.'s work in the area since early on. She worked on several enforcement actions against fraudulent cryptocurrency projects and has served as the co-head of the agency's Dark Web Working group. In addition to punishing bad actors, Ms. Szczepanik has led the agency's effort to define the boundaries that will determine what form legal cryptocurrency and blockchain projects can take.   The speeches she has given have been cheered by some in the industry because they have shown that she understands the technological nuances of the projects out there.   When her group decided that the second most valuable digital token, Ether, would not fall under the agency's purview, it set off a big rally in the markets. But that decision only cleared up a bit of the regulatory uncertainty in the sector. Industry players are still following Ms. Szczepanik's every word for an indication of where the industry will be allowed to go.   Jihan Wu   Jihan Wu, a 32-year-old graduate of Peking University, has become one of the more unlikely leaders in the cryptocurrency universe. Bitmain, the company that Mr. Wu built with his technical co-founder, Micree Zhan, manufactures the machines that crunch through lots of computations to mine new Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.   Bitmain used its proximity and connections to the computer manufacturing hubs in China to build machines that were more efficient and profitable than any competitor. Today, most estimates indicate that over 75 percent of the computers mining Bitcoins -- and a similarly large number of the machines mining other cryptocurrencies -- come from Bitmain. That has turned out to be an important position to occupy because it is the computers mining Bitcoins that get to vote on updates to the Bitcoin software.   Mr. Wu has been at the center of the battles over how to expand Bitcoin's capacity. The fights, and a cryptocurrency crackdown by the Chinese government, have not stopped Mr. Wu from growing Bitmain into one of the most valuable companies in the industry, and a crucial player in any conversation about the shape of the computer networks that stand behind most of the cryptocurrencies in existence.

A Guide to Travels in the Crypto World,"The original blockchain was created by Bitcoin to record every movement of every Bitcoin token. It has inspired thousands of other new blockchains that attempt to record information in the distinctive fashion Bitcoin pioneered.  There is significant debate about how to define a blockchain and which systems for recording data should earn the label. But most projects using the term blockchain try to create a single database that is shared and maintained by a group of people or institutions.    Because all of the computers keep their own copy of the records, if any one computer gets hacked or knocked out, the other ones can keep going. As with the Bitcoin blockchain, the blocks of data stored in blockchains are generally linked, or chained, together using complicated math, making it hard to go back and change the earlier records.   The vast majority of blockchains in existence involve new virtual currencies inspired by Bitcoin; many used the open source Bitcoin software as a starting point. Almost every virtual currency has its own blockchain, which stores the records of every transaction.   Most of these blockchains are known as public, or permissionless blockchains, because anyone can hook into the network and help record the transactions without requiring permission from anyone. The security of these blockchains comes from the number of computers helping to keep the records.   Corporations and governments around the world have also taken an interest as they have watched the success of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Given that most modern companies and governments are grappling with how to reliably and efficiently store vast amounts of data, many have been drawn in by the promise of a new way of recording data in a shared fashion -- similar to the way that the internet and email made it possible for information and messages to flow through shared networks.   Most companies and governments have been scared by the idea of storing data on public blockchains that anyone could access.   That has led to the creation of private, or permissioned blockchains, which are only shared among computers that have been granted access by some authority.   This design has been scoffed at by many Bitcoin purists, who say the power of blockchains comes from the vast number of computers that stand at their foundation -- something that is lost when only a few computers are maintaining a blockchain.   But many private blockchains have been able to innovate quickly because of the smaller number of people who have to be herded together whenever a change is proposed.   But blockchain believers say shared records -- even those among small networks -- are better than relying on one central player.   Here are some of the biggest companies and governments working on blockchain projects.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
What U.S. Prosecutors Say 7 Russian Spies Did To Hurt Doping Agencies,"Seven Russian spies charged Thursday with carrying out cyberattacks targeted a number of international antidoping agencies as well as soccer's governing body and even individual athletes, the Justice Department said. Some of the defendants -- all members of Russia's military intelligence agency -- had been separately indicted in July for conspiring to interfere in the American presidential election. According to the new indictment, the spies traveled beyond their Moscow headquarters, including to Rio de Janeiro at the time of the 2016 Olympics, to conduct attacks on investigators pursuing Russian misconduct. Their tactics included stealing the private communications and records of top sports officials, antidoping investigators and prominent athletes.    Here are key takeaways from the indictment as it relates to global sports.   The targets of the cyberattacks included:     250 athletes from about 30 countries who had their medical records stolen and published, including the tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams and the gymnast Simone Biles.    The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the regulator of drugs in sports, headquartered in Montreal, which has commissioned multiple investigations into Russian doping.    The United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) and its Canadian counterpart, the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport, which have pressed for strong punishment of Russia.    The International Association of Athletics Federations (I.A.A.F.), the Monaco-based governing body of track and field, which has taken the strongest, most persistent stance against Russian doping.    FIFA, the global governing body of soccer, which managed fallout from the doping scandal as it prepared to hold its marquee event, the World Cup, in Russia last summer.   How did the spies carry out the attacks?    The hackers used spearphishing -- email fraud, in which they baited recipients into clicking malicious links -- while leveraging fictitious personas, cryptocurrency and social media accounts.   When their remote hacking efforts failed, they traveled to various sporting competitions and conferences around the world, logging on to hotel Wi-Fi networks used by the targets of their attacks. After studying hotel internet systems, the Russians compromised networks in coordination with conspirators in Moscow.   The spies conducted extensive research about the sports and antidoping organizations, their computer networks and employees, the American prosecutors said. They registered fake domain names that closely resembled legitimate websites -- for example, in the case of the top antidoping watchdog, WADA, they used ''wada.awa.org'' and ''wada.arna.org'' to mimic the correct ''wada.ama.org.''   In pursuing access to the systems of the international sports arbitration court -- which upheld a blanket ban of Russian track and field athletes -- they registered ''tas-cass.org'' to mimic the correct ''tas-cas.org.''   When did the attacks occur?    Across multiple years, but many were in summer 2016. A key date was July 25, 2016 -- the day after Russia's participation in the Rio Games was threatened by global Olympic officials.   On July 24, 2016, the International Olympic Committee announced that Russian athletes would be excluded from the 2016 Olympics unless evidence cleared them of doping. The restriction came after reports of a state-supported doping scheme Russia carried out at the 2014 Games the country hosted in Sochi.   The next day, according to American prosecutors, Russian spies began a ''distributed denial-of-service attack'' on the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had recommended Russia be banned; such an attack overloads a target's website with traffic until it weakens or collapses.   Right before the Aug. 5 opening ceremony of the Rio Games -- the hackers registered a false WADA domain name. On Aug. 4, one spy, Artem Andreyevich Malyshev, sent messages to WADA employees posing as the organization's chief technology officer, phishing for employees to input their user names and passwords. Similar messages went out on Aug. 9, and at least one employee entered his or her credentials, the prosecutors said.   What did the intelligence officers do at the 2016 Olympics?   Two of the spies traveled to Rio de Janeiro -- in July and again in August. According to the indictment, a defendant who remained in Moscow ''conducted research concerning an identified hotel chain that hosted Olympics officials,'' focusing on ''the routers used by some of those hotels for Wi-Fi access and methods of exploiting those routers, including through 'brute force' password cracking.''   At the Rio Games, Olympic officials stayed at the Windsor hotel chain and were principally headquartered at the Windsor Marapendi, where a pop-up sports arbitration court and other official proceedings were conducted.   On Aug. 19, 2016 -- about 15 hours before two of the Russian spies were scheduled to depart Rio de Janeiro -- an Olympic official logged on to the private global antidoping database, affording the hackers access. ''Large-scale exports of data'' followed on Aug. 29, 2016 and Sept. 6, 2016, the Justice Department prosecutors said.   What other events did the spies attend?   The frenzy of activity extended into September 2016, when two spies traveled to Lausanne, Switzerland, where the I.O.C. is headquartered, for an antidoping conference. The intelligence officers stayed at different hotels, each known to host antidoping officials for the occasion. By compromising a hotel Wi-Fi system, they gained access to a Canadian official's laptop and email account.   Was any of this activity discovered at the time?   Some organizations -- like WADA, the global antidoping regulator; Usada, the American regulator; and the I.A.A.F., the track and field governing body that first banned Russia in November 2015 -- had announced they had been the subject of cyberattacks.   But Thursday's indictment provided a new level of detail about the mechanics and extent of the attacks while also revealing, for example, that FIFA's medical and antidoping director also had his computer breached. Until at least Jan. 2, 2017, the spies had access to a computer belonging to the head of FIFA's medical and antidoping division and downloaded ''more than 100 documents,'' including evidence produced in investigations of Russian doping.   What motivated the attacks?   ''All of this was done to undermine organizations' efforts to ensure the integrity of the Olympics and other Games,'' a Justice Department official said at Thursday's news conference.   After the attacks occurred, until at least January 2018, according to the indictment, the hackers ''would actively solicit and promote media coverage so the stolen information would receive international attention.''   Did investigators and sports officials back off from disciplining Russia?   The nation was technically banned from the last Olympics for its doping system, though more than 160 Russian athletes were permitted to compete under special dispensations. WADA recently reinstated Russia's antidoping agency, which had been suspended for nearly three years. That decision was met with controversy as Russia has not fulfilled certain previously set criteria, including admitting to the widespread cheating.   How did sports officials react to Thursday's charges?   Asked about the charges at a news conference in Buenos Aires, Thomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., said he had not reviewed them and knew only the broad outlines from news reports. ''We know that we have been the target of numerous attacks, not only in the last two or three years,'' Bach said. ''I will not make mistakes to advise potential hackers to what we have done and not done.''    "
"Have a Cryptocurrency Company? Bermuda, Malta or Gibraltar Wants You","SAN FRANCISCO -- Hedge funds go to the Cayman Islands to incorporate. Big companies are generally domiciled in Delaware. And online poker companies often set up their bases in Gibraltar and Malta. Now the race is on to become the go-to destination for cryptocurrency companies that are looking for shelter from regulatory uncertainty in the United States and Asia. In small countries and territories including Bermuda, Malta, Gibraltar and Liechtenstein, officials have recently passed laws, or have legislation in the works, to make themselves more welcoming to cryptocurrency companies and projects. In Malta, the government passed three laws on July 4 so companies can easily issue new cryptocurrencies and trade existing ones. In Bermuda this year, the legislature passed a law that lets start-ups doing initial coin offerings apply to the minister of finance for speedy approval. ""We are 65,000 people, and 20 square miles, but we have a very advanced economy,"" the premier of Bermuda, E. David Burt, said in an interview at a cryptocurrency conference in May in New York, where he was trying to pitch companies on the island's charms. ""We want to position Bermuda as the incubator for this industry.""  The competition for cryptocurrency companies is part of a broader rush by governments to figure out how to approach a new industry that took on outsize prominence over the last year. Becoming a crypto center has many potential upsides, including jobs and tax revenue. But the drive to be a crypto nexus also comes with significant risk. Hackings and scams have followed the industry everywhere it has gone. They have been aided by the underlying technology introduced by Bitcoin, known as the blockchain, which was built to make it possible to send money without requiring approval from government agencies or existing financial institutions. And the cryptocurrencies are hardly stable, with the prices of most having plunged in 2018 after skyrocketing last year. The use of cryptocurrencies by hackers was reinforced this month when the Justice Department announced charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee and said they had principally used Bitcoin to fund their work. Volatility and uncertainty have deterred some countries and caused others to hesitate in embracing crypto companies. In China, the government banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings after many of its citizens were swept up in the frenzy and bet their savings on digital tokens. And the Japanese authorities halted the operations of several crypto exchanges this year after one of the biggest licensed exchanges was hacked. In the United States, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, has warned that most companies that have raised money by selling cryptocurrencies have most likely not followed the law. But his agency has not provided clear guidance on the line demarcating legal and illegal projects. All of this has opened the door for smaller countries to provide a friendlier environment, separate from private efforts -- such asin Puerto Rico -- to create crypto havens. And many of the countries' moves are already having an effect, with dozens of companies -- including the largest exchange in the world -- announcing plans to set up offices in the small jurisdictions that have passed laws. Bermuda has been a leading player. Apart from passing the law to allow for fast approval of initial coin offerings, the British territory has a law in the works to open the doors to cryptocurrency exchanges and related services. Mr. Burt said his government was modeling its approach on one it had taken with the insurance industry, in which Bermuda has become a major player. Bermuda's measures have attracted Will McDonough, the founder of a new cryptocurrency called iCash. He said he had decided to base his company there because of the island's experience in international finance and the government's willingness to listen to the company's input. ""The largest issue blockchain companies have is not knowing how they'll be governed or regulated,"" said Mr. McDonough, a former vice president at Goldman Sachs. ""Those markets that have made the rules clear have found many companies coming to play by the rules."" Mr. McDonough is planning to raise $35 million by selling iCash tokens to investors around the world, including some in the United States. The iCash tokens are initially designed to be the method of payment for an online gambling site. He said he would still be based in Florida, but would have an office and a head of operations in Bermuda, which the island requires of all companies. Other companies are playing the field more. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, went shopping for a new location after Japan shut it down this year for operating without a license. The exchange, which is known for its desire to skirt regulations, announced in March that it would open new offices in Malta with hundreds of employees as a result of the friendly laws the country had put into motion. That prompted Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, to post a congratulatory tweet and proclaim the island's intention to be the ""global trailblazers in the regulation of blockchain-based businesses."" But a month later, Binance's chief executive, Zhao Changpeng, traveled to Bermuda to announce that the company would also open up compliance operations there and invest $15 million in the island. At the signing event with Mr. Burt, Mr. Zhao wore a tie and blue Bermuda shorts. Mr. Zhao did not respond to requests for comment. Many of the countries passing the new laws have said they are not interested in becoming a home for illicit activity. Albert Isola, Gibraltar's finance minister, said his government was accustomed to making hard decisions after regulating online gambling companies for the last 25 years. ""For every one license we've issued, we've probably said no to 10,"" he said. ""When you're considering a new sector, to bring in big names is extremely attractive, but they've got to be good names. So you've got to be willing to say no to even some of the bigger ones."" Online gambling is responsible for around 3,000 jobs on Gibraltar, or about 10 percent of the territory's population. Mr. Isola said he saw a similar possibility in the blockchain, calling it ""the next significant new flow of business."" Gibraltar is in the final stages before voting on regulations that, similar to Malta's, would let companies issue and trade digital tokens. Already, 35 companies have applied to the government for licenses to operate blockchain businesses. Liechtenstein, the Alpine nation between Austria and Switzerland, is also among the newer entrants to the race, with the prime minister circulating a Blockchain Act this summer to allow companies to sell tokens. The activity has spread to other areas, too. Wyoming and Delaware have passed laws aimed at welcoming certain blockchain businesses, though they have been less focused on ones that trade in tokens. In 2014, New York created a so-called BitLicense, which initially drew businesses to the state, but it has since been viewed as a deterrent because of the government's wide-ranging requirements and slow approval process. In Switzerland, the canton of Zug has also sought out crypto business, labeling itself Crypto Valley. Zug's top economic official who has worked on the effort, Guido Bulgheroni, flew to the cryptocurrency conference in May that Mr. Burt also attended. At a cocktail party for Crypto Valley, Mr. Bulgheroni said his first job was to make sure that anyone with a crypto project was happy being in the Zug area. ""How many other jurisdictions have that?"" he said. Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.  PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Tyler Comrie FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Related Articles  "
Bomb Threats Sent to Schools and Businesses Across U.S.,"Law enforcement agencies across the country and in Canada responded Thursday to a wave of bomb threats against schools, businesses, government buildings and other institutions, according to the F.B.I.  The threats, many received by email and requesting payment, have promoted evacuations, lockdowns, panic and disruption, according to various reports. But several police agencies throughout the country said that the threats lacked credibility. ""We are aware of the recent bomb threats made in cities around the country, and we remain in touch with our law enforcement partners to provide assistance,"" the F.B.I. field office in Washington, D.C., said in a statement. ""As always, we encourage the public to remain vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activities which could represent a threat to public safety."" Hundreds of businesses, schools, hospitals and other facilities across the country received versions of the emailed threat, according to New York Police Department officials. About 30 to 40 such threats were received in New York. In one version of the email, the sender claimed that an explosive device had been hidden ""in the building where your company is conducted"" and could be prevented from detonating with a $20,000 ransom payment, made using Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, according to the officials. In a version of the email published on Facebook by the police in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the sender promised to ""call off my man if you make a transfer."" Emails with similar narratives were shared on Facebook by the police in Oshkosh, Wis.; Medina, Ohio; and Dubuque, Iowa. ""At this time, it appears that these threats are meant to cause disruption and/or obtain money,"" the New York Police Department said in a statement on Twitter. ""We'll respond to each call regarding these emails to conduct a search but we wanted to share this information so the credibility of these threats can be assessed as likely NOT CREDIBLE."" The Massachusetts State Police said that it was working with federal and local authorities to assess the risk associated with threats to businesses there. The San Francisco Police Department said it had begun responding to reports of bomb threats at about 10 a.m. Similar threats were received throughout the country, from Washington State to Colorado to Georgia, and even in Canada, according to various reports. The targeted institutions also included libraries, banks and medical facilities. William K. Rashbaum and Liam Stack contributed reporting.

'Insert 2 Quarters': Pentagon Fails Hacking Test,"WASHINGTON -- Authorized hackers were quickly able to seize control of weapons systems being acquired by the American military in a test of the Pentagon's digital vulnerabilities, according to a new and blistering government review. The report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that many of the weapons, or the systems that control them, could be neutralized within hours. In many cases, the military teams developing or testing the systems were oblivious to the hacking.    A public version of the study, published on Tuesday, deleted all names and descriptions of which systems were attacked so the report could be published without tipping off American adversaries about the vulnerabilities. Congress is receiving the classified version of the report, which specifies which among the $1.6 trillion in weapons systems that the Pentagon is acquiring from defense contractors were affected.    But even the declassified review painted a terrifying picture of weaknesses in a range of emerging weapons, from new generations of missiles and aircraft to prototypes of new delivery systems for nuclear weapons.   ''In one case, the test team took control of the operators' terminals,'' the report said. ''They could see, in real time, what the operators were seeing on their screens and could manipulate the system'' -- a technique reminiscent of what Russian hackers did to a Ukrainian power grid two years ago.   The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, described ''red team'' hackers who were pitted against cyberdefenders at the Pentagon. The tested weapons were among a total of 86 weapons systems under development; many were penetrated either through easy-to-crack passwords, or because they had few protections against ''insiders'' working on elements of the programs.   Sometimes the testing teams toyed with their Pentagon targets. One team ''reported that they caused a pop-up message to appear on users' terminals instructing them to insert two quarters to continue operating.''   The searing assessment comes after years of warnings about the vulnerabilities of the military systems -- some of which the Government Accountability Office said were ignored -- and just as President Trump gives American commanders more flexibility to deploy cyberweapons without obtaining presidential approval.   It also suggests that the United States is vulnerable to cyberattacks when it seeks to disable enemy systems.   The New York Times reported last year that former President Barack Obama had ordered accelerated cyberattacks on North Korea's missile systems starting in 2014 -- around the time, the report said, that the Pentagon belatedly began waking up to the holes in its own systems.   In recent years, the Pentagon has begun to install ''intrusion alarms'' to warn weapons operators of signs of attacks. But the Government Accountability Office suggested that those alarms were about as effective as car alarms going off on the streets of New York: an event so common that everyone assumed it was a false alarm.   ''Intrusion detection systems correctly identified test team activities,'' the report said. But, it added, the system ''was always 'red''' and ''warnings were so common that operators were desensitized to them.''   The congressional auditors called their findings the first time they have examined vulnerabilities of major weapon systems that the federal government is acquiring.   That issue has become more urgent over the past decades. Older weapons used by the Pentagon, some dating to before the Vietnam War, were minimally dependent on computers or networks, making them naturally resistant to hacking.   As the report made clear -- and as admirals and generals have been discussing for years -- the move to update systems introduces new vulnerabilities.   ''Today's weapon systems are heavily computerized, which opens more attack opportunities for adversaries,'' the review said.   It also found that the ''increasingly computerized and networked nature'' of the systems was not the only problem; so was the Defense Department's ''past failure to prioritize weapon systems cybersecurity.''   Compounding the problem are the millions of lines of software that are buried in parts and subsystems, creating vulnerabilities that weapons designers and contractors often do not fully grasp.   ''Weapon systems have a wide variety of interfaces, some of which are not obvious, that could be used as pathways for adversaries to access the systems,'' the study concluded.   Similar warnings have been sounded since 2013, when the government's Defense Science Board raised the potential that sophisticated adversaries, led by Russia and China, would use cyberweapons to neutralize weapons systems even before battle.   In the five years since, the Pentagon has been reluctant to discuss the subject beyond vague generalities, insisting that any public airing of the issue would only invite attacks.   Included in the Government Accountability Office's survey of vulnerabilities were submarines, missiles, cargo rockets, radars, fighter jets, refueling tankers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, satellites, helicopters and electronic jammers.   In interviews, office officials said the acquisition programs under review included two of the three major classes of nuclear-weapons delivery systems: the Columbia-class submarine and the replacement for the nation's aging Minuteman missiles, known as the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.   Not part of the $1.6 trillion total was the B-21 bomber, a new generation of stealth jet that could drop nuclear weapons.   Nuclear weapons themselves were not included in the report; they are mostly controlled by the Energy Department, which oversees their design and testing. But nuclear weapons have become a focus of increasing scrutiny, both inside and outside the defense establishment.   Last month, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a group that studies nuclear threats, published a detailed report about the risks that nuclear weapons systems could be subject to cyberattacks. It warned that such attacks ''could have catastrophic consequences,'' including the risk that weapons could be used in response to ''false warnings or miscalculation.''   ''The world's most lethal weapons are vulnerable to stealthy attacks from stealthy enemies -- attacks that could have catastrophic consequences,'' former Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, former Senator Sam Nunn and former Defense Minister Des Browne of Britain wrote in that report.   ''Today, that fact remains the chilling reality,'' wrote the three Cold War veterans. ''Cyberthreats are expanding and evolving at a breathtaking rate, and governments are not keeping pace. It is essential that the U.S. government and all nuclear-armed states catch up with -- indeed, get ahead of and stay ahead of -- this threat.''    "
Man Who Hacked West Point and Government Websites Is Charged,"A California man suspected of accessing and defacing numerous military, government and business websites, including that of West Point's Combating Terrorism Center and the New York City Comptroller's Office, was arrested Thursday on computer fraud charges. Prosecutors believe that from 2015 through March 2018, Billy Ribeiro Anderson, under the online pseudonym AlfabetoVirtual, gained unauthorized access to computers and replaced publicly available content with the words ""Hacked by AlfabetoVirtual,"" ""#freepalestine,"" ""#freegaza,"" or some combination of the three. Hackers often claim responsibility for cybercrimes by adding their online pseudonyms to their defacements.  ""Billy Anderson allegedly used specialized computer skills and knowledge to hack important U.S. military and government websites, as well as over 11,000 other websites around the world,"" Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said Thursday in a statement issued by the Department of Justice. Mr. Anderson, 41, of Torrance, Calif., faces three counts of computer fraud, and could face up to 21 years in prison if convicted on all charges. ""Among other possible effects, website defacements can disrupt an organization's operations and damage its credibility,"" William F. Sweeney Jr., the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.'s New York field office, said in the statement. In July 2015, security vulnerabilities in a website for the New York City comptroller were exploited, and AlfabetoVirtual claimed responsibility for the intrusion and defacement. In October 2016, AlfabetoVirtual claimed responsibility for defacing a website for the Combating Terrorism Center, an academic center at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y. According to the complaint, the comptroller's office ultimately paid more than $5,000 to fix the damage, and the United States government paid more than $7,000 to fix West Point's site. Mr. Anderson's lawyer could not be identified on Thursday, and Sagar K. Ravi, an assistant United States attorney who is expected to prosecute the case, could not immediately be reached. Tampering with websites in this way is probably the most common type of hacking, Levi Gundert, a former United States Secret Service special agent within the Los Angeles Electronic Crimes Task Force, said in an interview on Thursday. And those looking for holes in web servers can find ""so many different ways in,"" he said. ""There are hundreds of people who do this regularly."" The behavior of AlfabetoVirtual, Mr. Gundert said, seemed to be primarily hacktivist activity intended to spread a message, and leaving mostly superficial damage. ""He probably looked at it as a harmless hobby,"" said Mr. Gundert, who now runs a threat intelligence research team at the internet technology company Recorded Future. It was probably the importance of the sites that were targeted and the sheer number of sites that were hit that led prosecutors to proceed with a case, he said. There's a ""ton of potential for real harm"" when someone gains unauthorized access to web servers, said Mr. Gundert, who pointed out that the large-scale Equifax breach last year -- which exposed the personal information of up to 145 million Americans -- began with unauthorized access. ""Organizations generally underestimate the damage that can be done."" PHOTO: The website of the office the New York City comptroller, Scott M.

Trump Shows the World He's Putin's Lackey,"No matter how low your expectations for the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on Monday, it was hard not to be staggered by the American president's slavish and toadying performance. On Friday, the Justice Department indicted 12 members of Russia's military intelligence service for a criminal conspiracy to interfere with the 2016 election and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign. The same day, Trump's director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, gave a speech about America's vulnerability to cyberattacks, particularly from Russia. ""I'm here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again,"" he said, comparing the threat to the one that preceded Sept. 11.  But standing beside Putin in Helsinki on Monday, Trump sided with the Russian president against American intelligence agencies while spewing lies and conspiracy theories. ""He just said it's not Russia,"" he said of Putin's denials. ""I will say this. I don't see any reason why it would be."" Continuing in a free-associative fugue, he asked, ""What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the D.N.C.?"" referring to a debunked right-wing claim about a former Democratic I.T. staffer. ""What happened to Hillary Clinton's emails? Thirty-three thousand emails gone, just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn't be gone so easily."" Perhaps the most sinister part of the news conference was Trump's seeming openness to a deal in which F.B.I. investigators could question people in Russia in exchange for letting Russians question Putin critics in America. Putin referred specifically to associates of his arch-nemesis Bill Browder, a businessman (and British citizen) who has succeeded in getting seven countries, including the United States, to pass laws punishing Russian oligarchs suspected of corruption. (The Russians who met with members of the Trump campaign at Trump Tower in June 2016 wanted to discuss this law, the Magnitsky Act.) ""I've known for a long time that Putin has been trying to use every trick in the book to get me arrested in a foreign country and extradited back to Russia,"" Browder told me after the news conference. It's chilling that Trump appeared willing to help Putin with his vendetta. The news conference left observers reeling. John O. Brennan, a former director of the C.I.A., tweeted that Trump's display was ""nothing short of treasonous."" Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, described it as ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory."" Even some Trump partisans were aghast. Newt Gingrich decried it as the ""most serious mistake"" of Trump's presidency. While I was as shocked as everyone else, I shouldn't have been. Trump's behavior on Monday recalled his outburst at Trump Tower after the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, when he insisted there were ""very fine people"" among the racist demonstrators. Both times, everything Trump said was in keeping with things he'd said before. The shocking part was his frankness. Then, as now, it forced, if just for a moment, a collective apprehension of just what a repulsive abomination this presidency is. It's always been obvious that Trump does not hold Russia's hacking of the 2016 election, which he publicly encouraged and gleefully benefited from, against Putin. None of us yet know the exact contours of Trump's relationship with Russia, whether Putin is his handler, his co-conspirator or just his hero. But it's clear that Trump is willing to sell out American democracy for personal gain. After all, on July 27, 2016, he publicly called for Russia to find Clinton's emails, and, thanks to Friday's indictments, we now know Russia started trying to hack the domain used by her personal office that very day. Trump's collusion with Russia has always been out in the open, daring us to recognize what's in front of our faces. Some doubt that Trump is a Russian puppet precisely because his fealty to Putin is so blatant and undisguised. They should consider the case of Mariia Butina, which broke wide open just hours after the Trump-Putin meeting. Butina, who worked for the Russian politician and alleged organized crime figure Alexander Torshin, presented herself as a Russian gun rights activist, and spent years cultivating links to the National Rifle Association. She became a fixture in some pro-Trump circles and was reportedly especially close to a conservative operative named Paul Erickson. Last year, in a Daily Beast profile, the journalist Tim Mak described Butina as hosting a birthday costume party that was attended by Trump aides. ""She dressed as Russian Empress Alexandra while Erickson was dressed as Rasputin,"" Mak wrote. At the party, Butina reportedly boasted that she'd helped the Trump campaign communicate with Russia. If there was a reason to doubt that she was a Russian spy, it was only that one would expect a Russian spy to be subtler. This weekend, Butina was arrested in Washington, and on Monday a criminal complaint against her for acting as a Russian agent was unsealed. She was accused of conspiracy to ""exploit personal connections with U.S. persons having influence in American politics in an effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation."" There's a useful lesson here in evaluating Trump's behavior. Sometimes things are exactly as bad as they appear. PHOTO: President Trump with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday.

America's Elections Could Be Hacked. Go Vote Anyway.,"Will November's election be hacked? A quick sampling of news stories over the past couple of years offers little comfort.  In the months before the 2016 presidential election, Russian hackers tried to infiltrate voting systems in dozens of states. They succeeded in at least one, gaining access to tens of thousands of voter-registration records in Illinois. In April, the nation's top voting machine manufacturer told Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon that it had installed remote-access software on election-management systems that it sold from 2000 to 2006. Senator Wyden called it ""the worst decision for security short of leaving ballot boxes on a Moscow street corner."" At a hacking convention last summer, an 11-year-old boy who had been coached on finding the vulnerabilities in a mock-up of Florida's state election website broke into the fake site and altered the vote totals recorded there. It took him less than 10 minutes.  All along, the nation's top intelligence and law enforcement officials have been sounding the alarm, warning that Russia is engaged in a ""24/7, 365-days-a-year"" effort to disrupt the upcoming midterm elections and imploring Congress and the White House to take more decisive action. President Trump may not believe that the risk is real, but the American people do. An overwhelmingmajority say they are concerned about election security, and more than 60percent say the Trump administration should be doing more to protect the vote from foreign interference.  Numbers like these suggest that whether or not hackers manage to gain access to voting systems, they have already achieved their main goal, which is to sow pervasive doubt over the integrity of American elections. Whoever wins, this lack of confidence is as damaging to the nation's democracy as it is to its national security. And it drives down turnout at the polls, as voters who are already skeptical of the political process begin to believe not just that their vote won't count, but that it literally won't be counted. Meanwhile, the Russians show no signs of slowing their efforts to disrupt American elections through disinformation campaigns. On Friday, the Justice Department charged a Russian woman working for a close ally of President Vladimir Putin with participating in a plot ""to spread distrust toward candidates for U.S. political office and the U.S. political system."" What to make of it all? First, the bad news. America's voting systems, like all large and complex computerized systems, are highly vulnerable to cyberattack -- whether by altering or deleting voter-registration data, or even by changing vote counts. ""The vast majority of technical infrastructure for our voting is absolutely, without doubt, woefully insecure,"" said Matt Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer-science professor who studies voting machine security. Both of the primary methods by which Americans cast their ballots -- optical-scan machines and touch-screen monitors -- can be tampered with fairly easily. The handful of companies that design and make nearly all of America's voting machines insist that their equipment is cordoned off from bad actors on the internet, but in fact there are multiple ways in for anyone who is motivated, persistent and willing to commit a federal crime. These manufacturers could choose to share information in order to help researchers and experts identify security weaknesses, but instead they have zealously guarded it as proprietary, even when the outcome of a presidential election has been at stake -- as John Kerry found out when his 2004 presidential campaign attempted to look into voting irregularities in Ohio. Our reliance on these newer voting technologies is largely a result of the failures of older ones. In the weeks after the 2000 presidential election, the entire country sat on edge as Florida poll workers painstakingly examined butterfly ballots and hanging chads. Following that disaster, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act, which established a federal agency, the Election Assistance Commission, to serve as a resource and clearinghouse for state election officials. But the commission, which has been a political football since its creation, is perennially understaffed and underfunded. Most of the nearly $4 billion that it initially got from Congress was spent on new electronic machines that were designed without anticipation of the sort of coordinated cyberattacks America now faces. And these machines are now approaching the end of their useful life. Now for some good news. Elections officials have become acutely aware of these risks to America's electoral security, especially after the wake-up call they got in 2016. In a rare example of bipartisanship, Republicans and Democrats are communicating with one another and with their counterparts around the country, sharing information and shoring up defenses where needed. Most encouraging, the key fixes are relatively simple, and everyone agrees on what they are. One, provide a paper trail for every vote. Hackers work most effectively in the dark, so they love voting machines that produce no paper verification. Currently, five states -- Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey and South Carolina -- run their elections entirely on paperless touch-screen machines. But all five states are considering a switch back to paper ballots in time for 2020. In this year's midterms, 19 states and Washington, D.C., will use only paper ballots. Two, audit the vote. The best way to do this is known as a risk-limiting audit, which means comparing the digital tally to a manual count of a randomized sample of paper ballots. This type of audit can identify voting tabulation errors resulting from either malicious attacks or software failures. Three, give states more resources. After dragging its feet for years, Congress in March approved $380 million in grants to states for election security. A little more than a third of the money will be spent on enhancing cybersecurity. A little more than a quarter will go toward buying new voting equipment. The rest will be spent on improving voter-registration systems, running vote audits and communicating better with voters around election time. That money is good, but it's far from enough. And while the states are spending it in the right ways, Congress could help even more by passing the Secure Elections Act, a bipartisan bill that appeared headed toward passage until it got hung up over the summer. What can voters do? For starters, take advantage of early voting if your state offers it. The sooner votes are in, the more time officials have to detect irregularities. ""Every time someone votes early, they're part of the fight against foreign interference,"" said David Becker, who runs the Center for Election Innovation and Research. Most important, don't stay home because you believe that cyberattacks will rig the results of the election. ""It's true that these systems are vulnerable,"" said Mr. Blaze, the voting-security expert. ""It's also true that you should vote on Election Day. The worst outcome would be if people conclude that there's no point in voting."" PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Matt Chase FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) "
Reclaim Your Screen From Scammers; TECH TIP,"Q. My husband periodically receives a warning box telling us to contact Microsoft because of viruses. We cannot close it, so we turn the computer off and wait a few minutes before turning it back on. Local computer gurus have run scans three times and say that we are not infected with a virus. What can we do?   A. The persistent warning boxes sound like they are part of the ongoing blight of ""tech support"" scams that have plagued computer users for years. In some cases, the ""virus alerts"" are merely deviously scripted web pages or advertisements that can take over the screen and make it look like a realistic message to spook you into opening your wallet. This type of ruse may not trigger an antivirus program because it is technically just a pop-up window in your web browser. Some adware programs can also fly under the radar of an antivirus tool, but an anti-malware utility like Malwarebytes or Bitdefender might be able to root out any software squatters on your system. Even if the window is hard to close with a click, you may not have to restart the computer to ditch the message. If pressing the Alt and F4 keys on a PC (or the Mac's Command and Q keys) does not close the program, try force-quitting the browser by pressing the Control, Shift and Escape keys to get to the Windows Task Manager -- or by pressing the Command, Shift, Option and Escape keys on a Mac.

Hackers Exposed a Trump Ally. Now He's After Them.,"Of all the scandals swirling around the Trump White House, the Republican fund-raiser Elliott Broidy is in a category of his own. Documents from the office of the president's personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, revealed that Mr. Broidy had agreed to pay $1.6 million to a former Playboy model to keep her quiet about their affair, which led her to get an abortion. And emails stolen from his account showed he had used his White House access on behalf of the rulers of the United Arab Emirates while landing hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with them for his private defense company.    Mr. Broidy, though, is not going quietly. His lawyers said this week that, after more than 80 subpoenas and months of forensic analysis, they had managed to identify as many as 1,200 other individuals targeted by the same cybercriminals.    The list of names the lawyers compiled, they argue, will bolster Mr. Broidy's case that the rulers of Qatar -- the tiny Persian Gulf emirate that is a nemesis of the U.A.E.-- had targeted him for his advocacy against them.   Many of the other targets are well-known enemies of Qatar: senior officials of the U.A.E. and also of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Syria; American, British and Dutch commentators known for their criticism of Qatar; and two former employees of a Washington public affairs firm with U.A.E. ties.   Others on the list, though, have no obvious appeal as targets for Qatar, including several Syrian Americans, activists on multiple sides of the Syrian conflict, a former official of the Central Intelligence Agency and, incongruously, a handful of Bollywood actresses.   The list of targets was collected in the course of  lawsuits that Mr. Broidy filed this year, accusing Qatar and several individuals of conspiring in the cyberattack against him. A federal judge in California last month dismissed the claim against Qatar on the grounds of sovereign immunity. But Mr. Broidy's lawyers are still pursuing claims against the individual defendants, and the lawyers argue that their initial success at building at least a circumstantial case demonstrates the potential effectiveness of such litigation against even state-sponsored hackers.   Their litigation also offers the latest glimpse into an escalating cyberwar among Persian Gulf royals, some of whom have evidently turned to various forms of spying by high-priced international hackers to embarrass one another. Two lawsuits filed this month, in Israel and Cyprus, revealed that the rulers of the U.A.E. had paid an Israeli firm to hack the smartphones of several senior Qatari officials and royals, including the emir.   Before the scandals, Mr. Broidy served as vice chairman of the Republican finance committee and enjoyed extensive access to President Trump and his White House.   Mr. Broidy, his wife, and some other associates all received similar phishing emails trying to trick recipients into clicking a link to a bogus website and typing a password.   The links to the bogus websites always were presented in compressed shorthand, provided by the online service TinyURL and presumably used to mask details of the addresses that might reveal the ruse. So Mr. Broidy's lawyers sent a subpoena to TinyURL asking what other shortened web links the service had provided to the same user over the previous year.   The response was 11,000 pages of ''gibberish,'' said Lee Wolosky, a lawyer for Mr. Broidy, so ''we knew we were dealing with a serious player.''   Those 11,000 pages contained computer code setting up thousands of bogus web pages intended to trap at least 1,200 targets, and the code for each web page contained the email address of its intended victim. Although it was unclear which targets fell for the trick, the hackers sent repeated emails to those who did not.   Lawyers for Mr. Broidy argued in court filings that the hackers who had stolen his emails almost always hid their location, but at one point they appeared briefly to have operated from a telecommunications network in Qatar. The government of Qatar has said it was not responsible.   Jassim Bin Mansour Al-Thani, media attaché for the Qatar Embassy in Washington, said Thursday in a statement that the assertions of Mr. Broidy's lawyers were ''weak supposition and conjecture.''   Now the new list of targets that the lawyers say they have identified adds other suggestive details to the claim.   At least 19 of the hackers' targets were senior officials or prominent citizens of the U.A.E., including diplomats whose emails have previously been leaked to the public.   At least 15 of the targets are senior officials or diplomats from Egypt, a close ally of the U.A.E. and a foe of Qatar. Among the Egyptian targets was Gen. Abbas Kamel, now the director of the Egyptian Intelligence Service and previously the chief of staff to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Several embarrassing audio recordings from Mr. Kamel's office have leaked through Islamist media, leading to speculation about spying by some foreign government sympathetic to Islamists -- possibly Qatar.   At least two of the targets were American former employees of the Glover Park Group, a Washington public affairs firm that has worked for the U.A.E.   Several other targets were outspoken critics of Qatar, including the American Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, the British-based commentator Amjad Taha Yassin and the former Dutch intelligence analyst Ronald Sandee.   Others, however, were not obvious antagonists of Qatar. Another, Kristin Wood, is a former official of the C.I.A. who is now an adviser to a private security company that is part of DynCorp, which had worked for the U.A.E. But there is no indication she was involved in that work or any other project that might have drawn Qatar's interest. It is possible that hackers were hired to carry out many attacks for multiple clients.   The Bollywood targets -- including the stars Aishwarya Devan, Anushka Sharma, Meghanna Raj and Nikki Galrani -- suggest the hackers may have been fans, the lawyers said. ''My guess is this was a frolic of the hackers,'' Mr. Wolosky said.   In his opinion dismissing Mr. Broidy's claim against Qatar, Judge John F. Walker of the district court for central California noted ''the growing prevalence of attacks in cyberspace'' and suggested that ''it may be an appropriate time for Congress to consider a cyberattack exception'' to sovereign immunity. North Korea and Russia also have been accused of conducting such attacks on American citizens.   Whatever the outcome in the courts, Mr. Wolosky argued, ''we have evidence that establishes in the court of public opinion what really happened.''    "
"New Russian Hacking Targeted Republican Groups, Microsoft Says","BOSTON -- The Russian military intelligence unit that sought to influence the 2016 election appears to have a new target: conservative American think tanks that have broken with President Trump and are seeking continued sanctions against Moscow, exposing oligarchs or pressing for human rights. In a report scheduled for release on Tuesday, Microsoft Corporation said that it detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials. Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific Senate offices or political campaigns. The shift to attacking conservative think tanks underscores the Russian intelligence agency's goals: to disrupt any institutions challenging Moscow and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.  The Hudson Institute has promoted programs examining the rise of kleptocracy in governments around the world, with Russia as a prime target. The International Republican Institute, which receives some funding from the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, has worked for decades in promoting democracy around the world. ""We are now seeing another uptick in attacks. What is particular in this instance is the broadening of the type of websites they are going after,"" Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, said Monday in an interview. ""These are organizations that are informally tied to Republicans,"" he said, ""so we see them broadening beyond the sites they have targeted in the past."" The International Republican Institute's board of directors includes several Republican leaders who have been highly critical of Mr. Trump's interactions with Mr. Putin, including a summit meeting last month between the two leaders in Helsinki, Finland. Among them are Senator John McCain of Arizona; Mitt Romney, a former presidential candidate; and -- though he was silent on Mr. Trump's appearance in Helsinki -- Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who was replaced in the spring as the White House national security adviser. General McMaster, who is now retired, had been the author of the national security strategy that called for treating Russia as a ""revisionist power"" and confronting it around the world. ""This is another demonstration of the fact that the Russians aren't really pursuing partisan attacks, they are pursuing attacks that they perceive in their own national self-interest,"" said Eric Rosenbach, the director of the Defending Digital Democracy project at Harvard University, on Monday. ""It's about disrupting and diminishing any group that challenges how Putin's Russia is operating at home and around the world."" The State Department has traditionally helped fund both Republican and Democratic groups that engage in promoting democracy. Daniel Twining, the president of the International Republican Institute, called the apparent ""spear phishing"" attempt ""consistent with the campaign of meddling that the Kremlin has waged against organizations that support democracy and human rights."" ""It is clearly designed to sow confusion, conflict and fear among those who criticize Mr. Putin's authoritarian regime,"" Mr. Twining said in a statement. The goal of the Russian hacking attempt was unclear, and Microsoft was able to catch the spoofed websites as they were set up. But Mr. Smith said that ""these attempts are the newest security threats to groups connected with both American political parties"" ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. ""These attacks are seeking to disrupt and divide,"" he said. ""There is an asymmetric risk here for democratic societies. The kind of attacks we see from authoritarian regimes are seeking to fracture and splinter groups in our society."" On Sunday, the current national security adviser, John R. Bolton, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the fall elections. He also named China, Iran and North Korea -- the other most active cyberoperators among state adversaries -- as threats. But so far Microsoft and other firms have not found extensive election-related actions by those nations. Senior United States intelligence officials have also warned that the midterm elections will be targeted by foreign governments looking to influence American voters. Speaking last month at the Aspen Security Forum, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said that his agency was seeing information operations ""aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in the country."" Only days later, in a report first released to members of Congress, Facebook revealed that it had discovered and eliminated an influence operation aimed at fueling divisions among Americans by targeting progressive groups. Facebook stopped short of naming Russia as the culprit of that campaign, although the social media company pointed to similarities between the influence operation and previous work by the Russian state-linked Internet Research Agency. The attempt revealed by Microsoft mirrored efforts by Russian state-backed hackers before the 2016 presidential election. After the 2016 vote, a number of cybersecurity companies discovered websites that had been created by Russian hackers to spoof, or mimic, those of well-known institutions. Among the think tanks targeted were the Council on Foreign Relations and the Eurasia Group, both based in New York; the Center for a New American Security in Washington; Transparency International in Berlin; and the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. A single letter, or even a punctuation mark, was often the only difference between the real and fake websites. The fake websites were used as the conduit for a number of attacks, including persuading victims to download harmful malware or to reveal passwords and other personal information. But for the past year, Microsoft has grown increasingly aggressive in countering them. In 2016, a federal judge in Virginia agreed that the group Microsoft calls ""Strontium"" and others call ""APT 28,"" for ""advanced persistent threat,"" would continue its attacks. The judge appointed a ""special master"" with the power to authorize Microsoft to seize fake websites as soon as they are registered. As a result, the hackers have lost control of many of the sites only days after creating them. But it is a constant cat-and-mouse game, as the Russian hackers seek new vectors of attack while Microsoft and others seek to cut them off. ""These attacks keep happening because they work. They are successful again and again,"" said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, who doubts whether anyone can stay ahead of the hackers. ""Microsoft is playing whack-a-mole here,"" Mr. Rid said. ""These sites are easy to register and bring back up, and so they will keep doing so."" Last month, Microsoft announced that it had detected and helped block similar attacks against two senators who are up for re-election. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who faces one of the toughest political challenges this year, acknowledged that her campaign was among them after months of keeping the news quiet -- apparently to avoid alienating voters who doubt the Russian role in election interference. Microsoft says it is expanding its effort to help political candidates counter foreign influence. It is starting an initiative it calls ""AccountGuard"" to bolster protections to candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations. With the midterms less than three months away, Microsoft said greater cooperation was needed between tech companies and the federal government over efforts to interfere in the American elections. ""Over the last year, the larger tech companies, in particular, have put into place stronger information-sharing practices where we have seen these threats emerge,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Those agreements, however, are informal."" David E. Sanger reported from Boston, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.

Marriott Data Breach Is Traced to Chinese Hackers as U.S. Readies Crackdown on Beijing,"WASHINGTON -- The cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain that collected personal details of roughly 500 million guests was part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort that also hacked health insurers and the security clearance files of millions more Americans, according to two people briefed on the investigation. The hackers, they said, are suspected of working on behalf of the Ministry of State Security, the country's Communist-controlled civilian spy agency. The discovery comes as the Trump administration is planning actions targeting China's trade, cyber and economic policies, perhaps within days. Those moves include indictments against Chinese hackers working for the intelligence services and the military, according to four government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration also plans to declassify intelligence reports to reveal Chinese efforts dating to at least 2014 to build a database containing names of executives and American government officials with security clearances. Other options include an executive order intended to make it harder for Chinese companies to obtain critical components for telecommunications equipment, a senior American official with knowledge of the plans said.  The moves stem from a growing concern within the administration that the 90-day trade truce negotiated two weeks ago by President Trump and President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires might do little to change China's behavior -- including the coercion of American companies to hand over valuable technology if they seek to enter the Chinese market, as well as the theft of industrial secrets on behalf of state-owned companies. The hacking of Marriott's Starwood chain, which was discovered only in September and revealed late last month, is not expected to be part of the coming indictments. But two of the government officials said that it has added urgency to the administration's crackdown, given that Marriott is the top hotel provider for American government and military personnel. It also is a prime example of what has vexed the Trump administration as China has reverted over the past 18 months to the kind of intrusions into American companies and government agencies that President Barack Obama thought he had ended in 2015 in an agreement with Mr. Xi. Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied any knowledge of the Marriott hacking. ""China firmly opposes all forms of cyberattack and cracks down on it in accordance with the law,"" he said. ""If offered evidence, the relevant Chinese departments will carry out investigations according to the law."" Trade negotiators on both sides of the Pacific have been working on an agreement under which China would commit to purchasing $1.2 trillion more of American goods and services over the next several years, and would address intellectual property concerns. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the United States and China were having ""very productive conversations"" as top American and Chinese officials held their first talks via telephone since the two countries agreed to a truce on Dec. 1. But while top administration officials insist that the trade talks are proceeding on a separate track, the broader crackdown on China could undermine Mr. Trump's ability to reach an agreement with Mr. Xi. American charges against senior members of China's intelligence services risk hardening opposition in Beijing to negotiations with Mr. Trump. Another obstacle is the targeting of high-profile technology executives, like Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the communications giant Huawei and daughter of its founder. The arrest of Ms. Meng, who has been detained in Canada on suspicion of fraud involving violations of United States sanctions against Iran, has angered China. She was granted bail of 10 million Canadian dollars, or $7.5 million, while awaiting extradition to the United States, a Canadian judge ruled on Tuesday. Mr. Trump, in an interview on Tuesday with Reuters, said that he would consider intervening in the Huawei case if it would help serve national security and help get a trade deal done with China. Such a move would essentially pit Mr. Trump against his own Justice Department, which coordinated with Canada to arrest Ms. Meng as she changed planes in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Mr. Trump said. American business leaders have been bracing for retaliation from China, which has demanded the immediate release of Ms. Meng and accused both the United States and Canada of violating her rights. On Tuesday, the International Crisis Group said that one of its employees, a former Canadian diplomat, had been detained in China. The disappearance of the former diplomat, Michael Kovrig, could further inflame tensions between China and Canada. ""We are doing everything possible to secure additional information on Michael's whereabouts, as well as his prompt and safe release,"" the group said in a statement on its website. From the first revelation that the Marriott chain's computer systems had been breached, there was widespread suspicion in both Washington and among cybersecurity firms that the hacking was not a matter of commercial espionage, but part of a much broader spy campaign to amass Americans' personal data. While American intelligence agencies have not reached a final assessment of who performed the hacking, a range of firms brought in to assess the damage quickly saw computer code and patterns familiar to operations by Chinese actors. The Marriott database contains not only credit card information but passport data. Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser under Mr. Obama, noted last week at a conference that passport information would be particularly valuable in tracking who is crossing borders and what they look like, among other key data. But officials on Tuesday said it was only part of an aggressive operation whose centerpiece was the 2014 hacking into the Office of Personnel Management. At the time, the government bureau loosely guarded the detailed forms that Americans fill out to get security clearances -- forms that contain financial data; information about spouses, children and past romantic relationships; and any meetings with foreigners. Such information is exactly what the Chinese use to root out spies, recruit intelligence agents and build a rich repository of Americans' personal data for future targeting. With those details and more that were stolen from insurers like Anthem, the Marriott data adds another critical element to the intelligence profile: travel habits. James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, said the Chinese have collected ""huge pots of data"" to feed a Ministry of State Security database seeking to identify American spies -- and the Chinese people talking to them. ""Big data is the new wave for counterintelligence,"" Mr. Lewis said. ""It's big-data hoovering,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chief technology officer at CrowdStrike, who first highlighted Chinese hacking as a threat researcher in 2011. ""This data is all going back to a data lake that can be used for counterintelligence, recruiting new assets, anticorruption campaigns or future targeting of individuals or organizations."" In the Marriott case, Chinese spies stole passport numbers for up to 327 million people -- many of whom stayed at Sheraton, Westin and W hotels and at other Starwood-branded properties. But Marriott has not said if it would pay to replace those passports, an undertaking that would cost tens of billions of dollars. Instead, Connie Kim, a Marriott spokeswoman, said the hotel chain would cover the cost of replacement if ""fraud has taken place."" That means the company would not cover the cost of having exposed private data to the Chinese intelligence agencies if they did not use it to conduct commercial transactions -- even though that is a breach of privacy and, perhaps, security. And even for those guests who did not have passport information on file with the hotels, their phone numbers, birth dates and itineraries remain vulnerable. That data, Mr. Lewis and others said, can be used to track which Chinese citizens visited the same city, or hotel, as an American intelligence agent who was identified in data taken from the Office of Personnel Management or from American health insurers that document patients' medical histories and Social Security numbers. The effort to amass Americans' personal information so alarmed government officials that in 2016, the Obama administration threatened to block a $14 billion bid by China's Anbang Insurance Group Co. to acquire Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide, according to one former official familiar with the work of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, a secretive government body that reviews foreign acquisitions. Ultimately, the failed bid cleared the way later that year for Marriott Hotels to acquire Starwood for $13.6 billion, becoming the world's largest hotel chain. As it turned out, it was too late: Starwood's data had already been stolen by Chinese state hackers, though the breach was not discovered until this past summer, and was disclosed by Marriott on Nov. 30. It is unclear that any kind of trade agreement reached with China by the Trump administration can address this kind of theft. The Chinese regard intrusions into hotel chain databases as a standard kind of espionage. So does the United States, which has often seized guest data from foreign hotels. Even the Office of Personnel Management hacking was viewed by American intelligence officials with some admiration. ""If we had the opportunity to do the same thing, we'd probably do it,"" James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, told Congress afterward. ""One thing is very clear to me, and it is that they are not going to stop this,"" Mr. Alperovitch said. ""This is what any nation-state intelligence agency would do. No nation-state is going to handcuff themselves and say, 'You can't do this,' because they all engage in similar detection."" Since 2012, analysts at the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the GCHQ, have watched with growing alarm as sophisticated Chinese hackers, based in Tianjin, began switching targets from companies and government agencies in the defense, energy and aerospace sectors to organizations that housed troves of Americans' personal information. At the time, one classified National Security Agency report noted that the hackers' ""exact affiliation with Chinese government entities is not known, but their activities indicate a probable intelligence requirement feed"" from China's Ministry of State Security.

2 Big Flaws Discovered In Nearly All Computers,"Follow Cade Metz and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter: @CadeMetz and @nicoleperloth SAN FRANCISCO -- Computer security experts have discovered two major security flaws in the microprocessors inside nearly all of the world's computers. The two problems, called Meltdown and Spectre, could allow hackers to steal the entire memory contents of computers, including mobile devices, personal computers, servers running in so-called cloud computer networks.    There is no easy fix for Spectre, which could require redesigning the processors, according to researchers. As for Meltdown, the software patch needed to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent -- an ugly situation for people used to fast downloads from their favorite online services.   ''What actually happens with these flaws is different and what you do about them is different,'' said Paul Kocher, a researcher who was an integral member of a team of researchers at big tech companies like Google and Rambus and in academia that discovered the flaws.    Meltdown is a particular problem for the cloud computing services run by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft. By Wednesday evening, Google and Microsoft said they had updated their systems to deal with the flaw.   Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability ''has existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures.'' It said that it had already protected nearly all instances of A.W.S. and that customers must update their own software running atop the service as well.   To take advantage of Meltdown, hackers could rent space on a cloud service, just like any other business customer. Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.   That is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers -- and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers' data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.   The personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine. There are various ways that could happen: Attackers could fool consumers into downloading software in an email, from an app store or visiting an infected website.   According to the researchers, the Meltdown flaw affects virtually every microprocessor made by Intel, which makes chips used in more than 90 percent of the computer servers that underpin the internet and private business operations.   Customers of Microsoft, the maker of the Windows operating system, will need to install an update from the company to fix the problem. The worldwide community of coders that oversees the open-source Linux operating system, which runs about 30 percent of computer servers worldwide, has already posted a patch for that operating system. Apple had a partial fix for the problem and is expected to have an additional update.   The software patches could slow the performance of affected machines by 20 to 30 percent, said Andres Freund, an independent software developer who has tested the new Linux code. The researchers who discovered the flaws voiced similar concerns.   This could become a significant issue for any business running websites and other software through cloud systems.   There is no evidence that hackers have taken advantage of the vulnerability -- at least not yet. But once a security problem becomes public, computer users take a big risk if they do not install a patch to fix the issue. A so-called ransomware attack that hit computers around the world last year took advantage of machines that had not received a patch for a flaw in Windows software.   The other flaw, Spectre, affects most processors now in use, though the researchers believe this flaw is more difficult to exploit. There is no known fix for it, and it is not clear what chip makers like Intel will do to address the problem.   It is not certain what the disclosure of the chip issues will do to Intel's business, and on Wednesday, the Silicon Valley giant played down the problem.   ''Intel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed,'' the company said in a statement. ''Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.''   The researchers who discovered the flaws notified various affected companies. And as is common practice when such problems are identified, they tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.   But on Tuesday, news of the Meltdown flaw began to leak through various news websites, including The Register, a science and technology site based in Britain. So the researchers released papers describing the flaws on Wednesday, much earlier than they had planned.   For now, computer security experts are using a patch, called Kaiser, that was originally discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria to respond to a separate issue last year.   Spectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.   The Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel's design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.   Spectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is ''going to live with us for decades,'' said Mr. Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.   ''Whereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,'' Mr. Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.   ''We've really screwed up,'' Mr. Kocher said. ''There's been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.''   The Meltdown flaw was discovered by Jann Horn, a security analyst at a Google-run security research group called Google Project Zero, last June. Mr. Horn was the first to alert Intel. The chip giant then heard from other researchers who had also discovered the flaw, including Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher, at Cyberus Technology; and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz at the Graz University of Technology.   The researchers had been working through the Christmas holiday on a patch, and coordinating with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to roll out the fix.   The second flaw, Spectre, was also discovered by Mr. Horn at Google and separately by Mr. Kocher, in coordination with Mike Hamburg at Rambus, Mr. Lipp at Graz University and Yuval Yarom at the University of Adelaide in Australia.   A fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.   ''This will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It's not going to change tomorrow or the day after,'' Mr. Kocher said. ''It's going to take a while.''    "

Following the Tentacles of Guccifer 2.0 to Russia,"The message from WikiLeaks in July 2016 to a group of Russian intelligence officers who prosecutors say were posing as a Romanian hacker named Guccifer 2.0 urged swift action before the opening of the Democratic National Convention that month. ''If you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo days prefable because the DNC is approaching,'' the error-ridden message read. ''and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after.''    WikiLeaks had begun seeking stolen files from Guccifer 2.0 weeks earlier, after revelations that the Democratic National Committee's server had been hacked, according to private messages cited in an indictment filed Friday by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The organization had told Guccifer that publishing the stolen material on the WikiLeaks site will ''have a much higher impact than what you are doing.''   But WikiLeaks' administrators, including Julian Assange, its founder, did not know what was in the trove -- they were simply seeking anything that would widen the divisions inside the party between supporters of Hillary Clinton and those of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who had also sought the nomination.    The exchange offers a new look at the central role of Guccifer 2.0, the digital persona alleged to have been set up by Russian military intelligence, which passed the stolen Democratic documents and misinformation to WikiLeaks and some Americans, who then spread it through social media and news organizations.   The indictment provides never-before-seen detail of how the Russian cyberspies operated, based on intercepts that had to have come from American, British or Dutch intelligence, interviews in recent months show. All three eventually got into the Russian networks, but it was the British who had first warned the National Security Agency that they were seeing the D.N.C.'s messages running through communications lines controlled by the Russian military intelligence service, called the G.R.U.   When Guccifer 2.0 appeared, many experts suspected it was an avatar for members of an elite military cyberunit operating from Moscow. The indictment documented the evidence against 12 Russian officials, mostly military officers, who were charged with conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election.   Those charges loom over President Trump's meeting on Monday with Vladimir V. Putin, who American intelligence officials say launched and oversaw the operation to interfere in the election. A year ago, when the men met for the first time, the Russian leader insisted that Russia had nothing to do with the attacks, telling Mr. Trump, as he later related to a reporter, ''If we did, we wouldn't have gotten caught, because we're professionals.''   Mr. Trump said, ''I thought that was a good point because they are some of the best in the world.'' Now, he meets Mr. Putin again just after prosecutors issued an unusually detailed account of the Russian military officers' role in the hacks.   The effort by the team that posed as Guccifer to disseminate the fruits of the audacious cyberattack shows how aggressively the Russian operatives worked in 2016 to interfere with the presidential election. They showed dexterity in navigating their way through the national political debate and an increasingly sophisticated understanding of American electoral politics.   In addition to WikiLeaks, the Russians made contact with Americans who held sway both in Republican circles and with Mr. Trump, the indictment says. It does not assert that the Americans knew that Guccifer 2.0 was a creation of Russian spies.   Those figures included Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime Trump friend who exchanged messages with Guccifer during the campaign but said in an interview on Saturday that he did not believe at the time that Russian state actors were behind it. ''I originally thought he was a Romanian hacker because that's what he claimed to be,'' Mr. Stone said.   There was Lee Stranahan, who is now a co-host of ''Fault Lines'' on the Russian-owned Sputnik radio network but back then was at Breitbart News, whose chief during that period, Stephen K. Bannon, joined Mr. Trump's campaign that August.   The indictment mentions that Guccifer 2.0 had sent some documents to a lobbyist in Florida, which had been previously reported. But it also reveals that a congressional candidate whom it did not name connected with the operatives, looking for stolen documents about a political opponent, which were then sent.   Using Guccifer 2.0 as their main means of communication, the Russian agents had regular contact with both conservative and mainstream journalists, the indictment said. In one case, it said, the Russians gave an unidentified reporter a password to view documents. The Smoking Gun said in a Twitter message that it was the ''reporter'' in the reference. In another case, according to the indictment, the Russians conferred with a writer about the timing of one planned leak; Mr. Stranahan announced on Twitter that he was the writer, then at Breitbart.   Suspicions that Guccifer 2.0 was of Russian provenance surfaced from the moment it was created. The avatar brazenly engaged on questions about its origins and its work with journalists at BuzzFeed, Vice and The Wall Street Journal, telling The Journal in September 2016 that the accusation ''made me angry.'' Nonetheless, the suspicions never seemed to have interfered with its mission.   The G.R.U. was no newcomer to attacks in the United States: It had been central to previous thefts of emails from the unclassified systems at the State Department, the White House and, later, the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   ''Anybody who was sophisticated about Russian behavior immediately spotted what this was -- it was not like you needed forensic data or any real insight,'' said Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former staff member of the National Security Council.   The indictment fills in several critical gaps in the sequence of events that unfolded after the electronic break-in at the D.N.C. and its partner group, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which helps elect House Democrats.   Top D.N.C. executives, emails previously obtained by The New York Times show, knew by April 19, 2016, that the D.N.C. system had been compromised. The committee's lawyers that day discussed plans to meet with senior staff members who were aware of the hack, some of whom had already alerted the F.B.I.   But just three days later -- as the D.N.C. was scrambling to try to contain the attack -- the conspirators procured gigabytes of data, including so-called opposition research, the indictment said. That suggests that the worst of the hack occurred even after the committee knew that its systems had been breached.   Guccifer 2.0 made its first public appearance two months later, on June 15, just days after the last Republican primaries. On its newly created website, the Guccifer persona announced it was releasing ''just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into DNC's network.'' The new blog post included the Democratic Party's secret research dossier on Mr. Trump.   The name Guccifer 2.0 echoed that used by the Romanian hacker Marcel-Lehel Lazar, who, under the original Guccifer handle in 2013, hacked and then released emails from the Bush family, Colin Powell and Sidney Blumenthal, an informal adviser to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lazar, who is now in prison, said he came up with his handle by combining the words ''Gucci'' and ''Lucifer.''   Five days after the first Guccifer 2.0 blog post, the military unit believed to be behind it sent out its first message under its connected Twitter account: ''Hi! I'm on Twitter now! this is my official account!''   By June 22, Guccifer was encouraging anyone to communicate directly with its hacker avatar -- and, as the indictment shows, it immediately drew in a host of Americans with influence in the media and Republican politics.   Some of the cache was particularly valuable because it included reports that the Democrats had compiled on vulnerabilities involving their own candidates -- a due-diligence check to bolster their defenses -- and never intended to make public.   In mid-August, the indictment noted, Guccifer 2.0 received a request for stolen documents from a candidate for Congress. The Russian intelligence operatives, it said, responded by sending the information about the candidate's rival.   Stolen material from Democrats related to their House candidates from 2016 was passed out in states including Florida, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico and North Carolina.   In one case, a Republican lobbyist from Florida reached out to Guccifer, according to Aug. 22, 2016, text messages previously obtained by The Times. The lobbyist, Aaron Nevins, runs a website called HelloFLA! and was preparing to post some of the stolen documents.   In a later exchange, Mr. Nevins, who uses the pen name Mark Miewurd, wrote: ''Let's do an interview.''   ''I'm not sure anyone has written about your motivation,'' he wrote, before adding that ''the democrats say you are a russian operative, what do you say to that?'' He got no specific response, according to messages he shared with The Times.   The same day in mid-August that Mr. Nevins received material from Guccifer 2.0, he started to post it to his blog, boasting that he had exclusive access to once-confidential Democratic Party voter turnout models and weakness assessments of the party's Florida candidates.   Guccifer 2.0's Twitter account in September 2016 forwarded one of Mr. Nevins's blog posts detailing the Florida voter turnout modeling to someone the indictment called ''a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.'' In a direct message, the Guccifer account wrote: ''What do you think of the info on the turnout model for the democrats entire presidential campaign.''   That person was Mr. Stone, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump and a prominent Republican operative who has long reveled in being called a ''dirty trickster.'' After receiving the message about the turnout model, Mr. Stone wrote back that he was unimpressed: ''pretty standard.''   Mr. Stone was in contact with Guccifer 2.0 as of at least mid-August 2016, when he sent a direct message on Twitter congratulating it on overcoming a temporary suspension. (A Twitter spokesman said Saturday it had now shut the account down.)   ''Thank you for writing back,'' Guccifer 2.0 wrote to Mr. Stone. ''Do you find anyting interesting in the docs i posted?'' The exchange, which Mr. Stone had publicly shared in March 2017, showed that he then asked Guccifer to retweet an article he had written for The Hill titled ''How the Election Can Be Rigged Against Donald Trump,'' a request Guccifer said it fulfilled.   Justice Department officials said Friday that they were not alleging that Mr. Stone knew he was communicating with Russian intelligence officers.   Mr. Stone said on Saturday that he eventually concluded that the D.N.C. had not been hacked and that its emails had been stolen by an insider -- something Guccifer 2.0 alleged in pointing to conspiracy theories that the hack involved a murdered Democratic National Committee staff member.   Mr. Stone described his interactions with Guccifer as ''pretty innocuous,'' noting that after the account ''sent me some voter model which evidently they sent to a number of people, I looked at it and said 'pretty standard stuff' and didn't pass it on to anybody.''   The avatar was particularly complimentary to Mr. Stone, telling him at one point, ''Please tell me if i can help u anyway ... it would be a great pleasure to me.''   That was in keeping with the chummy and sometimes self-deprecating personality that the Russian military operatives gave Guccifer 2.0 as they sought, according to prosecutors, to use it to build relationships with Americans.   ''Hi man, how's life,'' it said by way of introduction in a direct message to Mr. Stranahan. (Mr. Stranahan said in a video message over the weekend that he did not know of ties between Guccifer and Russian intelligence and is not convinced even now.)   The Daily Caller reported in late 2016 that after one Guccifer 2.0 lead did not live up to its initial billing, the purported Romanian hacker acknowledged in a direct Twitter message to the site that ''he lacked the best news judgment and it was up to journalists to find the stories in his leaks.''    "
Chinese Intelligence Officers Are Accused of Stealing Aerospace Secrets,"WASHINGTON -- Intelligence officers in a small office in China's vast intelligence-gathering network for years stole secrets from aerospace companies in the United States and abroad, Justice Department officials said on Tuesday in unsealing the third indictment in recent weeks that detailed China's elaborate efforts to steal corporate secrets through espionage and hacking. Two Chinese intelligence officers and five hackers repeatedly broke into corporate computer systems to steal intellectual property and other information about the aerospace industry, according to the indictment, which had been under seal since June.     From January 2010 to May 2015, they stole turbofan engine plans and other confidential business information from 13 companies, according to court documents. They included Capstone Turbine, a gas turbine manufacturer based in Los Angeles, and other unnamed companies in Los Angeles and San Diego as well as Massachusetts, Arizona, Oregon and Wisconsin and overseas in Britain, France and Australia.   At the time, a Chinese government-owned aerospace company was developing a comparable commercial aircraft engine, the government said.   The officers worked in the Jiangsu Province office of the Ministry of State Security, China's primary domestic and foreign intelligence-gathering agency. That office was also at the heart of the two other recent cases involving China's efforts to steal information from the American aerospace industry.   China has long pilfered American corporate, academic and military information to bolster its position in the global economy, and the three cases show the Justice Department's continued crackdown on China's efforts to steal corporate data for China's commercial gain, Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement.   ''The concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy and shareholder money into the development of products,'' he said.   This month, Yanjun Xu, a deputy division director in the office, was charged with  trying to steal secrets from GE Aviation. Mr. Xu was arrested in Belgium in April, about a year after he began grooming a GE employee to obtain and deliver corporate secrets, prosecutors said. The case was the first time a Chinese intelligence official was extradited to the United States to be tried in federal court.   In September, the department arrested Ji Chaoqun, a United States Army reservist from China, on charges that he secretly provided information about aerospace industry employees after meeting Chinese intelligence officers from the Jiangsu office in 2013. One of those officers, who was arrested in April, was Mr. Xu, according to an American official briefed on the investigation.   The information Mr. Ji provided would have been used in the Chinese government's efforts to recruit those employees as informants, the Justice Department said.   The indictment unveiled on Tuesday accused the two intelligence officers, Zha Rong and Chai Meng, and other co-conspirators in the Jiangsu office of working with hackers to steal turbofan technology used in American and European commercial airliners. They also accused them of working with two employees in a Jiangsu Province office of the unnamed French aerospace manufacturer, Gu Gen and Tian Xi, who had been recruited to act as spies by the Chinese intelligence officers. They were also charged.   An unidentified American company and the French manufacturer oversaw the turbofan engine project, according to court papers.   The hackers -- Zhang Zhang-Gui, Liu Chunliang, Gao Hong Kun, Zhuang Xiaowei and Ma Zhiqi -- also infiltrated other companies that made turbofan jet engine parts, prosecutors said, and leased a global network of servers to hide their movements.   The hackers sent spearphishing emails to company employees and planted malware into corporate computer networks, according to the indictment. They also turned their corporate websites into malicious sites that would compromise the computers of anyone who visited them, law enforcement officials said.   From November 2013 to February 2014, they also groomed Mr. Tian and Mr. Gu, employees in the French aerospace company's China office, to work with Chinese intelligence officers, according to the indictment.   Mr. Tian planted malicious software into his employer's computer systems for the Chinese intelligence officials, according to court documents.   Mr. Gu, his office's head of information technology and security, told Chinese intelligence officers that law enforcement officials had noticed the presence of malware in the company's systems, prosecutors said. The warning allowed the conspirators to try to hide their identities.   Mr. Zhang was also charged in a separate case claiming that he and another Chinese citizen used some of the stolen information for their own criminal scheme. The Justice Department intends to bring more such corporate theft cases, said John C. Demers, the head of the National Security Division at the agency.   Follow Katie Benner on Twitter: @ktbenner.

Seeking an elusive cure for cyberattacks,"David E. Sanger is national security correspondent for The New York Times. His forthcoming book is ''The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage and Fear in the Cyber Age.'' WASHINGTON -- When the ''Wannacry'' ransomware attack spread across Britain, Japan Russia, Taiwan and places in between last May, it took only a few days for private firms that looked at the code to come to some pretty quick conclusions. The attack almost certainly came from North Korea. The North Koreans almost certainly used computer code that had leaked from the inner sanctum of the National Security Agency. And the ransomware part was a scam: If you paid off the hackers, your data still wasn't restored. Yet it took until October for the British government to identify North Korea as the culprit in an attack that paralyzed its health care system for a few days, and until mid-December for the Trump administration, in a presentation at the White House, to reach that same conclusion.    So what was the penalty for the government in Pyongyang for unleashing a devastating cyberattack? There was none. Nothing. Not even the kind of weak economic sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on the North three years before for its attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.    ''President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea, to change their behavior,'' Mr. Trump's Homeland Security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, said when he made the ''name and shame'' announcement blaming the North. ''So we don't have a lot of room left here to apply pressure.''   Securing the world against cyberattacks -- from nations, criminal groups, vandals and teenagers -- will be on the agenda when many of the world's top leaders gather at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. As usual, there is a flurry of reports, and entrepreneurs will declare they have technological solutions at hand. But the fact remains that the major powers of the world have been unable to come up with a viable means of deterring the most damaging attacks. It still takes too long to formally identify the culprits, and the responses, as Mr. Bossert indicated, are insufficient.   Efforts to establish ''norms of behavior'' got a promising start, but are now falling apart. No one can even agree on when an act of aggression in cyberspace amounts to an act of war. The Pentagon, in its first nuclear strategy review since President Trump took office, is even proposing to use the threat of unleashing nuclear weapons against a country or group that delivered a devastating cyberattack against the critical infrastructure of the United States or its allies. But that doesn't help with the problem of everyday attacks.   The most talented state sponsors of attacks -- mostly Russia, China, Iran and North Korea -- have carefully calibrated their operations in cyberspace to achieve their strategic aims while avoiding a real shooting war. So far they have succeeded. While there have been indictments of Iranian and Chinese hackers in major strikes on the United States, they have never seen the inside of an American courtroom.   North Korea has been a case study in how a nation learns to make use of its cyberweapons for disruption, revenge or profit, without fear of serious retaliation. It has learned how to station hackers around the world -- in China, Malaysia, Thailand and elsewhere -- and has gotten away with bolder and bolder attacks, from Wannacry to its raid on Bangladesh's central bank, which nearly resulted in the theft of a billion dollars. (The transfers were halted after $81 million had passed through the Swift system, the international clearinghouse for transactions, after someone at the New York Fed discovered a spelling error -- the word ''fandation'' for ''foundation'' -- and stopped the heist. )   As James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies put it recently, ''North Korea is both cautious and cunning in its use of force, including cyberattack.'' But he added: ''The North has been successful only against poorly protected targets, of which there are many, suggesting that there is a relatively low ceiling for its cyberattack capabilities.''   In fact, the explosion of state-sponsored, sophisticated cyberattacks over the past seven or eight years has been fueled, in large part, by the expansion of poorly protected targets. Yes, banks and major utilities have, for the large part, tightened their defenses, and tens of billions of dollars have been made by companies promising all kinds of cyber protections, from the most basic programs loaded on your laptop to sophisticated systems designed to anticipate future action, or watch for variations in the normal behavior of users.   But none of that has prevented cyberspace from becoming what President Barack Obama termed the ''Wild, Wild West,'' a territory of anarchy, where adversaries take free shots at one another. In the past five years, these attacks have become the cheapest way for nations to undercut one another in the name of bigger strategic goals.   Yet the world has been unable to decide what constitutes fair game, and what should be off limits. For years officials talked about their fear of a ''cyber Pearl Harbor,'' a devastating strike against the power grid that would turn out the lights from Boston to Washington, or London to Rome. That has not happened, save for limited strikes in Ukraine, widely attributed to Russian hackers, that seemed intended to send a message that they could attack critical infrastructure at any time. Countries have sensed what would happen if they went too far.   Instead, cyberattacks have taken a far more subtle turn. The Russian-led attacks on the 2016 American election -- and similar efforts in France and Germany last year -- are prime examples. While United Nations experts had been struggling to come up with ''norms of behavior'' in cyberspace, a consensus about what was off-limits -- like attacks on power grids or safety systems, for example -- few were thinking about the use of the technology to influence elections.   In fact, the election systems in the United States -- the foundation of American democracy -- were never on the list of ''critical infrastructure'' until Mr. Obama's Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, added them in the last days of the administration. By then it was too late.   Infrastructure is only part of the problem. The evidence that has poured out of the United States after more than a year of congressional investigations has left no doubt that Russian hackers -- working largely on behalf of two of Moscow's spy services, the SVR and the GRU -- did far more than use cyber tools to break into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of key players in Hillary Clinton's campaign.   The sophisticated use of ''bots'' to target key demographic groups with Twitter messages, Facebook ads and just ordinary-looking social media exchanges made it clear that we have entered a new world, in which states marry some of the oldest propaganda techniques with the newest ways to disseminate a divisive message.   Yet thinking about how to regulate that kind of activity is tying the West in knots. President Emmanuel Macron in France is proposing that government authorities be able to take down ''fake news'' during elections, declaring in his New Year's speech that ''if we want to protect liberal democracies, we must be strong and have clear rules.''   Yet those rules clearly could not survive in the United States, where First Amendment protections would prohibit the government from stepping in and declaring what is fake and what is not.   President Trump's own declarations about what constitutes ''fake news'' -- including articles about the Russian election activity -- underscore the dangers of putting that power into government hands.   There are other complications. After the election hacks in the United States, many called for ''real identities'' on the internet, so the world would know exactly who is tweeting or posting. Sensible as it may sound, it would also be a boon to the Russians, the Chinese and any authoritarian government looking to crack down on dissent. In short, the best way to solve the problem of election meddling and anonymous attacks would be a dictator's dream.   There have been a few successes in setting norms of behavior, particularly when it comes to banning child pornography or cracking down on intellectual property theft. But those are the easiest issues on which to agree.   The United States, for example, would never support rules that banned espionage. And what about rules prohibiting the placement of ''implants'' in foreign computer networks, so that in the future they could monitor activity or plant malware to bring a network down?   American and European officials raise the alarm whenever they find such implants in their electrical grids. But they also quietly place them in hundreds of thousands of foreign networks. That is how Presidents Bush and Obama got inside Iran's nuclear enrichment site at Natanz, with the Stuxnet code.   It is a power that the United States and its allies, have no intention of giving up.    "
Mr. Trump Is Blind to Russia's Threat,"The phalanx of intelligence chiefs who testified on Capitol Hill delivered a chilling message: Not only did Russia interfere in the 2016 election, it is already meddling in the 2018 election by using a digital strategy to exacerbate the country's political and social divisions.  No one knows more about the threats to the United States than these six officials, so when they all agree, it would be derelict to ignore their concerns. Yet President Trump continues to refuse to even acknowledge the malevolent Russian role.    It's particularly striking that four of the men who gave this warning to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday -- the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray; and the Defense Intelligence Agency director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley -- were all appointed by Mr. Trump.   They testified that the president has never asked them to take measures to combat Russian interference and protect democratic processes.   Mr. Trump isn't completely oblivious about Russia, of course. He fired Mr. Wray's predecessor, James Comey, to derail the F.B.I.'s investigation of possible Trump campaign involvement with the election hacking, and reportedly asked Mr. Coats and Mr. Pompeo to help end the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Mr. Flynn's contacts with Russians.   With the midterm elections only nine months away, the federal government is taking some defensive measures. It is trying to get at least one election official in each state a security clearance to make them aware of threats, and is providing states with enhanced online security to ensure that Americans' votes will not be manipulated.   Nevertheless, absent Mr. Trump's commitment, there can be no robust mobilization to take all measures needed to confront an insidious problem that strikes at the heart of the democratic system. These would include a comprehensive and well-funded plan for protecting critical infrastructure, countering cyberattacks and mitigating propaganda.   The president should not only be strengthening electoral defenses, but also pushing back against Russia, instead of ignoring a law Congress adopted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions for election meddling and aggression against Ukraine. The list of potential activities meriting sanctions covers weapons deals, human rights abuses and Russian cyberattacks against the United States and other democracies.   Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured Congress on Wednesday that sanctions ''are coming,'' there's little reason to believe him. The State Department recently argued that it didn't impose sanctions against companies doing weapons deals with Russia because the threat of sanctions was enough to deter some of those deals. But there is no excuse for not acting against Russia for cyberattacks -- Mr. Trump's own intelligence chiefs say such activity has increased, not diminished.   So why is Mr. Trump still ignoring such conclusions? Some have said he is giving Russia a green light to tamper with the 2018 elections. That would have once been an absurd suggestion. It can no longer be dismissed out of hand.   Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.     "
FIFA Braces For Airing Of Secrets After Hacking,"LONDON -- FIFA acknowledged this week that its computer systems were hacked earlier this year for the second time, and officials from European soccer's governing body fear they also might have suffered a data breach. The hack on FIFA, world soccer's governing body, occurred in March and is not thought to be connected to a cyberattack orchestrated by a group linked to Russia's intelligence agency in 2017. That incident led to the publication of a list of failed drug tests by soccer players.    The information that was compromised in the second cyberattack on FIFA is not yet clear, but a consortium of European media organizations plans to publish a series of stories based in part on the internal documents as early as Friday. The group Football Leaks originally obtained the documents.    UEFA officials were targeted in a so-called phishing operation in which third parties fool their targets into giving up password-protected login details, though the organization has been unable to find traces of a hack in its computer systems.   In recent weeks, both FIFA and UEFA have received hundreds of questions, including several related to information contained in confidential documents. FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, was UEFA's most senior administrator before being elected to lead global soccer in 2016.   FIFA officials discussed the prospect of a new hack, and more uncomfortable revelations in the news media, on the edges of the FIFA Council meeting last week in Kigali, Rwanda.   Information published by Football Leaks has rattled global soccer since 2015, when stolen documents emerged on a specially created website. Since the initial leak, a trove of emails, contracts and private messages have been obtained exclusively by the German weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel. Der Spiegel has sought to deal with the volume of information it received by sharing it with an investigative reporting consortium called European Investigative Collaborations.   The leaks have uncovered some of soccer's biggest secrets, shining light on dubious practices that have led to tougher regulations in soccer and in some cases, criminal prosecutions. FIFA earlier this year announced planned changes to the $6 billion transfer market, in part as a response to dealing unveiled by Football Leaks, and Spanish authorities have successfully prosecuted top players and coaches for tax evasion.   Most recently, information obtained from the leak led to articles in Der Spiegel that revealed the details of a nondisclosure agreement Cristiano Ronaldo signed with a Las Vegas woman who accused the Portuguese star of sexually assaulting her in 2009. Ronaldo has denied the charges and, though his lawyers, threatened to sue the magazine.   A coordinator with E.I.C. said he could not comment on the content of the next batch of articles, or even if any would be published. FIFA issued a statement criticizing the leaks of stolen information.   ''FIFA condemns any attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data in any organization using unlawful practices,'' FIFA said.   Asked about the leaks, Infantino said he had tried to do his work honestly. That has meant having discussions and sharing ideas and documents with numerous people, he added.   ''If then this is being portrayed as something bad then I think there's not much I can do other than my job,'' he said during a conversation in Kigali last week. ''We are not stealing.''   Details of the person or group behind Football Leaks were presented in a book written by two reporters from Der Spiegel and published earlier this year. The group told the authors that its aim is to cleanse world soccer by exposing bad actors.   Football Leaks is not the only major data breach that has roiled soccer, or global sports. In October, the United States Department of Justice announced charges against seven Russian intelligence officers who it said had successfully compromised the networks of organizations including FIFA and The International Olympic Committee.   And for most of the past year, confidential emails belonging to the Portuguese club Benfica have surfaced on the internet. Those leaks have highlighted how the club has tried to influence senior figures in soccer and forged close links to officials responsible for refereeing. Benfica has denied wrongdoing and sought Google's help in identifying those who have republished the documents.    "
Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble,"Steven Johnson is the author of 10 books, most recently ''Wonderland.'' He last wrote for the magazine about the science of communicating with extraterrestrials. layer innocent nothing argue pottery winner cotton menu task slim merge maid The sequence of words is meaningless: a random array strung together by an algorithm let loose in an English dictionary. What makes them valuable is that they've been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they're known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps.    On the screen, I'm instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:   1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66    This is what's called a ''private key'' in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there's no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.   That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:   0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9   That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.   Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction -- say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum -- that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of ''blocks'' of data, that record is called the blockchain.   The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening -- something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I've managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.   And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum's ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.   Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one ''coin'' of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.   You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether's runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn't feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?   But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there's one thing we've learned from the recent history of the internet, it's that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.   The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet's roots.   Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia -- there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems -- but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress.   Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. ''We have to fix the internet,'' Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. ''After 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.'' The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: ''The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.'' In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: ''Publishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google's search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.'' (Full disclosure: Burnham's firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where ''misinformation, or 'fake news,' which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.''   For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools -- turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media -- or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft's monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware -- the web, open-source software and Apple products -- that helped undermine Microsoft's dominant position.   The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today's digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.   That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.   To some students of modern technological history, the internet's fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, ''The Master Switch,'' all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon -- and indirectly, Apple -- what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism.   Blockchain advocates don't accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.   To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet's raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services -- Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter -- that largely came to power in the following decade.   The first layer -- call it InternetOne -- was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don't appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don't need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don't need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don't have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.   To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing PokÃ©mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.   But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.   But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it's a problem we don't have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.   The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-'90s, we've adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 -- many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms -- were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.   For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined -- pages, links, messages -- but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online.   This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It's what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as ''base-layer'' infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don't have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities -- most of them backed by the power of the state -- that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.   The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call ''increasing returns'' or ''network effects'' kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world's sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today -- and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.   If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there's less reason to fret about all the ways we've abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we're living in a fallen state today and there's no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there's no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It's a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: ''The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.'' You can't fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.   But the thing about the master's house, in this analogy, is that it's a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.   One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet's organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO's ''Silicon Valley,'' its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words ''Welcome to Rivendell'' were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from ''Lord of the Rings.'' ''We call this house Rivendell,'' Benet said sheepishly. ''It's not a very good Rivendell. It doesn't have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.''   Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet's decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.   Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as ''the 'summer' of peer-to-peer'' -- its salad days. ''But then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,'' he said. ''And partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.'' A graduate of Stanford's computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he's reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. ''The rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,'' he said. ''The structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.'' He continued: ''It was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it's now your turn to protect it.''   Protocol Labs is Benet's attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet's file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol -- HTTP -- pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call ''historic versioning,'' so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) ''Right now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,'' Benet said. ''So you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.'' But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet's larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.   Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn't care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company's key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.   And yet -- as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out -- there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. ''Let's say you're trying to build an open Twitter,'' Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. ''I'm @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.'' A closed architecture like Facebook's or Twitter's puts all the information about its users -- their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network -- into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.   Running Facebook's database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook's point of view, they're providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service -- and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world -- is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people -- much less two billion -- was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.   So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem -- the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards -- turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can't figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we're stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers' markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.   The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called ''Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,'' and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres -- one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook.   The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.   History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a ''peer-to-peer electronic-cash system'' in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.   First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database -- the blockchain -- scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.   Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer's processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right -- and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists -- you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called ''mining.''   For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being ''in charge'' of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn't available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.   These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.   These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet's Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a ''presale'' of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.   The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor -- in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network's storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.   Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of ''tokens,'' not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn't necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. ''I like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it's like an arcade,'' he says. ''You go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we're not trying to replace the U.S. government. It's not meant to be a real currency; it's meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.'' Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon's argument. ''To me, what's interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,'' he says. ''They don't have to resemble money.''   Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. ''I hate it,'' Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s ''are scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.'' Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s -- and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether -- is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.   Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson's partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. ''Uber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,'' Burnham says. ''Yes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map -- and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.'' But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there's a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. ''At some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,'' Burnham says.   The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there's a case to be made for adding another ''basic layer'' to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users' past trips, credit cards, favorite locations -- all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn't have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you'd get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.   How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.   As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.   ''You think about the '90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,'' Dixon says. ''You're basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.''   Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. ''How can we fix the internet if we can't even make coffee?'' she said with a laugh.   Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone's throw from the pizza mecca Roberta's, ''headquarters'' seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers' collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum's smart contracts into their own systems.   The true test of the blockchain will revolve -- like so many of the online crises of the past few years -- around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don't belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn't portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can't extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).   The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity -- which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history -- and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of ''self-sovereign'' identity -- as the parlance has it -- was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.   What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu's Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn't present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I'd be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether.   Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. ''There may be many corporate entities that I don't want seeing that data, but maybe I'd like to donate that data to a medical study,'' she says. ''I could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.''   The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook's. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. ''If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,'' Dixon says, ''that could be pretty compelling.''   Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. ''Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,'' Dixon says. ''That means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a 'bug bounty' is? Someone says, 'If you hack my system, I'll give you a million dollars.' So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one's hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.''   Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity -- your social connections, your purchasing history -- could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users -- what security experts call ''honey pots'' -- is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sniï¬[#x192]ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, ''It's the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.''   So much of the blockchain's architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line.   Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (''self-sovereign'') that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.   The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have ''a right to a private data store,'' where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn't be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.   Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical -- almost communitarian -- possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don't have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.   Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers.

Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble; Feature,"The sequence of words is meaningless: a random array strung together by an algorithm let loose in an English dictionary. What makes them valuable is that they've been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they're known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps. On the screen, I'm instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters: This is what's called a ""private key"" in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there's no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.  That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string: That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction -- say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum -- that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of ""blocks"" of data, that record is called the blockchain. The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening -- something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I've managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness. And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum's ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened. Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one ""coin"" of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later. You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether's runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn't feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment? But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there's one thing we've learned from the recent history of the internet, it's that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook. The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet's roots. Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia -- there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems -- but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress. Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. ""We have to fix the internet,"" Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. ""After 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us."" The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: ""The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will."" In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: ""Publishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google's search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products."" (Full disclosure: Burnham's firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where ""misinformation, or 'fake news,' which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire."" For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools -- turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media -- or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft's monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware -- the web, open-source software and Apple products -- that helped undermine Microsoft's dominant position. The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today's digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons. That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure. To some students of modern technological history, the internet's fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, ""The Master Switch,"" all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon -- and indirectly, Apple -- what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism. Blockchain advocates don't accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties. To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet's raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services -- Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter -- that largely came to power in the following decade. The first layer -- call it InternetOne -- was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don't appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don't need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don't need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don't have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history. To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pokémon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts. But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky. But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it's a problem we don't have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation. The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-'90s, we've adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 -- many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms -- were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo. For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined -- pages, links, messages -- but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online. This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It's what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as ""base-layer"" infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don't have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities -- most of them backed by the power of the state -- that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know. The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call ""increasing returns"" or ""network effects"" kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world's sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today -- and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation. If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there's less reason to fret about all the ways we've abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we're living in a fallen state today and there's no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there's no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It's a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: ""The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house."" You can't fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power. But the thing about the master's house, in this analogy, is that it's a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better. One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet's organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO's ""Silicon Valley,"" its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words ""Welcome to Rivendell"" were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from ""Lord of the Rings."" ""We call this house Rivendell,"" Benet said sheepishly. ""It's not a very good Rivendell. It doesn't have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves."" Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet's decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype. Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as ""the 'summer' of peer-to-peer"" -- its salad days. ""But then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,"" he said. ""And partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven."" A graduate of Stanford's computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he's reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. ""The rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,"" he said. ""The structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future."" He continued: ""It was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it's now your turn to protect it."" Protocol Labs is Benet's attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet's file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol -- HTTP -- pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call ""historic versioning,"" so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) ""Right now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,"" Benet said. ""So you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage."" But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet's larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come. Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn't care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company's key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders. And yet -- as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out -- there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. ""Let's say you're trying to build an open Twitter,"" Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. ""I'm @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database."" A closed architecture like Facebook's or Twitter's puts all the information about its users -- their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network -- into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you. Running Facebook's database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook's point of view, they're providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service -- and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world -- is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people -- much less two billion -- was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore. So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem -- the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards -- turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can't figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we're stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers' markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo. The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,"" and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres -- one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook. The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain. History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a ""peer-to-peer electronic-cash system"" in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features. First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database -- the blockchain -- scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data. Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer's processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right -- and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists -- you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called ""mining."" For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being ""in charge"" of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn't available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter. These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune. These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet's Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a ""presale"" of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O. The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor -- in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network's storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network. Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of ""tokens,"" not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn't necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. ""I like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it's like an arcade,"" he says. ""You go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we're not trying to replace the U.S. government. It's not meant to be a real currency; it's meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world."" Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon's argument. ""To me, what's interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,"" he says. ""They don't have to resemble money."" Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. ""I hate it,"" Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s ""are scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws."" Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s -- and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether -- is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson's partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. ""Uber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,"" Burnham says. ""Yes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map -- and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for."" But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there's a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. ""At some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,"" Burnham says. The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there's a case to be made for adding another ""basic layer"" to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users' past trips, credit cards, favorite locations -- all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn't have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you'd get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train. How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft. As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value. ""You think about the '90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,"" Dixon says. ""You're basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application."" Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. ""How can we fix the internet if we can't even make coffee?"" she said with a laugh. Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone's throw from the pizza mecca Roberta's, ""headquarters"" seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers' collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum's smart contracts into their own systems. The true test of the blockchain will revolve -- like so many of the online crises of the past few years -- around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don't belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn't portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can't extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same). The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity -- which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history -- and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of ""self-sovereign"" identity -- as the parlance has it -- was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet. What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu's Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn't present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I'd be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether. Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. ""There may be many corporate entities that I don't want seeing that data, but maybe I'd like to donate that data to a medical study,"" she says. ""I could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there."" The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook's. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. ""If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,"" Dixon says, ""that could be pretty compelling."" Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. ""Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,"" Dixon says. ""That means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a 'bug bounty' is? Someone says, 'If you hack my system, I'll give you a million dollars.' So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one's hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof."" Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity -- your social connections, your purchasing history -- could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users -- what security experts call ""honey pots"" -- is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\xAC\x83ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, ""It's the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village."" So much of the blockchain's architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line. Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (""self-sovereign"") that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age. The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have ""a right to a private data store,"" where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn't be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state. Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical -- almost communitarian -- possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don't have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago. Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can't change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.

"In Mexico, a Barrage of Hitmen and Hackers","MEXICO CITY -- The messages arrived at a familiar moment of crisis for Mexico's fragile journalist community -- another reporter killed in the line of duty. Javier Valdez, a prominent investigative reporter, had been shot dead only a day earlier. Then came a sudden breakthrough: According to a text message received by his colleagues, his killers had been detained.    Despite the tragedy, his co-workers were suspicious. More than 90 percent of murders go unsolved in Mexico. How did the authorities solve the case so soon?   More likely, they worried, the text messages were an attempt to infiltrate their smartphones -- part of a pattern of hacking attempts involving sophisticated spying technology bought by the Mexican government.    They were right.   The messages were infected with a spyware known as Pegasus, which the Mexican government purchased from an Israeli cyber arms dealer called the NSO Group, according to a forensic analysis by the Citizen Lab at the Munk School at the University of Toronto.   A simple click on the links embedded in the messages would have infected the cellphones with spyware powerful enough to break through encrypted messaging, monitor emails and remotely activate the camera and microphone.   Someone was trying to spy on Mr. Valdez's closest friends and colleagues the day after he was killed last year -- most likely the Mexican government, according to those targeted.   ''I believe they wanted to search our conversations and messages for clues to the murder of Javier, but we are absolutely against this,'' said Ismael Bojórquez, the co-founder and news director of Rio Doce, the news organization where Mr. Valdez worked. ''Nothing obtained illegally should be used in an investigation, and especially not from those who are involved professionally and emotionally to the victim.''   The illegal use of the surveillance technology in Mexico first emerged during the administration of Mr. Peña Nieto, which bought the spyware on the condition that it be used only to target terrorists and criminals.   But in the last year and a half, the Citizen Lab has confirmed nearly two dozen highly questionable targets, including some of Mexico's most prominent journalists, human rights lawyers and anticorruption activists.   When news of the surveillance erupted last year, the Mexican government denounced the spying and opened a federal investigation into any misuse of the technology.   But the federal investigation has gone nowhere. Not a single individual has been punished for abusing the system.   Well aware of the scandal, Mr. Bojórquez said he had little faith in the messages he was receiving. He and another target -- the news director, Andres Villareal -- refused to click on the links. They had reason to be suspicious.   The men were running one of the few independent news groups in the nation, dedicated to covering organized crime and exposing the underbelly of Mexico's vast nexus of crime and corruption.   Their work made them few friends. Threats came with the territory, and not just from organized crime. Government data show that public officials are responsible for the greatest number of assaults and attacks on journalists.   But Mr. Valdez's work and international profile, they figured, protected him. He was known and beloved by local and foreign journalists alike, and was the recipient of awards and recognition globally.   His death and the subsequent targeting of newsroom leaders exposed two of the most devastating risks to the freedom of expression in Mexico today.   One is the physical threats to journalists and, by extension, freedom of speech in Mexico. More than 47 journalists have been killed since Mr. Peña Nieto took office in late 2012, 15 of them after Mr. Valdez's death in May of last year, according to Article 19, a journalist protection group.   ''We believed that a journalist as prestigious as Javier was untouchable,'' Mr. Bojórquez said.   ''When they killed Javier, we understood from that point on that they could kill anyone,'' he added. ''We understood that the paradigm had been broken.''   The second risk is a separate but connected facet of the rule of law in Mexico: There is essentially near total impunity when it comes to how it is broken or applied -- a dynamic underscored by the use of illegal spyware to intimidate and spy on pro-democracy voices.   Dating back to 2016, the target list has been a who's who of Mexico's most prominent voices aiming to bring accountability to the nation, including the directors at Rio Doce.   Mr. Bojórquez said he and others had become aware of the government's potent spyware in February 2017, when the Citizen Lab and The New York Times published articles outlining its illicit use against backers of a nationwide soda tax.   The investigations detailed the purchase of the spyware by the Mexican government, and included details about its proper use. The Israeli company claimed it had sold the software only to governments, and said it had measures in place to ensure that its clients followed the ethical guidelines stipulated in purchasing agreements.   Mexico's government was deeply embarrassed by the scandal. And yet months after the attempted hacking of doctors and activists promoting a tax on sugary drinks in Mexico, which is suffering a diabetes crisis, the targeting did not stop.   ''These infection attempts are reckless, and probably indefensible,'' said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, adding that the company had already been exposed for abuses previously. ''Where was the internal oversight? And where was NSO's oversight?''   ''We hold ourselves to a rigorous standard of ethics and regulatory compliance and take any accusation seriously, no matter the source,'' a spokesperson for NSO said. ''We do not tolerate misuse of our products against civil rights activists, journalists or any innocent person. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract.''   Mexico has become an emblem of problematic use of spyware. In a series of articles in 2017, The Times and the Citizen Lab detailed the extensive use of the malware against journalists, minors, human rights lawyers, politicians and anticorruption activists. It also included critics of the president.   The NSO Group claimed that it monitored abuses of its software and intervened to stop clients from targeting people who did not fall within the permitted categories.   But even after suspicious targeting was unveiled in February 2017, operators in Mexico continued their illicit spying.   Mr. Peña Nieto's tenure has been marked by scandals: the questionable purchase of a multimillion-dollar home by his wife from a favored government contractor; the unsolved disappearance of 43 students; and the widespread hacking of the nation's nascent pro-democracy movement. His six years in office has also seen an unusual rise in homicides.   By this summer, Mr. Peña Nieto's long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed for nearly a century with few interruptions, was practically broken. Across both houses of Congress and in the race for the presidency, it suffered devastating losses.   In response to the latest reports about the targeting of Mr. Valdez's colleagues in the aftermath of his murder, the government had little to say.   Government officials did not comment on the specifics of the continuing investigation, but said that the government was open to collaborating with the victims and remains committed to pursuing any charges should evidence emerge.   A new government comes into office in the next week, arriving on a wave of popular support. But whether the status of journalists will change in the country, and whether their targeting and abuse, and state overreach will subside, is an open question.   ''A change in government does not mean there will be a change in the context of impunity or aggressions against journalists,'' Mr. Bojórquez said. ''If there is no change to the impunity, the murder of journalists will continue.''    "
Mexico Spyware Inquiry Bogs Down. Skeptics Aren't Surprised.,"MEXICO CITY -- American officials have rebuffed repeated requests from Mexico to help investigate the use of government spying technology against innocent civilians, wary that Mexico wants to use the United States as cover in a sham inquiry, senior American officials say. The Mexican government has been on the defensive for months, battling revelations that surveillance technology it acquired has been used to spy on some of the nation's most prominent human rights lawyers, academics and journalists. Days after The New York Times revealed the extensive spying campaign, Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, acknowledged that the government had purchased the spying technology. He quickly ordered a federal investigation into any misuse, and Mexican officials said they would ask the F.B.I. for help. But after reviewing the request, American officials decided not to get involved, leery that the Mexican government had little interest in actually solving the case because a serious investigation might implicate some of its most powerful figures, senior American officials said.  In particular, American officials were worried that the Mexicans would try to trumpet the involvement of the United States to lend an appearance of credibility to a whitewash, the officials said. The spying technology, developed by an Israeli cyber-arms manufacturer, is sold only to governments, and under the explicit condition that it be used only to track terrorists and other criminals. After it became clear that the technology had been used much more broadly than that, the Mexicans sent a list of questions to American law enforcement officials to show their seriousness about investigating. But the questions required no more than a basic computer science degree to answer, one American official said. The Mexican government -- which operated the surveillance technology itself -- was more than capable of solving the case on its own if it wanted to, the official said. The F.B.I. declined to comment. There are many potential reasons Mexican officials, if they were serious about investigating, might want American help, even if they did not necessarily need it. The Mexican public is deeply suspicious of its government, so the participation of American law enforcement officials could help build trust in the findings. But more than six months after the investigation was announced, some of the American concerns appear to be bearing out, according to victims of the spying and their lawyers, who have had access to the case files. The government inquiry has failed to make headway in many basic areas, they contend. Prosecutors handling the case have yet to question any of the officials responsible for operating the surveillance technology, according to the victims' lawyers and their review of the case file. The Mexican government declined to offer specific comments on the investigation but said it remains ""in the phase of exhausting different lines of investigation."" It also said that it had been in constant contact with the group of forensic analysts that first discovered the existence of the spyware, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, and that it had sought counsel from other national and international experts. The Citizen Lab seemed taken aback by the assertion. ""That's a surprising statement, given that we have had exactly one meeting with them and have received no further follow-up,"" said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher there. He said the Citizen Lab answered the government's questions at that meeting, in October, and even suggested a list of evidence to preserve for the investigation. The spying software, known as Pegasus, infiltrates smartphones to monitor every detail of a person's cellular life -- calls, texts, email, contacts and calendars. It can even use the microphone and camera on phones for surveillance, turning a target's smartphone into a personal bug. But investigators have not even identified the government employees who operate the technology, or visited the offices where the spying operation was conducted, according to interviews with the victims and their lawyers and the the case files. Prosecutors have for now also declined to examine the servers used by the officials who operated the spying technology, according to the case files and the lawyers. Those servers, according to cyber-forensic analysts and the Israeli manufacturers of the spyware, would contain a record of every attempted hack on every single target. ""It is highly likely that the political actors who were using this software are now keeping this investigation from making any progress at all,"" said Mario Ignacio Álvarez, a former deputy at the nation's attorney general's office. ""This is still a country where it is better to pray to the Virgin of Guadalupe for justice than to the authorities."" That is not to say that the case file is empty. It already stands several feet tall, stacked with sheaths of documents. But they are often as pointless as they are copious, lawyers for the victims of the spying contend. Investigators have included printouts of basic Google searches related to the case, including some of the victims' Facebook pages. And the bulk of the file is dedicated to the rolling responses from about 2,000 municipalities that were asked by prosecutors if they possessed the software. The requests include townships of fewer than 500 people with annual budgets that are a fraction of the roughly $80 million that the Mexican government spent to purchase the surveillance system. ""Once more we have entered into a bureaucratic labyrinth that will take us nowhere,"" said Leopoldo Maldonado, a lawyer for a journalist protection group, Article 19, which is representing several victims in the case. ""This is not a serious investigation."" One of the documents contained in the case file, according to those who have reviewed it, is an admission by the nation's attorney general's office that it purchased the software. But the prosecutors assigned to solving the case are employed by the attorney general's office -- offering little hope to the spying victims that the agency will vigorously investigate itself. ""We knew from the beginning that it would be very hard to have a real investigation, but this is a clear demonstration of the lack of an independent system in Mexico,"" said Carmen Aristegui, one of Mexico's most renowned journalists, who endured dozens of hacking attempts using the Pegasus spyware. ""We are the political targets of a government that combats its critics with illegal tools."" Lawyers for the victims have taken the government to court, hoping to force a more thorough inquiry. In written responses to the suit, prosecutors say they are waiting for the opportune moment to review the servers and question participants in the hacking program, but have not refused outright to do so. They also claim that the cutting-edge malware does not allow them to track the targets, according to documents in the case file. ""The software has no reporting function that offers a registry of numbers that might have been intercepted,"" according to the file. But this is at odds with the description of the spyware given to The Times last year by its manufacturer, the NSO Group. Officials at the company said the contracts were based on a specific number of spying targets, and that the system installed on site at the government agency tracked every time it was used. Even critics accustomed to the Kabuki dance of independent investigations in Mexico, where officials publicly promise to root out corruption but do little to punish the culprits, have expressed surprise. To some, the lack of an investigation is almost as worrisome as the spying itself. ""It translates into still feeling vulnerable,"" said Luis Fernando García, the director of R3D, a digital rights group representing several victims. ""When nothing happens, it emboldens those with this kind of technology to continue using it illegally."" Prosecutors insist they need the phones of the spying victims to proceed with their investigation. But forensic experts -- as well as victims of the spyware in Panama, where the former president has been charged with illegal espionage -- say the target's phone is unnecessary to conduct an inquiry. The servers, they say, are all that is really required. ""This is the height of cynicism, to transfer blame for the lack of investigation to the victims,"" said Mario Patrón, a target of the hacking and the executive director of the Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center, one of Mexico's most respected human rights groups. One of the most glaring omissions in the file, the victims' lawyers say, is the contract that the Attorney General's office signed with the software manufacturer. While some of that and other material is secret for reasons of national security, the government says, there are other leads that prosecutors appear to have ignored. For instance, they have not questioned the individual in charge of the division that used the spyware, Tomás Zerón, a close ally of the president, according to the case files and the lawyers. The office, known as the Criminal Investigation Agency, was run by Mr. Zeron at the time of the hacking. Mr. Zerón's name has surfaced in scandals before. He was the chief investigator into the mysterious disappearance of 43 teaching students who clashed with the police in 2014. The case remains unresolved. Mr. Zerón was removed from his post in 2016, after video obtained by international investigators looking into the disappearances showed him handling evidence related to the case that was never logged in any official files, they said. Mr. Zerón, through an aide, declined to comment. Independent groups, meanwhile, appear to be making some progress in unearthing details about the purchase of the software. This month, the group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity said it had discovered a link between an individual who was working for the Attorney General's office and the company that sold the software to the law enforcement agency. Salvador Camarena, an investigative editor with Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity, whose team has been looking into the companies associated with the sale, was himself a target of spying. But unlike other victims, he chose not to file a complaint with the government. ""I saw it as a waste of time,"" he said. ""Why on earth would they want to investigate themselves?"" But in recent weeks, Mr. Camarena decided to file a complaint to review what the government had done. ""It was journalistic curiosity,"" he said, ""to see what I could find out about who targeted me."" Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Mexico City.

"Hacking a Prince, an Emir and a Journalist to Impress a Client","The rulers of the United Arab Emirates had been using Israeli spyware for more than a year, secretly turning the smartphones of dissidents at home or rivals abroad into surveillance devices. So when top Emirati officials were offered a pricey update of the spying technology, they wanted to make sure it worked, according to leaked emails submitted Thursday in two lawsuits against the spyware's maker, the Israel-based NSO Group. Could the company secretly record the phones of the emir of Qatar, a regional rival, the Emiratis asked? How about the phone of a powerful Saudi prince who directed the kingdom's national guard? Or what about recording the phone of the editor of a London-based Arab newspaper? ""Please find two recordings attached,"" a company representative wrote back four days later, according to the emails. Appended were two recordings the company had made of calls by the editor, Abdulaziz Alkhamis, who confirmed this week that he had made the calls and said he did not know he was under surveillance.  The NSO Group's actions are now at the heart of the twin lawsuits accusing the company of actively participating in illegal spying -- part of a global effort to confront the growing arms race in the world of spyware. As private companies develop and sell cutting-edge surveillance technology to governments for tens of millions of dollars, human rights groups say the scant oversight over the practice invites rampant misuse. And no company is more central to the battle than the NSO Group, one of the best-known creators of spyware that invades smartphones. The two lawsuits, filed in Israel and Cyprus, were brought by a Qatari citizen and by Mexican journalists and activists who were all targeted by the company's spyware. In Mexico, the NSO Group has sold the surveillance technology to the Mexican government on the explicit condition that it be used only againstcriminals and terrorists. Yet some of the nation's most prominent human rights lawyers, journalists and anti-corruption activists have been targeted instead. Many are now plaintiffs in the lawsuits. The government of Panama also purchased the spyware, and the president at the time used it to spy on his political rivals and critics, according to court documents in a case there. Whenever challenged, the company has said that it merely sells the technology to governments, which agree to deploy it exclusively against criminals but then operate it on their own. The new lawsuits include leaked documents and emails that directly challenge the company's repeated assertions that it is not responsible for any illegal surveillance conducted by the governments that buy its spyware. In the case of the U.A.E., the lawsuits argue, an affiliate of the NSO Group attempted to spy on foreign government officials -- and successfully recorded the calls of a journalist -- at the request of its Emirati customers four years ago. The technology works by sending text messages to a target's smartphone, hoping to bait the person into clicking on them. If the user does, the spyware, known as Pegasus, is secretly downloaded, enabling governments to monitor phone calls, emails, contacts and potentially even face-to-face conversations conducted nearby. For the U.A.E., documents show, an affiliate of the NSO Group specifically suggested language for the corrupting text messages. Many were tailored for the Persian Gulf with seemingly innocuous invitations like ""Ramadan is near -- incredible discounts"" and ""keep your car tires from exploding in the heat."" Leaked technical documents included in the lawsuits also show that the company helped its clients by transmitting the data gained through surveillance through an elaborate computer network. ""We are pushing to make the law catch up with technology"" and show that the spyware makers ""are complicit in these privacy violations,"" said Alaa Mahajna, an Israeli lawyer who filed the lawsuits in cooperation with Mazen Masri, a senior lecturer in law at the City University of London. The NSO group declined to comment until it could review the lawsuits. The Emirati Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. After The New York Times reported last year that prominent Mexican lawyers, journalists and anticorruption campaigners had been targeted by the NSO Group's spyware, the Mexican government announced a federal investigation. But more than a year later, the investigation has made little apparent progress, so the Mexican journalists and human rights defenders joined the lawsuits to uncover more about the government's hacking program. The lawsuits also shed new light on the political intrigues involving Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchies, which have increasingly turned to hacking as a favorite weapon against one another. The U.A.E. does not recognize Israel, but the two appear to have a growing behind-the-scenes alliance. Because Israel deems the spyware a weapon, the lawsuits note, the NSO Group and its affiliates could have sold it to the Emirates only with approval by the Israeli Defense Ministry. Leaked emails submitted in the lawsuits show that the U.A.E. signed a contract to license the company's surveillance software as early as August 2013. A year and a half later, a British affiliate of the NSO Group asked its Emirati client to provide a sixth payment of $3 million under the original contract, suggesting a total licensing fee of at least $18 million over that period. An update the next year was sold through a different affiliate, based in Cyprus, at a cost of $11 million in four installments, according to leaked invoices. Tensions between the U.A.E. and its neighbor Qatar reached a boil in 2013 over a struggle for power in Egypt. Qatar had allied itself with the Egyptian Islamist movement that won the elections after the Arab Spring. Then the U.A.E. backed a military takeover that cast the Islamists into prison instead. In the escalating feud, each side accused the other of cyberespionage. Hackers broke into the email accounts of two outspoken opponents of Qatar -- the Emirati ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, and an American Republican fund-raiser who does business with the U.A.E., Elliott Broidy. Mr. Broidy has filed a separate lawsuit accusing Qatar and its Washington lobbyists of conspiring to steal and leak his emails. Other hackers briefly took over the website of the Qatari news service to post a false report of an embarrassing speech by the emir to damage him, and later leaked Qatari emails exposing awkward details of Qatari negotiations over the release of a royal hunting party kidnapped in Iraq. Allies of Qatar blamed the Emiratis. The leaked emails disclosed in the new lawsuits may also have been stolen through hacking. Lawyers involved said the documents were provided by a Qatari journalist who did not disclose how he had obtained them. The messages show that the Emiratis were seeking to intercept the phone calls of the emir of Qatar as early as 2014. But the Emirati target list also included Saudi Arabia. In the email discussions about updating the NSO Group's technology, the Emiratis asked to intercept the phone calls of a Saudi prince, Mutaib bin Abdullah, who was considered at the time to be a possible contender for the throne. The Emiratis have been active promoters of Prince Mutaib's younger rival, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Last year, the crown prince removed Prince Mutaib from his role as minister of the national guard and ordered his temporary detention in connection with corruption allegations. In a telephone interview, Prince Mutaib expressed surprise that the Emiratis had attempted to record his calls. ""They don't need to hack my phone,"" he said. ""I will tell them what I am doing."" According to the emails, the Emiratis also asked to intercept the phone calls of Saad Hariri, who is now prime minister of Lebanon. Mr. Hariri has sometimes been accused of failing to push back hard enough against Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese movement backed by Iran. Last year, the U.A.E.'s Saudi ally, Crown Prince Mohammed, temporarily detained Mr. Harari in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and forced him to announce his resignation as prime minister. (He later rescinded the announcement, and he remains prime minister.) Mr. Alkhamis, who resigned in 2014 as the editor of the London-based newspaper Al Arab, called the surveillance of his phone calls ""very strange"" but not unexpected, since he had published ""sensitive"" articles about Persian Gulf politics. The U.A.E.'s use of the NSO Group's spyware was first reported in 2016. Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati human rights advocate, noticed suspicious text messages and exposed an attempt to hack his Apple iPhone. The U.A.E. arrested him on apparently unrelated charges the next year and he remains in jail. After Mr. Mansoor's disclosures, Apple said it had released an update that patched the vulnerabilities exploited by the NSO Group. The NSO Group pledged to investigate and said in a statement that ""the company has no knowledge of and cannot confirm the specific cases."" But other leaked documents filed with the lawsuits indicate that the U.A.E. continued to license and use the Pegasus software well after Apple announced its fix and the NSO Group pledged to investigate. On June 5, 2017, the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia begana blockade of Qatar in an effort to isolate it. Ten days later, an internal Emirati email cited in the lawsuits referred to 159 members of the Qatari royal family, officials and others whose phones it had targeted with the NSO spyware, promising a report based on ""what we found from the top 13 targets only."" ""ur highness based on ur instructions we viewed the collecting from the Q phone targeting,"" wrote an Emirati official identified in the lawsuits as an assistant to Prince Khalid bin Mohammed, the chairman of the Emirati intelligence agency and the son of the de facto ruler of the U.A.E., Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. This month, Amnesty International said one of its staff members working in Saudi Arabia had also been targeted by spyware that appeared to be linked to the NSO Group, and the company reiterated that it bears no responsibility for its customers' use of its spyware. ""Our product is intended to be used exclusively for the investigation and prevention of crime and terrorism,"" the company said in a statement to Amnesty, pledging to ""investigate the issue and take appropriate action.""

Protecting Privacy Inside and Outside the House; TECH TIP,"Q. If I browse in incognito mode, can anyone still track my movements around the web? A. Incognito mode -- also known as InPrivate or Private Browsing mode, depending on the browser -- does offer some protection, but is mostly designed to shield your web travels from other people using the same computer. When you have the privacy setting enabled, the browser typically does not save cookies, searches, temporary files or a list of the pages you visited during your session for others to discover.   However, as most browsers themselves warn, the incognito or private mode does not make you fully anonymous online. The websites you viewed may have a record of your visit, and your internet service provider, office network administrator or your school might be able to see your activity. Malicious software can also record your web activity and keystrokes regardless of your privacy settings. The Apple Safari, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (or Internet Explorer) browsers all include incognito or private modes for their desktop and mobile editions that you can enable in the program settings. Mozilla Firefox Quantum has a private browsing mode as well as a Tracking Protection tool that more aggressively blocks some sites known to stalk visitors. With last year's repeal of regulations that would have prohibited internet service providers from collecting and selling the browsing-activity data of their customers without permission (not to mention recent concerns regarding the lack of privacy), some people may be in less of a sharing mood when it comes to their personal lives. If you find yourself wanting more discretion as you go about life online, you can step up your defenses.  For example, search engines like DuckDuckGo and StartPage do not collect and share information from your web queries with advertisers. Virtual private networks can encrypt your web traffic, hide your location and help protect you on unsecured public wireless networks. Browser add-ons like Disconnect and Privacy Badger can help shield you from companies that try to track you around the web.

Pentagon Plan Would Expand Nuclear Policy,"WASHINGTON -- A newly drafted United States nuclear strategy that has been sent to President Trump for approval would permit the use of nuclear weapons to respond to a wide range of devastating but non-nuclear attacks on American infrastructure, including what current and former government officials described as the most crippling kind of cyberattacks. For decades, American presidents have threatened ''first use'' of nuclear weapons against enemies in only very narrow and limited circumstances, such as in response to the use of biological weapons against the United States. But the new document is the first to expand that to include attempts to destroy wide-reaching infrastructure, like a country's power grid or communications, that would be most vulnerable to cyberweapons.    The draft document, called the Nuclear Posture Review, was written at the Pentagon and is being reviewed by the White House. Its final release is expected in the coming weeks and represents a new look at the United States' nuclear strategy. The draft was first published last week by HuffPost.    It called the strategic picture facing the United States quite bleak, citing not only Russian and Chinese nuclear advances but advances made by North Korea and, potentially, Iran.   ''We must look reality in the eye and see the world as it is, not as we wish it to be,'' the draft document said. The Trump administration's new initiative, it continued, ''realigns our nuclear policy with a realistic assessment of the threats we face today and the uncertainties regarding the future security environment.''   The Pentagon declined to comment on the draft assessment because Mr. Trump has not yet approved it. The White House also declined to comment.   But three current and former senior government officials said large cyberattacks against the United States and its interests would be included in the kinds of foreign aggression that could justify a nuclear response -- though they stressed there would be other, more conventional options for retaliation. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the proposed policy.   Gary Samore, who was a top nuclear adviser to President Barack Obama, said much of the draft strategy ''repeats the essential elements of Obama declaratory policy word for word'' -- including its declaration that the United States would ''only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.''   But the biggest difference lies in new wording about what constitutes ''extreme circumstances.''   In the Trump administration's draft, those ''circumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks.'' It said that could include ''attacks on the U.S., allied, or partner civilian population or infrastructure, and attacks on U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities.''   The draft does not explicitly say that a crippling cyberattack against the United States would be among the extreme circumstances. But experts called a cyberattack one of the most efficient ways to paralyze systems like the power grid, cellphone networks and the backbone of the internet without using nuclear weapons.   ''In 2001, we struggled with how to establish deterrence for terrorism because terrorists don't have populations or territory to hold at risk. Cyber poses a similar quandary,'' said Kori Schake, a senior National Security Council and State Department official during President George W. Bush's administration, who is now the deputy director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.   ''So if cyber can cause physical malfunction of major infrastructure resulting in deaths,'' Ms. Schake said, the Pentagon has now found a way ''to establish a deterrent dynamic.''   The draft review also cites ''particular concern'' about ''expanding threats in space and cyberspace'' to the command-and-control systems of the American nuclear arsenal that the review identifies as a ''legacy of the Cold War.'' It was the latest warning in a growing chorus that the nuclear response networks could themselves be disabled or fed false data in a cyberattack.   So far, all of the United States' leading adversaries -- including Russia, China, North Korea and Iran -- have stopped well short of the kind of cyberattacks that could prompt a larger, and more violent response.   The Russians have placed malware called ''Black Energy'' in American utility systems, but never tried to cause a major blackout. They have sent cable-cutting submarines along the path of undersea fiber optic lines that connect the continents, but not cut them. North Korea has attacked companies like Sony, and used cyberweapons to cause chaos in the British health care system, but never directly taken on the United States.   Still, the document recognizes that American, Russian and Chinese strategies have all been updated in recent years to reflect the reality that any conflict would begin with a lightning strike on space and communications systems. During the Obama administration, for example, a secret program, code-named ''Nitro Zeus,'' called for a blinding cyberattack on Iran in the event negotiations over its nuclear program failed and Washington found itself going to war with Tehran.   There are other differences with the Obama administration policy.   The draft strategy embraces the American production of a new generation of small, low-yield nuclear weapons -- some of which were under development during the Obama administration. Some experts warn that such smaller weapons can blur the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons, and, as a result, be more tempting to use.   And it states outright that Russia is testing its first autonomous nuclear torpedo, one that American officials believe would be guided largely by artificial intelligence to strike the United States even if communications with Moscow were terminated. It was Washington's first public acknowledgment of such an undersea weapon, a prototype of which was first envisioned in the 1960s by Andrei Sakharov, the physicist who later ranked among the Soviet Union's most famous dissidents.   The torpedo's development was detected by the Obama administration and has been widely discussed in defense circles, but never publicly referred to by the Pentagon as a significant future threat.   Mr. Trump has rarely publicly criticized President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for Russia's aggressions around the world. But the Pentagon document describes Moscow's actions as so destabilizing that the United States may be forced to reverse Mr. Obama's commitment to reduce the role and size of the American nuclear arsenal.   Russia is adopting ''military strategies and capabilities that rely on nuclear escalation for their success,'' Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote in an introduction to the report. ''These developments, coupled with Russia's invasion of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow's unabashed return to Great Power competition.''   In most cases, the Trump administration plan would simply move forward nuclear weapons that Mr. Obama had endorsed, such as a new generation of nuclear cruise missiles -- low-flying weapons with stubby wings that, when dropped from a bomber, hug the ground to avoid enemy radars and air defenses.   But the strategy envisions other new nuclear weapons. The draft policy calls for ''the rapid development'' of a cruise missile to be fired from submarines. Mr. Obama had retired that class. It also calls for the development of a low-yield warhead for ballistic missiles fired from submarines.   It is relatively easy for presidents to change the country's declaratory policy on the use of nuclear arms and quite difficult for them to reshape its nuclear arsenal, which takes not only vast sums of money but many years and sometimes decades of planning and implementation.   The price tag for a 30-year makeover of the United States' nuclear arsenal was put last year at $1.2 trillion. Analysts said the expanded Trump administration plan would push the bill much higher, noting that firm estimates will have to wait until the proposed federal budget for the 2019 fiscal year is made public.   ''Almost everything about this radical new policy will blur the line between nuclear and conventional,'' said Andrew C. Weber, an assistant defense secretary during the Obama administration who directed an interagency panel that oversaw the country's nuclear arsenal.   If adopted, he added, the new policy ''will make nuclear war a lot more likely.''   One of the document's edgiest conclusions involves the existence of a deadly new class of Russian nuclear torpedo -- a cigar-shaped underwater missile meant to be fired from a submarine.   Torpedoes tipped with nuclear arms were common during the Cold War, with the Soviet Union pioneering the weapons and developing them most vigorously. One Soviet model had a range of miles and a large warhead.   Mr. Sakharov, a famous Russian dissident in the 1970s and 1980s, envisioned a giant torpedo able to travel several hundred miles and incur heavy casualties with a warhead thousands of times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. Though his vision was rejected at the time, the new review discloses that Moscow has resurrected a weapon along the same lines.   The document calls it ''a new intercontinental, nuclear-armed undersea autonomous torpedo.'' In a diagram labeled ''New Nuclear Delivery Vehicles over the Past Decade,'' it identifies the torpedo by its code name, Status-6.   News stories have reported the possible existence of such a weapon since at least 2015, but the document's reference appears to be the first time the federal government has confirmed its existence. The long-range torpedo with a monster warhead is apparently meant to shower coastal regions with deadly radioactivity, leaving cities uninhabitable.    "
"In Eastern Europe, U.S. Military Girds Against Russian Might and Manipulation","ORZYSZ, Poland -- Soon after a United States Army convoy crossed Poland's border into Lithuania during a major military exercise this month, two very strange things happened. First, four Army Stryker armored vehicles collided, sending 15 soldiers to the hospital with minor injuries. But hours later, an anti-American blog claimed a child was killed and posted a photo of the accident. Lithuanian media quickly denounced the blog post as a doctored fake, designed to turn public opinion against the Americans and their Baltic ally.    The bloggers had borrowed a page from the playbook of Russia's so-called hybrid warfare, which American officials say increasingly combines the ability to manipulate events using a mix of subterfuge, cyberattacks and information warfare with conventional military might.   The exercise, which involved 18,000 American and allied troops, offers a window into how Army commanders are countering not just Russian troops and tanks, but also twisted truths. They occurred as President Trump is sidling up to Moscow by bad-mouthing NATO, calling for Russia to be readmitted into the Group of 7 industrialized nations, and planning a summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia next month.    American commanders say they are tuning out Mr. Trump's comments -- strengthening ties to allied armies, increasing the number of troops and spies devoted to Russia, and embracing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's newest defense strategy that focuses more on potential threats from Russia and China and less on terrorism.   ''The Russians are actively seeking to divide our alliance, and we must not allow that to happen,'' Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, warned separately in a speech in France the day after the June 7 accident in Lithuania.   Over the past year, the United States and its NATO allies completed positioning about 4,500 soldiers in the three Baltic States and Poland, and have stationed several thousand other armored troops mostly in Eastern Europe as a deterrent to Russian aggression.   In Brussels, allied defense ministers met recently in advance of a NATO summit meeting in July and approved a plan to ensure that by 2020, at least 30,000 troops, plus additional attack planes and warships, can respond to aggressions within 30 days.   These tensions are part of an expanding rivalry and military buildup, with echoes of the Cold War, between Washington and Moscow.   The doctored photo of the Army accident in Lithuania was just the latest reminder of what American officials called Russia's increasing reliance on cyberattacks and information warfare to keep its rivals off balance.   Last year, for instance, Lithuanian prosecutors investigated a claim of rape against German soldiers who were stationed in Lithuania as part of a NATO mission to deter Russia. Ultimately, the report turned out to be false. Moscow denied being involved in any disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting troops, but the incident was widely viewed as an attempt to sow divisions among the allies.   Moscow is flexing its conventional might, too, sending military forces for its own exercises along its western border with Europe and also to Syria and eastern Ukraine. Additionally, Russia is building up its nuclear arsenal and cyberwarfare prowess in what American military officials call an attempt to prove its relevance after years of economic decline and retrenchment.   In response, the Pentagon has stepped up training rotations and exercises on the territory of newer NATO allies in the east, including along a narrow 60-mile-wide stretch of rolling Polish farmland near the Lithuanian border northeast of here called the Suwalki Gap. The corridor is sandwiched between the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Moscow's ally Belarus, and is considered NATO's weak spot on its eastern flank.   In the unlikely event of a land war, American and allied officers say, the region is where Russia or its proxies could cut off the Baltic States from the rest of Europe. Since Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, Eastern Europe has felt increasingly vulnerable.   ''Putin is a bird of prey,'' said Piotr Lukasiewicz, a retired Polish Army colonel and former Polish ambassador to Afghanistan. ''He preys on weak states.''   The Polish government has offered to pay the United States up to $2 billion to build a permanent military base in the country, an offer the Trump administration is weighing cautiously. American forces are, apparently for the first time, flying unarmed Reaper surveillance drones from a Polish base in the country's northwest. Nearly 2,000 Special Operations forces from the United States and 10 other NATO nations carried out one of their biggest exercises ever -- Trojan Footprint 18 -- in Poland and the Baltics this month.   Elsewhere in Europe, Norway agreed two weeks ago to increase the number of American Marines training there regularly, to 700 from 330, drawing an angry protest from Moscow.   The Russian military threat has changed markedly since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Mr. Putin has invested heavily in modern infantry forces, tanks and artillery. Moscow has also increased its constellation of surveillance drones that can identify targets and coordinate strikes launched from other weapons.   Russia's big war game in Belarus last year -- known as Zapad 2017 -- involved tens of thousands of troops and raised concerns about accidental conflicts that could be triggered by such exercises, or any incursions into Russian-speaking regions in the Baltics.   The Kremlin firmly rejects any such aims and says NATO is the security threat in Eastern Europe. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff, in Helsinki, Finland, this month, in part to discuss ''the current international security situation in Europe,'' a spokesman for General Dunford said.   A mobile American command post here in northeastern Poland reflects the Army's new realities in Eastern Europe.   Soldiers accustomed to operating from large, secure bases in Iraq and Afghanistan now practice disguising their positions with camouflage netting. Troops disperse into smaller groups to simulate avoiding sophisticated surveillance drones that could direct rocket or missile attacks against personnel or command posts. Intelligence analysts track Twitter and other social media for information on their adversaries and local sympathizers.   ''We have to be nimble,'' said Brig. Gen. Richard R. Coffman, a deputy commander of the Army's First Infantry Division who is overseeing much of the American training from a command post in Orzysz.   Asked about the Russian threat, General Coffman, a third-generation Army officer from Fort Knox, Ky., echoed a sentiment of many officers interviewed over the course of three days: ''To say I wasn't worried would be foolish, but it doesn't keep me up at night.''   The largest American component in the $21 million exercise, called Saber Strike, consisted of roughly 3,000 soldiers from the Second Cavalry Regiment, a storied Army unit that tracks its lineage to 1836. To practice its ability to move quickly in a crisis and sustain itself along the way, the regiment drove 950 vehicles about 840 miles from its base in Vilseck, Germany, to a training range in southern Lithuania -- roughly the distance from New York to Atlanta.   The road march was a proving ground for enhanced technology, such as new, small reconnaissance drones and electronic-jamming equipment to thwart Russian probes. For Lithuanian officers, many of whom have served alongside Americans in Afghanistan and Iraq, the expanded allied presence is welcome payback for the Baltic contributions to those counterterrorism campaigns of the past decade.   When it comes to Russian aggression, the Lithuanians have long memories. Hanging in the spacious office of Maj. Gen. Vitalijus Vaiksnoras, Lithuania's second-ranking officer, is a huge painting of the Battle of Orsha -- from 1514 -- when a force of 30,000 Lithuanians and Poles defeated 80,000 Russians.   ''We cannot afford to be weak,'' said General Vaiksnoras, who studied in San Antonio and at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. ''The Russians will take advantage of that.''   Lithuania's army has grown to 10,000 full-time soldiers, a roughly 25 percent increase in the past two years, the general said. Conscription has been reinstated. And the military has bought new infantry fighting vehicles, air defenses and howitzers.   At a training range about 15 miles from the border with Belarus, Col. Mindaugas Steponavicius, commander of the Lithuanian Army's 3,000-soldier Iron Wolf brigade, said he was sharpening his forces by training with NATO partners like the United States and Germany.   He is putting aside Mr. Trump's comments and relying on soldier-to-soldier bonds to deter Russia.   ''If you are a small nation, you have to have good, strong allies,'' said Colonel Steponavicius, who has served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. ''When we have such a neighbor, allies matter.''   Eric Schmitt reported from Orzysz and Suwalki, Poland, and Vilnius, Lithuania.    "
Intelligence Chief Warns U.S. Digital Infrastructure 'Is Literally Under Attack',"WASHINGTON -- The nation's top intelligence officer said on Friday that the persistent danger of Russian cyberattacks today was akin to the warnings the United States had of stepped-up terror threats ahead of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. That note of alarm sounded by Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, came on the same day that 12 Russian agents were indicted on charges of hacking the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr. Coats said those indictments illustrated Moscow's continuing strategy to undermine the United States' democracy and erode its institutions.     ''The warning lights are blinking red again,'' Mr. Coats said as he cautioned of cyberthreats. ''Today, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.''   Coming just days ahead of President Trump's meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Coats's comments demonstrate the persistent divisions within the administration on Russia -- and on how hard a line senior administration officials should take with Moscow on its cyberspace activities.   Mr. Trump has said he would raise the issue of Russian election interference with Mr. Putin during their meeting in Helsinki, Finland. And Mr. Trump regularly cites some strong actions his administration has taken to punish Moscow, such as expelling 60 Russians accused of intelligence activities. But Mr. Trump and the White House also routinely minimize information about the impact of Moscow's cyberattacks and intrusion efforts on the 2016 election.   The government's national security agencies, particularly the intelligence agencies, have been far more concerned about Russia's 2016 interference campaign -- and efforts still underway.   Mr. Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana, has helped position the intelligence agencies in the more hard-line camp, pushing for more aggressive actions to halt cyberattacks by Russia and other nations. In a speech last month in France, he outlined the recent history of Russian cyberattacks on elections and on candidates critical of Moscow.   In his remarks on Friday, Mr. Coats did not directly address Mr. Trump's coming meeting with Mr. Putin. But Mr. Coats did say that if he was meeting the Russian president, he would deliver a sharp message that the United States knows what the Russians are doing and that Mr. Putin's government is responsible for the cyberattacks.   Mr. Coats also expressed frustration with cyberspace strategies that emphasize only defense, and not offense as well. Evoking President Ronald Reagan's Cold War approach to the Soviet Union, Mr. Coats suggested that if Russia continued to try to take on the United States in the cyberarena, then the administration should ''throw everything we have got into it.''   Seth G. Jones, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Reagan pushed the United States to begin offensive information operations against the Soviet Union. Invoking Reagan, Mr. Jones said, was hardly accidental and was symbolically important because he remains revered by Republicans.   The comments by Mr. Coats reflect the view by the intelligence community that Russia's campaign remains a grave threat.   ''Russia continues to be aggressive across the board,'' Mr. Jones said. ''Much as the Soviets did in the Cold War, the Russian active measures are much bigger than just elections.''   Mr. Coats has previously warned about continuing Russian attempts to influence future elections, including the midterm elections in the fall.   At a Senate hearing this year, Mr. Coats said that Russia viewed the midterm elections as a potential target, and he said Moscow's activities were designed ''to exacerbate social and political fissures in the United States.''   Mr. Coats said on Friday that the intelligence community was working with the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security to support states' efforts to secure their elections.   The federal effort has been hampered by the fact that elections are controlled at the state and local levels. States have had different levels of cooperation with the federal authorities.   While Mr. Coats did not directly address that issue, he mentioned that a problem in one state could throw the midterms or the next presidential election into doubt.   Friday's comments by Mr. Coats at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, appeared aimed at increasing the intensity of his warnings over Russia.   Mr. Coats said Russian and other actors were exploring vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and trying to infiltrate energy, water, nuclear and manufacturing sectors.   ''These actions are persistent, they are pervasive and they are meant to undermine America's democracy,'' Mr. Coats said.   He did not outline any details of what exactly the United States or its intelligence agencies will do to curtail the intrusions. But he did say intelligence and other government agencies will speak more publicly about the threat of cyberattacks and cyberinterference to increase public knowledge.   Mr. Coats said cyberattacks from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran were mounting on American business and government agencies every day.   China has the most adept hackers working for a government, Mr. Coats said. But Beijing's agenda was more focused on stealing information and technical advances, while Moscow remained more interested in dividing the United States from its allies and undermining democracy, he said.   Both the Russian and Chinese governments have repeatedly insisted they are the victims, not the perpetrators, of cyberattacks.    "
President Loosens Secretive Restraints on Ordering Cyberattacks,"President Trump has authorized new, classified orders for the Pentagon's cyberwarriors to conduct offensive attacks against adversaries more freely and frequently, the White House said on Thursday, wiping away Obama-era restrictions that his advisers viewed as too slow and cumbersome. ''Our hands are not as tied as they were in the Obama administration,'' John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, told reporters in announcing a new cyberstrategy.     Mr. Bolton rewrote a draft of the strategy after joining the administration in April. Many of his remarks on Thursday focused on a secret order -- which Mr. Trump signed in August but which has never been publicly described -- that appears to give far more latitude for the newly elevated United States Cyber Command to act with minimal consultation from a number of other government agencies.   The order essentially delegates more power to Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, who took over this year as the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command. During his Senate confirmation hearing in March, General Nakasone complained that America's online adversaries attacked with little concern about retaliation.   ''I would say right now they do not think that much will happen to them,'' said General Nakasone, who previously oversaw the Army's cybercommand. ''They don't fear us.''   But this month, General Nakasone said he was more comfortable with the new guidance issued by the White House, even though the administration has not made any of it public.   Senior officials have said it eliminates a lengthy process of consensus-building across the government -- the Departments of Commerce, Treasury and Homeland Security among them -- before the United States conducts an offensive action.   It is not clear whether Mr. Trump must still approve every major offensive online operation, as Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did.   Mr. Bolton did not shed much light. ''Our presidential directive effectively reversed those restraints, effectively enabling offensive cyberoperations through the relevant departments,'' he said.   He said that since Mr. Trump took office, the administration has ''authorized cyberoperations'' against rivals, though he gave no details.   Much of the strategy that was made public on Thursday strongly echoes similar documents issued by Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. They focus on improving digital defenses for the United States government, bettering training, working with private industry to share information about vulnerabilities and working with allies.   While the words in the strategy differ from the past, the impetus is the same. It did, however, identify specific countries as adversaries.   ''Russia, Iran and North Korea conducted reckless cyberattacks that harmed American and international businesses and our allies and partners without paying costs likely to deter future cyberaggression,'' the strategy read. ''China engaged in cyberenabled economic espionage and trillions of dollars of intellectual property theft.''   But the classified directive appears to be significantly different, as Mr. Bolton said on Thursday.   His indictment of the previous administration omitted the fact that Mr. Obama continued or initiated three of the most aggressive cyberoperations in American history: one to disable Iran's nuclear fuel production, another to attack North Korea's missile programs and a third against online recruitment and communications by the Islamic State.   The first, code-named Olympic Games, was judged successful at destroying about 1,000 nuclear centrifuges for a year. The Korea operation had only mixed results at best, and Mr. Obama's own defense secretary later wrote that the operation against the Islamic State proved largely ineffective.   But Mr. Obama hesitated to strike back at Russia in 2016 after revelations of its breach into the Democratic National Committee, and acted only after the presidential election.   And, as Mr. Bolton noted, the United States declined to name other attackers, including the Chinese, for stealing roughly 22 million files on Americans with security clearances from the Office of Personnel Management. He noted that those files, ''my own included, maybe yours, found a new residence in Beijing.''   Mr. Bolton became the first American official to formally acknowledge what was widely known: that the Chinese government was behind that intrusion.   Additionally, the Trump administration accused North Korea of mounting the WannaCry attack that brought down the British health care system, and Russia of initiating the NotPetya attack that was aimed at Ukraine and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, including to shipping companies like Maersk.   But Mr. Bolton, whose concepts of deterrence were formed in the Cold War, is likely to discover what his predecessors learned: Almost every strategy that worked in deterring nuclear attacks does not fit the digital era, and even figuring out where an attack originated can be a challenge.   The government has grown more skilled at attributing the source of a cyberattack, but the process remains lengthy. By the time a conclusion is reached, it is often too late to mount a successful counterstrike.   Mr. Trump has particularly muddied the waters in assigning blame for attacks, repeatedly expressing doubts that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and members of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The Justice Department has indicted officers of Russia's military intelligence unit, once known as the G.R.U., and the Internet Research Agency, in those attacks.   Part of the strategy calls for the United States to develop what it describes as an international cyberdeterrence initiative, which sounds similar to efforts to develop a theory of nuclear deterrence. The document provides few details, but says the Trump administration will build ''a coalition and develop tailored strategies to ensure adversaries understand the consequences of their malicious cyberbehavior.''   Some of those efforts have already begun: The American accusations against North Korea and Russia last year were immediately echoed by Britain and other Western powers.   Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island who has been active in developing new cyberstrategies, said that the White House approach was focused ''in starkly offensive terms.''   ''I agree that our adversaries need to know that we can -- and will -- challenge them in cyberspace,'' Mr. Langevin said. ''But as the country with the most innovative economy in the world, we must also acknowledge the abiding interest of the United States in encouraging stability in this domain.''

"Russia's Spies, Foiled Again","One has to wonder whether Russia's military hackers want to be exposed, given how often they are. Or are these bungled operations just the tip of the iceberg? On Thursday, the United States, Britain and the Netherlands produced a stunning array of accusations against officers of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service, for cyberattacks involving antidoping agencies, political campaigns, chemical warfare labs and the downing of a passenger jet.    The coordinated revelations about GRU hacking over the past three years confirmed the many reports that have already emerged about a Russian cyberwarfare program working overtime under fanciful names such as BadRabbit, Fancy Bear or Voodoo Bear to push Russia's agendas abroad -- mostly by trying to control the damage from embarrassing revelations about botched Kremlin operations.    In Washington, the Justice Department announced the indictment of seven GRU officers for a series of cyberattacks, including efforts to hack into antidoping agencies in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, in an apparent attempt to stymie their investigations into Russia's systematic doping of its athletes. Three of those named were previously charged by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, with hacking into Democratic Party servers.   Dutch officials, meanwhile, revealed a Russian attempt in April to hack into the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Netherlands, which at the time was investigating the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination by the GRU of a GRU double agent in Britain, Sergei Skripal. The Dutch caught and threw out four Russian GRU agents -- noting that they were also behind an attack to hack a Swiss lab involved in the inquiry.   Britain, for its part, released a report on GRU cyberattacks that disclosed an attempted hack on the Foreign Office and gave more evidence of GRU involvement in the leak of Democratic emails in 2016.   All that, declared the British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, amounted to ''reckless and indiscriminate'' attacks that left Russia isolated in the international community. But unless there are many more far more successful attacks that the United States and its allies have not disclosed, those revealed on Thursday seemed to speak, above all, to the pathetically unsuccessful efforts by Vladimir Putin & Co. to throw their weight around and then try to cover up their failures.   The failed attacks on Mr. Skripal, the industrial-scale doping of Russian athletes and the downing of a Malaysian airliner in 2014 were massively damaging to Russia's standing in the world, and the disclosure that Russian military hackers tried to secretly sneak into agencies investigating them can only make the shame and ridicule greater. As for the 2016 election, the Kremlin must be wondering whether helping to put Donald Trump into the White House was really a triumph, given that it has produced no tangible benefits while generating a huge amount of ill will and a barrage of accusations and investigations.   The Kremlin has responded with its usual ridicule of Western charges, calling them ''a diabolical blend of perfume'' in a rather sick reference to the perfume bottle used to poison Mr. Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent. Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent, seems not to have fathomed that few in the West are fooled by his propaganda antics or impressed by his power plays, and that his irresponsible cyberattacks serve only to further diminish his country's already dismal standing in the world.

U.S. Declines to Sign Macron Declaration Against Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON -- Reflecting reluctance by the Trump administration to limit its options for using offensive and defensive cyberweapons, the United States declined on Monday to sign a vaguely worded international call to protect civilians against cyberattacks and discourage digital meddling in elections. The United States was one of only a few Western nations that chose not to sign on to the nonbinding declaration, which was released by France's president, Emmanuel Macron, during the Paris Peace Forum, timed to the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.     The declaration, the ''Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace,'' was signed by 51 countries, more than 130 companies and 90 universities and nongovernmental groups, and was the latest in a series of efforts to move toward what some call a ''digital Geneva Convention.''   Just as the original Geneva Convention prohibits aiming attacks at civilians, the Paris statement would prohibit ''indiscriminate or systemic harm to individuals and critical infrastructure,'' such as shutting down an electric grid.   It also included a call to ''prevent malign interference by foreign actors aimed at undermining electoral processes though malicious cyberactivities.''   All members of the European Union signed the agreement. Australia and Turkey joined the United States in declining.   Mr. Macron aimed the accord largely at democracies, which meant that the countries most often accused of conducting state-sponsored attacks -- Russia, China, North Korea and Iran -- did not participate in the process.   Israel, which along with the United States conducted the most sophisticated cyberattack in history, the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear enrichment program, also declined to sign.   The United States did not say why it did not sign the accord, and one diplomat, who would not allow the use of his name because he is not authorized to speak publicly on policy issues, said that it was possible that Washington may sign the principles at a later date.   But if past debates over setting norms of behavior for cyberspace are a guide, American officials are leery of any kind of agreement that might make illegal the types of activity -- like espionage, data manipulation or attacks on infrastructure -- that the United States may want to use in a future conflict.   Elections are an interesting example. Congress and many others have condemned the 2016 Russian attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the private email accounts of senior officials in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. But the United States has interfered in foreign elections before, including Italy in the 1940s and Iran and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s, and some officials say that no American president should be forced to give up that tool if it could prevent a war.   Similarly, the Pentagon worries about commitments to avoid using cyberattacks as a prelude to military action. The United States had a secret program, code-named ''Nitro Zeus,'' which called for turning off the power grid in much of Iran if the two countries had found themselves in a conflict over Iran's nuclear program. Such a use of cyberweapons is now a key element in war planning by all of the major world powers.   Still, the fact that companies and governments came together on any kind of vision for keeping the internet free of malicious activity was viewed by some key players as a step forward.   ''Most of the world's democracies are rallying around the need to protect all democracies from cyberattacks,'' said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, who has been among the most vocal in arguing for a digital Geneva Convention. ''You have to start by building a strong coalition among the democracies themselves.''   Much of the statement of principles calls for restrictions on actions Washington has also condemned in the past: the theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets and industrial designs, and attacks on ''the public core of the internet.''   The United States has indicted Chinese, North Korean, Iranian and Russian hackers for offenses including theft of industrial secrets and for attacking Sony Pictures Entertainment to prevent the distribution of a movie that North Korea found offensive. Nonetheless, the administration's aversion to international agreements in general may have made it leery of joining the announcement on Monday.   Governments were outnumbered by companies and nongovernmental groups as signatories. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and I.B.M. all signed on. Three of the five countries that are part of what is known as the ''Five Eyes,'' -- the English-speaking victors of World War II who share intelligence information -- also signed: Britain, Canada and New Zealand.

Trump's National Security Chief Calls Russian Interference 'Incontrovertible',"MUNICH -- Just hours after the Justice Department indicted 13 Russians in what it charged was a broad conspiracy to alter the 2016 election, President Trump's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, accused Moscow of engaging in a campaign of ""disinformation, subversion and espionage"" that he said Washington would continue to expose. The evidence of a Russian effort to interfere in the election ""is now incontrovertible,"" General McMaster said at the Munich Security Conference, an annual meeting of European and American diplomats and security experts, including several senior Russian officials. On Friday, just hours before the indictment, the top White House official for cyberissues accused Russia of ""the most destructive cyberattack in human history,"" against Ukraine last summer.  Taken together, the statements appeared to mark a major turn in the administration's willingness to directly confront the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and C.I.A. Director Mike Pompeo also attended the Munich conference, and while they did not speak publicly, in private meetings with others here they reiterated similar statements. The comments highlighted a sharp division inside the administration about how to talk about the Russian covert efforts, with only Mr. Trump and a few of his close advisers holding back from acknowledging the Russian role or talking about a larger strategy to deter future attacks. The indictment characterized the cyberattacks and social media fraud as part of a larger effort by Russia to undermine the United States. A senior administration official called the effort to confront Russia ""a significant point of contention"" within the administration. After the indictment on Friday Mr. Trump declared in a Twitter post that ""the results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong -- no collusion!"" He made no mention of Russia as a ""revisionist power,"" the description used in his own National Security Strategy, or of the elaborate $1.2 million-a-month effort that the indictment indicated Russia's Internet Research Agency spent in an effort to discredit the election system and ultimately to support his candidacy. Vice President Mike Pence, speaking this past week in Washington, misstated American intelligence conclusions about the election hacking, arguing ""it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any effect on the outcome of the 2016 election."" The intelligence chiefs have said they have not, and cannot, reach such a conclusion. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, cited Mr. Pence's comments during the session here Saturday to make the case that Russia did nothing wrong. ""So until we see the facts, everything else is just blabber,"" he said. The man who served as the Russian ambassador to the United States during the period covered by the indictments, Sergey I. Kislyak, picked up on a favorite theme of Mr. Trump's: questioning the credibility of the F.B.I. and intelligence agency assessments. ""I have seen so many indictments and accusations against Russians,"" Mr. Kislyak said on Saturday afternoon. ""I am not sure I can trust American law enforcement to be the most truthful source against Russians."" He added, ""The allegations being mounted against us are simply fantasies."" Mr. Kislyak, who has been caught up in the investigation because of meetings with Trump campaign officials during his time as ambassador, went on to cite a study, which he said he was keeping in his briefcase, that proved the ""main source of computer attacks in the world is not Russia. It is the United States."" The accusations and counteraccusations about cyber- and social media attacks were the main point of division between the Americans and the Russians, but hardly the only ones expressed at the conference. Mr. Kislyak argued that the Trump administration's new nuclear strategy involved the manufacture of low-yield weapons and made nuclear war more probable. The Americans argued they were just matching Russian capabilities and charged that Moscow was in continued violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, limiting tactical weapons. Yet the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and others, and the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to spread propaganda, dominated the discussion and reflected how quickly the use of these techniques has become the new battleground in a very different kind of post-Cold War conflict. The White House cybercoordinator, Rob Joyce, was particularly direct in his accusations that Russia was behind the broad attack on Ukraine last June, called ""NotPetya."" He described the attack as ""indiscriminate"" and noted that it paralyzed operations far beyond Ukraine, the intended target, and included the Maersk shipping system. He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding ""we will not telegraph these punches."" Mr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. ""We are going to conduct cyberoperations,"" he said. But ""we need to do it in a responsible, balanced way."" General McMaster, in his comments, argued that Russia had bridged the partisan divides in the United States, citing a 98 to 2 vote in the Senate to impose Russian sanctions. He did not mention that the administration has yet to impose those sanctions, saying the threat of them alone has begun to change Russian behavior. ""That sanctions bill has not yet been used as a tool against the Russians,"" Christopher Painter, a former coordinator for cyberissues at the State Department, who also attended the conference. ""The question now is whether they will actually use it to create consequences. I don't know."" General McMaster was questioned by the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russian Federation Council, the country's equivalent of the Senate, about whether the United States was ready to enter into some kind of negotiation with Russia about the use of cyberweapons. It was not the time for that yet, General McMaster said, adding, ""I'm surprised there are any Russian cyberexperts available based on how active they have been in undermining the democracies"" of the world.

"From the Start, Trump Has Muddied a Clear Message: Putin Interfered","WASHINGTON -- Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election. The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation. Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed. The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.  On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin's denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, ""Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?"" Mr. Trump shot back, ""No"" -- directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.) Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, ""because he's in charge of the country."" In the run-up to this week's ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency. The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the ""Steele dossier."" That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump's activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied. According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin's role in the election interference. They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash. And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin's own role. That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified. Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security. Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks. The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called ""hand-to-hand combat"" to dig in. The pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, fit the same pattern. After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said ""Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries"" were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations -- including the D.N.C. Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, ""there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election."" Mr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from. ""I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,"" he said in testimony in May 2017. ""And they were very aggressive."" For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered. Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton's loss in the election. Mr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia's election interference. Only Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.) And the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling. In March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security. Just last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were ""blinking red"" and called Russia the ""most aggressive foreign actor, no question."" ""And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,"" he said. Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm. ""The intelligence community's assessment has not changed,"" Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. ""My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day."" The Russian efforts are ""aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,"" he continued. ""We haven't yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level."" ""It's a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus."" Almost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia's election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics. He dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a ""witch hunt"" against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton's home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia's role -- and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump's immediate orbit may have worked with them. In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow's cyberskills were so good that the government's hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible. Since then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure -- as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday -- he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings. That is what happened again this week, twice. Mr. Trump's statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack. That contributed to Mr. Trump's decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered -- although he also veered off script to declare: ""Could be other people also. A lot of people out there."" Follow David Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter: @SangerNYT and @AllMattNYT. Adam Goldman contributed reporting. Related Articles  "
"Russia Targeted Investigators Trying to Expose Its Misdeeds, Western Allies Say","WASHINGTON -- Western allies accused Russian intelligence officers on Thursday of launching cyberattacks against organizations around the globe that challenged Russian wrongdoing, exposed Kremlin disinformation campaigns or took on President Vladimir V. Putin. Officers operating near Red Square sought to hack the British foreign ministry, antidoping agencies in Colorado Springs and Canada, and investigators examining the shooting down of a Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine in 2014, the officials said. Other Russian officers armed with mobile computer equipment traveled to the Netherlands in April to tap into the headquarters of the world's chemical weapons watchdog, which was investigating the poisoning in Britain a month earlier of a Russian former spy and his daughter. Those officers were caught and expelled. Seeking to deter Moscow, officials in Washington, London and Amsterdam released extraordinarily detailed accounts of Russian misdeeds on Thursday in intelligence reports and a Justice Department indictment charging seven Russian officers.  They named the officers, published photographs of them and their equipment, and released maps charting their travel and their targets. One officer caught in the Netherlands, they said, was carrying a receipt for a taxi ride to the Moscow airport from the street outside the headquarters of the military intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. The complaints echoed the case that British authorities recently made against Russia in the poisoning of the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, by publishing photographs of two Russian officers and other evidence. American officials also expanded the constellation of cyberattacks they blamed on Russia, which they had previously limited to election interference. The accusations also demonstrated that even while its hacking of the Democratic National Committee was underway, the G.R.U. was conducting similar operations around the world. ""The defendants believed that they could use their perceived anonymity to act with impunity, in their own countries and on territories of other sovereign nations, to undermine international institutions and to distract from their government's own wrongdoing,"" said John C. Demers, the assistant attorney general for national security. ""They were wrong."" As with previous Justice Department criminal complaints against hackers from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, the indictments were unlikely to lead to arrests. But taken together, the accusations formed the West's latest public shaming of the Kremlin, over malfeasance that President Trump has shown reluctance to condemn. In the case of election interference in the United States, he has cast doubt that it ever happened. Instead, Vice President Mike Pence denounced China on a number of fronts on Thursday, saying that its influence campaigns were more worrisome than Russia's. ""What the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country,"" he said. He made no reference to the Russian indictments. The Kremlin dismissed the accusations. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry called them the result of a ""rich imagination"" and ""some kind of diabolical perfume cocktail,"" Russian state media reported. The combined effort by Western officials is based on a theory that Mr. Putin and his aides can be embarrassed into paring back their operations. But past cases cast doubt on that theory. American intelligence agencies accused the Russians, and ultimately Mr. Putin, of the Democratic National Committee hack in 2016; Thursday's allegations documented misconduct this year, by the same agency and, in some cases, the same operatives. Of the seven Russian officers charged by the Justice Department, three were also indicted in July by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for interfering in the 2016 election. The new Justice Department case did not emerge from the Mueller investigation, Mr. Demers said, but added, ""They evince the same methods of computer intrusion and the same overarching Russian strategic goal: to pursue its interests through illegal influence and disinformation operations aimed at muddying or altering perceptions of the truth."" The indictment primarily focused on allegations that the Russian officers hacked into antidoping agencies and sporting federations, including the global soccer organization FIFA, and stole private medical information about roughly 250 athletes from 30 countries. The hackers released the data ""selectively, and sometimes misleadingly,"" in retaliation for the revelations of a state-sponsored Russian doping program that led to a ban on the Russian team from the 2018 Winter Olympics, prosecutors said. The Dutch intelligence officials also contributed evidence to the hacks of the sports groups. The authorities who foiled the Russian operation in the Netherlands seized a laptop that had a picture of one of the G.R.U. officers with a Russian athlete during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil. It also contained evidence that a Russian spy stayed in the same Lausanne, Switzerland, hotel as a Canadian antidoping official during a meeting of the World Anti-Doping Agency as it investigated allegations of Russian doping. After the Canadian official logged on to the hotel's Wi-Fi network, the Russian and some of his colleagues used it to illegally access his laptop, according to the Justice Department indictment. The Canadian later noticed a strange message in his sent mail riddled with typos and a fake signature. Investigators found a malicious link embedded in the email; Russian intelligence had apparently used it to stealthily access the Canadian antidoping agency's network for weeks in the fall of 2016. Beginning that September, officers from G.R.U. Unit 74455 released information stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency. Claiming to be ""hacktivists,"" court papers show they went by the name Fancy Bears' Hack Team, an ironic reference to the name that investigators have given to that G.R.U. unit and another. As they did that summer and fall with stolen Democratic emails, the Russians played off the Western news media's hunger for scoops. Through this July, the indictment alleged, the Fancy Bears' Hack Team communicated with about 70 reporters, doling out stories on an exclusive basis. In one case, the Justice Department alleged, an unidentified reporter suggested ways for the spies to sift through their stolen data for nuggets of news. When articles resulting from their documents were published, the Russian intelligence officers distributed them ""in an apparent attempt to amplify the exposure and effect of their message,"" the indictment said. ""All of this was done to undermine those organizations' efforts to ensure the integrity of the Olympic and other games,"" Mr. Demers said. One officer, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, was also charged with creating a fake website and sending spear-phishing emails to employees of Westinghouse Electric Company, based near Pittsburgh, who worked on nuclear reactor technology. Westinghouse has supplied Ukraine with nuclear fuel, but Mr. Demers declined to detail whether the larger aim of the Russian operation was to steal nuclear technology or interfere with fuel deliveries to Ukraine, which Mr. Putin has sought to destabilize. One of the most detailed and well-documented of the charges involved the attack on the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The group was investigating the poisoning in March of the Skripals. British officials have accused Russia of using a nerve agent to try to kill Mr. Skripal, whom Mr. Putin on Wednesday called ""simply a scumbag"" and ""a traitor to the motherland."" The attack on the O.P.C.W., as the group is known, unfolded over three days before it was thwarted. Dutch officials identified four Russian military intelligence operatives -- two of whom specialize in cyberattacks -- soon after they arrived in Amsterdam on April 10 carrying diplomatic passports, said Maj. Gen. Onno Eichelsheim, the director of the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service. They were also behind an attempt to hack a Swiss laboratory that tested a nerve agent for the O.P.C.W. in the Skripal poisoning and had also done testing in 2013 of the agent used in a chemical attack in Syria, a Russian ally, Dutch officials said. British intelligence officials alerted their Dutch counterparts that the Russian officers intended to conduct reconnaissance for a hacking operation, General Eichelsheim said. A day after their arrival, the spies rented a Citroën hatchback to travel to and around The Hague. One of them, Alexey Minin, took several pictures around O.P.C.W. headquarters, according to Dutch officials. On their third day in the Netherlands, the Russian officers parked the Citroën in the lot of a Marriott Hotel next door, its trunk pointed toward the headquarters of the arms control organization. Inside the car was a sophisticated device for penetrating a Wi-Fi network to gather the login credentials of its users, its antenna hidden under a jacket. After about 30 minutes, the Dutch authorities moved in on the Citroën, catching the Russians in the act and, General Eichelsheim said, preventing ""severe damage"" to the O.P.C.W. The Dutch recovered the taxi receipt and the laptop, whose internet search history included evidence that train tickets were purchased for an April 17 trip from the Netherlands to Bern, Switzerland, about 25 miles from the Swiss facility, said to be their next target. The Dutch also seized a mobile phone that one of the Russian agents tried to destroy and discovered that it had been used four days earlier at G.R.U. headquarters. They also found evidence that a Russian officer had been in a Kuala Lumpur hotel near where Malaysian government officials were investigating the 2014 crash of the passenger jet over Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people. In May, international investigators said Russia had supplied the missile that downed the plane. And British officials identified a group of hackers known as Sandworm as the culprits in Russia's attempt to hack the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and said that the same Russian officers were behind attempted cyberattacks in April on the British Defense Science and Technology Laboratory.

Saudis' Image Makers: A Troll Army and a Twitter Insider,"Each morning, Jamal Khashoggi would check his phone to discover what fresh hell had been unleashed while he was sleeping. He would see the work of an army of Twitter trolls, ordered to attack him and other influential Saudis who had criticized the kingdom's leaders. He sometimes took the attacks personally, so friends made a point of calling frequently to check on his mental state. ""The mornings were the worst for him because he would wake up to the equivalent of sustained gunfire online,"" said Maggie Mitchell Salem, a friend of Mr. Khashoggi's for more than 15 years. Mr. Khashoggi's online attackers were part of a broad effort dictated by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his close advisers to silence critics both inside Saudi Arabia and abroad. Hundreds of people work at a so-called troll farm in Riyadh to smother the voices of dissidents like Mr. Khashoggi. The vigorous push also appears to include the grooming -- not previously reported -- of a Saudi employee at Twitter whom Western intelligence officials suspected of spying on user accounts to help the Saudi leadership.  The killing by Saudi agents of Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, has focused the world's attention on the kingdom's intimidation campaign against influential voices raising questions about the darker side of the crown prince. The young royal has tightened his grip on the kingdom while presenting himself in Western capitals as the man to reform the hidebound Saudi state. This portrait of the kingdom's image management crusade is based on interviews with seven people involved in those efforts or briefed on them; activists and experts who have studied them; and American and Saudi officials, along with messages seen by The New York Times that described the inner workings of the troll farm. Saudi operatives have mobilized to harass critics on Twitter, a wildly popular platform for news in the kingdom since the Arab Spring uprisings began in 2010. Saud al-Qahtani, a top adviser to Crown Prince Mohammed who was fired on Saturday in the fallout from Mr. Khashoggi's killing, was the strategist behind the operation, according to United States and Saudi officials, as well as activist organizations. Many Saudis had hoped that Twitter would democratize discourse by giving everyday citizens a voice, but Saudi Arabia has instead become an illustration of how authoritarian governments can manipulate social media to silence or drown out critical voices while spreading their own version of reality. ""In the Gulf, the stakes are so high for those who engage in dissent that the benefits of using social media are outweighed by the negatives, and in Saudi Arabia in particular,"" said Marc Owen Jones, a lecturer in the history of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula at Exeter University in Britain. Neither Saudi officials nor Mr. Qahtani responded to requests for comment about the kingdom's efforts to control online conversations. Before his death, Mr. Khashoggi was launching projects to combat online abuse and to try to reveal that Crown Prince Mohammed was mismanaging the country. In September, Mr. Khashoggi wired $5,000 to Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident living in Canada, who was creating a volunteer army to combat the government trolls on Twitter. The volunteers called themselves the ""Electronic Bees."" Eleven days before Mr. Khashoggi died in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, he wrote on Twitter that the Bees were coming. Swarming and Stifling Critics on Twitter One arm of the crackdown on dissidents originates from offices and homes in and around Riyadh, where hundreds of young men hunt on Twitter for voices and conversations to silence. This is the troll farm, described by three people briefed on the project and the messages among group members. Its directors routinely discuss ways to combat dissent, settling on sensitive themes like the war in Yemen or women's rights. They then turn to their well-organized army of ""social media specialists"" via group chats in apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, sending them lists of people to threaten, insult and intimidate; daily tweet quotas to fill; and pro-government messages to augment. The bosses also send memes that their employees can use to mock dissenters, like an image of Crown Prince Mohammed dancing with a sword, akin to the cartoons of Pepe the Frog that supporters of President Trump used to undermine opponents. The specialists scour Twitter for conversations on the assigned topics and post messages from the several accounts they each run. Sometimes, when contentious discussions take off, they publish pornographic images to goose engagement with their own posts and distract users from more relevant conversations. Other times, if one account is blocked by too many other users, they simply close it and open a new one. In one conversation viewed by The Times, dozens of leaders decided to mute critics of Saudi Arabia's military attacks on Yemen by reporting the messages to Twitter as ""sensitive."" Such reported posts are one of the things Twitter considers as signals when it decides to hide content from other users, blunting its impact. Twitter has had difficulty combating the trolls. The company can detect and disable the machine-like behaviors of bot accounts, but it has a harder time picking up on the humans tweeting on behalf of the Saudi government. The specialists found the jobs through Twitter itself, responding to ads that said only that an employer sought young men willing to tweet for about 10,000 Saudi riyals a month, equivalent to about $3,000. The political nature of the work was revealed only after they were interviewed and expressed interest in the job. According to the people The Times interviewed, some of the specialists felt they would have been targeted as possible dissenters themselves if they had turned down the job. The specialists heard directors speak often of Mr. Qahtani. Labeled by activists and writers as the ""troll master,"" ""Saudi Arabia's Steve Bannon"" and ""lord of the flies"" -- for the bots and online attackers sometimes called ""flies"" by their victims -- Mr. Qahtani had gained influence since the young crown prince consolidated power. He ran media operations inside the royal court, which involved directing the country's local media, arranging interviews for foreign journalists with the crown prince, and using his Twitter following of 1.35 million to marshal the kingdom's online defenders against enemies including Qatar, Iran and Canada, as well as dissident Saudi voices like Mr. Khashoggi's. For a while, he tweeted using the hashtag #The_Black_List, calling on his followers to suggest perceived enemies of the kingdom. ""Saudi Arabia and its brothers do what they say. That's a promise,"" he tweeted last year. ""Add every name you think should be added to #The_Black_List using the hashtag. We will filter them and track them starting now."" A Suspected Mole Inside Twitter Twitter executives first became aware of a possible plot to infiltrate user accounts at the end of 2015, when Western intelligence officials told them that the Saudis were grooming an employee, Ali Alzabarah, to spy on the accounts of dissidents and others, according to five people briefed on the matter. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Alzabarah had joined Twitter in 2013 and had risen through the ranks to an engineering position that gave him access to the personal information and account activity of Twitter's users, including phone numbers and I.P. addresses, unique identifiers for devices connected to the internet. The intelligence officials told the Twitter executives that Mr. Alzabarah had grown closer to Saudi intelligence operatives, who eventually persuaded him to peer into several user accounts, according to three of the people briefed on the matter. Caught off guard by the government outreach, the Twitter executives placed Mr. Alzabarah on administrative leave, questioned him and conducted a forensic analysis to determine what information he may have accessed. They could not find evidence that he had handed over Twitter data to the Saudi government, but they nonetheless fired him in December 2015. Mr. Alzabarah returned to Saudi Arabia shortly after, taking few possessions with him. He now works with the Saudi government, a person briefed on the matter said. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment. Mr. Alzabarah did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Saudi officials. On Dec. 11, 2015, Twitter sent out safety notices to the owners of a few dozen accounts Mr. Alzabarah had accessed. Among them were security and privacy researchers, surveillance specialists, policy academics and journalists. A number of them worked for the Tor project, an organization that trains activists and reporters on how to protect their privacy. Citizens in countries with repressive governments have long used Tor to circumvent firewalls and evade government surveillance. ""As a precaution, we are alerting you that your Twitter account is one of a small group of accounts that may have been targeted by state-sponsored actors,"" the emails from Twitter said. Pursuing a Revamped Image The Saudis' sometimes ruthless image-making campaign is also a byproduct of the kingdom's increasingly fragile position internationally. For decades, their coffers bursting from the world's thirst for oil, Saudi leaders cared little about what other countries thought of the kingdom, its governance or its anachronistic restrictions on women. But Saudi Arabia is confronting a more uncertain economic future as oil prices have fallen and competition among energy suppliers has grown, and Crown Prince Mohammed has tried relentlessly to attract foreign investment into the country -- in part by portraying it as a vibrant, more socially progressive country than it once was. Yet the government's social media manipulation tracks with crackdowns in recent years in other authoritarian states, said Alexei Abrahams, a research fellow at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. Even for conversations involving millions of tweets, a few hundred or a few thousand influential accounts drive the discussion, he said, citing new research. The Saudi government appears to have realized this and tried to take control of the conversation, he added. ""From the regime's point of view,"" he said, ""if there are only a few thousand accounts driving the discourse, you can just buy or threaten the activists, and that significantly shapes the conversation."" As the Saudi government tried to remake its image, it carefully tracked how some of its more controversial decisions were received, and how the country's most influential citizens online shaped those perceptions. After the country announced economic austerity measures in 2015 to offset low oil prices and control a widening budget gap, McKinsey &amp; Company, the consulting firm, measured the public reception of those policies. In a nine-page report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, McKinsey found that the measures received twice as much coverage on Twitter as in the country's traditional news media or blogs, and that negative sentiment far outweighed positive reactions on social media. Three people were driving the conversation on Twitter, the firm found: the writer Khalid al-Alkami; Mr. Abdulaziz, the young dissident living in Canada; and an anonymous user who went by Ahmad. After the report was issued, Mr. Alkami was arrested, the human rights group ALQST said. Mr. Abdulaziz said that Saudi government officials imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone, an account supported by a researcher at Citizen Lab. Ahmad, the anonymous account, was shut down. McKinsey said the austerity report was an internal document based on publicly available information and not prepared for any government entity. ""We are horrified by the possibility, however remote, that it could have been misused,"" a McKinsey spokesman said in a statement. ""We have seen no evidence to suggest that it was misused, but we are urgently investigating how and with whom the document was shared."" Adam Goldman and Karam Shoumali contributed reporting.

"After a Hiatus, China Accelerates Cyberspying Efforts to Obtain U.S. Technology","WASHINGTON -- Three years ago, President Barack Obama struck a deal with China that few thought was possible: President Xi Jinping agreed to end his nation's yearslong practice of breaking into the computer systems of American companies, military contractors and government agencies to obtain designs, technology and corporate secrets, usually on behalf of China's state-owned firms. The pact was celebrated by the Obama administration as one of the first arms-control agreements for cyberspace -- and for 18 months or so, the number of Chinese attacks plummeted. But the victory was fleeting. Soon after President Trump took office, China's cyberespionage picked up again and, according to intelligence officials and analysts, accelerated in the last year as trade conflicts and other tensions began to poison relations between the world's two largest economies.  The nature of China's espionage has also changed. The hackers of the People's Liberation Army -- whose famed Unit 61398 tore through American companies until its operations from a base in Shanghai were exposed in 2013 -- were forced to stand down, some of them indicted by the United States. But now, the officials and analysts say, they have begun to be replaced by stealthier operatives in the country's intelligence agencies. The new operatives have intensified their focus on America's commercial and industrial prowess, and on technologies that the Chinese believe can give them a military advantage. That, in turn, has prompted a flurry of criminal cases, including the extraordinary arrest and extradition from Belgium of a Chinese intelligence official in October. Trump administration officials said the arrest reflected a more determined counterattack against a threat that has infuriated some of the country's most powerful corporations. ""We have certainly seen the behavior change over the past year,"" said Rob Joyce, Mr. Trump's former White House cybercoordinator, speaking at the Aspen Cyber Summit in San Francisco this month. Mr. Trump and administration officials often suggest that all technology-acquisition efforts by China amount to theft. In doing so, they are blurring the line between stealing technology and negotiated deals in which corporations agree to transfer technology to Chinese manufacturing or marketing partners in return for access to China's market -- a practice American companies often view as a form of corporate blackmail but one distinct from outright theft. The stealing of industrial designs and intellectual property -- from blueprints for power plants or high-efficiency solar panels, or the F-35 fighter jet -- is a long-running problem. The United States trade representative published a report this month detailing old and new examples. But the administration has never said whether cracking down on theft and cyberattacks is part of the negotiations or simply a demand that China cease activity that Beijing has already acknowledged, in the Obama years, was illegitimate. But as Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi prepare to meet at the Group of 20 gathering in Argentina this weekend, China's corporate espionage has once again emerged as a core American grievance. Whatever the reason for the renewed hacking, it is a cautionary tale as Mr. Trump tries to use tariffs and threats of more restrictions to strike a new trade deal with Mr. Xi, one that presumably would address, once again, the Chinese practices that Mr. Obama thought he had halted. American trade and intelligence officials, as well as experts from private cybersecurity firms, all acknowledged that the previous agreement had completely fallen apart. And that, they agreed, has made it still more difficult to imagine how any new agreement struck between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would become a permanent solution to a problem that reaches back years, and seems rooted in completely different views of what constitutes reasonable competition. ""Our two systems are so dissimilar that I think there was never real hope that crafting an agreement like this would last that long anyway,"" said Matthew Brazil, a former government official who now runs Madeira Security Consulting, a firm in San Jose, Calif. Why the espionage has spiked again is a matter of debate. Some officials and analysts call it a cause of the worsening trade relationships, others a symptom. Still others argued that the tightening of American export controls in critical industries like aerospace and rules on Chinese investment in Silicon Valley -- which China sees as part of a ""containment"" strategy to blunt its industrial and geopolitical rise -- has led the Chinese once again to try to steal what they cannot buy. The impetus for the 2015 accord was one of the most blatant espionage operations ever conducted by the Chinese government: the removal, over a period of more than a year, of 22 million security-clearance files on American officials, military personnel, contractors and American intelligence officers. The Obama administration, partly out of embarrassment, said little about the breach, never naming the Chinese publicly -- except by mistake when the director of national intelligence blurted out the truth. Privately, American intelligence officials concluded that the Chinese were assembling a giant database of who worked with whom, and on what, in the American national security sphere, and were applying ""big data"" techniques to analyze the information. The C.I.A. could not move some officers to China, for fear their cover had been blown. Publicly, Obama administration officials offered millions of Americans credit protection for a few years in the wake of the data breach -- as if Mr. Xi's agents were looking for credit card numbers. But Mr. Obama used the episode, and the threat of sanctions, to force Mr. Xi into what he called a ""common understanding"" that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions to poach intellectual property, and that they would together seek ""international rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace."" All that was forgotten after Mr. Obama left office. Mr. Trump has never referred publicly to the 2015 agreement. Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who is now a China analyst for the International Crisis Group, said that China had a fundamentally different understanding of what was acceptable in espionage. While the Central Intelligence Agency, say, would not act to help a private company gain a competitive advantage over a foreign competitor, he said, China's Communist Party, which has control over practically all aspects of policy there, would make no such distinction. ""If you view economic growth as an existential pillar of your party's political legitimacy and in fact your national security, it follows that you would do anything possible to maintain that competitive edge,"" he said. Indeed, the latest spike in corporate espionage cases -- including some not yet made public -- has focused on industries critical to Mr. Xi's Made in China 2025 program. That is a plan to jump ahead of the United States and others in cutting-edge industries like aerospace, automation, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. ""We are seeing it in high tech, in law firms, in insurance companies,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, one of the founders of CrowdStrike, who early in his career was one of the first to identify the teams of state-run Chinese hackers aiming at the United States, and who tracked their retreat after the 2015 pledge. With the arrest of the intelligence officer in Belgium in October, the Trump administration claimed it had exposed what the assistant F.B.I. director, Bill Priestap, called ""the Chinese government's direct oversight of economic espionage against the United States."" That case involves Xu Yanjun, a deputy division director in the Jiangsu branch of the Ministry of State Security, China's main intelligence agency. According to a secret criminal complaint filed in Ohio in March but not unsealed until October, Mr. Xu tried to recruit an employee of General Electric Aviation and entice him to provide proprietary information about jet fan blade designs. Instead the employee alerted the company, which went to the F.B.I. and organized a sting. Mr. Xu flew from China to Belgium in April on the hope he would be able to copy the employee's computer hard drive. He was arrested on April 1 when he arrived in Brussels and was extradited to the United States on Oct. 9, the day before the Justice Department made the case public. China's Foreign Ministry denounced the criminal case as ""pure fabrication,"" but it has neither confirmed nor denied that Mr. Xu was an intelligence officer. China's relatively muted reaction could be an effort to minimize attention on an embarrassing intelligence failure and leave room for quiet negotiations for an exchange. Mr. Xu's was the most high profile of several recent cases, including two others that had links to the Ministry of State Security's branch in Jiangsu Province, which extends north from Shanghai. In September, the Justice Department announced the arrest of Ji Chaoqun, a 27-year-old graduate student who had joined the Army Reserves under a special waiver for foreigners. The F.B.I. affidavit in the case said that Mr. Ji's handler -- presumably Mr. Xu -- had been arrested, allowing the bureau to send an undercover officer to meet the student in April. Mr. Ji, the affidavit said, had been recruited to gather background information about eight potential recruits for the Jiangsu branch. Mr. Xu, who went by at least two aliases, often claimed to represent the Jiangsu Association for International Science and Technology Cooperation and Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, both based in the provincial capital, Nanjing. The reasons Jiangsu has become a hotbed of China's cyberespionage are not entirely clear, though it is an important manufacturing center, with many foreign investments, and is thus one of China's richest provinces. In 2016, the director of the Jiangsu intelligence branch, Liu Yang, declared that ""the national security departments should actively cooperate and promote enterprises"" in their efforts to expand and compete globally, according to a report from the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce. In January, Mr. Liu was promoted and is now the vice governor of the province. Another American criminal case of espionage in the same region of China was announced Oct. 30. The Justice Department accused two other intelligence officers from that branch, as well as five hackers and two employees of a French aerospace company in Suzhou. The target was Safran, which operates a joint venture, CFM International, that builds jet engines with General Electric. The hackers were accused of using a variety of sophisticated techniques and tools against the Suzhou plant, and against other companies. But as in the cases the Obama administration brought, the suspects are believed to still be in China and thus beyond the reach of American law enforcement. David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Steven Lee Myers from Beijing.  PHOTO: General Electric Aviation&amp;rsquo;s factory in Cincinnati.

Fund-Raiser For Trump Claims Hack By Qatar,"LONDON -- A cyberwar in the Persian Gulf reverberated in the United States this week as a top Republican fund-raiser accused agents for Qatar of hacking into his email to plant damaging articles in the American news media. The fund-raiser, Elliott Broidy, 60, a national deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, is the owner of a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to provide services to the United Arab Emirates. Qatar called Mr. Broidy's charges a false ''diversionary tactic to distract from the serious allegations against himself and his client, the United Arab Emirates.''     Mr. Broidy and Qatar each threatened legal actions.   The dispute illustrates how conflicts around the globe can echo through American news media, politics and courts, as rivals compete for the favor of Washington and the sympathies of the West.   Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are both small, conservative, oil-rich monarchies and close American allies, but they have been locked for years in an escalating feud. The U.A.E. has accused Qatar of destabilizing the region by supporting political Islam, and, with Saudi Arabia, the Emiratis have led a monthslong campaign to blockade and isolate Qatar.   Qatar disputes the charges and accuses the United Arab Emirates of bullying its neighbors.   At least three sets of documents that appear to have been hacked from Mr. Broidy's personal email have been passed in recent days to several journalists at multiple news organizations, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, in a coordinated attempt to discredit Mr. Broidy. His allies note that the tactic being used against him resembles a long series of leaks, over more than a year, from the email accounts of the Emirati ambassador to the United States, Yousef al-Otaiba.   Both are vocal critics of Qatar; Al Jazeera, the Qatari-owned news network, has often trumpeted news of the leaks; and allies of Mr. Otaiba have also sought to blame Qatar. But anonymous intermediaries have distributed the leaks, and no definitive evidence of responsibility has emerged.   In a public letter released over the weekend to the Qatari ambassador to Washington, Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad al-Thani, Mr. Broidy accused ''registered and unregistered agents'' both inside and outside of the United States of carrying out ''hostile intelligence operations against United States citizens.''   ''Your government's actions against U.S. citizens will certainly jeopardize your nation's relationship with the United States at a sensitive and costly political time,'' Mr. Broidy added.   In a statement, a spokesman for Qatar denied that it had engaged in or paid for any such crimes, including hacking, and threatened legal action ''to protect its reputation.''   In calling Mr. Broidy's charges an attempted ''distraction,'' the Qataris were apparently alluding to a Times article that cited leaked documents. It raised questions about the possibility that Mr. Broidy might have sought to profit by selling his influence with the Trump administration to the United Arab Emirates.   Mr. Broidy was introduced to the de facto ruler of the U.A.E. by the crown prince's adviser, George Nader. Last fall, Mr. Broidy sent Mr. Nader a detailed report on extensive advocacy for Emirati goals during a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office. And Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has asked witnesses about the possible flow of illegal Emirati campaign contributions to Mr. Trump through Mr. Nader. A spokesman for Mr. Broidy said he had done nothing wrong, and a lawyer for Mr. Nader did not respond to messages.   Both sides of the Persian Gulf dispute have traded allegations of hacking for months. Hackers briefly took control of the website of Qatar's official news agency last summer, and posted a false account of a speech by the emir that appeared contrived to irk the Arab states and Washington. The emir was quoted as describing ''tensions'' with President Trump and speculating that he might not last in office, recommending friendship with Iran and praising the Palestinian militants of Hamas. Then the emir attested to his own ''good'' relations with Israel.   Saudi Arabian and Emirati news networks continued repeating false news of the Qatari emir's shocking speech long after the emir had publicly denied making it. The two allies began a boycott of Qatar days later. Qatari and American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, blame the U.A.E. for the hack.    "
Russian Man Held in Hack Of U.S. Firms Is Extradited,"PRAGUE -- A Russian man accused of hacking the systems of three American technology companies in 2012, possibly compromising the personal information of more than 100 million users, was extradited to the United States from the Czech Republic on Friday. The man, Yevgeniy A. Nikulin, appeared in Federal District Court in San Francisco after arriving in the city around 6 a.m. He pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley scheduled his next court appearance for next week.     ''This is deeply troubling behavior once again emanating from Russia,'' Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. ''We will not tolerate criminal cyberattacks and will make it a priority to investigate and prosecute these crimes, regardless of the country where they originate.''   Mr. Nikulin had been held in the Czech Republic since the authorities there arrested him in 2016. His case quickly turned into a battle between Washington and Moscow over whether he should be tried in the United States.   He was arrested just two days before the Obama administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other institutions and prominent individuals.   In fighting Mr. Nikulin's extradition to the United States, his lawyer had argued that the case against him was politically motivated. The Russian government argued separately that it had jurisdiction in the case after a Moscow court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Nikulin in November 2016 in the 2009 theft of $3,450 via a website called WebMoney.   More broadly, the Kremlin claims that the United States has unfairly targeted Russians around the world for political purposes. The Russian ambassador in Prague has said the case against Mr. Nikulin was an effort to ''extend the jurisprudence of American law to the territory of third countries.''   This year, Spain extradited to the United States two Russians suspected of hacking. Another Russian, Aleksandr V. Vinnik, is being held in Greece pending extradition requests from Washington and Moscow.   Mr. Nikulin's extradition was ordered by the Czech Ministry of Justice on Thursday.   The charges were laid out in an indictment unsealed after he was arrested. He is accused of hacking into the computer networks at LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring; damaging computers used by LinkedIn and Formspring employees; and using their credentials for further intrusions.   The charges include three counts of computer intrusion, two counts of causing damage to a protected computer, two counts of aggravated identity theft, one count of trafficking and one count of conspiracy. If convicted, Mr. Nikulin could be sentenced to more than 30 years in prison and fined more than $1 million.   Mr. Nikulin's arrest and court filings related to the case offered an early look into the shadowy world of Russian hacking. The American authorities say Russian hackers are able to act with impunity as long as they do not choose targets within their own country.   The competing extradition claims by the United States and Russia caused a schism in the Czech government. President Milos Zeman, who has openly courted President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, pressed the Kremlin's case. Andrej Babis, the acting prime minister, whose affinities lean more toward the West and NATO, said publicly that Mr. Nikulin should be sent to the United States.   On a visit to Prague this week, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, argued that ''we have every reason to believe and expect that Mr. Nikulin will be extradited to America.''   ''The United States has the case to prevail on having him extradited, whether it's the severity of the crime, which is clearly on the side of U.S., or the timing of the request for the extradition,'' Mr. Ryan told reporters on Tuesday.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Joy Reid, MSNBC Host, Apologizes Again as More Incendiary Blog Posts Surface","Joy Reid, an MSNBC host and a prominent liberal figure who blamed hackers for some of the homophobic blog posts found on her decade-old blog in the past several months, apologized again on Friday after more incendiary posts emerged this week. On Wednesday, BuzzFeed News reported that Ms. Reid's old blog had promoted a Sept. 11 conspiracy by suggesting that readers watch ''Loose Change,'' which posits that the attack was planned by the United States government.     And on Thursday, BuzzFeed News surfaced a post that contained an image of Senator John McCain's head Photoshopped onto the body of Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech. Meghan McCain, the senator's daughter, wrote on Twitter that the post was ''beyond disgusting and disgraceful.''   Ms. Reid, 49, did not blame or mention hackers this time. In a statement on Friday, Ms. Reid, the ''AM Joy'' host, said that she had reached out to Ms. McCain, a former on-air colleague, and that she had the ''highest respect for Senator McCain.'' She said that she had evolved and that ''I'm a better person today than I was over a decade ago.''   ''There are things I deeply regret and am embarrassed by, things I would have said differently and issues where my position has changed,'' Ms. Reid said. ''Today I'm sincerely apologizing again.''   MSNBC said in a statement that some of the blog posts were ''obviously hateful and hurtful,'' but that they were ''not reflective of the colleague and friend we have known at MSNBC for the past seven years.''   ''Joy has apologized publicly and privately and said she has grown and evolved in the many years since, and we know this to be true,'' the network said.   Friday's apology was the latest in a series that Ms. Reid has made for her previous writings.   It began in December, when a Twitter user unearthed the first homophobic posts. Ms. Reid said at the time that she was ''disappointed in myself'' and that her words were ''insensitive, tone deaf and dumb.''   But her tone shifted when more homophobic posts emerged in April. She insisted that her blog was ''breached'' and that ''fraudulent entries'' were posted ''with suspicious formatting and time stamps'' that were inconsistent with the rest of the blog.   The posts included her statement that ''most straight people cringe at the sight of two men kissing'' and that ''a lot of heterosexuals, especially men, find the idea of homosexual sex to be ... well ... gross.''   Her writings were found through the Wayback Machine, which preserves more than two decades of web history. The Internet Archive, which runs the project, said in April that it had found no evidence of hacking involving the blog posts.   A few days after she claimed she had been hacked, Ms. Reid apologized on air and said security experts could not prove that the blog had been compromised.   ''I genuinely do not believe I wrote those hateful things, because they are completely alien to me,'' she said on her morning show. ''But I can definitely understand, based on things I have tweeted and have written in the past, why some people don't believe me.''    "
Promise From Senators to Punish Russia After New Reports of Hacking,"WASHINGTON -- Faced with new evidence that Russian hackers are targeting conservative American research groups and the Senate's own web pages, key lawmakers from both parties signaled on Tuesday that they were ready to move forward with punishing new sanctions legislation capable of crippling the Russian economy. And in three separate hearings on Capitol Hill, senators prodded the Trump administration to do more with its existing authorities to deter Russia and protect the United States' political infrastructure.    ''Congress is going to act; you might as well know that,'' Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, predicted in a meeting of the Banking Committee, which oversees sanctions law. ''I'd rather it act in a way that has your insights about what would be helpful, but if you fail to provide insights then we will provide you with a law that ultimately takes place without your insights.''    But administration officials argued that the current sanctions regime provided all the authority they needed, and they dismissed concerns that President Trump's equivocation on questions of Russian interference had harmed their efforts.   ''If you look at the wide range of activities that this administration has undertaken under the direction of the president, including the very significant sanctions that we have been able to launch, including the expulsion of 60 Russians out of our country, including the closing of Russian entities in the United States, what Russia sees is a United States that is very aggressively targeting malign activity,'' Sigal P. Mandelker, a senior Treasury Department official, told the Banking Committee.   The senators' pleas took on more urgency after Microsoft Corporation revealed on Monday that it had detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian military intelligence unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the conservative Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials.   Both institutions have taken aim at Russian corruption, and on Tuesday the Hudson Institute said in a statement that was not the first time an authoritarian government had targeted its work, nor did it expect it to be the last. Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific offices or political campaigns.   Those revelations came less than a month after Facebook disclosed that it had identified a new, active political influence campaign targeting November's midterm elections on its network that showed signs of Russian handiwork.   ''To Republicans, if you think the Russians don't have you in mind, you are making a great mistake,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said as he led a hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee focused on election security. ''They are trying to undermine the democratic process.''   On Tuesday, the Treasury Department announced a new round of sanctions targeting ships delivering Russian oil to North Korea despite sanctions and marine companies that are supplying Russia's military. Ms. Mandelker said to expect additional designations in the coming weeks.   But senators were skeptical of the administration's actions. They questioned the effectiveness of sanctions passed overwhelmingly last year to target Russia's defense and intelligence sectors, and tried to solicit input from the officials on how to proceed. And with the latest targets being conservative groups, concern could spread.   Mr. Graham said efforts to deter Russia had clearly fallen short and called on party leaders to move quickly.   Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he was ''personally very interested'' in additional bipartisan sanctions legislation, but he cautioned that there may not be time to fully consider it before the election.   ''The chances of sandwiching that in, honestly, in the month of September with all the other items we have swirling around, is probably pretty slim, but we will be here longer this year,'' Mr. McConnell told reporters. ''It would be high on the list for consideration for floor time.''   Top intelligence and law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned that Russia remains active in American politics and has targeted the midterm elections. All senators were scheduled to receive an additional classified briefing on Wednesday from the homeland security secretary, the director of national intelligence and the F.B.I. director about the Russian threat and what is being done to blunt it.   The report from Microsoft sharpened the warnings. It said that the company had identified and shut down several websites linked to a Russian military intelligence unit that set out to influence the 2016 American elections.   Amid those warnings and the fallout from Mr. Trump's July summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, senators from both parties have been anxiously debating how to raise the pressure on Moscow.   Two approaches dominate the discussion.   Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, have drafted legislation to deter Russia from further interference, putting the Kremlin on notice that the United States will enact broad economic sanctions if it does not stand down before the November elections.   The competing bill, written by Mr. Menendez and Mr. Graham, would seek to immediately drop a package of what they call ''crushing'' new punishments on the country for actions already underway.   The Banking Committee appeared ready to sort through the differences.   ''It's not often that Congress acts together in such a strong manner, as marked by such near-unanimous votes'' last year, said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, the committee's chairman. ''But then, Russia is a menace on so many different levels today that Congress can be compelled to act with a single voice to find solutions that will protect America and democratic values across the world.''   Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's top Democrat, was more forceful, calling the latest denial by the Kremlin ''nonsense'' and insisting that Mr. Trump do the same.   ''Our government -- the president and Congress together -- must right now send a more powerful and direct message to Putin and those within his circles: We know what you're doing, it must stop and if you continue, you and your government will pay a dear price,'' he said.   The hearings were combative at times, with senators venting that administration officials were dodging simple questions.   ''One of the things I thought would come from this hearing is a recommendation or a set of recommendations of what Congress might consider legislatively for additional sanctions,'' Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said at the Banking Committee hearing. ''Am I to take from your unwillingness to answer that kind of question that there is opposition by the administration to additional sanctions?''   Ms. Mandelker would not give a straight answer, repeatedly telling senators that the Treasury Department had the authority it needed.   In the Foreign Relations Committee, senators were clearly frustrated with what they said was a lack of progress in curbing Russian behavior.   ''Why, given all the things we are doing, are we not making better progress?'' asked Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. ''I think sanctions are necessary,'' he continued, but ''it's obviously not working the way we'd like. What would be more effective?''   A. Wess Mitchell, an assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, replied that ''the chilling effect on the Russian economy has been significant and measurable.''

Former N.S.A. Translator Gets 5 Years in Leak of Russia Hacking Report,"Reality Winner, the former Air Force linguist and intelligence contractor who pleaded guilty in June to leaking a top-secret government report on Russian hacking, was sentenced on Thursday to five years and three months in federal prison. Ms. Winner, 26, is the first person to be sentenced under the Espionage Act since President Trump took office. Prosecutors said her sentence was the longest ever imposed in federal court for an unauthorized release of government information to the media.    She was arrested in June 2017 and was held for more than a year while prosecutors built a case. She pleaded guilty in June 2018 to one felony count of unauthorized transmission of national defense information, for giving a classified report about Russian interference in the 2016 election to a news outlet.   Prosecutors said on Thursday that Ms. Winner's actions merited a stiff sentence.    ''Winner's purposeful violation put our nation's security at risk,'' United States Attorney Bobby L. Christine told reporters after the sentencing in federal court in Augusta, Ga. He said the report she leaked revealed sources and methods of intelligence gathering, and its disclosure ''caused exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national security.''   He added that she ''knowingly and intentionally betrayed the trust of her colleagues and her country,'' and was ''the quintessential example of an insider threat.''   Ms. Winner was fresh out of the Air Force and a few months into a job as a translator for the National Security Agency in May 2017 when prosecutors say she printed a report from her work computer that detailed hacking attacks by a Russian intelligence service against local election officials and voter registration databases. She later told investigators that she smuggled the report out of the Augusta, Ga., offices of the contractor, Pluribus International, in her pantyhose, and then mailed it to the online news outlet The Intercept.   Following a trail of clues, the F.B.I. soon arrested Ms. Winner two days before the Intercept published the classified report.   Addressing Chief Judge J. Randall Hall in court on Thursday, Ms. Winner said she took ''full responsibility'' for the ''undeniable mistake I made.'' She said she ''would like to apologize profusely'' for her actions.   Ms. Winner's lawyers asked the judge to take into account in sentencing that she had served honorably in the Air Force, had been a top student and had no prior criminal record. ''She is someone who has done something she should not have done -- and knows she should not have done,'' John Bell, one of Ms. Winner's lawyers, told Judge Hall. ''But she's not an evil person.''   Joe Whitley, a former federal prosecutor who was another of Ms. Winner's lawyers, highlighted her military service, including assisting with more than 800 intelligence missions that he said had ''removed'' 100 enemies.   Federal guidelines allowed for a sentence of up to 10 years, but prosecutors agreed in June to a sentence of 63 months, to avoid a trial that would require discussing classified reports and intelligence gathering techniques in open court. Prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum filed this week that such a trial ''would compound the exceptionally grave harm to national security already caused by the defendant,'' and that the plea agreement ''reflects a fair resolution of the defendant's criminal culpability. ''   The judge imposed the sentence that prosecutors recommended.   In federal leak cases, the sentences are generally aligned with the scale of damage done to national security, according to Robert Cattanach, a former lawyer in the Justice Department's civil division who represented security agencies. He said Ms. Winner's sentence seemed to be an outlier.   ''No one was endangered, no one's identity was revealed, the Russians just learned that when they penetrate our systems, we can track them, which they already knew,'' Mr. Cattanach said. ''I think this kind of sentence, if anything, is designed to have a chilling effect.''   The Justice Department prosecuted Ms. Winner under the Espionage Act, a World War I-era law that made it a crime to disclose secrets that could be used to harm the United States or aid a foreign adversary.   Prosecutions under the law for leaking sensitive information to the news media, rather than to a foreign government, were once rare, and usually led to little if any prison time. But in recent years the Justice Department has been cracking down on such leaks.   Perhaps the best-known leaker, Chelsea Manning, was tried and convicted in a military court-martial, not a civilian court, for sending a vast archive of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks. She was sentenced to 35 years, but served only about seven years; President Obama commuted the remainder of her sentence.   In 2013, a former F.B.I. agent was sentenced to 43 months for leaking classified information to The Associated Press about a foiled bomb plot in Yemen. That same year, a former C.I.A. agent, John Kiriakou, was given a 30-month sentence for revealing the identity of an undercover agent. In 2015, another former C.I.A. agent, Jeffrey Sterling, was sentenced to 42-months for leaking classified information to The New York Times about a secret operation to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.   [Read: A security breach and spilled secrets have shaken the N.S.A. to its core.]   Ms. Winner, who grew up in Texas, seemed in some ways not to fit the popular image of someone who might try to circumvent the rules. A part-time yoga instructor who was fond of kale, owned rescued pets and drove a Nissan Cube with a bumper sticker saying ''Be truthful, gentle and fearless,'' she had passed several security screenings and had no history of disciplinary problems in the military.   But prosecutors said in court filings that she was a savvy and well-trained analyst whose political beliefs drove her to violate security restrictions. They said that in the months before she leaked the report, Ms. Winner had downloaded software that helped her hide her web searches and communications; had expressed support for Edward J. Snowden, the N.S.A. contractor who leaked a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks in 2013 and then took refuge in Russia; and had ''repeatedly expressed contempt for the United States.''   ''It's literally the worst thing to happen on the planet,'' she said of the United States in a Facebook chat with her sister in February 2016, according to prosecutors. ''We invented capitalism, the downfall of the environment.''   When her sister asked if she really hated America, Ms. Winner replied yes, prosecutors said, though she added that her feeling was ''mostly just about Americans' obsession with air-conditioning.''   According to prosecutors, she printed out the classified report on May 9, the day President Trump fired James Comey, the director of the F.B.I. At a detention hearing last year, a prosecutor, Jennifer G. Solari, said that Ms. Winner had been ''mad about some things she had seen in the media, and she wanted to set the facts right.''   Some advocacy groups have championed Ms. Winner as a whistle-blower, saying that the leak of the report alerted states to the dangers posed to elections by outside hackers -- something that security agencies had been slow to do, according to a Senate report.   The Intercept, which published the material that Ms. Winner leaked, contributed financially to her defense. In a statement on Thursday, the organization's editor in chief, Betsy Reed, said Ms. Winner had done a public service.   ''The vulnerability of the American electoral system is a national topic of immense gravity, but it took Winner's act of bravery to bring key details of an attempt to compromise the democratic process in 2016 to public attention,'' Ms. Reed said. ''Instead of being recognized as a conscience-driven whistle-blower whose disclosure helped protect U.S. elections, Winner was prosecuted with vicious resolve.''   Under the plea agreement, Ms. Winner will be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons' medical center in Carswell, Tex., where she can receive treatment for bulimia and be relatively close to her family.   Standing in front of the courthouse, one of her lawyers, Titus Nichols, disputed that her actions had been a ''nefarious plot that she enacted to harm the country.'' But he said that, in light of all the facts, he thought the sentence was fair.    "
"Zelle, the Banks' Answer to Venmo, Proves Vulnerable to Fraud","Big banks are making it easy to zap money to your friends. Maybe too easy. Zelle, a service that allows bank customers to instantly send money to their acquaintances, is booming. Thousands of new users sign up every day. Some $75 billion zoomed through Zelle's network last year. That's more than twice the amount of money that customers transferred with Venmo, a rival money-transfer app. But the same features that make Zelle so useful for customers, its speed and ubiquity, have made it irresistible to thieves. Hackers and con artists have used the system to steal from victims -- some of whom had never used Zelle or even heard of it until someone used it to clean out their bank accounts. Interviews with more than two dozen customers who had their money stolen through Zelle illustrate the weaknesses that criminals are using in targeting the network. While all financial systems are susceptible to fraud, aspects of Zelle's design, like not always notifying customers when money is transferred -- some banks do; others don't -- have contributed to the system's vulnerability. And some customers who lost money were made whole by their banks; others were not.  For the banks, Zelle is a big -- and must-win -- bet on where money is headed. As consumers become increasingly accustomed to splitting dinner checks, paying for their coffee and hailing an Uber without touching paper money, banks are rushing to stake their claim on the wallet of the future. In recent years, apps such as Venmo (which is owned by PayPal), Popmoney, Square Cash and Apple Pay made digital cash transfers quick and simple. Banks were falling behind. So they joined up to create a rival product, run by Early Warning Services, a Scottsdale, Ariz., consortium that is jointly owned by seven large banks. Last June, Early Warning introduced Zelle. It is built directly into each bank's mobile app, making the system easy to use for customers -- or thieves who gain access to their accounts. The scale of the problem is hard to pinpoint, because Zelle is fairly new and banks do not report much data about it. But banking analysts say they have seen some alarming incidents. ""I know of one bank that was experiencing a 90 percent fraud rate on Zelle transactions, which is insane,"" said Genevieve Gimbert, a partner in PwC's financial crimes unit. Most banks have strong authentication and fraud-detection controls for Zelle, she said, but some ""just implemented it without any protections"" like two-factor authentication and user-behavior monitoring. Zelle said the problem was under control. ""There are very few incidents,"" said Lou Anne Alexander, Early Warning's head of payments. ""When there is a problem, we and the banks are proactive. It's not something we're putting our heads in the sand about."" Eighteen banks in the United States, including most of the biggest players, are using Zelle, and 70 more are in the process of setting it up. Collectively, they connect about half of the traditional checking accounts in the United States. Cash transfers within the network often take place within seconds -- much faster than on most of its rival payment services. That has made it more difficult for banks to halt or reverse illicit transactions. Security is a cornerstone of Zelle's marketing campaign. In one TV commercial, Daveed Diggs, an actor and rapper known for ""Hamilton"" and ""black-ish,"" is encouraged to pay for playoff tickets through Zelle by another actor who raps: ""You can send money safely, 'cause that's what it's for, and it's backed by the banks, so you know it's secure."" But the system has had problems. Brian Kemm, a Bank of America customer in Pasadena, Calif., lost $300 because of a misdirected payment. To transfer money through Zelle, the sender enters the recipient's phone number or email address. Zelle is built on the assumption that each of those identifiers is unique to one person. Last November, Mr. Kemm tried to send cash to his mother, Carol Kemm, who is also a Bank of America customer. He typed in the mobile phone number Ms. Kemm had been using for at least three years and hit ""send."" ""She told me she didn't get it, and my first thought was, 'Mom, you're not being very tech-savvy,'"" Mr. Kemm said. ""Eventually, after a few days, I realized it really didn't get there."" When he called Bank of America's customer service line, he learned that the $300 had been transferred -- to a JPMorgan Chase bank account, whose owner had registered the same phone number Ms. Kemm used. He said he was told that there was nothing Bank of America could do to get his money back. Mr. Kemm filed a police report and a fraud claim with Bank of America. On Nov. 30, the bank sent him a reply: ""Our records indicate that we initiated the transfer in accordance with your instructions. As a result, your account will not be credited for this claim."" After being contacted for this article, Bank of America said it would refund Mr. Kemm. ""In general, in cases in which the mobile number was previously registered to another person and directed to that account, we'll work with the receiving bank to reverse the transaction,"" said Betty Riess, a bank spokeswoman. Another Bank of America customer, Heather Pocorobba, went hunting on March 18 for tickets to a Justin Timberlake concert. On Craigslist, she found two good seats for $260. The seller suggested she pay with Zelle. ""I naïvely believed that since my bank uses it, the accounts must be connected to real people, with some sort of protection built in,"" Ms. Pocorobba said. As soon as she sent the cash, the seller stopped answering her text messages. She never got the tickets -- or her money back. She reported the fraud to the police and her bank. Bank of America's fine print about Zelle tells customers: ""You are protected by the same security you're used to where you will not be liable for fraudulent transactions."" The catch is that the bank, like all the others that use Zelle, only considers transactions fraudulent if the customer did not authorize them. When a customer knowingly sends money to someone, the bank offers no protection against rip-offs. (Credit cards, by contrast, protect users against such scammers.) ""We're committed to ensuring consumers are aware of potential scams, including reminding them that Zelle is intended for sending funds to friends, family or people they know,"" said Ms. Riess, the Bank of America spokeswoman. Bob Sullivan, an author who specializes in cybercrime and consumer protection, said he was stunned by how poorly the banks had communicated Zelle's risks -- and by their failure to learn from the painful lessons of the past. Craigslist, PayPal and Venmo faced early criticism for leaving users vulnerable to fraud. In response, each made changes. Craigslist, for example, added a warning about scams on every sale listing. PayPal increased the protections it offers on some digital sales and provided a detailed disclosure about what transactions it will and won't protect. And Venmo -- which, like Zelle, does not protect users if a seller does not deliver what they promised -- upgraded its security policies in 2015 to better detect fraud, including by notifying customers when someone adds an email address or new device to their account. This year, the Federal Trade Commission criticized the company for not having those protections in place from the start. Customers have to hunt on Zelle's website to get to this red flag: ""Neither Zelle nor the participating financial institutions offer a protection program for any purchase or sale conducted using Zelle."" Some banks, such as JPMorgan, don't notify customers when new recipients are linked to their Zelle accounts. David Nowicki, a BB&T customer, discovered in March that someone had gained access to his online accounts and used Zelle to steal $4,000. Mr. Nowicki said he had never received any email or phone notifications about the transactions, or about a new computer accessing his account. After he filed a fraud claim with BB&T, and a police report, the bank refunded his loss. ""We have multiple layers of security measures,"" said David R. White, a BB&T spokesman. ""Clients are protected and reimbursed for any unauthorized transactions."" BB&T sends email notices about Zelle transactions, Mr. White said. Mr. Nowicki, however, said he was certain he had not received any. Jane Butler, a Wells Fargo customer in Downingtown, Pa., first heard of Zelle when it was used to steal $2,500 from her bank account. The con was elaborate. First, a phishing email that appeared to be from Wells Fargo tricked her into entering her bank ID and password into a fraudulent website. The next day, Ms. Butler got a call that appeared to be from Wells Fargo's fraud department. The number she saw displayed on her phone screen matched the phone number on the back of her bank card -- but it wasn't her bank on the other end of the line. The call had been spoofed. The caller tricked her into handing over one-time passcodes that provided access to Zelle, which was then used to make six transfers from her account, ranging from one penny to $999.98. Wells Fargo refunded Ms. Butler for her loss. Others have fallen victim to similar calls. Cory McWilliams, a Wells Fargo customer in Houston, said that thieves had called him from a spoofed Wells Fargo number, fooled him into giving them authentication codes texted by the bank and then stole $1,000. Jim Seitz, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said the company takes customer security ""very seriously"" and that it will ""continue to evolve our multilayers of controls to further help our customers avoid becoming victims of fraud."" Mr. McWilliams reported the theft to a banker at his local branch, and Wells Fargo refunded his loss. ""The banker I spoke with was not surprised at all,"" Mr. McWilliams said. ""He stated he was aware this sort of scam was going around."" PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Tyler Comrie FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Related Articles  "
A Future Where Everything Becomes a Computer Is as Creepy as You Feared; State of the Art,"More than 40 years ago, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft with a vision for putting a personal computer on every desk. No one really believed them, so few tried to stop them. Then before anyone realized it, the deed was done: Just about everyone had a Windows machine, and governments were left scrambling to figure out how to put Microsoft's monopoly back in the bottle. This sort of thing happens again and again in the tech industry. Audacious founders set their sights on something hilariously out of reach -- Mark Zuckerberg wants to connect everyone -- and the very unlikeliness of their plans insulates them from scrutiny. By the time the rest of us catch up to their effects on society, it's often too late to do much about them. It is happening again now. In recent years, the tech industry's largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There's just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it.  The industry's new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone. Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets -- these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting ""smart."" Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend -- known by the marketing catchphrase ""the internet of things"" -- but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung. For instance, Amazon last month showed off a microwave powered by Alexa, its voice assistant. Amazon will sell the microwave for $60, but it is also selling the chip that gives the device its smarts to other manufacturers, making Alexa connectivity a just-add-water proposition for a wide variety of home appliances, like fans and toasters and coffee makers. And this week, both Facebook and Google unveiled their own home ""hub"" devices that let you watch videos and perform other digital tricks by voice. You might dismiss many of these innovations as pretty goofy and doomed to failure. But everything big in tech starts out looking silly, and statisticsshow the internet of things is growing quickly. It is wiser, then, to imagine the worst -- that the digitization of just about everything is not just possible but likely, and that now is the time to be freaking out about the dangers. ""I'm not pessimistic generally, but it's really hard not to be,"" said Bruce Schneier, a security consultant who explores the threats posed by the internet of things in a new book, ""Click Here to Kill Everybody."" Mr. Schneier argues that the economic and technical incentives of the internet-of-things industry do not align with security and privacy for society generally. Putting a computer in everything turns the whole world into a computer security threat -- and the hacks and bugs uncovered in just the last few weeks at Facebook and Google illustrate how difficult digital security is even for the biggest tech companies. In a roboticized world, hacks would not just affect your data but could endanger your property, your life and even national security. Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities. He calls for reimagining the regulatory regime surrounding digital security in the same way the federal government altered its national security apparatus after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet. ""I can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,"" he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. ""In our government-can't-do-anything-ever society, I don't see any reining in of the corporate trends,"" he said. Those trends are now obvious. It used to be difficult to add internet connectivity to home devices, but in the last few years the cost and complexity of doing so have plummeted. Today, off-the-shelf minicomputers like the Arduino can be used to turn just about any household object ""smart."" Systems like the one Amazon is offering promise to accelerate the development of internet-of-things devices even further. At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a ""smart"" fan using Amazon's chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan's control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code -- in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code. And that's it. The fan's digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in. This system illustrates Mr. Schneier's larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet. Sometimes, smarts will lead to conveniences -- you can yell at your microwave to reheat your lunch from across the room. Sometimes it will lead to revenue opportunities -- Amazon's microwave will reorder popcorn for you when you're running low. Sometimes smarts are used for surveillance and marketing, like the crop of smart TVs that track what you watch for serving up ads. Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don't connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do. The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don't often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple's brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors. But manufacturers of low-margin home appliances have little such expertise, and less incentive. That's why the internet of things has so far been synonymous with terrible security -- why the F.B.I. had to warn parents last year about the dangers of ""smart toys,"" and why Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has identified smart devices as a growing threat to national security. An Amazon representative told me that the company was building security into the core of its smart technologies. The Connect Kit, the company said, lets Amazon maintain the digital security of a smart device -- and Amazon is very likely to be better at security than many manufacturers of household appliances. As part of its cloud business, the company also offers a service for companies to audit the security of their internet-of-things services. The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry. Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation -- that's one reason techies don't like it. But when uncertain global dangers are involved, taking a minute isn't a terrible idea. Connecting everything could bring vast benefits to society. But the menace could be just as vast. Why not go slowly into the uncertain future? Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo.

That Virus Alert on Your Computer? Scammers in India May Be Behind It,"MUMBAI, India -- You know the messages. They pop up on your computer screen with ominous warnings like, ""Your computer has been infected with a virus. Call our toll-free number immediately for help."" Often they look like alerts from Microsoft, Apple or Symantec. Sometimes the warning comes in a phone call. Most people ignore these entreaties, which are invariably scams. But one in five recipients actually talks to the fake tech-support centers, and 6 percent ultimately pay the operators to ""fix"" the nonexistent problem, according to recent consumer surveys by Microsoft.  Law enforcement authorities, working with Microsoft, have now traced many of these boiler rooms to New Delhi, India's capital and a hub of the global call-center industry. On Tuesday and Wednesday, police from two Delhi suburbs raided 16 fake tech-support centers and arrested about three dozen people. Last month, the Delhi authorities arrested 24 people in similar raids on 10 call centers. In Gautam Budh Nagar, one of the suburbs, 50 police officers swept into eight centers on Tuesday night. Ajay Pal Sharma, the senior superintendent of police there, said the scammers had extracted money from thousands of victims, most of whom were American or Canadian. ""The modus operandi was to send a pop-up on people's systems using a fake Microsoft logo,"" Mr. Sharma said. After the victims contacted the call center, the operator, pretending to be a Microsoft employee, would tell them that their system had been hacked or attacked by a virus. The victims would then be offered a package of services ranging from $99 to $1,000 to fix the problem, he said. Such scams are widespread, said Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft's digital crimes unit. Microsoft, whose Windows software runs most personal computers, gets 11,000 or so complaints about the scams every month, she said, and its internet monitors spot about 150,000 pop-up ads for the services every day. The company's own tech-support forums, where people can publicly post items, also see a steady stream of posts offering fake tech-support services. Although American authorities have busted such scams in places like Florida and Ohio, the backbone of the illicit industry is in India -- in large part because of the country's experience running so many of the world's call centers. India's outsourcing industry, which includes call centers, generates about $28 billion in annual revenue and employs about 1.2 million people. ""The success of the legitimate industry has made it easier for the illegitimate industry there,"" Ms. Gregoire said. As in any con, experience helps. ""You have to convince them they have a problem,"" she said. ""You have to have the touch."" For tech companies, combating the impersonators is complicated by the fact that many legitimate tech-support operations, including some of Microsoft's, operate from India. The scam is quite lucrative. Researchers at Stony Brook University, who published a detailed study of fake tech-support services last year, estimated that a single pop-up campaign spread over 142 web domains brought in nearly $10 million in just two months. Najmeh Miramirkhani, lead author of the research paper, said the network of entities involved in the scams was complex, with some making their own calls and others running the sites but outsourcing the calls to India. Many of the scammers also share data with one another. ""This is an organized crime,"" she said. Microsoft said it was working with other tech industry leaders such as Apple and Google, as well as law enforcement, to fight the scourge, which is migrating beyond the English-speaking world to target other users in their local languages. In the 16 countries surveyed by Microsoft, people in India and China were the most likely to pay the con artists. The problem extends beyond fake tech support, too. In July, the Justice Department said 24 people in eight states had been convicted for their roles in a scheme to use Indian call-center agents to impersonate tax collectors at the Internal Revenue Service. The thieves duped more than 15,000 people out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Thirty-two contractors in India were also indicted. Mr. Sharma said that in a similar con broken up by his department, call-center agents had impersonated Canadian tax authorities. Like the I.R.S., Microsoft and other legitimate technology companies do not call their users out of the blue. Nor do they send security alerts to the screen telling customers to call them. Ms. Miramirkhani had some simple advice to avoid being conned: Don't pick up the phone. Vindu Goel reported from Mumbai, and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.

"6 Ways to Fight Election Hacking and Voter Fraud, According to an Expert Panel","WASHINGTON -- Amid a chorus of warnings that the American election system is ground zero for foreign attackers, a panel of leading scholars and election experts issued a sweeping set of recommendations on Thursday for how to make elections more secure. Several similar reports have been issued lately, but this one is different. It not only carries a blue-ribbon pedigree from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, but it also suggests ways to address allegations of domestic voter fraud, which Republicans have leveled for years.  The report notes the significant challenges of securing elections. In 2016, Americans voted in 178,217 precincts and 116,990 polling places. Under the Constitution, each state controls its own election procedures, and officials jealously guard their authority against federal interference. The rules vary so wildly that uniform standards are almost impossible. Still, many of the report's proposals can be applied nationwide. Here are six ways the panel says that election security can be improved: 1. Use paper ballots to establish a backup record of each vote. Even if voter databases and other equipment aren't connected to the internet, experts said, it will be hard to protect computer systems from cyber threats. As a result, they recommend that by 2020, every voting machine nationwide should generate a backup paper record of each vote. Currently, five states -- Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Delaware and New Jersey -- and portions of several others do not maintain a paper trail. 2. Outlaw any kind of internet voting -- for now. Many states now allow some votes to be cast online, usually by armed forces members and other Americans living abroad. Twenty states and the District of Columbia let some voters submit ballots by email, rather than by mail. But the report recommends an outright ban on voting over the internet, or via any machines that are connected to the internet. For now, the experts say, that is simply too risky. That said, they also urge further study into new technologies that might make electronic voting more secure. And the report says election officials and vendors of voting equipment should be required to disclose to federal and state authorities all attempts to breach security and any newly discovered vulnerabilities in equipment, software and databases. 3. Verify election results. With public confidence in elections declining, the panel said states should require public, transparent audits of all elections to guarantee their integrity, including audits of processes -- like voter registration, preparing ballots and reporting of results -- that normally get little scrutiny. The audit data, scrubbed of any private voter information, should be made public so outsiders can verify the results themselves. Within a decade, federal and state elections (and where possible, local ones) should undergo risk-limiting audits, a statistical double-check that is the gold standard of vote validation. And all audits should be performed by human beings, not machines, counting actual paper ballots, not electronic ones. The report calls for states to begin developing ""end-to-end verifiable voting systems"" -- a method that lets voters confirm that election equipment is working properly and that their votes have been accurately recorded. Pilot systems already exist, but they are too complicated for voters to use; the report calls for more research to simplify them. 4. Crosscheck voter registrations nationwide to weed out duplicates. The report urges all states to adopt some method of comparing their registration databases with those of other states to eliminate duplicates from voters who have moved. That would eliminate instances in which voters cast ballots in two locations undetected. In practice, double voting is extremely rare. But election experts say that accurate matching systems would help pare state voter rolls, which are bloated by voters who move but fail to ask election officials in their old districts to remove them. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia already match registration databases via the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit agency run by its member states. 5. Make voting by mail more secure. Voting by mail is now the standard in Colorado, Oregon and Washington and is rapidly gaining popularity elsewhere. But mailed-in and absentee ballots are at greater risk of theft, forgery and other kinds of fraud -- it's easier, for example, to buy votes or coerce someone into casting a ballot by mail than it would be in the privacy of a voting booth. Although this kind of voting fraud is also quite rare, the report urges all states to adopt systems that let voters easily verify whether ballots have been mailed to them and whether marked ballots have been received and accepted by election offices. It also calls for the development of new technologies that could counter coercion, vote-buying and other frauds. To combat fraud at the ballot box -- the rarest of all -- the report urges a host of federal agencies to sponsor research into reliable ways of verifying voters' identities like biometric markers (fingerprints and iris scans, for example). 6. Spend more to make elections trustworthy. Again and again, the report hammers home the message that federal and state authorities pinch pennies when it comes to protecting the constitutional right to vote. The experts call for ""appropriate"" funding of the United States Election Assistance Commission, a little-known advisory body that plays a crucial role in improving election administration. They also urge Congress to allot more money to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which helps develop voluntary security guidelines for voting equipment, so that it can work on security standards for other election procedures and equipment. And the report asks Congress to finance ""a major initiative on voting"" that would establish academic research centers to improve election technology and administration. Finally, the experts urge Congress and the states to create an ongoing stream of money to replace worn-out and outdated voting equipment. The last major federal funding for voting equipment was approved in 2002, when Congress passed the Help America Vote Act to address electoral failures highlighted by the contested 2000 presidential election.

You Dumped Facebook. So Why Does It Keep Sending You Emails?,"Q. Last year I opened a Facebook account, and as I entered my information I soon decided I didn't want to continue. I deleted the app on my phone and tablet. Occasionally, I receive a ''Welcome back to Facebook'' message and realize I've not cut the cord. Is there way to sever this connection for good? Completely?   A. Removing the Facebook app from your mobile devices does not delete the user account connected with it. To fully sever your ties with the social network, you need to visit the site's Account Deletion page and log back in; you can do this from a web browser if you do not want to download the mobile app again. Use the box on the page to officially request that Facebook delete your account.    Facebook's settings page also offers an account deactivation option, which removes your profile page from view but is not permanent. Accounts are reactivated when you log back in. If you deactivated your account and then started up a laptop that was set to automatically log into Facebook, your account may have revived itself.   From your account settings page, you can see on which devices you are logged into Facebook and then log out if necessary. Logging in, then logging out of any forgotten devices and permanently deleting the account should cut your Facebook ties. (More active Facebook users can download an archive of the posts made while using the service by clicking the ''Download a copy of your Facebook data'' link on the account settings page.)   If you deactivated the account and are sure no other devices were set to automatically log into Facebook, receiving ''Welcome back'' messages may mean Facebook is trying to re-engage you or that someone else is trying to get into your account. You can report the problem at facebook.com/hacked. Change the password of the mail account you used for Facebook and -- to be safe -- reset your Facebook password before deleting the account.   Fake messages purporting to be from Facebook have been flying around the internet for years, so it is also possible you received a phishing attempt urging you to supply your account information to a fraudulent site. Late last year, Facebook announced that its users could see a list of official messages by clicking the link at the bottom of the Security and Login tab on the Settings page. If you see that Facebook has not sent you any legitimate messages, report the one you received to phish@facebook.com   Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Florida Governor Wants Proof of Election Hacking Plot,"Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei. MIAMI -- Cryptic comments from Senator Bill Nelson of Florida this week alluded to a secret Russian plot to tap into Florida's election systems. ''They have already penetrated certain counties in the state, and they now have free rein to move about,'' the Democratic senator told The Tampa Bay Times on Wednesday.    He declined to elaborate or offer any proof. A day earlier, he had described details as ''classified.''    But the suggestion that Russian hackers might have breached voter systems, vague as it was, has set off a political maelstrom in Florida less than three weeks before the state's Aug. 28 primary election.   On Friday, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who is running against Mr. Nelson for the Senate, accused his opponent of scaremongering and demanded that he back up his claims with evidence.   ''Either Bill Nelson knows of crucial information the federal government is withholding from Florida election officials, or he is simply making things up,'' Mr. Scott said at a Tampa campaign event. ''So far, no one seems to know what Nelson is talking about.''   Russian hackers attempted to infiltrate voter registration systems in Florida and at least 20 other states in 2016, according to federal officials. But before Mr. Nelson's comments, there had been no indications of any successful meddling this year. In a July indictment, the Justice Department accused 12 Russian intelligence officers of posing as an election vendor and sending more than 100 phishing emails to elections officials in a number of Florida counties.   ''While we are aware of Senator Nelson's recent statements, we have not seen any new compromises by Russian actors of election infrastructure,'' Sara Sendek, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement on Wednesday. ''That said, we don't need to wait for a specific threat to be ready.''   Mr. Nelson's comments prompted worried voters to contact some of the state's 67 elections supervisors. Nearly half a million voters have already cast ballots by mail ahead of the primary, and in-person early voting begins in some counties on Monday.   ''Everyone wants to know what we're doing to secure the elections,'' said Paul Lux of Okaloosa County, president of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections. He noted that Florida voters cast paper ballots, and the attempted 2016 breaches targeted voter registration databases, not election tallies.   Election experts say that hackers do not need to change votes to have an impact. Intruding into systems, corrupting voter rolls and taking down websites all sow chaos and erode confidence in the system.   ''Elections are a system based on trust. All you need to do is inject enough doubt in people's minds,'' said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which monitors interference in elections.   Ken Detzner, the Florida secretary of state, who works for the governor and is in charge of elections, on Thursday asked Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to share any information that could shed light on Mr. Nelson's comments. Mr. Nelson is the ranking member of the cyber subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   Earlier this year, Mr. Detzner made few moves to obtain federal money that was available to shore up voting systems from outside attack. He said the $19.2 million in federal funds earmarked for Florida would not be available for elections supervisors to use ahead of the midterm elections. But Mr. Detzner was overruled by Mr. Scott, who ordered him to seek the money so that it could be spent before the election.   On Thursday, Mr. Detzner said he had already contacted Homeland Security, the F.B.I. and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and none had any details about possible Russian hacking attempts. The state's division of elections, which he oversees, ''has no evidence to support these claims,'' Mr. Detzner wrote.   In his response on Friday, Mr. Burr advised Florida to remain in contact with federal agencies about any potential election intrusions. He also referred to a July 2 letter that Mr. Nelson and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida sent to elections supervisors about possible threats.   ''The federal government has resources to help, and only by working together can we thwart Russia's continued efforts to interfere in our democracy and undermine our elections,'' Mr. Burr wrote. ''That is also the message of the letter sent by Senators Rubio and Nelson, and I support their effort.''   But the senators' letter to elections supervisors did not detail the sort of breach suggested this week by Mr. Nelson. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Rubio, a Republican member of the intelligence committee, did not confirm nor deny Mr. Nelson's claims.   ''Given the importance of Florida in our national politics, our state's election systems have been and will remain a potentially attractive target for attacks by foreign actors,'' said Mr. Rubio, who for months has warned of attempts at election interference.   A hint of corroboration came late Friday from Sen. Mark Warner, the intelligence committee's ranking Democrat. ''Sens. Nelson and Rubio are right to warn their state's election officials about this very serious and ongoing threat to our democracy,'' he said in a statement. ''This is not about politics. I urge officials at all levels of government to heed the warning and work with D.H.S. and the F.B.I. to address the threat.''   Mr. Nelson did not appear to hold any campaign events or give any interviews to the news media on Friday, as the controversy over his comments continued for a third day. In a statement, he said he and Senate colleagues ''are trying to make sure Florida officials are aware of the ongoing Russian threat so they take the steps necessary to safeguard our elections.''   ''It's unfortunate that some Florida officials would try to use this issue for personal, political gain,'' he said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Hacker of Nude Photos Is Sentenced,"A Connecticut man was sentenced on Wednesday to eight months in prison for his part in a hacking scandal in which nude photographs of the actress Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities were made public on the internet, according to the man's lawyer.  The man, George Garofano, 26, had pleaded guilty in April to gaining access to about 240 Apple iCloud accounts and stealing users' private information. He was one of four hackers involved in a 2014 phishing scheme that tricked people into revealing their usernames and passwords. The other three hackers have been sentenced.    Mr. Garofano's lawyer, Richard Lynch, said that Judge Victor A. Bolden, who oversaw sentencing in the United States District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., gave his client a lighter sentence than prosecutors had requested. Prosecutors in the case had argued that Mr. Garofano should serve at least 10 to 16 months in prison, saying the hacking was a serious crime.   Mr. Lynch said he and his team asked the judge for a more lenient sentence: five months in prison and another five months of home confinement. ''The judge listened,'' he said. But, Mr. Lynch added, ''it was a difficult case because of the number of victims.''   After Mr. Garofano serves his sentence, he will be subject to three years of supervised release.   Mr. Garofano, who is from North Branford, Conn., breached not only the accounts of celebrities like Ms. Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kirsten Dunst, but also those of users who were not famous. Ms. Lawrence told Vanity Fair in 2014 that she was worried about how the release of the stolen photos would affect her career.   ''Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this,'' she told the magazine. She called the hacking a ''sex crime.''   ''It's disgusting,'' she added. ''The law needs to be changed, and we need to change.''   A spokeswoman for Ms. Lawrence said on Thursday that the actress declined to comment on the sentencing news.   Mr. Lynch said his client was apologetic. ''When he gets behind a computer, he forgets what he does impacts other people,'' he said.    "

Former Equifax Executive Charged With Insider Trading in 2017 Breach,"A former top Equifax executive was charged on Wednesday with insider trading for selling nearly $1 million in company stock after he learned about a major data breach in 2017 but before it was publicly announced. Jun Ying, the former chief information officer of Equifax's core United States consumer reporting division, exercised all of his vested stock options and sold nearly $1 million in shares a little more than a week before Equifax announced that hackers had broken into its systems, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The breach compromised sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, of more than 140 million Americans. Mr. Ying avoided $117,000 in losses because of the timing of his sale, the S.E.C. said in a civil complaint.    The United States attorney's office in Atlanta announced parallel criminal charges against Mr. Ying on Wednesday.   ''Corporate insiders who learn inside information, including information about material cyber intrusions, cannot betray shareholders for their own financial benefit,'' said Richard R. Best, the director of the S.E.C.'s office in Atlanta, where Equifax is based.   Stock trades by Equifax employees have drawn scrutiny since the breach was disclosed. Four senior executives, including the consumer credit reporting agency's chief financial officer, sold shares worth $1.8 million in the days after the company began investigating the breach and more than a month before the public was told of it.   After conducting its own investigation, the Equifax board concluded that none of the four executives knew of the breach when they made their trades.   Mr. Ying's trades were different. He was not among the executives whose trades initially came under scrutiny.   On a Friday afternoon in late August, an email went out to several top executives at Equifax asking them to begin work immediately on an emergency project related to a ''VERY large breach Opportunity,'' according to  the S.E.C. complaint. Mr. Ying was one of the recipients.   Later that day, after a brief conversation with David Webb, Equifax's global chief information officer, Mr. Ying began to understand the extent of the problem, the S.E.C. said. He texted one of his employees: ''We may be the one breached ... Starting to put 2 and 2 together.''   Three days later, a Monday, Mr. Ying exercised all of his vested options to buy Equifax shares, and then sold them immediately.   Mr. Webb, who was Mr. Ying's boss, retired in September, shortly after the breach was disclosed. Equifax offered to promote Mr. Ying to fill the vacancy. The offer was rescinded when the company learned of Mr. Ying's stock trading, according to the S.E.C.'s complaint.   In an interview on Wednesday, Julia Houston, Equifax's chief transformation officer, said the company learned of Mr. Ying's trades during an internal investigation. On Oct. 16, the company summoned him to a meeting at which it planned to fire him, she said. Mr. Ying resigned instead.   Equifax alerted the S.E.C. and the Justice Department about Mr. Ying's trading, Ms. Houston said.   ''We take corporate governance and compliance very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of our policies,'' Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., Equifax's acting chief executive, said in a statement.   Ms. Houston declined to comment on whether the company is investigating any other suspicious trading activity.   Mr. Ying declined to comment through his lawyers at the firm Schulte Roth & Zabel.   Mr. Ying's LinkedIn page shows that he left Equifax in October. It lists his current job as ''a little bit of everything. Stay tuned.''    "
Equifax Worker Charged With Insider Stock Trade,"Regulators charged a second former Equifax employee with insider trading, accusing him on Thursday of placing a financial bet that the stock would decline after learning about the company's huge data breach but before it was publicly disclosed.  The former employee, Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, a software engineering manager, traded on the information he received while creating a website for consumers affected by the attack, according to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in federal court in Atlanta. Mr. Bonthu, 44, was told that the project was being done for an unnamed client but figured out that Equifax itself was the victim, according to the complaint.    He then bought stock options that would gain value if Equifax's shares declined, according to the S.E.C. complaint.   Meg Strickler, Mr. Bonthu's lawyer, said he was looking forward to having his case move through the criminal justice system, but declined further comment.   The data breach ultimately exposed the sensitive details of more than 140 million consumers, including Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers and other information.   In March, the S.E.C. accused another former Equifax employee, Jun Ying, who had been chief information officer in Equifax's core United States consumer reporting division, of exercising all of his vested stock options and selling nearly $1 million in shares a little more than a week before Equifax announced the cyberattack.   According to the S.E.C., Mr. Bonthu bought so-called put options -- giving him the right to sell Equifax shares at a certain price -- after he figured out the company had been hacked. Less than a week later, Equifax publicly disclosed the breach, and its stock fell about 14 percent. Mr. Bonthu then sold the options, which had gained value as the stock declined, and made a $75,000 profit, the commission said.   ''As we allege, Bonthu, who was entrusted with confidential information by his employer, misused that information to conclude that his company had suffered a massive data breach and then sought to illegally profit,'' said Richard R. Best, director of the S.E.C.'s Atlanta regional office.   The United States attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia filed parallel criminal charges against Mr. Bonthu.   The S.E.C. said that Equifax fired Mr. Bonthu in March after he refused to cooperate with an internal investigation into whether he violated the company's insider trading policy.   Equifax said in a statement that it was cooperating with regulators. ''Upon learning of potential trading activity by Mr. Bonthu, we immediately launched a review of his trading activity and separated him from our company,'' a spokeswoman said.    "
Chinese Officer Brought to U.S. On Spy Charge,"WASHINGTON -- A Chinese intelligence official was arrested in Belgium and extradited to the United States to face espionage charges, Justice Department officials said on Wednesday, a major escalation of the Trump administration's effort to crack down on Chinese spying. The extradition on Tuesday of the officer, Yanjun Xu, a deputy division director in China's main spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, is the first time that a Chinese intelligence official has been brought to the United States to be prosecuted and tried in open court. Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Xu tried to steal trade secrets from companies including GE Aviation outside Cincinnati, in Evendale, Ohio, one of the world's top jet engine suppliers for commercial and military aircraft.     A 16-page indictment details what appears to be a dramatic international sting operation to lure Mr. Xu to what he believed was a meeting in Belgium to obtain proprietary information about jet fan blade designs from a GE Aviation employee, only to be met by Belgian authorities and put on a plane to the United States.   China has for years used spycraft and cyberattacks to steal American corporate, academic and military information to bolster its growing economic power and political influence. But apprehending an accused Chinese spy -- all others charged by the United States government are still at large -- is an extraordinary development and a sign of the Trump administration's continued crackdown on the Chinese theft of trade secrets.   The administration also outlined on Wednesday new restrictions on foreign investment aimed at keeping China from gaining access to American companies.   The arrest of Mr. Xu ''shows that federal law enforcement authorities can not only detect and disrupt such espionage, but can also catch its perpetrators,'' Benjamin C. Glassman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement.   The coming trial, in federal court in Cincinnati, could further expose China's methods for stealing trade secrets and embarrass officials in Beijing -- part of what current and former administration officials said was a long-term strategy to make stealing secrets costly and shameful for China. Federal prosecutors will have to present additional evidence to prove their case, which could include intercepted communications between government officials or even testimony from cooperating witnesses.   ''If you can make it less expensive in terms of money and reputation to instead invest in R&D, the country's behavior can and will change,'' said John Carlin, the former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, referring to research and development.   In the short term, the Justice Department's aggressive move is likely to worsen tensions as the United States and China engage in a tit-for-tat trade war. Should China respond to the arrest, current and former administration officials said, it is possible that the Chinese government will expel American diplomats or intelligence officers from Beijing.   The indictment outlines China's courting of the GE Aviation employee starting in March 2017. The company, a subsidiary of General Electric, was a ripe target because it builds airplane and helicopter engines for the Pentagon.   An individual identified as an unindicted co-conspirator invited the GE Aviation employee on an all-expense trip to China to meet with scientists at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Once there, the employee was introduced to Mr. Xu, who continued to be in touch by email after the trip.   In January, Mr. Xu invited the employee back to China and told him that he should bring information about GE Aviation's ''system specification, design process.'' Over the next two months, Mr. Xu asked the employee for more details, including what the indictment said was proprietary information about fan blade design.   Mr. Xu and the GE Aviation employee discussed increasingly specific pieces of data that Mr. Xu wanted, and the employee even sent Mr. Xu a file directory of documents on the employee's company-issued laptop.   The two never met again in China, but set up a meeting in Belgium for the employee to pass more secrets to Mr. Xu. In preparation for the employee's trip to Europe, Mr. Xu asked the employee if he would use an external thumb drive to transfer information from the employee's work computer when they met in person.   It is unclear from the indictment if the employee at this point was cooperating with the F.B.I. as part of the sting operation, and it is unclear if the employee ever traveled to Belgium. On Wednesday, the Justice Department praised GE Aviation for its cooperation in the investigation and internal controls that the department said ''protected GE Aviation's proprietary information.''   Mr. Xu was arrested on April 1 in Belgium and remained in custody there until Tuesday. He is now being held in Cincinnati.   Employees of large American corporations traveling to countries like China are often targets for information theft because their devices can be hacked remotely and because they can speak too revealingly of their work while being wined and dined, said Joseph S. Campbell, the former head of the F.B.I.'s criminal investigative division who is now a director at Navigant Consulting.   ''Employees who think they're sharing unimportant information don't realize that they're adding to a broad matrix of knowledge,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''Even with unclassified information, China can put together a fuller picture of a company's sensitive information.''   The government indictment against Mr. Xu leaves open the possibility that the government investigation is continuing. The document says that an unindicted co-conspirator referred to as CF brokered the meeting between Mr. Xu and the GE Aviation employee; it mentions that Mr. Xu was communicating with other Ministry of State Security agents about the spy operation.   The Justice Department is pursuing other thefts of trade secrets for prosecution, said John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division. Together, he said, they show that China has a policy of developing its economy to the detriment of the United States.   ''This case is not an isolated incident,'' Mr. Demers said. ''It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense. We cannot tolerate a nation's stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.''   China has also been targeting General Electric's turbine technology. The F.B.I. arrested in August a dual citizen of the United States and China who worked at General Electric, charging him with stealing the company's technology for the purpose of helping Chinese companies.

Quora Breach Compromised Personal Data Of 100 Million,"Users of Quora, the question-and-answer site, are asking today: Did my personal data just get stolen?    The social platform said late Monday that the account information and private messages of around 100 million users may have been exposed when its computer systems were compromised by ''a malicious third party.'' Quora discovered the data breach on Friday, the company's chief executive, Adam D'Angelo, wrote in a blog post, and it is still investigating how it happened.    ''It is our responsibility to make sure things like this don't happen, and we failed to meet that responsibility,'' Mr. D'Angelo wrote.   The company noted that the incident was unlikely to result in identity theft, as the site does not collect sensitive information such as credit card or Social Security numbers.   Still, coming less than a week after the hotel chain Marriott announced that hackers had stolen the personal data of up to 500 million guests, the incident serves as another reminder that a vast and expanding swath of our lives is vulnerable to digital intrusion.   Quora commands a huge audience. The company says that 300 million people around the world use its site at least once a month to ask and answer questions about politics, faith, calculus, unrequited love, the meaning of life and more. By comparison, Twitter claims 326 million monthly active users.   But since it blasted onto the social media landscape in 2010, igniting a blaze of interest among tech company employees, Quora has not become the mainstream cultural force that Twitter has, for better or for worse. That is perhaps why some Quora users reacted to news of the security breach with surprise -- not that their account information may have been stolen by malicious actors, but that they had a Quora account in the first place.   The company seemed to acknowledge such reactions on Monday. A page of frequently asked questions about the attack includes the query: ''I didn't know I had a Quora account. How is it that my email or information was exposed?''   Its answer: ''You may have signed up for Quora some time ago. While you might not have regularly visited or used Quora, your account remained.''   Follow Raymond Zhong on Twitter: @zhonggg.    "
How a Few People Took Equifax to Small Claims Court Over Its Data Breach and Won,"Christina Bernstein's check finally arrived last week: $7,440 from Equifax for her trouble. She was one of more than 145 million Americans whose financial information was exposed in the company's huge data breach last year. Most got an apology and free credit monitoring from the consumer data clearinghouse, but Ms. Bernstein and a few others found a way to get compensated for their aggravation: Take the corporate giant to small claims court. Many who try don't succeed, but a few have reached confidential settlements and others, like Ms. Bernstein, have prevailed, even if their victories were bittersweet.  ""I'm happy to get the money, but it's not really over because I know my information has been leaked and you can never put it back,"" said Ms. Bernstein, a small-business owner in San Francisco. It was that frustration and sense of helplessness after the breach, as well as the company's response, that first motivated many to pursue Equifax in local court. ""It's sort of important for the human organism to do what you can do,"" said Jessamyn West, a library technologist in central Vermont who won a judgment there against Equifax this month. Those who have won against the company in court say that the key to their success was being prepared and having proof of the harm they experienced -- receipts, for example, for services they would not otherwise have purchased. Research local laws that might apply, they advised. Document everything. ""Take screenshots of internet pages; if you get weird phone calls, keep your phone records,"" Ms. Bernstein said. There are, of course, higher-profile legal battles underway -- the kind in which teams of lawyers spend years battling over enormous sums. Chief among them is a fight before the United States District Court in Atlanta, where nearly 400 separate lawsuits from thousands of people and businesses will be consolidated into one class-action case. But that could take some time to resolve. And even if Equifax loses, victims of the breach may not see much in the way of monetary damages after lawyers take their cut and the winnings are sliced into millions of pieces. That's why Christian Haigh, a co-founder of Legalist, a start-up that pays for litigation on a contingency basis, decided to go it alone, too. ""If you have a class-action lawsuit, a large proportion of it is going to a lawyer or a legal team,"" he said. ""The other thing is small claims is very fast."" He and Ms. Bernstein filed their claims in the same San Francisco court just days apart and both won final judgments in their favor on March 8, six months after Equifax announced its breach. Mr. Haigh received $5,490, but not all successful cases involve such large sums. Ms. West was awarded only $690, about a seventh of what she had requested. The judge who listened to her and an Equifax representative lay out their arguments in a small-town Vermont courthouse last month agreed that Ms. West had suffered from the hacking, but awarded her just enough to cover court costs and two years of identity theft protection, instead of the five years that she had sought. But, for Ms. West, the case was never about the money she could win, which she plans to donate, anyway. It was, at least in part, a form of activism, she said. And while everyone has their reasons, frustration with Equifax was a common theme. The company failed to act on a March 2017 warning from federal authorities about a vulnerability that hackers would later exploit, resulting in the exposure of millions of consumers' Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers and other sensitive personal information. Even after the breach, Equifax fumbled its response, briefly directing worried consumers to a fake, unaffiliated website. By its own admission, the security lapse had cost the company almost $243 million by the end of the first quarter of this year. For many, those missteps were a motivation to act. No matter how futile it seemed to take on a multibillion-dollar corporation, local courts at least offered an opportunity to hold Equifax to account. ""They have a responsibility to either get back to you or lose,"" Ms. West said of the small claims process. ""That's the most fascinating thing."" For Ms. Bernstein, who runs a medical device consulting business, the Equifax breach was particularly frustrating because it threatened to interfere with her ability to apply for government grants. Because the grants often require credit checks, a credit freeze, which experts recommended after the breach, was out of the question. ""I really don't need this aggravation with my credit and my phone number and, God knows, maybe my bank account numbers being leaked all over the internet,"" she recalled thinking. A judge in San Francisco Superior Court agreed, ordering Equifax to pay not only for the cost of credit monitoring, but also for the emotional distress and time Ms. Bernstein spent trying to get through to the company. On appeal, another judge reduced the award by about $2,000, setting it at $7,440. In the end, Ms. Bernstein received restitution and relief: Last week, just days before receiving the Equifax check, Ms. Bernstein opened an envelope containing another check, this one for $15,000 for a grant she had just been awarded.

'Big Red Flag': Automakers' Trade Secrets Exposed in Data Leak,"Automakers like Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen go to great lengths to keep their technical information confidential. Details about assembly line machinery and proprietary robotics are among the industry's most closely guarded trade secrets. But this month, a security researcher came across tens of thousands of sensitive corporate documents -- including many from nearly all of the largest auto manufacturers -- on the open internet, unprotected. The trove included material from more than 100 companies that had interacted with a small Canadian company, Level One Robotics and Controls. Among the documents were detailed blueprints and factory schematics; client materials such as contracts, invoices and work plans; and even dozens of nondisclosure agreements describing the sensitivity of the exposed information.  ""That was a big red flag,"" said Chris Vickery, the researcher who found the data. ""If you see NDAs, you know right away that you've found something that's not supposed to be publicly available."" It was unclear whether anyone else had seen or downloaded the unguarded data, which included some personal information, such as scanned driver's licenses and passports, on Level One employees but otherwise appeared to be confined to corporate secrets. Mr. Vickery alerted the company last week, and the exposed information was taken offline within a day. But the inadvertent exposure of customers' data illustrates a problem confounding businesses: Some of their biggest security risks come from their suppliers and contractors. Many of the worst recent data breaches began with a vendor's mistake. In 2013, thieves infiltrated Target's payment terminals and stole credit and debit card information from 40 million customers. The attackers got in by hacking one of Target's heating and ventilation contractors, then using information stolen from that business to gain access to Target's systems. Just last month, Ticketmaster revealed that payment information from thousands of customers had recently been stolen in a breach it attributed to flawed software from Inbenta, a company running customer support chatbots on TicketMaster's website. Fifty-six percent of the businesses polled last year by Ponemon Institute, a security research firm, said they had at some point experienced a data breach linked to a vendor. The exposure only grows as more third-party companies gain access: The survey's respondents said an average of 470 outside companies had access to their sensitive corporate information, up from around 380 a year earlier. ""It's relatively recently that C-level executives have begun to acknowledge that some of their third-party relationships are creating unbelievable risk,"" said Larry Ponemon, the research firm's founder. The auto industry has a deep and complex supply chain, and third-party security risk is an area of growing concern, said Faye Francy, the executive director of the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a trade group that focuses on cybersecurity. Generally, automakers' top security priority is vehicle risks, she said, such as vulnerabilities that could be used to attack a car's critical components. Leaked corporate documents aren't quite as fraught -- ""I doubt anyone is going to die over it,"" Ms. Francy said -- but the exposure of such information is still worrying. ""No one wants their data outside of their own company,"" she said. ""Anything that showcases how they manufacture is proprietary and competitive."" Mr. Vickery, the director of cyber risk research at UpGuard, a security services company in Mountain View, Calif., has made a career out of hunting unguarded data caches. He's a rarity in the industry: a security sleuth who doesn't hack. Instead, he searches communication ports and the internet's hive of connected devices to find information inadvertently made public. His discoveries have included medical records, airport security files, hotel bookings, a terrorist screening database and 87 million Mexican voter registration records. Once the sensitive information has been secured, he publicly discloses that the data had been revealed. Mr. Vickery found Level One's data through an exposed backup server. It required no password or special access permissions, he said. Anyone who connected could download the material, which totaled at least 157 gigabytes and contained nearly 47,000 files filled with factory records and diagrams from companies including Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen. Milan Gasko, Level One's chief executive, declined to discuss the details of the exposed information. ""Level One takes these allegations very seriously and is diligently working to conduct a full investigation of the nature, extent and ramifications of this alleged data exposure,"" he said. ""In order to preserve the integrity of this investigation, we will not be providing comment at this time."" Mr. Gasko said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the data had been viewed by any outside parties other than Mr. Vickery, but he did not address questions about whether Level One has tools in place to detect unauthorized access. Level One was founded in 2000 in Windsor, Ontario, and opened an American office six years later outside Detroit. The company provides engineering services, with a focus on robotics and automation, to manufacturing companies, according to its website. Officials from General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen declined to comment on the data exposure. Fiat Chrysler, Ford and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Researchers like Mr. Vickery often face skepticism, and criticism, from the companies that they notify about exposed data -- no business likes to get a phone call telling it that it has revealed sensitive information. But publicizing data breaches is an effective way to get other companies to combat them, he said. ""Nothing gets better in silence, as far as cybersecurity goes,"" Mr. Vickery said. ""Human nature is to try to sweep things under the rug. That hurts our society. We need better data security, and nothing improves unless people realize there's a problem.""

"Marriott Hack Adds Passport Headache, but Its Intensity Is in Dispute","It has become a familiar dance: A company reports a data breach, and you dutifully change your passwords, ask for a new credit card and hope your information doesn't end up for sale on the dark web. But the hack that last week engulfed Marriott -- and 500 million of its customers -- has added a new step: Your passport might be at risk, too.  Whether those customers should go get a new passport is perhaps the most complicated consumer question hanging out there in the wake of the news that millions of Starwood Hotels customers had their data stolen in a breach that began as early as 2014. Brands like Westin, Sheraton, Aloft and W are affected, but not Marriott brands that predate the company's acquisition of Starwood in 2016.  Besides passport information, the thieves took names, addresses, dates of birth, and credit or debit card numbers, though it's possible that they did not get access to every bit of information for each person in the company database.  Given how often bank card fraud occurs, Starwood customers may have obtained a new number in the past few years, anyway.  But a subset of Starwood customers -- those who traveled abroad and had to turn over their passport numbers at the check-in desk -- face a question that few breach victims have faced before: What is the likelihood that someone might use that number to acquire a new passport and use it for no good? [After almost two months of picket lines, Marriott workers have agreed to a settlement.] The State Department says there isn't much of a chance. The World Privacy Forum and the Identity Theft Resource Center say there is -- with a mild qualification. If you're among the Starwood customers who had to hand over passport information, your decision will hang on your taste for the very long odds of very bad people doing horrible things with a passport they acquired in your name. The thieves -- the hackers have not been identified, but the stolen information has not turned up on the dark web, which experts said suggested the work of a state actor -- were able to access passport numbers because local or national rules sometimes require hotels to collect them. Depending on where you go in the world, officials in the place you are visiting may require your hotel to examine your passport and perhaps transmit passport information to local authorities. It is unclear how long Marriott had held on to the information and if it held it longer than it had to. A spokeswoman said the company was not certain about these details yet. A Hilton spokesman said that when its hotels are required to gather passport information, they often upload it via third-party software to the relevant authorities. The length of time such information is retained depends on the location of the hotel. A Hyatt spokeswoman said that it collects the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide services that guests say they want or to comply with local rules. It is also not clear how many former Starwood customers have a decision to make about their passports. A Marriott spokeswoman would only say that it believed that the number would be a ""very small subset"" of the larger group but that it did not have a precise number just yet. But even a small subset of 500 million can be a very big number: If two-tenths of a percent of customers are affected, that would be one million people. The State Department does not believe those people need new passports. The logic goes like this: Nobody can access your travel records using a passport number, nor can anyone travel in your name simply by presenting those digits. If the thieves try to obtain a replacement in your name, they'll run into difficulty: Unable to present a lost or expired passport, they would need a sheaf of other documents to prove that they are you. But that's where the danger lies, said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. Sophisticated thieves can clear those hurdles, she said.  ""The Marriott breach is risky precisely because they had the passport number plus all of the demographic information,"" she said of the thieves. She worried in particular about an emerging form of fraud called ""morphing"" -- in which determined thieves create fake supporting documents and then try to obtain a passport in your name. Part of the process involves creating an image by merging a photo of you that they find online with a photo of a thief -- similar to the ""deepfake"" videos that can already be found on the internet.  Ms. Dixon said she would replace her passport once she finished a pending trip abroad. Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said that she would do the same if she received notification from Marriott indicating that thieves retrieved useful information like her address and date of birth in addition to her passport number. (Marriott is just beginning the process of informing customers if their data is on the loose.) To be clear: Thieves probably won't be making a few million passports. For any one person to become a victim, the thieves would need to be in the business of faking identities in the first place. That may not be their endgame at all. Then, they'd have to pick on your data and be successful in getting a passport in your name. Then, they'd have to choose to use it. The odds of all that happening are low. In the world of payment cards -- where fraud is not nearly as complicated -- it's still a small portion of customers that have to deal with it. A Visa spokeswoman said that as its algorithms improved and companies became more sophisticated, it has seen fraud rates on at-risk card accounts falling below 5 percent. That won't keep some people from wanting to do anything they can to avoid even rock-bottom odds of, say, landing in jail when they try to enter another country someday. So they'll get a new passport, which comes with a new passport number. For now, Marriott doesn't want to pay for that peace of mind. Instead, it's setting up a process to work with guests who may one day experience passport fraud that they believe was a result of this breach. Then and only then will it reimburse people for the costs involved with getting a new passport. On Sunday, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called on the company to reimburse people who choose to obtain new passports. Marriott is offering customers free enrollment in a service called Web Watcher from the security company Kroll, which scans the dark web for information that thieves may be trying to sell. You can give the service your passport number and ask it to watch out for those figures out there in the blackness -- but the membership expires after a year. But breach anxiety can be forever, or at least 10 years: the standard renewal period for adults' passports. So why can't a company, just once, say something like the following? ""We're sorry. And we're going to protect you for as long as you feel like you need protecting."" Stacy Cowley contributed reporting.

Will Cryptocurrencies Be the Art Market's Next Big Thing?,"LONDON -- There's a new gold rush. But this precious metal doesn't actually exist. The frenzy is for so-called cryptocurrencies -- or encrypted digital money -- and their value skyrocketed in 2017. The price of Bitcoin, the pioneer decentralized virtual currency, rose more than 1,300 percent last year, despite plunging 40 percent at one point in December. A Bitcoin rival, Ether, was up 8,000 percent. It is thought that the total worldwide value of cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion this year.    Bitcoin and its derivatives have, for the moment, proved too volatile and unwieldy for day-to-day transactions. Yet the cryptocurrency model, underpinned by decentralized blockchain ledger technology, is increasingly becoming a force in more specialized areas of the economy. The art world is one of them.   On Dec. 16, the nascent market for what might be called cryptoart appeared to reach a new level when the hitherto-unknown Distributed Gallery announced the auction of ''Ready Made Token,'' a unique unit of a cryptocurrency that the gallery said was created by Richard Prince using technology from Ethereum, the network responsible for Ether.    The online gallery describes itself as the first to specialize in ''blockchain-based artwork and exhibition.'' It invited bids for the work, starting at one Ether, equivalent to about $650 at the time. (As of Friday, one Ether was worth about $1,200, according to ethereumprice.org.) The timed auction ends on Monday.   The appearance of a crypto ''ready-made'' by an artist of Mr. Prince's stature seemed to suddenly put blockchain on the art world map. Distributed Gallery even arranged for Mr. Prince to attend the inaugural Rare Digital Art Festival in New York on Saturday.   But when buying into the world of cryptocurrencies, it can be difficult to determine what is real.   Consider this Twitter post from Mr. Prince on Jan. 6:   In fact, Distributed Gallery had no connection with the American artist. This virtual dealership and its ''Ready Made Token'' are instead a playful experiment devised by Olivier Sarrouy, a philosophy and sociology lecturer at the University Rennes 2 in France, along with three friends.   ''We were trying to explore how a cryptocurrency could relate to scarcity in the art market,'' Mr. Sarrouy, 32, said in a telephone interview. ''It reinterpreted Marcel Duchamp's gesture of the ready-made in a radical way.''   But why Richard Prince?   ''To make a ready-made we needed a signature, but we were no one in the art world,'' Mr. Sarrouy said, adding that he and his friends had chosen Richard Prince ''because he is the king of appropriation art.''   ''Our artwork has been created by our own Richard Prince,'' he said. ''And then there is the famous Richard Prince.''   The appropriation of this name was certainly mischievous, given that the ''famous'' Richard Prince continues to be involved in a lawsuit concerning his appropriation of an Instagram-sourced photograph for a 2014 exhibition. Adding further confusion, Mr. Prince's most recent show of paintings at the Gladstone Gallery was titled ''Ripple,'' which also happens to the name of a high-rising cryptocurrency.   Mr. Prince declined to comment for this column.   ''The project is interesting,'' said Judy Mam, an organizer of the Rare Digital Art Festival, referring to the Distributed Gallery's Duchampian token. ''But we're talking about people who are putting up money,'' she added. ''That's when the theoretical aspect of the project comes crashing down.'' It no longer features in the festival program.   As of Wednesday, Distributed Gallery's auction had attracted four participants, who bid in Ether up to a value of about $2,600. Three bidders who thought they were competing for a work by the ''famous'' Mr. Prince have received or are in the process of receiving a refund, according to Mr. Sarrouy. ''The last one has bet knowing what this project was all about,'' he said, ''and is still the highest bidder.''   Meanwhile, delegates at the Rare Digital Art Festival planned to discuss how to take memes and the other infinitely copyable stuff of the internet and turn them into ''rare, tradable blockchain assets.''   Since late November, the most spectacular proof of this concept has been CryptoKitties. These cute virtual felines have a collectibility -- and tradeability -- that has attracted more than 235,000 registered users and more than 37,000 Ether, or about $52 million in transactions, according to the company. Cryptokitties.co charges 3.75 percent every time a cat ''breeds'' with another or is sold in its own marketplace. In December, one of the 100 ''Founder Cats'' traded for 253.3368 Ether, equivalent at the time to about $111,000. (It would now be more than $300,000.)   Mack Flavelle, co-founder of CryptoKitties, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, thinks that digital art could be a major beneficiary of the explosion in virtual wealth.   ''There's not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,'' said Mr. Flavelle, 37, who planned to attend the festival on Saturday. ''We gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum. It's early days, but this could happen in the blossoming art space as well. The blockchain is an entirely new medium for art.''   Matt Hall and John Watkinson, creators of CryptoPunks, also plan to be at the festival. CryptoPunks are 10,000 unique algorithm-generated characters, 9,000 of which were given away in June 2017 for collecting and trading on the Ethereum platform. Coveted ''punks'' are now selling for 10 Ether, or about $13,500 as of Wednesday, lifting the investment value of the founders' retained 10 percent.   Being pegged to cryptocurrencies, digital collectibles have risen (and fallen) in value at a far faster rate than just about everything in the analogue art world. They can be bought for a few dollars and sold for nominal fees. There's no need to enter the intimidating world of galleries and auction houses to acquire them. True, the buyer doesn't get to own a physical work of art, but then consumer research increasingly reveals that millennials are less hung up about possession.   ''If you can create a market for kittens, you can do it for digital art,'' said Anders Petterson, author of the Hiscox Online Art Trade Report. ''Millennials are comfortable with this kind of technology. There is the potential to open up an entire new ecosystem outside the traditional art world.''   Plenty of people think cryptocurrencies will collapse under the weight of financial speculation. But if they don't, they might just turn out to be the art world's big game-changer.    "
"Adrian Lamo, Hacker Who Reported Chelsea Manning to the F.B.I., Dies at 37","Adrian Lamo, a hacker best known for breaking into the computer networks of The New York Times and other major corporations, and for reporting the Army whistle-blower Chelsea Manning to the authorities, was found dead on Wednesday in Wichita, Kan. He was 37. Mr. Lamo's body was discovered in an apartment in the city, The Wichita Eagle reported. His father announced the death in a post on Facebook on Friday. Kate Flavin, a spokeswoman for Sedgwick County, Kan., said on Saturday that the cause of death was unknown.     Mr. Lamo was 22 when federal prosecutors accused him of breaking into The Times's computer network, creating fake usernames and running up over $300,000 in data research fees. Mr. Lamo also gained access to the computer networks of Yahoo, Microsoft and Cingular Wireless, prosecutors said.   ''It's like someone kicking in your front door while you're on vacation and running up a $300,000 bill on your phone, and then telling you when you arrive home that he had performed a useful service by demonstrating that your deadbolt wasn't secure enough,'' James B. Comey, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in 2003, referring to Mr. Lamo's activities.   Mr. Lamo pleaded guilty to one count of computer damage, telling a federal judge that he was ''genuinely remorseful'' for his actions. He was sentenced to house arrest and probation.   Mr. Lamo was never a ''malicious hacker,'' his father, Mario Lamo, said in a message, adding, ''Everything that he did was out of curiosity.'' The younger Mr. Lamo told Wired magazine in 2010 that he had Asperger's syndrome.   In 2010, Ms. Manning, an Army private, contacted Mr. Lamo via instant message. They chatted for a week about her personal problems in the military. Ms. Manning admitted that she had leaked classified video of a helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two Reuters employees, to WikiLeaks.org, which published the video online under the title ''Collateral Murder.''   Mr. Lamo said Ms. Manning had also admitted leaking to WikiLeaks 260,000 classified diplomatic cables and video of a 2009 Afghanistan airstrike that left 96 people dead.   ''He was just grabbing information from where he could get it and trying to leak it,'' Mr. Lamo told The  Times in 2010 about Ms. Manning, a transgender woman who was then known as Bradley Manning.   Mr. Lamo called the F.B.I. and relayed Ms. Manning's admissions. She was arrested and eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking over 750,000 documents and video, the longest punishment ever imposed for a leak conviction. President Barack Obama commuted Ms. Manning's sentence in January 2017, and she recently filed to run for the United States Senate in Maryland.   Mr. Lamo said he was worried that the leaks provided by Ms. Manning would endanger people's lives.   ''I thought to myself, 'What if somebody dies because this information is leaked?''' he said in 2010.   WikiLeaks and others condemned Mr. Lamo for turning Ms. Manning in to the federal authorities.   Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, called Mr. Lamo a ''serial F.B.I. snitch'' on Twitter. On the comments of the Facebook post announcing Mr. Lamo's death, some called him a ''real hero'' and ''true patriot.''   Mario Lamo said his son went through a difficult period after reporting Ms. Manning to the authorities.   ''He was vilified by many people by his position about the Manning affair,'' he said. ''I was with him when this happened and understood that he lived by some principles and he stood for them.''   In addition to his father, Mr. Lamo is survived by his mother, Mary Atwood, and two siblings.   Follow Jeffery C. Mays on Twitter: @jeffcmays.     "
"Russia's Tricks, Minus Russia, In Senate Race","As Russia's online election machinations came to light last year, a group of Democratic tech experts decided to try out similarly deceptive tactics in the fiercely contested Alabama Senate race, according to people familiar with the effort and a report on its results. The secret project, carried out on Facebook and Twitter, was likely too small to have a significant effect on the race, in which the Democratic candidate it was designed to help, Doug Jones, edged out the Republican, Roy S. Moore. But it was a sign that American political operatives of both parties have paid close attention to the Russian methods, which some fear may come to taint elections in the United States.    One participant in the Alabama project, Jonathon Morgan, is the chief executive of New Knowledge, a small cyber security firm that wrote a scathing account of Russia's social media operations in the 2016 election that was released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee.   An internal report on the Alabama effort, obtained by The New York Times, says explicitly that it ''experimented with many of the tactics now understood to have influenced the 2016 elections.''    The project's operators created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians, using it to try to divide Republicans and even to endorse a write-in candidate to draw votes from Mr. Moore. It involved a scheme to link the Moore campaign to thousands of Russian accounts that suddenly began following the Republican candidate on Twitter, a development that drew national media attention.   ''We orchestrated an elaborate 'false flag' operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,'' the report says.   Mr. Morgan said in an interview that the Russian botnet ruse ''does not ring a bell,'' adding that others had worked on the effort and had written the report. He said he saw the project as ''a small experiment'' designed to explore how certain online tactics worked, not to affect the election.   Mr. Morgan said he could not account for the claims in the report that the project sought to ''enrage and energize Democrats'' and ''depress turnout'' among Republicans, partly by emphasizing accusations that Mr. Moore had pursued teenage girls when he was a prosecutor in his 30s.   ''The research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,'' said Mr. Morgan. ''We thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.''   The project had a budget of just $100,000, in a race that cost approximately $51 million, including the primaries, according to Federal Election Commission records.   But however modest, the influence effort in Alabama may be a sign of things to come. Campaign veterans in both parties fear the Russian example may set off a race to the bottom, in which candidates choose social media manipulation because they fear their opponents will.   ''Some will do whatever it takes to win,'' said Dan Bayens, a Kentucky-based Republican consultant. ''You've got Russia, which showed folks how to do it, you've got consultants willing to engage in this type of behavior and political leaders who apparently find it futile to stop it.''   There is no evidence that Mr. Jones sanctioned or was even aware of the social media project. Joe Trippi, a seasoned Democratic operative who served as a top adviser to the Jones campaign, said he had noticed the Russian bot swarm suddenly following Mr. Moore on Twitter. But he said it was impossible that a $100,000 operation had an impact on the race.   Mr. Trippi said he was nonetheless disturbed by the stealth operation. ''I think the big danger is somebody in this cycle uses the dark arts of bots and social networks and it works,'' he said. ''Then we're in real trouble.''   Despite its small size, the Alabama project brought together some prominent names in the world of political technology. The funding came from Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who has sought to help Democrats catch up with Republicans in their use of online technology.   The money passed through American Engagement Technologies, run by Mikey Dickerson, the founding director of the United States Digital Service, which was created during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government's use of technology. Sara K. Hudson, a former Justice Department fellow now with Investing in Us, a tech finance company partly funded by Mr. Hoffman, worked on the project, along with Mr. Morgan.   A close collaborator of Mr. Hoffman, Dmitri Mehlhorn, the founder of Investing in Us, said in a statement that ''our purpose in investing in politics and civic engagement is to strengthen American democracy'' and that while they do not ''micromanage'' the projects they fund, they are not aware of having financed projects that have used deception. Mr. Dickerson declined to comment and Ms. Hudson did not respond to queries.   The Alabama project got started as Democrats were coming to grips with the Russians' weaponizing of social media to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump.   Mr. Morgan reached out at the time to Renée DiResta, who would later join New Knowledge and was lead author of the report on Russian social media operations released this week.   ''I know there were people who believed the Democrats needed to fight fire with fire,'' Ms. DiResta said, adding that she disagreed. ''It was absolutely chatter going around the party.''   But she said Mr. Morgan simply asked her for suggestions of online tactics worth testing. ''My understanding was that they were going to investigate to what extent they could grow audiences for Facebook pages using sensational news,'' she said.   Mr. Morgan confirmed that the project created a generic page to draw conservative Alabamians -- he said he couldn't remember its name -- and that Mac Watson, one of multiple write-in candidates, contacted the page. ''But we didn't do anything on his behalf,'' he said.   The report, however, says the Facebook page agreed to ''boost'' Mr. Watson's campaign and stayed in regular touch with him, and was ''treated as an advisor and the go-to media contact for the write-in candidate.'' The report claims the page got him interviews with The Montgomery Advertiser and The Washington Post.   Mr. Watson, who runs a patio supply company in Auburn, Ala., confirmed that he got some assistance from a Facebook page whose operators seemed determined to stay in the shadows.   Of dozens of conservative Alabamian-oriented pages on Facebook that he wrote to, only one replied. ''You are in a particularly interesting position and from what we have read of your politics, we would be inclined to endorse you,'' the unnamed operator of the page wrote. After Mr. Watson answered a single question about abortion rights as a sort of test, the page offered an endorsement, though no money.   ''They never spent one red dime as far as I know on anything I did -- they just kind of told their 400 followers, 'Hey, vote for this guy,''' Mr. Watson said.   Mr. Watson never spoke with the page's author or authors by phone, and they declined a request for meeting. But he did notice something unusual: his Twitter followers suddenly ballooned from about 100 to about 10,000. The Facebook page's operators asked Mr. Watson whether he trusted anyone to set up a super PAC that could receive funding and offered advice on how to sharpen his appeal to disenchanted Republican voters.   Shortly before the election, the page sent him a message, wishing him luck.   The report does not say whether the project purchased the Russian bot Twitter accounts that suddenly began to follow Mr. Moore. But it takes credit for ''radicalizing Democrats with a Russian bot scandal'' and points to stories on the phenomenon in the mainstream media. ''Roy Moore flooded with fake Russian Twitter followers,'' reported The New York Post.   Inside the Moore campaign, officials began to worry about online interference.   ''We did have suspicions that something odd was going on,'' said Rich Hobson, Mr. Moore's campaign manager. Mr. Hobson said that although he did not recall any hard evidence of interference, the campaign complained to Facebook about potential chicanery.   ''Any and all of these things could make a difference,'' Mr. Hobson said. ''It's definitely frustrating, and we still kick ourselves that Judge Moore didn't win.''   When Election Day came, Mr. Jones became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in a quarter of a century, defeating Mr. Moore by 21,924 votes in a race that drew more than 22,800 write-in votes. More than 1.3 million ballots were cast over all.   Many of the write-in votes went to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Condoleezza Rice -- an Alabama native and former secretary of state -- certain popular football coaches and Jesus Christ. Mr. Watson drew just a few hundred votes.   Mr. Watson noticed one other oddity. The day after the vote, the Facebook page that had taken such an interest in him had vanished.   ''It was a group that, like, honest to God, next day was gone,'' said Mr. Watson.   ''It was weird,'' he said. ''The whole thing was weird.''    "
"Adrián Lamo, Hacker Who Reported Chelsea Manning to the F.B.I., Dies at 37","Adrián Lamo, a hacker best known for breaking into the computer networks of The New York Times and other major corporations, and for reporting the Army whistle-blower Chelsea Manning to the authorities, was found dead on Wednesday in Wichita, Kan. He was 37. Mr. Lamo's body was discovered in an apartment in the city, The Wichita Eagle reported. His father announced the death in a post on Facebook on Friday. Kate Flavin, a spokeswoman for Sedgwick County, Kan., said on Saturday that the cause of death was unknown.  Mr. Lamo was 22 when federal prosecutors accused him of breaking into The Times's computer network, creating fake usernames and running up over $300,000 in data research fees. Mr. Lamo also gained access to the computer networks of Yahoo, Microsoft and Cingular Wireless, prosecutors said. ""It's like someone kicking in your front door while you're on vacation and running up a $300,000 bill on your phone, and then telling you when you arrive home that he had performed a useful service by demonstrating that your deadbolt wasn't secure enough,"" James B. Comey, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in 2003, referring to Mr. Lamo's activities. Mr. Lamo pleaded guilty to one count of computer damage, telling a federal judge that he was ""genuinely remorseful"" for his actions. He was sentenced to house arrest and probation. Mr. Lamo was never a ""malicious hacker,"" his father, Mario Lamo, said in a message, adding, ""Everything that he did was out of curiosity."" The younger Mr. Lamo told Wired magazine in 2010 that he had Asperger's syndrome. In 2010, Ms. Manning, an Army private, contacted Mr. Lamo via instant message. They chatted for a week about her personal problems in the military. Ms. Manning admitted that she had leaked classified video of a helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two Reuters employees, to WikiLeaks.org, which published the video online under the title ""Collateral Murder."" Mr. Lamo said Ms. Manning had also admitted leaking to WikiLeaks 260,000 classified diplomatic cables and video of a 2009 Afghanistan airstrike that left 96 people dead. ""He was just grabbing information from where he could get it and trying to leak it,"" Mr. Lamo told The Times in 2010 about Ms. Manning, a transgender woman who was then known as Bradley Manning. Mr. Lamo called the F.B.I. and relayed Ms. Manning's admissions. She was arrested and eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking over 700,000 government records, the longest punishment ever imposed for a leak conviction. President Barack Obama commuted Ms. Manning's sentence in January 2017, and she recently filed to run for the United States Senate in Maryland. Mr. Lamo said he was worried that the leaks provided by Ms. Manning would endanger people's lives. ""I thought to myself, 'What if somebody dies because this information is leaked?'"" he said in 2010. WikiLeaks and others condemned Mr. Lamo for turning Ms. Manning in to the federal authorities. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, called Mr. Lamo a ""serial F.B.I. snitch"" on Twitter. In comments on the Facebook post announcing Mr. Lamo's death, some called him a ""real hero"" and ""true patriot."" Mario Lamo said his son went through a difficult period after reporting Ms. Manning to the authorities. ""He was vilified by many people by his position about the Manning affair,"" he said. ""I was with him when this happened and understood that he lived by some principles and he stood for them."" Adrián Alfonso Lamo Atwood was born in Malden, Mass., on Feb. 20, 1981. He attended high school in San Francisco before being expelled after altercations with his computer teacher. Mario Lamo said his son went on to obtain his high school equivalency diploma and later became friends with the computer teacher. Mr. Lamo first became interested in computers after receiving a hand-me-down Commodore 64. He became familiar with software after gaining access to the coding used to create the video games that he played. After receiving his first laptop computer in high school, Mr. Lamo began using a simple web browser to find holes in security. Mr. Lamo would report the security holes he uncovered to the affected companies. Until his death, Mario Lamo said, his son worked as a computer security consultant. In addition to his father, Mr. Lamo is survived by his mother, Mary Atwood, and two siblings, Andrea Lamo Atwood and Julián Lamo Atwood.

"Suspect Identified in C.I.A. Leak Was Charged, but Not for the Breach","In weekly online posts last year, WikiLeaks released a stolen archive of secret documents about the Central Intelligence Agency's hacking operations, including software exploits designed to take over iPhones and turn smart television sets into surveillance devices. It was the largest loss of classified documents in the agency's history and a huge embarrassment for C.I.A. officials. Now, the prime suspect in the breach has been identified: a 29-year-old former C.I.A. software engineer who had designed malware used to break into the computers of terrorism suspects and other targets, The New York Times has learned. Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched the Manhattan apartment of the suspect, Joshua A. Schulte, one week after WikiLeaks released the first of the C.I.A. documents in March last year, and then stopped him from flying to Mexico on vacation, taking his passport, according to court records and relatives. The search warrant application said Mr. Schulte was suspected of ""distribution of national defense information,"" and agents told the court they had retrieved ""N.S.A. and C.I.A. paperwork"" in addition to a computer, tablet, phone and other electronics.  But instead of charging Mr. Schulte in the breach, referred to as the Vault 7 leak, prosecutors charged him last August with possessing child pornography, saying agents had found 10,000 illicit images on a server he created as a business in 2009 while studying at the University of Texas at Austin. Court papers quote messages from Mr. Schulte that suggest he was aware of the encrypted images of children being molested by adults on his computer, though he advised one user, ""Just don't put anything too illegal on there."" In September, Mr. Schulte was released on the condition that he not leave New York City, where he lived with a cousin, and keep off computers. He was jailed in December after prosecutors found evidence that he had violated those rules, and he has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan since then. He has posted on Facebook under a pseudonym a series of essays critical of the criminal justice system. It is unclear why, more than a year after he was arrested, he has not been charged or cleared in connection with Vault 7. Leak investigators have had access to electronic audit trails inside the C.I.A. that may indicate who accessed the files that were stolen, and they have had possession of Mr. Schulte's personal data for many months. In court in January, a prosecutor, the assistant United States attorney Matthew J. Laroche, said that ""the government immediately had enough evidence"" to make Mr. Schulte a target of the investigation. He said that the investigation was continuing, and that it involved in part how Tor, software that allows anonymous communication on the internet, ""was used in transmitting classified information."" Mr. Schulte's lawyers have repeatedly demanded that prosecutors make a decision on the Vault 7 leak charges. Prosecutors said in court last week that they planned to file a new indictment in the next 45 days, and Mr. Schulte's lawyer Sabrina P. Shroff, of the federal public defender's office, asked the court to impose a deadline on any charges that the government sought to bring under the Espionage Act for supplying the secret C.I.A. files to WikiLeaks. ""This case has been dragging since August 2017,"" Ms. Shroff said in an interview. ""The government should be required to indict so Mr. Schulte has the opportunity to defend himself. Otherwise he is just languishing."" Spokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment. When WikiLeaks began to post the stolen documents last year, the C.I.A. said in a statement, ""The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries."" Family members, who have spent much of their savings on legal fees, say they believe that Mr. Schulte is a scapegoat for the C.I.A.'s inability to secure its most sensitive files. They say the child pornography charges, based on his actions nine years ago when he was 20, are a thin pretext for keeping him incarcerated. ""I am just scared to death,"" said Roger Schulte, Mr. Schulte's father, who lives in Lubbock, Tex. ""I think he's innocent of all these crimes, as far as everything I've seen."" The elder Mr. Schulte said that his son was in college when he built the server later found to contain child pornography, and that he ""had so many people accessing it he didn't care what people put on it."" Far from leaking classified information, his father said, Mr. Schulte had actually complained about security vulnerabilities at the C.I.A., first to his superiors and later to the agency's inspector general and to a House Intelligence Committee staff member. Family members shared with The Times evidence of those contacts, which predated the Vault 7 release. According to his family and his LinkedIn page, Mr. Schulte did an internship at the National Security Agency while working on a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. He worked in the C.I.A.'s Engineering Development Group, which designed the hacking tools used by its Center for Cyber Intelligence. He left the agency in November 2016 and moved to New York to work for Bloomberg L.P. as a software engineer. Most of the government's cyberespionage is carried out by the N.S.A., but the C.I.A. also employs hackers. The leaked Vault 7 documents came from the agency's Engineering Development Group and included descriptions and instructions for the use of agency hacking tools, but only a small amount of the actual computer code for the tools. Despite the scale of the breach, Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, Calif., said WikiLeaks had exaggerated the danger to civil liberties from the C.I.A. hacking tools, which he said were actually designed to target small numbers of high-priority targets. Mr. Weaver called the Vault 7 tools ""creative but not really special"" and designed for ""very targeted espionage."" He said the real significance of the leak was that it could happen at all, despite tightened security measures imposed after Edward J. Snowden took hundreds of thousands of classified N.S.A. documents and shared them with journalists. ""Somebody managed to walk out with a huge amount of secret data from a C.I.A. facility,"" he said. If the leaker has been identified, he said, ""that is very reassuring.""

Singapore's Prime Minister Among 1.5 Million Affected by Cyberattack,"A cyberattack on Singapore's public health system has compromised data from 1.5 million people, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, a cancer survivor, the authorities announced on Friday.  ""This was a deliberate, targeted and well-planned cyberattack,"" Singapore's Health Ministry and Ministry of Communications and Information said in a statement. ""It was not the work of casual hackers or criminal gangs."" Singaporeans who visited certain outpatient clinics between May 1, 2015, and July 4, 2018, may have been affected. The target of the attack was SingHealth, which runs four public hospitals and other facilities. The data purloined includes basic personal information: names, addresses, gender, race and birth dates. In addition, information about what drugs were dispensed in outpatient clinics to 160,000 people was exposed and copied during the hack. No other medical records were taken, nor was information tampered with, the health ministry said The government has set up an online service so that people can check if their personal information was compromised. ""We have lodged a police report on the incident,"" the ministry said. ""We apologize for the anxiety caused."" A highly wired city-state that claims to have the highest mobile phone penetration rate in the world, Singapore is on the forefront of efforts to integrate technology into daily life. A new housing development is being used as a testing ground for driverless vehicles, while Singapore residents can use their cellphones to pay parking fees or check where cases of dengue, a tropical disease, have broken out. Singapore's Smart Nation government website says people can use their smartphones to access ""personalized health records at your fingertips!"" The hack appeared to have used malware to infiltrate the system. The government said the hackers, who have not been named, had ""specifically and repeatedly targeted"" the data about Mr. Lee, Singapore's prime minister, including the medicines he had been dispensed on an outpatient basis. In 2013, Mr. Lee's website was targeted by hackers who said they were part of the hacking collective Anonymous. ""I don't know what the attackers were hoping to find,"" Mr. Lee wrote in a Facebook post on Friday, of the health breach. ""Perhaps they were hunting for some dark state secret, or at least something to embarrass me."" ""If so they would have been disappointed,"" he added. ""My medication data is not something I would ordinarily tell people about, but there is nothing alarming in it.""

How to Look for Proof of a Spoof; TECH TIP,"Q. I received one (and only one) warning from a friend that she had gotten a ""this might be of interest"" email from me and said I was hacked. Nobody else I have asked got it. Is there a way to verify I have been hacked before I go through the trouble of changing my primary email address?   A. If only one friend received such a message and you can still log into your email account, it's more likely a spammer is ""spoofing"" (forging) your address and has not fully hacked in to take control of the account. Spoofing is a popular way to evade junk-mail filters and get you to open the message -- and possibly click on a fraudulent or malware-loaded link. The forged address also lets the perpetrator avoid bounce-back messages to a traceable account.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do about a remote spammer's sticking your address in an email ""From"" field. Your information may have even been collected from the contact list of the person who reported the suspicious message, if that person's computer is infected with malware. Spammers can also grab working email addresses from public posts you've made online, as well as from mailing lists or web pages. Warn your acquaintances that someone is spoofing your address. If you get a curious message from a friend yourself, you can check the email header information to see if the account was truly hacked. In your mail programs options, settings or view menu, look for a ""show original"" or ""view message header"" command to see the message's path across the internet. If the Authenticated Sender line in the header information shows that it did come from the address in question, the mail account has been compromised because the message was sent with the user's name and password as verification. To maintain your own mail security, change your account's password on a regular basis and run malware and antivirus scans frequently to catch anything that may have sneaked onto your system. You may also want to avoid making posts in online forums with your primary email address and use a secondary, ""throwaway"" email account when signing up for mailing lists and other places where your information might be shared with others.

Staying Safer on Public Networks; TECH TIP,"Q. When I use an unsecured network and log into a website, does S.S.L. (https://) prevent anyone from capturing my password? A. Secure Sockets Layer, also known as S.S.L., is a worldwide technology standard that creates a private, encrypted link between the web browser on your computer and the web server you are communicating with online. Using a S.S.L. connection lowers the risk that someone on a public network could intercept sensitive information like credit card numbers or passwords transmitted between you and the site you are using.   Sites that have S.S.L. enabled typically have an U.R.L. that starts with https:// and display a padlock icon in the address bar; some browsers show the site's name in green as well. However, just because a site is using S.S.L. technology does not mean you are fully protected from internet ills.  To set up S.S.L. on a site, its administrators must get a security certificate from a trusted source or ""certificate authority."" The digital security certificate ensures that, among other things, the owners of the site have been verified as legitimate and that the communication with users will be encrypted. But just because the connection to the site is secure, it does not mean the site itself is safe -- so avoid giving personal information to websites you are not familiar with, even if it shows a secure connection. A Certificate Authority can sell certificates to all kinds of sites, including ones that may be quietly slipping malicious software onto your computer when you visit. (In past years, fraudsters have even set up fake S. S. L. certificates and have tried to break the encryption, so the technology itself is a target.) Sites can also purchase security certificates with different levels of validation from trusted authorities. These levels include the basic Domain Validation for standard encryption and verification, and go up to Extended Validation, which has the highest level of security because the site goes through a more thorough level of vetting before the certificate is issued. In theory, a sinister site wanting to appear secure could quickly get a simple Domain Validation certificate and set up shop. So while a S.S.L. connection indicates your communications with a website are encrypted even on public networks, you can increase your safety level for all your browsing by using virtual private network software to encrypt all your internet traffic on open Wi-Fi networks -- if you are not able to use your own secured home network for financial matters and other sensitive business. The Federal Trade Commission's site has a general guide for using public wireless networks, as well as a guide for keeping your own home wireless network secure. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Tech Thinks It Has a Fix for the Problems It Created: Blockchain,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Worried about someone hacking the next election? Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal information? The technology industry has an answer called the blockchain -- even for the problems the industry helped to create. The first blockchain was created in 2009 as a new kind of database for the virtual currency Bitcoin, where all transactions could be stored without any banks or governments involved. Now, countless entrepreneurs, companies and governments are looking to use similar databases -- often independent of Bitcoin -- to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society. ""People feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data,"" said Ryan Shea, a co-founder of Blockstack, a New York company working with blockchain technology.  The creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has said the blockchain could help reduce the big internet companies' influence and return the web to his original vision. But he has also warned that it could come with some of the same problems as the web. Blockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority. In theory, this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hacked. Investors, for one, see potential. While the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have plummeted this year, investment in other blockchain projects has remained strong. In the first three months of 2018, venture capitalists put half a billion dollars into 75 blockchain projects, more than double what they raised in the last quarter of 2017, according to data from Pitchbook. Most of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing, and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting. But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things, like the way we vote and the way we interact online. ""There is just so much it can do,"" said Bradley Tusk, a former campaign manager for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects. ""I love the fact that you can transmit data, information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack -- really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient."" Mr. Tusk, the founder of Tusk Strategies, is an investor in some large virtual currency companies. He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain-based systems. Mr. Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper-proof way. ""Everything is moving toward people saying, 'I want all the benefits of the internet, but I want to protect my privacy and my security,'"" he said. ""The only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain."" Blockchains assemble data into so-called blocks that are chained together using complicated math. Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps, any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions. The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain -- and most of its imitators -- are kept by a peer-to-peer computer network. The novel structure allows people to set up online accounts that can securely hold valuable personal information without having to trust a single entity that can hoard, abuse or lose control of the data, as happened with Facebook and the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax. A range of corporations and governments are trying to apply the blockchain model -- for projects from the prosaic to the radical. Various departments of the United Nations now have blockchain experiments looking to tackle climate change, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the identity challenges faced by stateless people. Coca-Cola and the State Department recently announced a project to register foreign employees on a blockchain in an attempt to eliminate forced labor. These experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados, who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with old-fashioned databases. Other critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry: a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly tested. ""The blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say, 'Yes, we are the solution,' and they have every incentive to do so,"" said Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. ""But somebody needs to ask the question: 'Is it actually better? Is it measurably better?'"" Many blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through so-called initial coin offerings last year. These fund-raising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversight. But new blockchain efforts continue apace, motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTube. Most of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements. This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data -- as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles. And start-ups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their hands. Blockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of it. The animating force behind the project is that users -- rather than Blockstack or any other company -- would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online service. Blockstack is one of several blockchain-based projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that don't rely on having unfettered access to our personal information. The idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebook's relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke, Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchain-based alternatives. ""As Facebook is collapsing we need to replace it with a blockchain based, decentralized platform!"" one user, @GerdMoeBehrens, wrote. ""#blockchain WE NEED U NOW!!!"" wrote another, @andymartin46. But Mr. Berners-Lee has warned that the development of the blockchain could come with unintended consequences, like more activity from criminals operating outside the oversight of governments. Even blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand, when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly develop. In fact, most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy. For example, the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data -- details of the transactions between users -- to be seen by anyone, even if other data -- the users' identities -- remains obscured. Voting start-ups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain, but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concerns. Blockchain-based accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys, which people are famously bad at doing. With Bitcoin, when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account -- if someone lost the private key to a blockchain-based online account, they could lose access to their identity. ""We're not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems,"" said Michael Casey, a co-author of ""The Truth Machine,"" a new book on the blockchain. ""What's important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we face."" Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper. Related Articles  "
Russian Hackers Again Aim at Doping Investigators by Releasing Stolen Emails,"A Russian cyberespionage group that has made international athletes a top target published a new set of stolen emails on Wednesday, seeking to highlight discord among global sports officials and the antidoping investigators who deconstructed Russia's systematic doping. The cyberespionage group -- known as Fancy Bear and linked to Russia's main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U. -- called the communications evidence of ''sports officials' tension over the fight for power and cash,'' pointing to antidoping authorities' desire for independence from Olympic officials.     In one internal message released Wednesday, a top lawyer for the International Olympic Committee criticized the World Anti-Doping Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports, for having published two damning investigative reports about the Russian doping scandal without having first discussed their content with sports officials.   ''It seems that RM's first report was intended to lead to the complete expulsion of the Russian team from the Rio Games,'' the lawyer, Howard Stupp, wrote, referring to the sports investigator Richard McLaren. Mr. McLaren spent nearly a year investigating Russia's widespread cheating and ultimately produced two voluminous reports in 2016, but did not recommend specific sanctions.   ''And the second report? To expulse the Russian team from the Pyeongchang Games?'' Mr. Stupp wrote, referring to the coming 2018 Winter Olympics, which begin Feb. 9. ''This put the I.O.C.,'' as well as the officials overseeing each sport and the Olympic movement in general, he wrote, ''in a very difficult position.''   A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee declined to comment on the communications published Wednesday. Mr. McLaren did not immediately respond to a request for his reaction to the leaked emails.   Last month, the organization banned the Russian Federation from the 2018 Winter Games but left the door open for individual Russian athletes to compete as neutrals. While it has not yet been determined just how many Russian athletes will clear the bar for competition, some critics who advocated a blanket ban on Russian athletes have cautioned that the punishment could have too many loopholes and enable Russia to send a sizable delegation.   Much of the information published Wednesday was unsurprising, reflecting routine logistical discussions among investigators, lawyers and Olympic staff members regarding, for example, the retesting of urine samples from the 2012 London Games and the 2014 Sochi Games, where Russia cheated most elaborately.   Fancy Bear emphasized, however, that some of the investigators who had worked to expose the details of Russia's cheating also had done work for the United States and British governments. As examples, the hackers pointed to Martin Dubbey, who worked with Mr. McLaren, and David Tinsley, the chief executive of 5 Stones intelligence and a former agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Neither man immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday.   Some antidoping officials said that while the hackers might have intended to embarrass or expose them, the information only underscored their efforts to disentangle the jobs of sports officials -- who are tasked with promoting competitions and making them profitable -- from the work of drug-testing officials working to root out cheating that damages the brand image of those competitions.   ''If anything it shows what we've said since Day 1 of our existence: You can't both promote and police,'' Travis T. Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said Wednesday. ''You have to have independent organizations handling antidoping operations.''   Fancy Bear first published the private medical records of Western athletes -- a majority of them American and British -- in the summer of 2016, at the peak of the Russian doping scandal. Those medical records, reflecting that certain athletes had received special medical permission to use banned medications, sought to discredit the athletes in question, none of whom had committed a violation, sports officials said.   Last year, American intelligence officials published a declassified report linking Fancy Bear to Russia's main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., and attributing to the group hacks of both the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Democratic National Committee.   ''The genuine intentions of the coalition headed by the Anglo-Saxons are much less noble than a war against doping,'' the Russian hackers wrote on their website, echoing Russian officials' repeated claims of Western conspiracies seeking to undermine Russia and calling Mr. McLaren's investigation of Russian sports cheating ''a smoke screen for special agents.''   ''It is apparent that the Americans and the Canadians are eager to remove the Europeans from the leadership in the Olympic movement,'' they wrote, ''to achieve political dominance of the English-speaking nations.''

"New Credit App, Same Old Equifax","Equifax introduced a free consumer service Wednesday that allows people to lock access to their credit files from a mobile phone. It didn't work. Are you surprised?    After cyberthieves gained access to 145 million Social Security numbers in a breach at Equifax disclosed last fall, the company's consumer-facing technology melted down. Websites froze, tools to check your potential vulnerability did not work, and people trying to freeze their credit files or temporarily lift the freezes spent hours at the task.   Amid that mess came a promise from Equifax that it would create a simple app that allowed people to ''lock'' their credit files without all the hassle and without a fee. That is what the company introduced Wednesday.   It was supposed to be simple: You download the app and swipe the lock to the right, which restricts access to your file.    Except that's not what happened.   We started by downloading the app -- with my (Tara's) husband's credit file as the guinea pig for the test.   The home screen said, ''Your Equifax credit report -- you're in charge.'' (Nope, not until we can opt out of the credit reporting system altogether. But we digress.)   Before you start trying to lock your credit, you can be diverted and given an option to remove your name from the lists that the credit bureaus give to credit card and insurance companies. That's something you would probably want to do so you're not inundated with marketing offers. Is it easy? Heh.   Here, you have a few choices. You can opt in (which is already selected), you can opt out electronically for five years, or you can opt out permanently by printing the opt-out form. From your phone. Then, you need to walk to the nearest mailbox and send it to Equifax.   But first, you'll need Barbie-sized fingers to fill out the opt-out form, because it isn't optimized for mobile phones and makes typing difficult. So I (Tara) put on my Barbie fingers, and began. I filled out the entire form and then emailed it to myself so I could print it (after all, is your mobile phone hooked up to a printer?).   As it turns out, I emailed myself a blank form. So I had to fill out the entire thing again, but at least I could do that from the luxury of a regular-sized keyboard.   I turned back to my phone and continued on the app. Next, you're asked to enter your name, date of birth, Social Security number, mobile number and address (that's O.K., because most of those are already exposed, right?). After you confirm you're not a robot, you create a password.   The user  agreement and privacy policy come next. Don't click on them! At least not from your phone. If you actually try to read them, as I tried to, when you press ''done'' you may be kicked back to the home screen. And you'll need to start over -- name, date of birth, Social Security number and so on.   Back to creating the account. Once you enter your personal information, you're sent a numeric passcode via text to confirm your identity. My husband read it to me from his phone.   ''1, 2, 3 ... ''   No, it couldn't be.   I laughed, and he continued.   The numerals 4, 5 and 6 did not follow. Phew.   I entered the code. Now, all I had to do was slide to the right and -- voilà! -- his credit file would be locked.   The lock was circling, but I figured it would take 10 seconds. After all, there are roughly 200 million individual credit files. That could take a while.   But several more seconds passed, and I started counting. I got to 90 before I was booted back to the sign-in screen.   I gave it another try. And another. And another still.   That's when we told Equifax. About 90 minutes later, a spokeswoman said the company had identified the issue and resolved it.   Except that it hadn't. The locking mechanism still wouldn't lock. A company spokeswoman said Equifax had not experienced widespread issues with the service, but, as with any new product, there had been isolated problems they were working to resolve. She also offered to put me on the phone with a technical support representative.   Why go to all of this trouble to cut off access to your credit file? Credit-card issuers, mobile phone companies and others generally won't do business with you without first checking your credit report with at least one of the three major bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.   If companies can't get to your file, they won't issue credit. That protects you when thieves get access to your information and then try to open new accounts in your name.   Shutting companies out of your credit files has traditionally meant initiating something called a credit freeze. It often costs a few dollars and you have to use a PIN -- which you may not remember or could lose -- to temporarily lift the freeze when you do want to authorize access to your credit file. Getting a new PIN takes a fair bit of tedious work. (For a longer primer, see our consumer guide to the Equifax breach.) Freezes are also subject to a variety of state laws.   Equifax's new app offers a lock instead of a freeze. Locks works similarly to freezes -- both restrict access to your credit file -- but it should be easier to unlock your credit file since you can do it from your phone with a swipe, and doesn't require a 10-digit pin or a fee.   What is not clear, however, is what disadvantages may come with locks. Many state laws exist that govern freezes, offering consumers protection. By creating locks, the companies avoid them.   ''Freezes are a right mandated by law and not conditional on terms set by companies,'' said Mike Litt, consumer campaign director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group. ''Your rights as a consumer are on firmer ground with a freeze.''   It isn't clear, however, what -- if any -- practical implication this will have.   We offered Equifax the opportunity to promise that their push toward locks will not cause the loss of legal or regulatory protections. The company declined.   The lock's user  agreement does explicitly promise to never add an ''arbitration provision'' to that agreement.   But Equifax reserves the right to change any other terms and also wipes its hands clean of any liability, through another legal clause, should things go wrong. ''Bottom line,'' said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center, ''if the 'lock' fails and you become a victim of identity theft, you have no recourse.''   Which is why vigilance is an important part of protection. Wednesday is the last day that you can sign up for Equifax's monitoring service, TrustedID Premier, which is free for a year. It will alert you to changes in your credit file, among other things.   Meanwhile, Equifax has also waived any fees that may be associated with freezing your credit files through the end of June. You cannot freeze and lock your files at the same time, so you'll have to choose.   We wanted to find a happy ending for the locking problems. So, after I tried to lock my husband's file five times with no luck, I changed course and obtained what we've been telling people to get for years: a freeze. It took all of a minute on Equifax's website.   Maybe in a year or two, Equifax will have its act locked up once and for all.    "
"Barry Crimmins, 64, Caustic Comic and a Warrior Against Sex Abuse, Dies","Barry Crimmins, an outspoken comedian who, as a result of his own traumatic experiences in childhood, also became an outspoken opponent of child pornography and internet services that enable it, died on Wednesday in Syracuse. He was 64. His wife, Helen Crimmins, announced his death on Twitter. In January Mr. Crimmins revealed that he had cancer.    Mr. Crimmins was a central figure on the Boston comedy scene as it blossomed in the 1980s, not only performing but also booking comics for the Ding Ho, a Chinese restaurant in Inman Square, where he was largely responsible for establishing a comedy club in 1979. His stand-up material was full of strong opinions on politics and social issues, a style less familiar then than it is now.    ''Before a lot of these guys like Bill Maher, Jon Stewart, he was one of the first guys that really would nail that kind of thing,'' the comedian and writer Paul Kozlowski said in a 2015 documentary about Mr. Crimmins, ''Call Me Lucky.''   Mr. Crimmins went from comic to activist in May 1992, when, during a performance at Stitches in Boston (another club Mr. Crimmins booked), he revealed that he had been raped as a child by a man who knew his babysitter. The Boston Globe called the admission ''perhaps the most highly charged and soul-baring monologue ever staged in one of the city's comedy clubs.''   He later wrote about the subject for The Boston Phoenix.   Mr. Crimmins became alarmed when he went to research sexual abuse on the just-evolving internet and found that child pornographers were trading images and observations in the newly created chat rooms of AOL.   By 1995 he was expert enough in the subject that he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling AOL ''the key link in a network of child-pornography traffickers'' that was growing rapidly. At the time, many of the senators had only a vague knowledge of the internet and its dangers.   ''The proliferation of child-pornography trafficking has created an anonymous pedophile superstore,'' he told them.   Investigators and AOL began cracking down on the abuses. Mr. Crimmins recently expressed some satisfaction with the role he had played in bringing the problem to light.   ''There's kids who would have been harmed who weren't harmed,'' he told The Globe. ''The bus never hit them.''   Mr. Crimmins was born on July 3, 1953, in Kingston, N.Y., to Phillip Crimmins and Margaret Hooe. He grew up in Skaneateles, N.Y., in the Finger Lakes region near Syracuse.   '' 'Skaneateles' is an Indian word that means 'beautiful lake surrounded by fascists,' '' Mr. Crimmins used to say in a typically caustic joke.   He was raised in the Roman Catholic Church and was no fan of it, often skewering it in his act. He was also no fan of Ronald Reagan, who assumed the presidency in January 1981 just as Mr. Crimmins's career was accelerating.   ''Our international policies under Reagan are great,'' he joked. ''Central American policy's tremendous: If people are hungry, kill them.''   At the Ding Ho he booked comedians like Steven Wright, Paula Poundstone and Bobcat Goldthwait while also pursuing his own stand-up career.   ''He wasn't the most successful comedian in Boston,'' Dana Gould, a writer and comedian, said in ''Call Me Lucky,'' which was directed by Mr. Goldthwait. ''He was like the president of the scene.''   Mr. Crimmins also opened for the singer-songwriter Jackson Browne on a 1988 tour, as well as for other musicians like Billy Bragg. But as the 1980s gave way to the 1990s, friends noticed that Mr. Crimmins's stage act was growing less funny and more harsh, full of ranting and badgering of audience members, as if wrestling with some kind of inner demon.   Then came his confessional performance in 1992. Mr. Goldthwait told The New York Times in 2015 that he first started thinking about making a movie out of Mr. Crimmins's story years ago, initially envisioning a scripted film. But his friend Robin Williams suggested that he try it as a documentary. Mr. Crimmins didn't hold back, Mr. Goldthwait said.   ''He really opened up his whole life to me, and he trusted me,'' he said in a telephone interview.   The two had known each other since Mr. Goldthwait and his friend Tom Kenny -- who, like Mr. Crimmins, had grown up near Syracuse -- asked if they could perform at a comedy show Mr. Crimmins had established in Skaneateles. Mr. Crimmins put them onstage even though they were only teenagers.   ''He just stressed that you had to be original,'' Mr. Goldthwait said, the same demand Mr. Crimmins would later place on the many fledgling comics he booked in Boston.   Mr. Crimmins was also featured in a 2003 documentary, ''When Stand Up Stood Out,'' directed by Fran Solomita. In 2016 he released a comedy special, ''Whatever Threatens You,'' through the website of his friend Louis CK. His book ''Never Shake Hands With a War Criminal'' was published in 2004.   In addition to his mother and his wife, the former Helen Lysen, whom he married last year, he is survived by three sisters.   In recent months, Mr. Crimmins had been active on social media promoting a GoFundMe campaign for his wife, who also has cancer.   Ms. Crimmins, in a telephone interview, remembered Mr. Crimmins's goofy habit of singing improvised songs all day long.   ''It cracked me up,'' she said. ''He cracked himself up. He loved making himself laugh, and he was really good at it.''    "
Japanese Blogger Is Killed After Talk on Online Trolls,"Follow Satoshi Sugiyama on Twitter: @SatoshiJournal Kenichiro Okamoto was an expert on internet crime and a prolific blogger. He studied the ''dark web,'' a part of the internet that relies on encryption and is often exploited, experts say, for illicit activities and hate-mongering. On Sunday evening, he held a two-hour seminar for about 30 people in the city of Fukuoka, about 550 miles west of Tokyo, advising other bloggers on engaging their audiences and dealing with internet trolls.     ''I have encountered many troubles as I have written my blog for many years,'' Mr. Okamoto wrote on a website introducing the seminar. ''Quarrels, pointing out typos, questions about the content, love letters, letters from attorneys, etc.''   The talk ended around 7:45 p.m. About 15 minutes later, he entered a men's room in the building, a former elementary school that now houses a business incubator called Fukuoka Growth Next.   There, Mr. Okamoto, 41, was stabbed several times in the neck and the chest, possibly by a man who had reportedly trolled and harassed him online. Mr. Okamoto was taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead.   The suspect in the killing fled on a bicycle but turned himself in to the police a few hours later, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported, citing unnamed police officials. Before that, someone -- possibly the suspect himself -- had posted an anonymous message online saying that the suspect was ''now going to surrender himself to take responsibility.''   The police have charged the suspect, Hidemitsu Matsumoto, a 42-year-old man, in connection with the killing. ''I thought I would kill him,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. Matsumoto as telling the police.   The two men had not met in person, it appears, but Mr. Matsumoto had harassed Mr. Okamoto in online messages and ''held a grudge'' against Mr. Okamoto, according to the newspaper.   Mr. Okamoto's blog embedded online comments from other websites and added short commentary on a variety of subjects. He had made more than 26,000 posts that reached 1,060 followers.   Recently, he wrote on his blog about being harassed by an internet troll he called ''Mr. Low I.Q.''   The troll, Mr. Okamoto wrote in a May 2 blog post, slandered him in online posts, and once harassed him seven times in a single day.   Mr. Okamoto did not name the troll, but provided a list of close to 270 user names that he said the troll had used and whose accounts Hatena, a popular blogging service in Japan, had suspended at his request.   ''As soon as I receive a call from Mr. Low I.Q., I report it to Hatena,'' Mr. Okamoto wrote. ''Initially, I used to write scrupulously: 'This person heaps abuse on other users, including myself,' as the reason, but these days I simply write: 'This is by Mr. Low I.Q.' and send it, and the account associated with it gets frozen.''   Mr. Okamoto continued, ''It's not a problem for people who are used to abusive language, like me, but a great many people would feel frightened when they receive invectives out of the blue.''   The police were not immediately able to confirm that the troll in question was Mr. Matsumoto, but several online commentators said they believed he was the troll who had been bothering Mr. Okamoto.   The killing highlighted the chilling possibility of digital threats spilling over into real life, in an era when internet users are increasingly concerned about the proliferation of misinformation, hate speech and even incitement to violence.   ''The digital world is anonymous, and therefore it is easy for threats to get escalated there,'' Yoh Mikami, a journalist who covers information technology, told Nishinihon Shimbun, a local newspaper. ''Hatred toward people you wouldn't meet in the real world heightens.''   The problem of internet trolling online has been growing in Japan, as elsewhere. The country's National Police Agency said in March that the number of reports of online libel and slander had increased to 11,136 in 2016 from 9,425 in 2013.   Japan has a relatively low homicide rate. A report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime from 2013 said the rate was one of the world's lowest, noting the country's low levels of gun ownership, effective policing, low inequality and high level of development.   That said, homicides have recently been in the news. Earlier this month, a man attacked passengers with a knife on a Shinkansen high-speed train, killing one person, and a 21-year-old man fatally stabbed a police officer and shot a school security guard with a gun he had stolen from the officer.   Mr. Okamoto worked at Sprout, a company in Tokyo that provides cybersecurity consulting to companies and government agencies and conducts research on the dark web.   ''Losing Mr. Okamoto has been a matter of deep regret for the company,'' Seigen Takano, the chief executive of Sprout, wrote on its website. ''It can't help but be said that we've lost a person who was valuable for the future of the cybersecurity industry.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"To Curb Illegal Airbnbs, City Wants Data on Hosts","Follow Luis Ferré-Sadurní on Twitter: @luisferre In an unusually crowded City Council hearing on Tuesday, lawmakers took on Airbnb as they discussed a bill aimed at cracking down on illegal online home-sharing listings that have turned residential apartments into year-round hotels for tourists. The bill, which is almost certainly to pass with a veto-proof majority, would cap one of the most fractious battles in New York City to regulate companies of the so-called sharing economy. Council members are expected to vote on it later this summer.     If passed, the bill would require online rental services, like Airbnb, to disclose the addresses of its listings and the identities of its hosts to the city's Office of Special Enforcement on a monthly basis. Hosts would also have to list whether the dwelling was their primary residence and whether the entire unit or a portion was available for short-term rentals. Companies that fail to share the data would be fined up to $25,000 for each listing they did not disclose.   Lawmakers hope the data would help identify commercial operators with multiple listings who run illegal hotels in residential buildings. Commercial operators have long been a concern for lawmakers and housing advocates who say that Airbnb makes it easy to rent apartments to tourists, taking units off the market for full-time residents and exacerbating the city's affordable housing crisis.   ''This bill has one clear priority in mind: protecting our affordable housing stock for the millions of New Yorkers who could not live here without it,'' said Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who introduced the bill. Disclosing listing data would allow ''more prosecution of bad actors who are pushing out tenants'' in a ''largely unmonitored rental market,'' Ms. Rivera, a Democrat, said.   Airbnb has more than 50,000 apartment rental listings in New York City, the company's largest market in the United States. But even as cities, such as San Francisco and Barcelona, have passed similar legislation, New York City has struggled to regulate Airbnb, which some critics say is rampant with listings of illegal hotels that flood apartment buildings with tourists and threaten the safety of residents.   Airbnb did not send officials to testify at the hearing because, ''Council members should hear why this bill hurts regular New Yorkers directly from those hosts,'' Liz DeBold Fusco, a spokeswoman for the company, said.   In written testimony submitted to the Council, Josh Meltzer, the head of northeast public policy for Airbnb, said the bill places ''the interests of the hotel industry above the interests of New Yorkers who rely on opening their own home to stay in their home.''   Mr. Meltzer said that in the past year, the typical Airbnb host in New York City shared their dwelling for about five nights a month and earned about $6,400 a year, ''reinforcing the fact that most hosts are not full-time 'commercial' operators, but everyday New Yorkers who turn to sharing their home part-time to make ends meet.''   However, the city estimates that 20 to 30 percent of online listings ''are operating with commercial frequency,'' Christian Klossner, the executive director of the Office of Special Enforcement, said during the hearing. Mr. Klossner said the legislation would ''significantly enhance our ability'' to target illegal hosts.   Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the mayor supports the bill.   The Airbnb legislation would mark one of the most significant steps that city officials have taken to curb the sharing economy since Mr. de Blasio endorsed, but then backed away from a plan to place a cap on the number of ride-sharing vehicles in 2015.   Mr. Meltzer said the bill unfairly targets Airbnb because it is limited to online platforms and would undermine the privacy of its hosts by having them consent to the disclosure of their personal information.   He also said that it would lead the city law enforcement agency to ''harass and fine New Yorkers who share their own home.''   In 2017, the Office of Special Enforcement received 1,800 complaints through 311 about short-term rentals and issued about 3,050 violations, amounting to nearly $7.2 million in fines.   The legislation could be a serious blow to Airbnb if a significant amount of its listings are found to be unlawful. Under state law, it is illegal in most buildings to rent an apartment for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is present when a guest is renting. But research has found that many tenants and landlords skirt the law and rent entire apartments for short amounts of time without being there.   In San Francisco, for example, Airbnb listings dropped 50 percent after legislation was passed requiring that hosts register with the city.   In New York, the proposed bill has pitted Airbnb against affordable housing advocates, hotel corporations and hotel workers unions, who have opposed the company's growing presence and shown a string of attack ads in the weeks leading up to the hearing. Airbnb retaliated last week by publishing a list of Council members who have received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the hotel industry and accused them of bias.    "
Putin Faults Democrats for Result of Hacking,"When the Fox News host Chris Wallace asked President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia whether Russian hackers had tried to influence the 2016 American election, he gave an unusual answer: The hacks had exposed some Democrats who put their thumbs on the scale to help Hillary Clinton, and that was what mattered. Mr. Putin made the comments in a Fox News exclusive interview on Monday evening after his two-hour, one-on-one summit meeting with President Trump and their joint news conference.     Mr. Wallace tried to press Mr. Putin on a topic that Mr. Trump all but dismissed during the news conference -- the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers who the special counsel investigating interference in the 2016 election said were acting in their ''official capacities'' when they hacked the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton presidential campaign.   Mr. Putin refused to acknowledge a paper copy of the indictment that Mr. Wallace tried to hand him.   ''Do you really believe that someone acting from the Russian territory could have influenced the United States and influenced the choice of millions of Americans?'' Mr. Putin said.   He went on: ''The idea was about hacking an email account of a Democratic candidate. Was it some rigging of facts? Was it some forgery of facts? That's the important thing that I am trying to -- point that I'm trying to make. Was this -- any false information planted? No. It wasn't.''   The hackers, he said, entered ''a certain email account and there was information about manipulations conducted within the Democratic Party to incline the process in favor of one candidate.''   In July 2016, shortly before the Democratic National Convention began, the website WikiLeaks began posting a trove of emails hacked from Democratic National Committee officials. The emails indicated that top party officials were working to support Mrs. Clinton over the insurgent candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.   Those hacks sowed discord between the Clinton and Sanders camps that has never fully healed, and prompted the committee's chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, to resign. In the indictment by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, prosecutors indicated that the timing of the leaked emails was intended to create as much chaos for the Democrats as possible.   Mr. Putin, who did not address who he thought was responsible for the hacks, focused on what was revealed.   ''As far as I know, the entire party leadership resigned,'' Mr. Putin said. ''They admitted the fact of their manipulations. So, that's one thing -- that manipulation is where public opinion should stop, and an apology should be made to the public at large.'' During the news conference, Mr. Putin answered bluntly when asked whether he had wanted Mr. Trump to win the election. ''Yes, I did,'' he said.   In his conversation with Mr. Wallace, Mr. Putin took pains to diminish Mr. Trump's stature as a businessman to insist that he would not have been a target for manipulation by Russia.   The ''St. Petersburg Economic Forum was visited by 500 businessmen,'' Mr. Putin said of a meeting held in Russia. ''Pretty much every one of them is a major industrial tycoon of greater scale than President Trump. Do you think that our Special Services actually organized surveillance on each and every of them?''    "
"From Start, Trump Has Muddied Clear Message: Putin Interfered","Follow David Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter: @SangerNYT and @AllMattNYT. WASHINGTON -- Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election. The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.    Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.   The shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.    On Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin's denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.   On Wednesday, when a reporter asked, ''Is Russia still targeting the U.S.?'' Mr. Trump shot back, ''No'' -- directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)   Hours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, ''because he's in charge of the country.''   In the run-up to this week's ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.   The Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.   The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the ''Steele dossier.'' That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump's activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.   According to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin's role in the election interference.   They included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U. had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.   And ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin's own role.   That included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.   Instead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.   Mr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.   The same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called ''hand-to-hand combat'' to dig in.   The pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.   After the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said ''Russia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries'' were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations -- including the D.N.C.   Still, Mr. Trump said in his statement, ''there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.''   Mr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.   ''I was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,'' he said in testimony in May 2017. ''And they were very aggressive.''   For Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.   Mr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton's loss in the election.   Mr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia's election interference.   Only Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)   And the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.   In March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was  targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.   Just last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were ''blinking red'' and called Russia the ''most aggressive foreign actor, no question.''   ''And they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,'' he said.   Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.   ''The intelligence community's assessment has not changed,'' Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. ''My view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.''   The Russian efforts are ''aimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,'' he continued. ''We haven't yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.''   ''It's a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.''   Almost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia's election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.   He dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a ''witch hunt'' against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton's home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia's role -- and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump's immediate orbit may have worked with them.   In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow's cyberskills were so good that the government's hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.   Since then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure -- as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday -- he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.   That is what happened again this week, twice.   Mr. Trump's statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.   That contributed to Mr. Trump's decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered -- although he also veered off script to declare: ''Could be other people also. A lot of people out there.''    "
Job Seekers Fall Prey to Nigerian Scam With Bona Fide Royal Twist,"There are countless stories of people getting scammed online by someone claiming to be Nigerian royalty. There are decidedly fewer stories of people getting scammed in person by an actual member of Nigerian royalty. But prosecutors say that is exactly what happened to at least 250 victims of a scheme carried out by Osmond Eweka, a member of the royal family of Benin, and his associate Kamel McKay, who is from the Bronx.    The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., announced on Thursday that Mr. Eweka and Mr. McKay had been indicted on charges that they stole more than $54,000 from people searching for employment.    Mr. Eweka, 31, a United States citizen who lives in Montclair, N.J., pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges of larceny and scheme to defraud before Justice Daniel P. Conviser in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who released him without bail. Mr. McKay, 27, was arraigned on the same indictment last week and freed on $200,000 bail.   One of Mr. Eweka's lawyers, Thomas A. Kenniff, said his client did nothing illegal. ''The reality is that Mr. Eweka provided honest services to many satisfied clients,'' he said.   Prosecutors say Mr. Eweka rented an office in the Empire State Building for a bogus job-placement company, Stamford Consulting Firm, L.L.C., and located job seekers through the website Indeed.com. He then had an unidentified woman lure them into his office with the promise of a job interview, prosecutors said. The applicants were instructed to bring money to pay a fee for licensing and training should they be hired.   When the victims met Mr. Eweka in person, he introduced himself as Sean Jackson and claimed to have connections with employers across New York City, prosecutors said. After being told they were hired, the applicants paid fees ranging from $289 to $600.   Mr. Eweka told the job seekers that paying higher fees would land them positions with higher wages, prosecutors said. The victims were instructed to return to Mr. Eweka's office at a later date. He then sent them to the Fire Department headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn to obtain a fire guard license, telling them it was necessary for their new positions. When they passed the test, Mr. Eweka advised the victims to wait for a call from a job-placement coordinator.   For some, the call never came. For others, the caller, who used a blocked number, instructed them to go to fake addresses, prosecutors said. Others reported showing up to real businesses that were not expecting them and had no connection to Stamford Consulting Firm.   From May 18 to June 12, Mr. Eweka and Mr. McKay also worked together to orchestrate a similar scheme out of an office at 521 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, using a company named Howard Consulting Group, L.L.C., prosecutors said.   Uku Akpolopolo Ewuare II, the oba of the Benin Kingdom in Nigeria, leads the royal family of Benin today, which dates to the 11th century. The Benin Kingdom is centered in Benin City, which has a population of about 1.5 million.   Mr. Eweka's precise position in the royal family of Benin remains unclear. Prosecutors said in court that he was a member of the family and had strong ties to Nigeria. There are websites identifying him as a prince, featuring photos and videos of his royal wedding in 2016.   Two representatives of the family who answered the telephone at offices in Texas and New Jersey said they did not know Mr. Eweka. ''There is no way to verify who he is, because it is a very large family,'' said one representative at the New Jersey office, who declined to give his name.    "
"In Shift, Google Is Said to Build China a Filtered Search Engine","Follow Li Yuan and Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @liyuan6 and @daiwaka. HONG KONG -- Google withdrew from China eight years ago to protest the country's censorship and online hacking. Now, the internet giant is working on a censored search engine for China that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Google has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added.     Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google's return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available.   Google's reversal in China, which was reported earlier by The Intercept, is the latest example of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge Chinese market, even if it means tamping down free speech. LinkedIn censors content in China, for example. And Facebook  developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network, with the aim of potentially deploying it in China, though there was no indication it was offered to Chinese authorities.   Many of these overtures appear to fall short of winning over Beijing. Last month, Facebook briefly gained approval to open a subsidiary in China's Zhejiang Province, but that approval was abruptly withdrawn after a matter of hours.   Google's work on a censored search engine for China has already caused an outcry among human rights activists. Many are concerned that the company would block a long list of foreign websites including Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times, as well as Chinese search queries including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and information about the Chinese leadership.   Amnesty International said it would be a ''dark day for internet freedom'' and would constitute ''a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom'' if the tech giant accepted China's censorship terms.   The work is also unpopular among many of Google's own employees, who have pushed back in recent months on issues such as gender in the workplace and how artificial intelligence should be applied to weaponry. On Wednesday, several expressed their disappointment about the China project on internal messaging platforms, according to four employees who saw the messages and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.   One internal posting that was viewed by The New York Times said that some employees who were asked to work on the project had declined to do so, opting to transfer to different work or to quit the company. Some employees said the work was a violation of Google's previous statements about its stance on Chinese censorship, as well as its recently established principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which state that technologies should not be used to contravene human rights.   ''We provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,'' said Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman. ''But we don't comment on speculation about future plans.''   Although Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, the company has lately displayed more interest in regaining access to the world's largest internet population. In June, Google announced a $550 million investment in the Chinese online retailer JD.com. Last year, Google unveiled plans to open a research center in China focused on artificial intelligence. And the company has released translation and file management apps for the Chinese market. Google now has more than 700 employees in China.   In the years since Google's exit, local competitors have risen up, including China's dominant search engine, Baidu. Beyond search, the vast majority of Google's services, including its app store, email service and YouTube, remain inaccessible behind the Great Firewall, as the country's system of internet controls is known.   Talks between Google and the Chinese government over the censored search engine began before the start of the recent trade war between the United States and China, one of the people said. The talks were not going well, this person added.   But the Chinese government could nonetheless use Google as a chip in its negotiations with the American government, which has been critical of the way China limits market access for United States technology companies. By letting Google's search engine back into China, the Chinese government could give President Trump a political victory, earning some good will.   For Google, China is an increasingly difficult market to navigate. The Chinese government has tightened internet censorship significantly since President Xi Jinping came into power five years ago. Companies need a great deal of resources to meet the censorship demands imposed by the government, and failing to do so can be serious. In the first half of 2018, China's national internet regulator shut down or revoked the license of more than 3,000 websites.   Google is a household brand in much of the world, but its name may draw blank stares from China's younger generation who are growing up in the post-Google Chinese internet. Winning these people will be an uphill battle for Google, especially if it cannot differentiate itself much from Baidu.   On Chinese social media on Wednesday, some people cheered the news of Google's possible China re-entry, saying that they welcomed competition with Baidu, which has faced scandals over its search results related to medical treatment.   Others questioned whether a heavily censored Google might be useful.   ''We welcome a normal Google but not a neutered Google,'' said Liu Xingliang, head of research at the Beijing-based analytics firm Data Center of the China Internet. ''We don't need a second Baidu.''    "
A Political Scrapper Fights for His Legal Future,"As a flamboyant veteran of Washington and New York City politics, the campaign strategist Roger J. Stone Jr. has been in any number of knock-'em-down scrapes over the years, reaching back four decades to his early days as a self-described ''dirty trickster'' in the Nixon administration. But now Mr. Stone, a veteran adviser to President Trump who has long cut a piratical figure on the political scene, appears to be engaged in his stiffest fight yet: the one for his own legal future.     On Friday, a stream of developments in the special counsel investigation underscored his peril. An old friend -- a former procuress from New York whom Mr. Stone has employed as an administrative worker -- testified about him to the federal grand jury hearing evidence in the inquiry. Another old friend, a New York City radio host, has been subpoenaed to appear before the same grand jury. And one of his close aides was held in contempt of court for ignoring his own subpoena, though the order was stayed.   For months now, Mr. Stone, 65, has been a key focus of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into whether any Trump associates worked with Russian operatives who were secretly trying to tip the election in Mr. Trump's favor. Mr. Stone is central to that question because he appeared to have advance knowledge of some of the moves that Russian hackers were making.   Mr. Stone dismissed the latest series of events on Friday afternoon, insisting that none of the three people knew anything about possible collusion with the Russians.   ''None my associates have any such knowledge, and the ongoing attempt to interrogate them appears to be an effort to fabricate some other 'crime' to pressure me into testifying against the president,'' he said. ''It really has the smell of a witch hunt.''   Mr. Stone once said in a speech that he had ''communicated with'' Julian Assange, the founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, and predicted that a trove of information about Hillary Clinton would be published before the 2016 election. And on Twitter, he seemed to correctly predict the release of emails -- stolen by Russian hackers -- sent and received by John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman.   ''Trust me,'' Mr. Stone wrote, ''it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel.''   Mr. Stone has also acknowledged that before the 2016 election, he traded private messages with Guccifer 2.0, the mysterious online figure that was instrumental in helping WikiLeaks release the emails and other political documents that eventually proved damaging to Mrs. Clinton's presidential bid.   In an indictment unsealed last month, Mr. Mueller charged that Guccifer 2.0 was in fact a front for Russian intelligence officers. The indictment also said that a person ''in regular contact with senior members'' of Mr. Trump's campaign had communicated with Guccifer 2.0. Government officials have identified that person as Mr. Stone.   At least two campaign officials -- Mr. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and a foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos -- were aware of the Russian government's interest in assisting the Trump campaign and were eager to receive the help. Mr. Trump said nothing ever came of those efforts. Mr. Stone's predictions have raised questions about whether the campaign did have secret ties to the Russian hacking effort.   A longtime Republican turned libertarian in recent years, Mr. Stone got his start on the national stage in 1979 on Ronald Reagan's campaign. Mr. Stone was for a time a partner in a Washington lobbying firm with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman who is on trial on charges of financial fraud.   Each of the three people linked to Mr. Stone who either appeared before, or have been called to testify in front of, the grand jury have circuitous connections to the Russia investigation.   The former procuress, Kristin M. Davis, who is best known by her tabloid nickname, the ''Manhattan Madam,'' used Mr. Stone as a political consultant in 2010 when she started a protest run for New York governor, touting a platform that included the legalization of pot and prostitution. Mr. Stone, who is the godfather of Ms. Davis's young son, has also employed her on and off in his office for years.   Neither Ms. Davis nor her lawyer, Daniel Hochheiser, returned phone calls on Friday seeking comment on her grand jury appearance. But in an email, Mr. Stone said that ''she has no knowledge of Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration or any other illegal activity on my part.''   The radio host, Randy Credico, a left-wing gadfly who has had his own failed bids for office, met Mr. Stone in the early 2000s when they worked together on a campaign to liberalize New York's drug laws. Last year, Mr. Credico was identified as the intermediary between Mr. Stone and Mr. Assange of WikiLeaks.   On Friday, Mr. Credico's lawyer, Martin Stolar, said his client was scheduled to appear before the Russia grand jury on Sept. 7. Mr. Stolar added that he suspected that investigators from Mr. Mueller's team wanted to ask Mr. Credico about Mr. Stone's dealings with Russian hackers and WikiLeaks, though he cautioned that he was simply speculating.   In response, Mr. Stone said that Mr. Credico had never told him ''what the source, content or scope of the WikiLeaks disclosures would be.'' He also said that he ''would urge Mr. Credico to simply tell the truth,'' if he is compelled to testify.   Mr. Stone's aide, Andrew Miller, received his own subpoena to appear before the Russia grand jury this year, and his lawyers have been trying to quash it ever since. According to news reports, that effort failed Friday when Mr. Miller failed show up for the grand jury and Judge Beryl Howell of Federal District Court in Washington held him in contempt.   Mr. Miller, a registered libertarian, briefly worked for Mr. Stone around the time of the 2016 Republican National Convention, helping to arrange media interviews and conducting other tasks. In keeping with Mr. Stone's intersecting social circles, Mr. Miller was also an aide on Ms. Davis's campaign for New York governor.   ''Andrew Miller has no knowledge or evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or any other illegal activity on my part,'' Mr. Stone said, echoing what he had said about Ms. Davis. ''If and when he is ever compelled to testify, I am highly confident that he would tell the truth.''

Head of Russia's Military Intelligence Agency Dies,"The head of Russia's military intelligence agency, who oversaw the hacking of the Democratic Party's computers during the United States' 2016 presidential election, died on Wednesday after a long illness, Russian state news agencies reported.  Col. Gen. Igor V. Korobov, 63, had not been seen in public for months and was notably absent from a ceremony on Nov. 2 marking the 100th anniversary of the military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. Historically a secretive, little-understood agency, the G.R.U. under General Korobov emerged as Russia's primary tool of global disruption.    Mr. Korobov was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for the release of emails stolen from the Democratic Party in support of Donald Trump's campaign in 2016.   Under his watch, the G.R.U. was also implicated in the theft and publication of documents belonging to the presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron in France, hacking computers of the global antidoping watchdog and the poisoning of a former G.R.U. officer, Sergei V. Skripal, with a highly potent nerve agent in Britain earlier this year.   G.R.U. operatives also play a key role in the wars in Ukraine and Syria.   Such operations have demonstrated Russia's ability to project its limited power well beyond its borders and remain a relevant international player that the West is still struggling to reckon with.   General Korobov was appointed head of the G.R.U. by President Vladimir V. Putin in January 2016 after his predecessor, Igor D. Sergun, died suddenly. But the general's absence in recent months has fueled rumors about an impending leadership shake-up at the agency.   Russian news agencies cited a Defense Ministry statement which described the general as a ''true son of Russia, a patriot of the Fatherland.'' And at the G.R.U.'s anniversary ceremony this month, Mr. Putin praised the agency for its ''unique capabilities.''   Though General Korobov is one of Russia's top military officials, very little is publicly known about him. According to his sparse biography on the Defense Ministry's website, he joined the armed forces in 1973 and joined the G.R.U. in 1985.   Despite Mr. Putin's recent laudatory remarks, the G.R.U. has had its share of missteps lately. Just weeks after British authorities released photographs and aliases of two G.R.U. officers suspected of poisoning Mr. Skripal in England in March, researchers with the investigative group Bellingcat were able to uncover the officers' true identities and travel itineraries primarily using publicly available information.   In October, officials in the Netherlands revealed details about a botched attempt by four agency operatives to hack into the computers of the world's chemical weapons watchdog in The Hague. The operatives were carrying computers with details from previous missions along with an airport taxi receipt showing that they had been picked up outside a G.R.U. headquarters building in Moscow.   Still, the agency's activities have put Russia's adversaries on edge and have provoked fierce reaction from the West. Russia has been hit with wave after wave of sanctions as a result of its election interference. After Mr. Skripal was poisoned, Britain and many allies expelled more than 150 Russia diplomats, many believed to be undercover intelligence operatives.    "
Leader of Russia's Spies Dies After Illness,"MOSCOW -- The head of Russia's military intelligence agency, who oversaw the hacking of the Democratic Party's computers during the United States' 2016 presidential election, died on Wednesday after a long illness, Russian state news agencies reported. Col. Gen. Igor V. Korobov, 63, had not been seen in public for months and was notably absent from a ceremony on Nov. 2 marking the 100th anniversary of the military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U.     Historically a secretive, little-understood agency, the G.R.U. under General Korobov emerged as Russia's primary tool of global disruption.

Such operations have demonstrated Russia's ability to project its limited power well beyond its borders and to remain a relevant international player that the West is still struggling to reckon with.   The officer expected to succeed General Korobov is Vice Adm. Igor O. Kostyukov, who had been serving as acting director because of Mr. Korobov's illness, according to Russian news reports.   The admiral sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin during the public ceremony commemorating the organization's 100th anniversary.   Admiral Kostyukov, 59, who was sanctioned by the United States, twice, was also linked by the American government to cyberattacks. Educated as a naval officer, he served abroad as a military attaché before joining the G.R.U., the news reports said.   Like his late boss, he helped plan and direct Russian operations in Syria, although no details about his role are public. He received a ''Hero of Russia'' award in 2017 for his military service.   Although the Twitter feeds of numerous Russia watchers in the West filled with black humor about the short life expectancy of any G.R.U. leader, especially after a string of bungled overseas operations, General Korobov's death was not considered all that untimely in Russia.   He had cancer, according to various independent publications, plus the average life expectancy for Russian men, although it has risen by about a decade to 66 in recent years, is still far lower than that of men in most Western countries.   The speculation was fed partly by the fact that the death of the general's predecessor, Col. Gen. Igor D. Sergun, occurred nearly three years ago under cloudy circumstances at a similar age. Despite some reports that he had dropped dead in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, during a stopover on a trip to Syria, the government insisted that General Sergun, 58, had died in Russia.   General Korobov was appointed head of the G.R.U. by Mr. Putin in January 2016. The general's absence in recent months had fueled rumors about an impending leadership shake-up at the agency.

"In a Flash, the Night Sky Turns an Electric Blue","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] So if it wasn't aliens, terrorists or Russian hackers, what was it?    On Thursday night, an electrical equipment mishap in Astoria, Queens, turned New York City's sky into an eerie blue, causing mass bewilderment, rampant speculation and a not insignificant amount of panic.   By Friday morning, it was as if nothing had happened.    The power was back on for those who had lost it. Flights were operating as expected at La Guardia Airport, which was forced to ground all flights after its lights went out. And the No. 7 subway line, which was delayed after the incident, was operating with ''good service.''   The sky was back to its appropriate hue.   Still, even if the aqua glow didn't linger for long, the questions did. Among them: Did the accident leave any pollution or contamination? (Authorities said no.)   At the same time, countless people who saw the so-called Astoria Borealis -- IRL or on social media -- were left asking:   Just why was the sky so blue?   First, we should ask why it happened   The bizarre illumination was sparked by an ''electric arc flash'' tied to faulty equipment at a Con Edison substation, a spokesman for the utility, Bob McGee, said early Friday.   The equipment, located about 20 feet above the ground, contained cables that transmit 138,000 volts of electricity -- a staggering amount compared with the 120 volts supplied to American households.   An arc produced by equipment of that magnitude often looks similar to a thunder and lightning event, Mr. McGee said.   A voltage detector at the substation failed, which led to the electrical fault that caused the arc, Con Ed's chairman, John McAvoy, said at a news conference Friday.   The fault went on for longer than would normally be expected, he added, because a protective device did not work as quickly as it normally would.   While initial reports Thursday traced the glow to a transformer explosion or a fire, Mr. McGee said there was no fire, and there were no transformers involved. There were also no injuries in connection with the fault, though Con Ed said one employee reported eye irritation from the flash.   Con Ed was still investigating the precise source of the equipment failures on Friday.   Con Edison employees who work at the substation thought the incident was a ''one-off event'' that was not caused by any larger issue, said John Melia, a spokesman for Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, which represents Con Ed workers.   The Police Department said in an email that it did not believe there was ''any criminality involved'' in the explosion.   So why was the sky that color?   O. K., let's get our Bill Nye on.   When an electrical current moves through air in an electrical arc, it alters the molecules in the air, charging them with energy, splitting them into atoms and ionizing them. Electrons, excited by the extra energy, get separated from their atoms. The result is a plasma, or charged gas.   When the electrons and ions in a plasma recombine, the atoms glow and emit visible light. The same process is behind fluorescent light bulbs, neon signs and lightning. In all those cases, the color of the light is characteristic of the elements and atoms involved.   On Thursday, when the electrical arc ripped apart oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the air, the light was a surreal blue. (Da ba dee, da ba da.)   The flash continued for as long as there was power to supply it. Once the faulty equipment stopped emitting an electrical current, New York's brief close encounter ended.   What about the sound?   Some people who saw the electrical arc flash and its aftermath reported hearing a loud hum. Others described hearing loud bangs.   Lucy Paul, who works at a diner near the Con Ed facility but lives about a mile away from it, said she heard a loud boom that made her think a plane had crashed at La Guardia.   Her co-worker Serafina Santos, who lives one avenue away from the substation, described the sound as an electrical noise. ''You heard the surge,'' she said Friday.   That noise was created when the arc struck the ground, Mr. McGee said. Again, like thunder and lightning, he said.   Joe Sanchez, 48, who lives seven blocks away from the substation, estimated that the light-and-sound episode lasted about three minutes.   ''You could smell the electricity in the air,'' Mr. Sanchez said on Friday. ''The whole area felt charged.''   And we're sure it wasn't aliens?   Well, the truth is out there. But we're pretty sure.   So are Con Edison, the Police Department and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who whipped out an alien mask in the middle of Friday's news conference and joked (we assume) that Con Ed investigators found it at the substation.   Will there be any long-term effects?   Until Con Ed finishes investigating, it won't know the full extent of the damage to the substation, or the cost or time required to repair it. But Mr. McAvoy said the utility did not expect any major issues, and electricity outages caused by the incident were resolved by Friday morning.   Mr. Melia said the utility workers' union did not believe there was any reason to be concerned about the safety of the facility.   In connection with the incident, about three gallons of dielectric fluid, which cools electrical equipment, were released, a Con Ed spokesman said Friday. But the fluid, which is not hazardous, was contained within the substation, and the spokesman said the company did not expect there to be a major environmental impact from it.   There was also no indication that asbestos or other harmful particles were released at any point, Mr. McAvoy said.   So where did 'Astoria Borealis' come from?   Well, Twitter, of course.   More than a few variations on the same jokes circulated on social media Thursday night, and references to the northern lights were among them.   So, too, were ''Ghostbusters'' references, ''Transformers'' jokes and mentions of superpowers.   Azi Paybarah and Sean Piccoli contributed reporting.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
How Fake Mark Zuckerbergs Scam Facebook Users Out of Their Cash,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A Facebook notification on Gary Bernhardt's phone woke him up one night last November with incredible news: a message from Mark Zuckerberg himself, saying that he had won $750,000 in the Facebook lottery. ""I got all excited. Wouldn't you?"" said Mr. Bernhardt, 67, a retired forklift driver and Army veteran in Ham Lake, Minn. He stayed up until dawn trading messages with the person on the other end. To obtain his winnings, he was told, he first needed to send $200 in iTunes gift cards. Hours later, Mr. Bernhardt bought the gift cards at a gas station and sent the redemption codes to the account that said it was Mr. Zuckerberg. But the requests for money didn't stop. By January, Mr. Bernhardt had wired an additional $1,310 in cash, or about a third of his Social Security checks over three months. Mr. Bernhardt eventually realized that he had been the unwitting victim of a scam that has thrived on Facebook and Instagram by using the sites' own brands -- and its top executives -- to lure people in. At a time when the real Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to clean up Facebook, the Silicon Valley company has failed to eliminate impostor accounts masquerading as him and his chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to swindle Facebook users out of thousands of dollars.  An examination by The New York Times found 205 accounts impersonating Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg on Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram, not including fan pages or satire accounts, which are permitted under the company's rules. At least 51 of the impostor accounts, including 43 on Instagram, were lottery scams like the one that fooled Mr. Bernhardt. The fake Zuckerbergs and faux Sandbergs have proliferated on Facebook and Instagram, despite the presence of Facebook groups that track the scams and complaints about the trick dating to at least 2010. A day after The Times informed Facebook of its findings, the company removed all 96 impostor Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg accounts on its Facebook site. It had left up all but one of the 109 fakes on Instagram, but removed them after this article was published. ""Thank you so much for reporting this,"" said Pete Voss, a Facebook spokesman. He could not say why Facebook had not spotted the accounts posing as its top executives, including several that appeared to have existed for more than eight years. ""It's not easy,"" he said. ""We want to get better."" Facebook requires people to use their authentic name and identity. Yet the company has estimated that perhaps 3 percent of its users -- as many as 60 million accounts -- are fake. Some of those accounts are disguised as ordinary people, some pretend to be celebrities such as Justin Bieber. In congressional testimony this month, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was improving its software to automatically detect and remove such accounts. Facebook officials have said the company blocks millions of fake accounts trying to register each day and analysts said the social network has improved its efforts to remove the accounts. ""Fake accounts, over all, are a big issue, because that's how a lot of the other issues that we see around fake news and foreign election interference are happening as well,"" Mr. Zuckerberg told lawmakers, adding that Facebook is hiring more people to work on reviewing content. But major holes remain. Interviews with a half-dozen recent victims -- and online conversations with nine impostor accounts -- showed that the Facebook lottery deception is alive and well, preying particularly on older, less educated and low-income people. The Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg impostor accounts typically use the executives' pictures as profile photos and list their Facebook titles. Some post manipulated images of people holding oversize checks. The names of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg are sometimes misspelled, or use parentheses and middle names (Elliot for Mr. Zuckerberg and Kara for Ms. Sandberg) to evade Facebook's software. Many of the impersonators had dozens to hundreds of followers; several had thousands. They are aided by a network of other sham accounts with generic names, such as Jim Towey and Mary Gilbert, which purported to be ""Facebook claim agents."" The scammers seek victims who, based on their Facebook and Instagram profiles, seem vulnerable, said Robin Alexander van der Kieft, who manages several Facebook groups that track the scams. The various fake accounts share information about successful shakedowns and continue pouncing on those victims, he said. He has traced many of the internet protocol addresses of these fake accounts to Nigeria and Ghana. The pitch often begins with an unsolicited ""Hello. How are you doing?"" on Facebook or Instagram. The fake accounts then proceed, sometimes in broken English, to inform people of their enormous Facebook lottery prize. After several messages between The Times and a fake Sheryl Sandberg account on Instagram last week, the impostor offered $950,000 and a new car via the ""Facebook splash promotion 2018."" When asked for proof the account was Ms. Sandberg, the scammer sent a Photoshopped identification. ""I want you to know that this Promo is 100% Real and Legitimate and the Government are aware of this Promo you don't have to be skeptical all you just have to do is to follow all instruction giving to you okay,"" the account added. Three days later, the account said it needed a $100 iTunes gift card to process and activate the winning A.T.M. card. (iTunes gift cards can quickly be redeemed and traded on the black market for cash.) After initially resisting, the sham Ms. Sandberg agreed to a phone call, adding ""I'm not the one that will be speaking to you O.K."" Seconds later, a call arrived from a number with a 650 area code -- Silicon Valley. ""You have to be careful, there are lots of scam artists,"" a man said in accented English after he was informed that he was speaking with The Times. He added, ""All I'm trying to do is get your winning package."" The Times reached out to more than 50 impostor accounts. Most messages went unreturned. None that replied broke character. The charade has ensnared people like Donna Keithley, 50, a stay-at-home mom with four children in Martinsburg, Pa. In March 2016, an account with the name Linda Ritchey messaged Ms. Keithley ""on behalf of the Facebook C.E.O Mark Zuckerberg"" to pass on word of her good fortune: $650,000 in lottery winnings. Ms. Keithley wired $350 -- a delivery fee -- the next day. That began a monthlong saga. According to a 28,000-word transcript of a Facebook Messenger conversation between Ms. Keithley and the account, the scammer repeatedly played on Ms. Keithley's Christian faith to get her to send more money. ""Are you good Christian with god fears?"" the Linda Ritchey account asked. ""Can you trust me and also have believe in me?"" Over the next month, Ms. Keithley received not only Facebook messages but a call from a Mr. Zuckerberg impostor who assured her the lottery was real. She even heard from a Facebook account masquerading as Eileen M. Decker, the former United States attorney in Los Angeles, asking for $205 to process her winnings. The Times found at least five Facebook accounts posing as Ms. Decker and advertising government grants, another known scam. Ms. Decker told The Times that she has tried to get Facebook to remove the accounts, but the site wanted a picture of her government-issued identification to do so. She refused. ""To me, they're not a trusted source,"" she said. She added that she had contacted the F.B.I. and hired a lawyer. Ms. Keithley's scammer ordered her to open new credit cards and bank accounts, and even to get a loan using her husband's 2001 Ford Taurus as collateral. Midway through the month, she said she had a minor stroke from the stress. By April 2016, she had used her family's tax refund and loans from relatives to pay the scammer $5,306.43 -- much of it in money transfers to the name Ben Amos in Lagos, Nigeria. ""It just devastated the whole household,"" said her husband, Tim Keithley, a security guard who was making $10 an hour at the time. The ordeal was so costly, Ms. Keithley said, the family's telephone service was shut off. They also had to go to a food bank. While Ms. Keithley still gets messages from accounts claiming to work for Facebook, she said she is now wiser. ""Lord as my witness, no one's getting any more money from me,"" she said. After they are duped, victims may struggle with what to do next. Mr. Bernhardt, the retired forklift driver, said he didn't know how to report the scammers to Facebook. Ms. Keithley said she had called a number for Facebook she had found online, though she was not sure the number was authentic. She also reported the scam to local police, who said they couldn't help, and the Pennsylvania attorney general. A spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general said the office did not have a record of Ms. Keithley's report, but that it planned to contact her. Others said they regularly report scammers to Facebook, but the company can be slow to act. Kathryn Schwartz, 55, from Lodi, N.J., said she has been in credit-card debt since she lost $1,742 trying to claim bogus Facebook lottery winnings in 2016. She said she has since been barraged by scammers and regularly reports them, including in messages to the real Mr. Zuckerberg. One Facebook account named Mary Williams recently messaged Ms. Schwartz, saying it would help her claim her winnings. A review of the account showed that in March it had renamed itself, purporting to be a Boise, Idaho, native who works at Facebook. Years of posts before that depicted a man in Nigeria. When Ms. Schwartz posted on Facebook last week that Mary Williams was a con artist, the account left a comment: ""You think you are smart but you are not. If you were smart why were you scammed."" The emojis tacked at the end of the message were crying with laughter. Mr. Bernhardt said that since he wired his last payment to the Mr. Zuckerberg masquerader in January, he has heard from two other Mark Zuckerbergs, one Sheryl Sandberg and other accounts promising him winnings in return for more cash. No conversations have gone as deep as with his original scammer. ""I thought we were getting real close,"" Mr. Bernhardt said. ""He started calling me Mr. Gary and I started calling him Mr. Mark."" He said he had told his scammer about growing up in a foster home and his dream of owning a house on a lake. ""They sucked me in because they knew my dreams,"" he said.

"To Curb Illegal Airbnbs, New York City Wants to Collect Data on Hosts","In an unusually crowded City Council hearing on Tuesday, lawmakers took on Airbnb as they discussed a bill aimed at cracking down on illegal online home-sharing listings that have turned residential apartments into year-round hotels for tourists. The bill, which is almost certainly to pass with a veto-proof majority, would cap one of the most fractious battles in New York City to regulate companies of the so-called sharing economy. Council members are expected to vote on it later this summer.  If passed, the bill would require online rental services, like Airbnb, to disclose the addresses of its listings and the identities of its hosts to the city's Office of Special Enforcement on a monthly basis. Hosts would also have to list whether the dwelling was their primary residence and whether the entire unit or a portion was available for short-term rentals. Companies that fail to share the data would be fined up to $25,000 for each listing they did not disclose. Lawmakers hope the data would help identify commercial operators with multiple listings who run illegal hotels in residential buildings. Commercial operators have long been a concern for lawmakers and housing advocates who say that Airbnb makes it easy to rent apartments to tourists, taking units off the market for full-time residents and exacerbating the city's affordable housing crisis. ""This bill has one clear priority in mind: protecting our affordable housing stock for the millions of New Yorkers who could not live here without it,"" said Councilwoman Carlina Rivera, who introduced the bill. Disclosing listing data would allow ""more prosecution of bad actors who are pushing out tenants"" in a ""largely unmonitored rental market,"" Ms. Rivera, a Democrat, said. Airbnb has more than 50,000 apartment rental listings in New York City, the company's largest market in the United States. But even as cities, such as San Francisco and Barcelona, have passed similar legislation, New York City has struggled to regulate Airbnb, which some critics say is rampant with listings of illegal hotels that flood apartment buildings with tourists and threaten the safety of residents. Airbnb did not send officials to testify at the hearing because, ""Council members should hear why this bill hurts regular New Yorkers directly from those hosts,"" Liz DeBold Fusco, a spokeswoman for the company, said. In written testimony submitted to the Council, Josh Meltzer, the head of northeast public policy for Airbnb, said the bill places ""the interests of the hotel industry above the interests of New Yorkers who rely on opening their own home to stay in their home."" Mr. Meltzer said that in the past year, the typical Airbnb host in New York City shared their dwelling for about five nights a month and earned about $6,400 a year, ""reinforcing the fact that most hosts are not full-time 'commercial' operators, but everyday New Yorkers who turn to sharing their home part-time to make ends meet."" However, the city estimates that 20 to 30 percent of online listings ""are operating with commercial frequency,"" Christian Klossner, the executive director of the Office of Special Enforcement, said during the hearing. Mr. Klossner said the legislation would ""significantly enhance our ability"" to target illegal hosts. Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said the mayor supports the bill. The Airbnb legislation would mark one of the most significant steps that city officials have taken to curb the sharing economy since Mr. de Blasio endorsed, but then backed away from a plan to place a cap on the number of ride-sharing vehicles in 2015. Mr. Meltzer said the bill unfairly targets Airbnb because it is limited to online platforms and would undermine the privacy of its hosts by having them consent to the disclosure of their personal information. He also said that it would lead the city law enforcement agency to ""harass and fine New Yorkers who share their own home."" In 2017, the Office of Special Enforcement received 1,800 complaints through 311 about short-term rentals and issued about 3,050 violations, amounting to nearly $7.2 million in fines. The legislation could be a serious blow to Airbnb if a significant amount of its listings are found to be unlawful. Under state law, it is illegal in most buildings to rent an apartment for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is present when a guest is renting. But research has found that many tenants and landlords skirt the law and rent entire apartments for short amounts of time without being there. In San Francisco, for example, Airbnb listings dropped 50 percent after legislation was passed requiring that hosts register with the city. In New York, the proposed bill has pitted Airbnb against affordable housing advocates, hotel corporations and hotel workers unions, who have opposed the company's growing presence and shown a string of attack ads in the weeks leading up to the hearing. Airbnb retaliated last week by publishing a list of Council members who have received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the hotel industry and accused them of bias.

Japanese Blogger Is Killed After Giving Lecture on Online Trolls,"Kenichiro Okamoto was an expert on internet crime and a prolific blogger. He studied the ""dark web,"" a part of the internet that relies on encryption and is often exploited, experts say, for illicit activities and hate-mongering. On Sunday evening, he held a two-hour seminar for about 30 people in the city of Fukuoka, about 550 miles west of Tokyo, advising other bloggers on engaging their audiences and dealing with internet trolls.  ""I have encountered many troubles as I have written my blog for many years,"" Mr. Okamoto wrote on a website introducing the seminar. ""Quarrels, pointing out typos, questions about the content, love letters, letters from attorneys, etc."" The talk ended around 7:45 p.m. About 15 minutes later, he entered a men's room in the building, a former elementary school that now houses a business incubator called Fukuoka Growth Next. There, Mr. Okamoto, 41, was stabbed several times in the neck and the chest, possibly by a man who had reportedly trolled and harassed him online. Mr. Okamoto was taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead. The suspect in the killing fled on a bicycle but turned himself in to the police a few hours later, the Japanese newspaperAsahi Shimbun reported, citing unnamed police officials. Before that, someone -- possibly the suspect himself -- had posted an anonymous message online saying that the suspect was ""now going to surrender himself to take responsibility."" The police have charged the suspect, Hidemitsu Matsumoto, a 42-year-old man, in connection with the killing. ""I thought I would kill him,"" the newspaper quoted Mr. Matsumoto as telling the police. The two men had not met in person, it appears, but Mr. Matsumoto had harassed Mr. Okamoto in online messages and ""held a grudge"" against Mr. Okamoto, according to the newspaper. Mr. Okamoto's blog embedded online comments from other websites and added short commentary on a variety of subjects. He had made more than 26,000 posts that reached 1,060 followers. Recently, he wrote on his blog about being harassed by an internet troll he called ""Mr. Low I.Q."" The troll, Mr. Okamoto wrote in a May 2 blog post, slandered him in online posts, and once harassed him seven times in a single day. Mr. Okamoto did not name the troll, but provided a list of close to 270 user names that he said the troll had used and whose accounts Hatena, a popular blogging service in Japan, had suspended at his request. ""As soon as I receive a call from Mr. Low I.Q., I report it to Hatena,"" Mr. Okamoto wrote. ""Initially, I used to write scrupulously: 'This person heaps abuse on other users, including myself,' as the reason, but these days I simply write: 'This is by Mr. Low I.Q.' and send it, and the account associated with it gets frozen."" Mr. Okamoto continued, ""It's not a problem for people who are used to abusive language, like me, but a great many people would feel frightened when they receive invectives out of the blue."" The police were not immediately able to confirm that the troll in question was Mr. Matsumoto, but several online commentators said they believed he was the troll who had been bothering Mr. Okamoto. The killing highlighted the chilling possibility of digital threats spilling over into real life, in an era when internet users are increasingly concerned about the proliferation of misinformation, hate speech and even incitement to violence. ""The digital world is anonymous, and therefore it is easy for threats to get escalated there,"" Yoh Mikami, a journalist who covers information technology, told Nishinihon Shimbun, a local newspaper. ""Hatred toward people you wouldn't meet in the real world heightens."" The problem of internet trolling online has been growing in Japan, as elsewhere. The country's National Police Agency said in March that the number of reports of online libel and slander had increased to 11,136 in 2016 from 9,425 in 2013. Japan has a relatively low homicide rate. A report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime from 2013 said the rate was one of the world's lowest, noting the country's low levels of gun ownership, effective policing, low inequality and high level of development. That said, homicides have recently been in the news. Earlier this month, a man attacked passengers with a knife on a Shinkansen high-speed train, killing one person, and a 21-year-old man fatally stabbed a police officer and shot a school security guard with a gun he had stolen from the officer. Mr. Okamoto worked at Sprout, a company in Tokyo that provides cybersecurity consulting to companies and government agencies and conducts research on the dark web. ""Losing Mr. Okamoto has been a matter of deep regret for the company,"" Seigen Takano, the chief executive of Sprout, wrote on its website. ""It can't help but be said that we've lost a person who was valuable for the future of the cybersecurity industry."" Follow Satoshi Sugiyama on Twitter: @SatoshiJournal  Related Articles  "
The World Cup's Hot New Accessory Comes With a Few Questions,"MOSCOW -- The must-have accessory at the 2018 World Cup is a passport-sized badge of honor that, for many fans, symbolizes the fulfillment of a lifetime's ambition. The badge, called a Fan ID, is an innovation introduced at the World Cup for the first time and is almost as valuable as a ticket. No fan can get into a World Cup stadium without one. It also grants access to perks like visa-free entry into Russia, free transport in and occasionally between host cities and discounts in certain shops and restaurants. Part identity card and conversation-starter, it hangs from a FIFA lanyard around the neck of nearly every fan at the World Cup -- a laminated credential to what could pass for the world's coolest business conference. Yet it has also raised concerns about privacy in a country that has been a base for international hackers and that has a long history of closely monitoring its citizens. The Russian authorities said the only purpose of the badges is to improve the security and comfort of fans. The badges, however, do give World Cup organizers and security officials the ability to track the location of fans during the tournament and provide the authorities those fans' personal information.  Many spectators simply like them as keepsakes. ""I'm going to keep this for the rest of my life,"" said the Brazilian fan Arnaldo Ylem, 50, proudly looking down at his Fan ID. It displayed a small photo of his face as well as his name in both English and Russian script. The Russian authorities created the Fan ID program as part of an extensive security operation for one of the biggest groups of foreign tourists the country has ever received. Each Fan ID is logged by Russia's Communications Ministry, under a set of agreements with FIFA, world soccer's governing body. Organizers have said that the Russian government had agreed that all information they obtain, which includes names, dates of birth, passport numbers, phone numbers, emails and home addresses, would be ""strictly confidential."" In total, more than 1.6 million Fan IDs have been distributed to tournament visitors, including V.I.P.s and celebrities. Even the disgraced former president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, who is attending the event as a guest of President Vladimir V. Putin, and the Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona were required to obtain and wear them. The Russian authorities are able to track every person's entry into every game. That might have allowed the authorities to locate Rodrigo Vicentini, a fan who had been wanted by the authorities in Brazil for two years on charges of robbing a post office. Vicentini, a 31-year-old Brazilian clad in his national team's jersey, had just watched his team score two late goals in tense victory over Costa Rica on June 22 when Russian security officers pounced. They had crosschecked the Interpol wanted list with Fan ID information and arrested him as he left the stadium. He is awaiting extradition to Brazil. The Russian authorities said that they have conducted background checks on all recipients of Fan IDs, working with counterparts around the world in what they said was an effort to prevent terrorists or known hooligans from entering the country or any of the World Cup's stadiums. ""The Fan ID is to provide full security, full comfort at the stadium for those who are there for football reasons, not any other reasons,"" said Alexey Sorokin, the chief executive of the local organizing committee. He said the Russian authorities were bound by what he called strict rules relating to the data that are embedded in the government's contracts with FIFA. Background checks and badges for fans coming to Russia are ""quite understandable,"" said Chris Eaton, who was responsible for FIFA's security plan at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. ""No one denies the threat Russia faces from domestic or international terrorist groups."" Still, privacy advocates have qualms about the harvesting of so much personal data. ""It's part of a surveillance economy where you are offered something that sounds enticing, like going to a sporting event without hassle and some freebies, in exchange for valuable personal information,"" said Timothy Edgar, a cybersecurity expert who teaches at Brown University. ""Russia should destroy the information as soon as the tournament is over,"" Edgar added. ""Once the need for the data has gone away, they should do that, because potentially it could be subject to leaking or loss."" While the Fan IDs are not unprecedented -- Russia used similar program, then called a Spectator Pass, at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 -- requiring them is a first at the World Cup, and they could be here to stay. Officials from Qatar, which will host the 2022 World Cup, have studied the program this month as part of their preparations, according to Colin Smith, FIFA's competitions director. The organizers of the 2026 World Cup in North America, which will require cross-border movement of fans between the United States, Mexico and Canada, confirmed that they are considering a similar program. But already the Fan ID has become essential equipment for fans. And the mere threat of the revocation of the privileges it confers -- chiefly, the ability to attend matches -- may be conditioning fan behavior. Mexico's soccer federation, under threat of fines or worse from FIFA over fans' use of a homophobic chant, issued a warning to ""avoid getting your Fan ID taken away from you"" in order to tamp down on the slur. After the warning, the chant stopped (Mexico was eliminated by Brazil on Monday). News media reports have said some fans from Latin American countries who tricked Russian women into joining vulgar chants have been identified through their Fan IDs. Sorokin said local law enforcement agencies have the final say in determining whether to revoke Fan IDs. But strolling along Teverskaya Street, one of the main thoroughfares leading to Red Square, any such concerns were the last thing on the mind of soccer fans like Pierre Louvat. A 71-year-old from Reunion, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, Louvat said he could not be happier with his Fan ID. Speaking over his son, who also couldn't contain his joy with his own World Cup credential, Louvat exclaimed, ""C'est magnifique."" ""You can do everything with this,"" he said in French. ""Plus, it's going to be a souvenir of the World Cup.""

Worried About the I.R.S. Scam? Here's How to Handle Phone Fraud,"Lee Meyer, a retired New York City schoolteacher, recently began getting strange telephone calls on weekday afternoons. A woman claiming to be a Treasury Department official left a message and a phone number, Mr. Meyer said, telling him he needed to settle a ""tax-fraud charge"" or else he would be hauled in front of a ""magistrate judge."" His reaction? ""I laughed,"" he said. ""I wasn't born yesterday.""  Mr. Meyer, 83, did not return the calls, having learned long ago what law enforcement and consumer protection officials say many Americans need to remember: The Internal Revenue Service does not call people and threaten legal action or harass them over debts. The Justice Department recently highlighted that message when it announced it had broken up a vast I.R.S. impersonation operation in which conspirators in the United States coordinated with call centers in India from 2012 to 2016, causing ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in losses to more than 15,000 victims. Twenty-four people have been convicted and sentenced in the case, and more indictments have been issued in India. The Justice Department said it hoped the case would serve as a deterrent. ""I.R.S. scams, as well as other telefraud scams, are conducted by multiple groups and individuals operating out of India, Nigeria, Costa Rica, Jamaica and other countries,"" said Nicole Navas Oxman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. ""While this prosecution is a major success in disrupting the largest group of conspirators operating out of multiple call centers identified to date, other perpetrators of the IRS scam and similar scams remain at large."" After The New York Times's article on Monday about the convictions, readers, including Mr. Meyer, responded with their own stories. Some asked where they could turn for restitution or to report suspicious calls. One reader said he had fallen victim in June after being instructed to transfer $8,000 in Best Buy cards -- a common type of fraud in which a person is told to obtain a prepaid card and provide the number to the caller. Another reader said that a friend of her father had recently lost $5,000 in such a scam. And a couple said they had received at least 10 calls in the last three months, which they ignored, claiming that their tax return had problems that needed to be addressed immediately. Some steps you can take to protect yourself As The Times has previously recommended, don't provide personal information and don't engage with the caller. But you can ask for a name to include it in a complaint. The website of the Treasury inspector general for tax administration has an online form to report I.R.S. impersonations. It includes sections for reporting how much you paid to the perpetrators of the fraud, and whether you provided personal information. A personal identification number is assigned to the case so you can confirm that any agent who follows up is legitimate. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, which investigates consumer fraud. If you've been scammed and you file a complaint, you might be entitled to restitution if a court orders defendants to pay up. You'll only have a limited amount of time to claim losses, because the court may amend restitution orders for up to 60 days after sentencing. In the case of the India call centers, that date would be in mid-September. The claim form for that case is online. If you used a wire transfer to pay a con artist, you should contact the wire transfer company. The MoneyGram Customer Care Center is 1[#x2011]800[#x2011]926[#x2011]9400. The Western Union Fraud Hotline is 1-800-448-1492. The I.R.S. generally contacts people by mail. If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from the agency, do not open attachments or click on links. Forward it to phishing@irs.gov. It is not always the I.R.S. that is being impersonated. Be aware, and learn to recognize a scam when you see or hear one. The indictment pertaining to the Justice Department's recent convictions described other ploys used by the conspirators. Some calls were purported to be from immigration officials who threatened deportation unless bogus fines were paid. Another technique was to pretend to be a payday lender and promise a loan if a fee was paid upfront, and then the loan would never materialize, the indictment said. Federal agencies have pages where consumers can browse scamsby type, and the list suggests that there is no end to the creativity of crooked callers. This month alone, the F.T.C. warned about half a dozen types of scams. The F.T.C. said this week that people answering advertisements for child-care jobs had been tricked into buying supplies from a specific vendor before they were hired. The promised reimbursement and job never materialized after the vendor was paid. Con artists also impersonate a relative or friend pleading to be bailed out of jail or swept up in a travel emergency and in need of a loan. Others pretend they are collecting money, cars or boats for military veterans. Reports about online romantic scams, in which impostors created fake profiles to trick a love interest, have tripled from 2012 to 2016, the F.T.C. said. ""Some even make wedding plans before disappearing with the money,"" the agency said. ""These scams can take a military angle with impostors stealing service members' photos to create phony profiles,"" it added. ""They might claim to be service members who can't get into their accounts overseas or who need money fast."" The agency also warned consumers last week of a common technical support scam. ""You're working on your computer when, suddenly, a message pops up on the screen: 'Virus detected! Call now for a free security scan and to repair your device,'"" the agency said in a blog post. The impostor asks for remote access, or pretends to run a test, it said. If you're worried about your computer, the agency advised, call your security software company directly, and do not use the phone number in the pop-up window or on caller ID.

"Idaho Inmates Hacked Prison Service for $225,000 in Credit","Hundreds of prison inmates in Idaho found a way to add hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of credit to their personal accounts, officials discovered this month. The prisoners were not inflating their bank accounts, but rather their JPay accounts. JPay is a service that inmates can use to communicate with the outside world; for example, by using secure tablets or kiosks to send emails or listen to music.  The Idaho Department of Correction learned about the hacking on July 2, and an investigation revealed that 364 inmates at five correctional facilities ""had improperly credited their JPay accounts by $224,772.40,"" Jeff Ray, the department's spokesman, said in a statement. ""This conduct was intentional, not accidental,"" he said. ""It required a knowledge of the JPay system and multiple actions by every inmate who exploited the system's vulnerability to improperly credit their account."" The inmates inflated their accounts by taking advantage of a quirk in the system that did not cost taxpayers money. Of the 364 inmates, 50 credited their accounts with more than $1,000 apiece, and one person managed to accumulate nearly $10,000. In recent years, tablets designed for prison use have become increasingly popular. JPay is one of the country's biggest prison financial services providers and has business in dozens of states. Inmates can use JPay to communicate with family members via emails, video calls and money transfers. Some can also access music, simple games or reading materials. ""While the vast majority of individuals use our secure technology appropriately, we are continually working to improve our products to prevent any attempts at misuse,"" Jade Trombetta, the company's spokeswoman, said in an email on Thursday. ""In this case, a number of individuals were found to have improperly credited their accounts, creating credits that could be used to purchase content. Once the issue was discovered it was quickly corrected."" Tablets have been marketed as a way to incentivize good behavior. But the companies that offer them have also been criticized for profiting from a captive market; when prisoners or their correspondents have to pay to communicate, the costs can add up. In 2014, a review by The New York Times of dozens of contracts found that states, counties and cities were seeking a substantial cut in return for letting such service businesses into prisons. The state's Department of Correction said that JPay had recovered more than $65,000 worth of improper credits, and the department had charged inmates with disciplinary offenses that could temporarily revoke privileges or tighten security for some. ""JPay has also suspended the ability of the inmates to download music and games until they compensate JPay for its losses,"" Mr. Ray said. ""The inmates are still able to use JPay to send and receive email."" PHOTO: JPay tablets allow inmates to communicate with family members via emails and video calls.

"Google, Seeking a Return to China, Is Said to Be Building a Censored Search Engine","HONG KONG -- Google withdrew from China eight years ago to protest the country's censorship and online hacking. Now, the internet giant is working on a censored search engine for China that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. Google has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added.  Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google's return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available. Google's reversal in China, which wasreported earlier by The Intercept, is the latest example of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge Chinese market, even if it means tamping down free speech. LinkedIn censors content in China, for example. And Facebook developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network, with the aim of potentially deploying it in China, though there was no indication it was offered to Chinese authorities. Many of these overtures appear to fall short of winning over Beijing. Last month, Facebook briefly gained approval to open a subsidiary in China's Zhejiang Province, but that approval was abruptly withdrawn after a matter of hours. Google's work on a censored search engine for China has already caused an outcry among human rights activists. Many are concerned that the company would block a long list of foreign websites including Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times, as well as Chinese search queries including the 1989 Tiananmen massacre and information about the Chinese leadership. Amnesty International said it would be a ""dark day for internet freedom"" and would constitute ""a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom"" if the tech giant accepted China's censorship terms. The work is also unpopular among many of Google's own employees, who have pushed back in recent months on issues such as gender in the workplace and how artificial intelligence should be applied to weaponry. On Wednesday, several expressed their disappointment about the China project on internal messaging platforms, according to four employees who saw the messages and who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One internal posting that was viewed by The New York Times said that some employees who were asked to work on the project had declined to do so, opting to transfer to different work or to quit the company. Some employees said the work was a violation of Google's previous statements about its stance on Chinese censorship, as well as its recently established principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence, which state that technologies should not be used to contravene human rights. ""We provide a number of mobile apps in China, such as Google Translate and Files Go, help Chinese developers, and have made significant investments in Chinese companies like JD.com,"" said Taj Meadows, a Google spokesman. ""But we don't comment on speculation about future plans."" Although Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, the company has lately displayed more interest in regaining access to the world's largest internet population. In June, Google announced a $550 million investment in the Chinese online retailer JD.com. Last year, Google unveiled plans to open a research center in China focused on artificial intelligence. And the company has released translation and file management apps for the Chinese market. Google now has more than 700 employees in China. In the years since Google's exit, local competitors have risen up, including China's dominant search engine, Baidu. Beyond search, the vast majority of Google's services, including its app store, email service and YouTube, remain inaccessible behind the Great Firewall, as the country's system of internet controls is known. Talks between Google and the Chinese government over the censored search engine began before the start of the recent trade war between the United States and China, one of the people said. The talks were not going well, this person added. But the Chinese government could nonetheless use Google as a chip in its negotiations with the American government, which has been critical of the way China limits market access for United States technology companies. By letting Google's search engine back into China, the Chinese government could give President Trump a political victory, earning some good will. For Google, China is an increasingly difficult market to navigate. The Chinese government has tightened internet censorship significantly since President Xi Jinping came into power five years ago. Companies need a great deal of resources to meet the censorship demands imposed by the government, and failing to do so can be serious. In the first half of 2018, China's national internet regulator shut down or revoked the license of more than 3,000 websites. Google is a household brand in much of the world, but its name may draw blank stares from China's younger generation who are growing up in the post-Google Chinese internet. Winning these people will be an uphill battle for Google, especially if it cannot differentiate itself much from Baidu. On Chinese social media on Wednesday, some people cheered the news of Google's possible China re-entry, saying that they welcomed competition with Baidu, which has faced scandals over its search results related to medical treatment. Others questioned whether a heavily censored Google might be useful. ""We welcome a normal Google but not a neutered Google,"" said Liu Xingliang, head of research at the Beijing-based analytics firm Data Center of the China Internet. ""We don't need a second Baidu.""

Australia Bars China's Huawei From Building 5G Wireless Network,"BEIJING -- The fog of cyberespionage concerns surrounding Huawei has for years kept the Chinese technology giant largely out of the United States. Now it has cost the company potentially lucrative business in another country: Australia. Huawei said on Thursday that the Australian government had barred it and another Chinese company, ZTE, from providing equipment to support the country's new telecommunications networks. Mobile carriers around the world have been preparing to build infrastructure using fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology, which promises to enable the ultrafast communications necessary for technologies such as self-driving cars. On Twitter, Huawei called the decision an ""extremely disappointing result for consumers."" In a statement, the company said it ""will continue to engage with the Australian government, and in accordance with Australian law and relevant international conventions, we will take all possible measures to protect our legal rights and interests.""  A ZTE spokeswoman declined to comment. Huawei, one of the world's largest makers of telecom gear and smartphones, already sells equipment to major Australian telecom carriers. The company wrote to Australian lawmakers recently, arguing that concerns that its gear could be used by the Chinese government for spying were ""ill informed and not based on facts."" But in a statement on Thursday, two Australian ministers indicated that the government would move to exclude certain equipment vendors from the nation's 5G networks. Companies that ""are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government"" pose unacceptable security risks, the ministers said. One of those ministers, Scott Morrison, is challenging Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for leadership of the country. Neither Huawei nor ZTE was specifically named in the Australian statement. But the two companies' ties to Beijing have long been cited by United States officials to justify keeping them out of American mobile networks. Huawei has said repeatedly that it is a private company owned by its employees, and that it obeys the law wherever it operates. Still, large American wireless carriers have for years shunned both its and ZTE's equipment. With such concerns about Chinese technology continuing to spread globally, it seems increasingly unlikely that the tech cold war between China and the United States will be reconciled quickly. More and more, the two economic powerhouses view the race to develop key technologies, 5G wireless included, in strategic as well as commercial terms. Both have stood up for their own national tech champions. And they have each sought to kneecap the other's. ZTE was nearly driven out of business this year after the United States Department of Commerce barred American firms from selling components to the company. The sanctions, imposed as punishment for illegal sales made by ZTE in Iran and North Korea, were later lifted to help defuse tensions between President Trump and China's leader, Xi Jinping. Even Chinese firms' research partnerships with universities in the United States and Canada have come under scrutiny. In June, a group of Washington lawmakers wrote to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, calling for a review of American universities' collaborations with Huawei. In response, Huawei's deputy chairman, Eric Xu, hit out at the politicians, saying that ""their minds are still in the agrarian age."" Mr. Xu added: ""Their behavior shows not just an ignorance of how science and innovation works today, but also their own lack of confidence.""

"Russians Planned Attack on Lab Testing Salisbury Nerve Agent, Swiss Say","BRUSSELS -- Two Russian spies caught in the Netherlands and expelled had been plotting cyber sabotage of a Swiss defense laboratory analyzing the nerve agent used to poison a former Russian agent in Britain, Swiss officials said Friday. The story -- first reported by the Dutch newspaper NRC and the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger, and confirmed by Swiss officials -- adds a new dimension to the charges by Western governments that the Kremlin is waging a sophisticated and unconventional campaign to work its will abroad, and undermine adversaries and their alliances. Britain contends that Russia sent two other spies to a quaint English cathedral city in March, carrying a military-grade poison to assassinate a turncoat former colleague, Sergei V. Skripal, which the Kremlin denies. The two men, publicly identified and charged by the British authorities, appeared on Russian television on Thursday to deny involvement in the poisoning that sickened Mr. Skripal and three others, and killed one person, insisting that they were sports nutritionists, not spies.  The Dutch authorities declined to comment on any expulsion of Russians or any plans for a cyber attack. The Swiss described the events as having taken place ""earlier this year"" but declined to be more specific. It was not clear if the Russians were among the diplomatic employees -- many suspected of being intelligence agents -- expelled by Western governments in retaliation for the Skripal attack. The two Russians, whose names have not been made public, came to the attention of the Swiss authorities during an investigation that began in March into ""suspicion of political espionage,"" said Linda von Burg, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland. That led to a joint investigation by Swiss, Dutch and British intelligence services, which concluded that the two Russians, working in The Hague, were spies for the Russian government and were preparing ""illegal actions against a Swiss critical infrastructure,"" according to Isabelle Graber, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service. She did not specify the intended target. But Andreas Bucher, a spokesman for the defense laboratory in the Swiss town of Spiez, confirmed that the laboratory had been the intended target. Mr. Bucher said he did not know about the Russians being identified, detained or expelled from the Netherlands. The Dutch media reports said that when they were intercepted by the Dutch military intelligence service, the two Russians had cyber tools for sabotaging the laboratory. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said on Friday that he would not comment until more information was available. Russia's foreign intelligence service declined to comment. The Spiez laboratory is part of the Swiss Federal Office for Civil Protection, which falls under the Swiss Defense Department, and is the designated lab in Switzerland for several international organizations, including the United Nations. The lab was one of two designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to provide independent analysis of the poison used against Mr. Skripal. The organization, which monitors compliance with a global treaty on chemical weapons, confirmed the British conclusion that the chemical belonged to a class of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union, known as Novichok. The lab also analyzed samples from the chemical attack near Damascus, Syria, in 2013 that killed more than 1,000 people. The United Nations concluded that the toxin in that attack was another nerve agent, sarin. Western governments have said it was used by forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, which Russia supports in the Syrian civil war. Workers at the Spiez lab need security clearances and most are Swiss nationals, though some are foreign fellows or visiting researchers, according to Mr. Bucher, the spokesman. ""We have indications of several attacks against our institutions, including possible cyber attacks in the last few months,"" Mr. Bucher said. ""But we took the necessary precautions and haven't been compromised."" Mr. Skripal, a former officer in Russian military intelligence, was imprisoned by the Russians for selling information to Britain. In 2010, he was sent to Britain in a spy swap, and settled in Salisbury, a small city in southwestern England famous for its church spire. On March 4, he and his daughter, Yulia S. Skripal, who was visiting from Russia, became seriously ill, as did one of the police officers who responded, Detective Sgt. Nick Bailey. It was quickly determined that a nerve agent was the cause, and parts of Salisbury were shut down amid a widespread search for traces of the poison, as local residents waited in fear for the results. British investigators concluded that the toxin was Novichok, applied to the handle of Mr. Skripal's front door, and long before they named the suspects they would eventually charge, officials said Russia had been responsible. Several Western countries expelled Russian officials, and denounced the attack as a violation of international norms, like Russia's aggression in Ukraine, its interference in other countries' elections, and assassinations and cyber attacks carried out abroad. Almost four months after the Skripal attack, two more people became seriously ill, apparently from handling a discarded bottle of the nerve agent. One of them, Dawn Sturgess, died, and the other, her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley -- like the Skripals and Sergeant Bailey -- recovered. Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.

The Plot to Subvert an Election: Unraveling the Russia Story So Far,"On an October afternoon before the 2016 election, a huge banner was unfurled from the Manhattan Bridge in New York City: Vladimir V. Putin against a Russian-flag background, and the unlikely word ""Peacemaker"" below. It was a daredevil happy birthday to the Russian president, who was turning 64. In November, shortly after Donald J. Trump eked out a victory that Moscow had worked to assist, an even bigger banner appeared, this time on the Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington: the face of President Barack Obama and ""Goodbye Murderer"" in big red letters. Police never identified who had hung the banners, but there were clues. The earliest promoters of the images on Twitter were American-sounding accounts, including @LeroyLovesUSA, later exposed as Russian fakes operated from St. Petersburg to influence American voters.  The Kremlin, it appeared, had reached onto United States soil in New York and Washington. The banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an American election in history. For many Americans, the Trump-Russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. What Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation, may know or may yet discover is still uncertain. President Trump's Twitter outbursts that it is all a ""hoax"" and a ""witch hunt,"" in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary, have taken a toll on public comprehension. But to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the Russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty: The Russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come. Acting on the personal animus of Mr. Putin, public and private instruments of Russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of American politics. Well-connected Russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the Trump campaign. To many Americans, the intervention seemed to be a surprise attack, a stealth cyberage Pearl Harbor, carried out by an inexplicably sinister Russia. For Mr. Putin, however, it was long-overdue payback, a justified response to years of ""provocations"" from the United States. And there is a plausible case that Mr. Putin succeeded in delivering the presidency to his admirer, Mr. Trump, though it cannot be proved or disproved. In an election with an extraordinarily close margin, the repeated disruption of the Clinton campaign by emails published on WikiLeaks and the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump messages shared with millions of voters by Russia could have made the difference, a possibility Mr. Trump flatly rejects. As Mr. Trump emerged in spring 2016 as the improbable favorite for the Republican nomination, the Russian operation accelerated on three fronts -- the hacking and leaking of Democratic documents; massive fraud on Facebook and Twitter; and outreach to Trump campaign associates. Consider 10 days in March. On March 15 of that year, Mr. Trump won five primaries, closing in on his party's nomination, and crowed that he had become ""the biggest political story anywhere in the world."" That same day in Moscow, a veteran hacker named Ivan Yermakov, a Russian military intelligence officer working for a secret outfit called Unit 26165, began probing the computer network of the Democratic National Committee. In St. Petersburg, shift workers posted on Facebook and Twitter at a feverish pace, posing as Americans and following instructions to attack Mrs. Clinton. On March 21 in Washington, Mr. Trump announced his foreign policy team, a group of fringe figures whose advocacy of warmer relations with Russia ran counter to Republican orthodoxy. Meanwhile, Unit 26165 was poring over the bounty from a separate attack it had just carried out: 50,000 emails stolen from the Clinton campaign's chairman. On March 24, one of the members of the Trump foreign policy team, George Papadopoulos, sat in the cafe of an upscale London hotel with a Russian woman who introduced herself as Mr. Putin's niece and offered to help set up a meeting between the Russian president and Mr. Trump. The woman and the adviser exchanged frequent messages in the weeks that followed. Today, Mr. Padadopoulos is unsure that those messages came from the person he met in the cafe. The Russian intervention was essentially a hijacking -- of American companies like Facebook and Twitter; of American citizens' feelings about immigration and race; of American journalists eager for scoops, however modest; of the naïve, or perhaps not so naïve, ambitions of Mr. Trump's advisers. The Russian trolls, hackers and agents totaled barely 100, and their task was to steer millions of American voters. They knew it would take a village to sabotage an election. Russians or suspected Russian agents -- including oligarchs, diplomats, former military officers and shadowy intermediaries -- had dozens of contacts during the campaign with Mr. Trump's associates. They reached out through email, Facebook and Twitter. They sought introductions through trusted business connections of Mr. Trump's, obscure academic institutions, veterans groups and the National Rifle Association. They met Trump campaign aides in Moscow, London, New York and Louisville, Ky. One claimed the Russians had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton; another Russian, the Trump campaign was told, would deliver it. In May and June alone, the Trump campaign fielded at least four invitations to meet with Russian intermediaries or officials. In nearly every case, the Trump aides and associates seemed enthusiastic about their exchanges with the Russians. Over months of such probing, it seems that no one alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the foreign overtures. Mr. Trump's position on the Russian contacts has evolved over time: first, that there were none; then, that they did not amount to collusion; next, that in any case collusion was not a crime. That is mere semantics -- conspiracy is the technical legal term for abetting the Russians in breaking American laws, such as those outlawing computer hacking and banning foreign assistance to a campaign. Whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired with the Russians is a central question of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, who has already charged 26 Russians and won convictions or guilty pleas from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; the former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and his deputy, Rick Gates; and from Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a separate case. But none of the convictions to date involve conspiracy. There remains an alternative explanation to the collusion theory: that the Trump aides, far from certain their candidate would win, were happy to meet the Russians because they thought it might lead to moneymaking deals after the election. ""Black Caviar,"" read the subject line of an email Mr. Manafort got in July 2016 from his associate in Kiev, Ukraine, hinting at the possibility of new largess from a Russian oligarch with whom they had done business. Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School and the great-granddaughter of the Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, said that what Russia pulled off, through creativity and sheer luck, would have been the envy of Mr. Putin's predecessors: puncturing the American sense of superiority and insisting on Russia's power and place in the world. ""This operation was to show the Americans -- that you bastards are just as screwed up as the rest of us,"" Professor Khrushcheva said. ""Putin fulfilled the dream of every Soviet leader -- to stick it to the United States. I think this will be studied by the K.G.B.'s successors for a very long time."" See the full timeline of events. Putin Is Angry The Russian leader thought the United States, and Hillary Clinton, had sought to undermine his presidency. The first Russian advance party was tiny: two women on a whirlwind American tour. Hitting nine states in three weeks in summer 2014, Anna Bogacheva and Aleksandra Krylova were supposed to ""gather intelligence"" to help them mimic Americans on Facebook and Twitter. They snapped photos and chatted up strangers from California to New York, on a sort of Russian ""Thelma &amp; Louise"" road trip for the era of social media. Even then, federal prosecutors would later say, the Russian government was thinking about the next United States presidential election -- perhaps ahead of most Americans. Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova had been dispatched by their employer, an online propaganda factory in St. Petersburg, to prepare to influence American voters. But why did Mr. Putin care about the election, then more than two years away? He was seething. The United States, in his view, had bullied and interfered with Russia for long enough. It was high time to fight back. His motives were rooted in Russia's ambivalence toward the West, captured in the history of St. Petersburg, Russia's spectacular northern city and Mr. Putin's hometown. Peter the Great, the brutal but westward-looking 18th-century czar, had brought in the best Italian architects to construct Russia's ""window on Europe"" in a swamp. Czar Peter's portrait replaced Vladimir Lenin's in Mr. Putin's office when he took a job working for the city's mayor in the early 1990s. Twenty-five years later, the internet offered a different kind of window on the West -- a portal that could be used for a virtual invasion. Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, had described the breakup of the Soviet Union as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century, a remarkable statement from a man whose country experienced revolution, civil war, bloody purges and the deaths of 27 million people in World War II. Like many of his fellow citizens, Mr. Putin was nostalgic for Russia's lost superpower status. And he resented what he saw as American arrogance. The Russian leader believed the United States had relentlessly sought to undermine Russian sovereignty and his own legitimacy. The United States had backed democratic, anti-Russian forces in the so-called color revolutions on Russia's borders, in Georgia in 2003 and Ukraine in 2004. It had funded pro-democracy Russian activists through American organizations with millions in State Department grants each year. With little evidence, Mr. Putin believed this American meddling helped produce street demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in 2011, with crowds complaining of a rigged parliamentary election and chanting, ""Putin's a thief!"" And Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, cheered the protesters on. Russians, she said, ""deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them."" Mr. Putin blamed Mrs. Clinton for the turmoil, claiming that when she spoke out, his political enemies ""heard the signal and with the support of the U.S. State Department began active work."" The two tangled again the next year when Mr. Putin pushed for a ""Eurasian Union"" that would in effect compete with the European Union. Mrs. Clinton sharply dismissed the notion, calling it a scheme to ""re-Sovietize the region"" and saying the United States would try to block it. By 2013, with his initial hopes for a ""reset"" of Russian relations dashed, Mr. Obama, like his top diplomat, no longer bothered to be diplomatic. He criticized Russia's anti-gay legislation, part of Mr. Putin's effort to become a global champion for conservative values, and gave a biting description of the Russian leader: ""He's got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom."" Mr. Putin was reported to be furious. After Russian troops seized Crimea and carried out a stealth invasion of Ukraine in 2014, relations grew openly hostile. American support for the new government in Kiev and condemnation of Russian behavior heightened Mr. Putin's rage at being told what he could do and not do in what he considered his own backyard. If Russia had only a fraction of the United States' military might and nothing like its economic power, it had honed its abilities in hacking and influence operations through attacks in Eastern Europe. And it could turn these weapons on America to even the score. By making mischief in the 2016 election, Mr. Putin could wreak revenge on his enemy, Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, damaging if not defeating her. He could highlight the polarized state of American democracy, making it a less appealing model for Russians and their neighbors. And he could send a message that Russia would not meekly submit to a domineering America. Hence the two Russian women who toured the United States in 2014, keyboard warriors granted the unusual privilege of real-world travel, hitting both coasts, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. At that point, according to a Russian document cited by the special counsel, Mr. Putin's intentions for 2016 were already explicit: to ""spread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general."" In the intervening two years, Mr. Putin's ire at America only increased. He blamed the United States for pushing for a full investigation of illicit doping by Russian athletes, which would lead to mass suspensions of the country's Olympic stars. And when the leaked Panama Papers were published in April 2016, revealing that a cellist who was Mr. Putin's close friend had secret accounts that had handled $2 billion, he charged that it was a smear operation by the United States. ""Who is behind these provocations?"" he asked. ""We know that among them are employees of official American institutions."" Then something unexpected happened. Of the more than 20 major-party candidates running for the American presidency, only Mr. Trump had repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin as a ""strong"" leader and brushed off criticism of Russia. Only he had little interest in the traditional American preoccupation with democracy and human rights. Only he had explored business interests in Russia for years, repeatedly pursuing a Trump Tower project in Moscow and bringing his beauty pageant there in 2013. ""Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow,"" the future candidate tweeted at the time, adding wistfully, ""if so, will he become my new best friend?"" If Mr. Putin had been designing his ideal leader for the United States, he could hardly have done better than Donald Trump. For some years, Mr. Trump had attracted attention from Russian conservatives with Kremlin ties. A Putin ally named Konstantin Rykov had begun promoting Mr. Trump as a future president in 2012 and created a Russian-language website three years later to support his candidacy. A Russian think tank, Katehon, had begun running analyses pushing Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump as a candidate was ""tough, rough, says what he thinks, rude, emotional and, apparently, candid,"" wrote Alexander Dugin, an ultranationalist philosopher considered a major influence on Mr. Putin, in February 2016. Mr. Dugin declared that Mr. Trump probably had ""no chance of winning"" against the ""quite annoying"" Mrs. Clinton, but added a postscript: ""We want to put trust in Donald Trump. Vote for Trump, and see what will happen."" Against all expectations, Republicans across the country began to do just that, and soon Mr. Trump was beating the crowd of mainstream Republicans. Mr. Putin, said Yuval Weber, a Russia scholar, ""found for the first time since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. that he has a prospective president of the United States who fundamentally views international issues from the Russian point of view."" Asked about the surging Mr. Trump in December 2015, Mr. Putin said he was ""a talent, without any doubt,"" and ""absolutely the leader in the presidential race."" He also applied to the candidate the Russian word yarkii, which means ""colorful"" or ""flamboyant"" but which some reports mistranslated as ""brilliant,"" an assessment that Mr. Trump immediately began repeating. ""It's always a great honor to be so nicely complimented,"" Mr. Trump said, ""by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond."" Moscow's Dream Team As Donald J. Trump emerged as the favorite for the nomination, his campaign brought on aides tied to Russia. Mr. Trump had steamrollered his primary opponents in part by taking aim at Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. The post-9/11 wars were foolish and costly, he would often say at campaign events. America's allies were deadbeats and freeloaders, he told supporters, who cheered in agreement. Russia was not an existential threat, he said, but a potential ally in beating back terrorist groups. In early March 2016, the establishment struck back. In an open letter, dozens of the party's national security luminaries vowed publicly to try to stop the election of a candidate ""so utterly unfitted to the office."" They took particular umbrage at Mr. Trump's remarks about the Russian president, writing that his ""admiration for foreign dictators such as Vladimir Putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world's greatest democracy."" But Mr. Trump was not cowed. He soon signed on new advisers and aides, including some who had been pushed to the fringe of a political party that had long lionized President Ronald Reagan for staring down Soviet leaders at the height of the Cold War. To the Kremlin, they must have looked like a dream team. Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, had long viewed Russia as a natural ally in what he saw as a ""world war"" against radical Islam. In June 2013, when he was D.I.A. chief, he sat inside the imposing headquarters of the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence agency, and chatted with officers. Two years later, he sat at Mr. Putin's elbow at a gala dinner in Moscow. Mr. Manafort, a longtime Republican lobbyist, had earned millions working for a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine and had a history of business dealings with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate close to Mr. Putin. He was nearly broke when he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 -- hired to help prevent a mass defection of convention delegates -- and yet he offered to work on the campaign unpaid. Carter Page, a businessman who spent several years working in Moscow, was virtually unknown in Washington when Mr. Trump appointed him a foreign policy adviser. But the S.V.R., Russia's foreign intelligence service, knew who he was. In 2013, Mr. Page met in New York with a Russian spy posing as an attaché at the United Nations and passed along energy industry documents in hopes of securing lucrative deals in Moscow. The F.B.I., which had been tracking Russian spies when Mr. Page came on the bureau's radar, determined that he had no idea he was meeting with a Russian agent. ""I promised him a lot,"" said the spy, Victor Podobnyy, speaking to another Russian intelligence officer about his dealings with Mr. Page, according to an F.B.I. transcript. ""How else to work with foreigners? You promise a favor for a favor."" The new team was in place by the end of March, and Mr. Trump had a new message that was strikingly similar to one of Mr. Putin's most ardent talking points. ""I think NATO's obsolete,"" Mr. Trump said during an interview on ABC's ""This Week."" ""NATO's not meant for terrorism,"" he went on to say. ""NATO doesn't have the right countries in it for terrorism."" By then, the Russian intelligence operation to intervene in the American election -- including efforts to infiltrate and influence the Trump campaign -- had begun. Mr. Papadopoulos, the 28-year-old campaign adviser, did not know this when he met in the cafe of the London hotel with Mr. Putin's ""niece"" (he has no niece) and an obscure Maltese professor in late March. The academic had taken an interest in Mr. Papadopoulos when he joined the campaign. F.B.I. agents have identified the professor, Joseph Mifsud, as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence, sent to establish contact with Mr. Papadopoulos and possibly get information about the direction of the Trump campaign. He disappeared after his name surfaced last October, and his whereabouts is unknown. At one point he changed his WhatsApp status to a simple, if cryptic, message: ""Alive."" Professor Mifsud arranged an email introduction between Mr. Papadopoulos and a Russian foreign ministry official. The American also exchanged emails with Olga Polonskaya, the woman in the cafe. ""We are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,"" she wrote in one message, and the two discussed a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump. Over time, though, Mr. Papadopoulos came to question whether the messages were actually from Ms. Polonskaya. The woman he had met in the cafe barely spoke English. The emails he received were in nearly perfect English. ""I even remember sending her a message asking if I'm speaking to the same person I met in London because the conversations were so strange,"" he said during an interview this month. In late April, Mr. Trump gave his first major foreign policy address in the ballroom of a historic Washington hotel. Some of the speech was a familiar litany of Republican policy positions -- hawkish warnings to Iran and pledges to be tough on terrorism. But midway through the speech, as Russia's ambassador to the United States watched from the front seats, Mr. Trump pivoted and said the United States and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest. ""Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end, and ideally will end soon,"" he said. ""That's the signal to meet,"" Mr. Papadopoulos wrote in an email to his Russian foreign ministry contact that evening, meaning that Mr. Trump's favorable comments about Russia suggested he might be interested in meeting Mr. Putin. Just one day earlier, Professor Mifsud had told the campaign aide about a possible gift from Moscow: thousands of hacked emails that might damage Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. It was a breathtaking revelation. But there was no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos -- while ambitious and eager for advancement in the bare-bones campaign -- passed the information along to anyone inside the Trump circle. More than two years later, Mr. Papadopoulos says he has ""no recollection"" of telling anyone in the campaign about the emails. He said he was supposed to have a phone call that day with Stephen Miller, a top campaign adviser, but it was postponed. If the two men had talked, Mr. Papadopoulos said, he might have shared the information. ""How fate works sometimes, I guess,"" said Mr. Papadopoulos, who has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to the F.B.I. As Mr. Trump continued to win primaries and vacuum up convention delegates late in the spring, the Russians made multiple attempts to establish contact with campaign officials. A Republican operative connected to the N.R.A. tried to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and a Russian central banker at an N.R.A. convention in Kentucky in May. ""Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,"" wrote the operative, Paul Erickson, in an email with the subject ""Kremlin connection."" ""Ever since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption."" Mr. Page, the foreign policy adviser, was invited to deliver the commencement address at the prestigious New Economic School in Moscow. That invitation now appears to have been an effort both to gain information about the Trump campaign and to influence it by feting Mr. Page in the Russian capital. Russian television that year was describing him as a ""famous American economist,"" but he was an obscure figure in this country. At that time, the last American to give the commencement speech was Mr. Obama, who used the opportunity to criticize Russia for its treatment of Georgia and Ukraine. Mr. Page, though, criticized the ""hypocrisy"" of the United States and its NATO allies for lecturing Russia about bullying its neighbors, which were former Soviet republics, while the Westerners were taking ""proactive steps to encourage regime change overseas."" During his time in Moscow, Mr. Page met with at least one top Russian official and numerous business leaders. And there was the now infamous June 2016 approach to Donald Trump Jr. by Russians whom he and his father had known from their days taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. The Russians met at Trump Tower in Manhattan with top campaign officials after promising damaging information on Mrs. Clinton. See the timeline of events that surround the Trump Tower meeting. What exactly transpired during the meeting is still a mystery, but it appears that the Russians pulled a bait-and-switch. They used the session to push for an end to the crippling economic sanctions that Mr. Obama had imposed on Russia. Donald Trump Jr. has said how disappointed he and other campaign advisers were that they didn't get what the Russians had promised. The campaign's reaction to the Russian attempts to discredit Mrs. Clinton's campaign was not to rebuff them or call law enforcement -- it was to try to exploit them. Experts who have studied Russian operations for decades see the catalog of contacts and communications between Russians and Mr. Trump's advisers as a loosely coordinated effort by Russian intelligence both to get insight into the campaign and to influence it. ""The Russians aren't reckless, and I don't see them going through with this effort without thinking they had a willing partner in the dance,"" said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. officer who served as the spy agency's station chief in Moscow. By midsummer 2016, the Russian contacts sounded alarms inside the F.B.I., where agents had received a tip about Mr. Papadopoulos and puzzled over Mr. Page's Moscow visit. The bureau sent a trusted informant to help understand what was happening: Stefan Halper, a former Nixon and Reagan adviser and professor at Cambridge University, reached out to Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos under false pretenses. American officials have defended Professor Halper's work, saying the use of such a confidential informant is routine in a counterintelligence investigation. Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have called him something different: a ""spy"" sent by the Obama administration to infiltrate the campaign. Eventually, Mr. Trump would use such episodes as a foundation for his view that America's law enforcement agencies had been aligned against him from the beginning -- ammunition for a looming war with the ""deep state."" This idea would consume Mr. Trump after he became president, feeding his sense of grievance that the legitimacy of his victory was under attack and shaping his decisions as he tried to blunt the widening Russia investigation. The long-promised ""dirt"" the Russians had on Mrs. Clinton would soon be made public. Three days after the Trump Tower meeting, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, appeared on a British Sunday television show. He said that his website would soon be publishing a raft of emails related to Mrs. Clinton. And he said something at once ominous and prescient: ""WikiLeaks has a very big year ahead."" Guccifer's Game Using a hacker persona, Russian military intelligence officers began to reveal documents stolen from the Democrats.  A website made its splashy debut three days later, presenting a jaunty hacker who called himself Guccifer 2.0. He had broken into the Democratic National Committee's computer network, Guccifer said, offering as proof a selection of purloined documents. ""Here are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC's network,"" Guccifer wrote on June 15. ""The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks,"" he added -- which seemed to explain Mr. Assange's boast. Russian intelligence had worked fast. Just the day before, D.N.C. officials and their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike, had announced that Russian hackers had penetrated the committee's computer network. Overnight, Russian military intelligence officers set up the website and created the Guccifer persona to counter the D.N.C. accusations. Guccifer -- a name borrowed from a real Romanian hacker -- was presented as a jovial Romanian, a ""lone hacker,"" who in his posts wanted to make one thing very clear: He had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia. ""It seems the guys from CrowdStrike and the DNC,"" he wrote, ""would say I'm a Russian bear even if I were a catholic nun."" In fact, beyond the conclusions of CrowdStrike and the F.B.I., there were clues from the start that Guccifer's posts came from Moscow: The name of the founder of the Soviet secret police was embedded in Guccifer's documents, written using a Russian version of Microsoft Word. Yet the Guccifer gambit would prove remarkably effective at creating doubt about Russia's responsibility for the hack. Republican operatives working on congressional campaigns emailed ""Guccifer"" and received hacked documents relevant to their races. For journalists, the claims of the supposed ""lone hacker"" made the role of Russian intelligence seem to be a disputed allegation rather than a proven fact. Today there is no doubt who hacked the D.N.C. and the Clinton campaign. A detailed indictment of 12 officers of Russia's military intelligence agency, filed in July by Mr. Mueller, documents their every move, including their break-in techniques, their tricks to hide inside the Democrats' networks and even their Google searches. See the timeline of hacking that led to the indictment. The agency, now called the Main Directorate but often referred to by its former abbreviation, the G.R.U., proved agile, brazen and not terribly discreet -- the same pattern it would show two years later in the nerve-agent poisoning in England of its former officer, the defector Sergei V. Skripal. The hacking might have drawn little attention had the G.R.U. stopped there, simply stealing emails to peruse for intelligence clues. But the Russians' decision to leak the emails to undercut Mrs. Clinton's candidacy was a huge escalation. The Russian officers' political skills proved equal to their hacking expertise. They deftly manipulated a long list of Americans and Europeans, many of whom embraced Guccifer's tall tale and took seriously the claim that the other Russian false front, DCLeaks.com, was run by American ""hacktivists."" ""Guccifer 2.0"" addressed a cybersecurity conference in London via messages to one of the organizers. The purported Romanian jousted with a suspicious reporter for Motherboard, insisting: ""I don't like Russians and their foreign policy. I hate being attributed to Russia."" When Twitter suspended the DCLeaks account, the Fox Business host Lou Dobbs accused the company of ""Leftist Fascism."" The account was swiftly reinstated. But the Russians' masterstroke was to enlist, via the Guccifer persona, the help of WikiLeaks. Neither of the Russians' websites, Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.com, had much reach. But WikiLeaks had a large global audience. Its editor, Mr. Assange, shared Mr. Putin's hatred of Mrs. Clinton and had a soft spot for Russia. Mr. Assange assisted with the subterfuge. He repeatedly denied that he'd received the documents from Russia; whether he was really taken in by the ""Guccifer"" ruse is uncertain. But he also obscured the Russian role by fueling a right-wing conspiracy theory he knew to be false. He offered a $20,000 reward for information about the murder in Washington of Seth Rich, a young D.N.C. staffer shot to death in an apparent bungled street robbery. Trump supporters were suggesting Mr. Rich had leaked the D.N.C. emails and been killed in retaliation, and Mr. Assange played along. In a discussion about WikiLeaks' sources on Dutch television in August 2016, Mr. Assange suddenly brought up Mr. Rich's killing. ""That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn't it?"" the interviewer said. ""What are you suggesting?"" ""I'm suggesting that our sources take risks,"" Mr. Assange said -- and then declined to say if Mr. Rich was a source. Such misleading interviews helped camouflage the Russian origin of the leak, and WikiLeaks' adept timing gave the emails big impact. After some technical problems, according to Mr. Mueller's indictment, ""Guccifer"" passed the entire archive of D.N.C. emails to WikiLeaks. The website published 19,252 of them on July 22, 2016 -- three days before the Democratic National Convention. The Russians' work detonated with powerful political effect. The emails' exposure of D.N.C. staffers' support for Mrs. Clinton and scorn for Senator Bernie Sanders, her chief rival, forced the committee's chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to resign. The resentment of the Sanders delegates deepened, leaving the party even more bitterly divided as it turned to the general election. Unknown to the feuding Democratic delegates, a cyberdrama had been playing out in secret for weeks, as CrowdStrike experts tried to root out the Russian hackers who had penetrated the D.N.C. and its sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Robert S. Johnston, a lead investigator for CrowdStrike, said the Russian hackers, uniformed officers of military intelligence, were ""like a thunderstorm moving through the system -- very, very noisy."" CrowdStrike had begun watching the Russians in April, asking D.N.C. staffers to keep quiet about the intrusion. ""We only talked over Signal,"" an encrypted text and call service, said Mr. Johnston, a former Marine and veteran of the United States Cyber Command who is now chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Adlumin. Only by following the hackers for several weeks could CrowdStrike be certain it had found the Russians' tools and blocked their access. But somehow, possibly by intercepting communications inside the D.N.C. or the F.B.I., which was investigating the breach, the G.R.U. officers learned they had been spotted. On May 31, two weeks before the public disclosure of the hack, Ivan Yermakov, a G.R.U. hacker who had used American-sounding online personas -- ""Kate S. Milton,"" ""James McMorgans"" and ""Karen W. Millen"" -- suddenly began searching online for information about CrowdStrike. He sought to find out what the cybersleuths knew about the Russians' main tool, a nasty piece of malware called X-Agent, the indictment noted. After that, the spy-versus-spy contest escalated. ""We knew it was the Russians, and they knew we knew,"" Mr. Johnston said. ""I would say it was the cyber equivalent of hand-to-hand combat."" The candidate favored by the Russians alternated between denying their help and seeming to welcome it. On June 15, the day after the D.N.C. hack was disclosed, the Trump campaign pitched in with a novel idea to deflect blame from the Russians: The D.N.C. had somehow hacked itself. ""We believe it was the D.N.C. that did the 'hacking' as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate,"" the statement said. Later, Mr. Trump tried out other alternative theories: Perhaps the hack had been carried out by ""somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,"" or a ""some guy in his home in New Jersey,"" or the Chinese, or almost anyone. But at other times, he appeared to accept that Russia was responsible. ""The new joke in town,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on July 25, ""is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should have never been written (stupid), because Putin likes me."" And two days later, he famously invited the Russians to try to retrieve 30,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton had deleted from her computer server on the basis that they involved personal matters and not State Department business. ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Mr. Trump said during a Florida news conference. The Mueller investigation discovered that the Russians were evidently listening: The same day as the news conference, the G.R.U. hackers began sending so-called spearphishing emails to accounts associated with Mrs. Clinton's personal office. Mr. Trump's pronouncements stood in striking contrast to the responses of past presidential candidates who had been offered assistance by foreign powers. In 1960, both Adlai E. Stevenson and John F. Kennedy refused quiet offers of help from Khrushchev. ""Because we know the ideas of Mr. Stevenson, we in our hearts all favor him,"" Khrushchev said in a message passed on by the Soviet ambassador. ""Could the Soviet press assist Mr. Stevenson's personal success? How?"" Mr. Stevenson declined the offer, in language that reflected the broad American political consensus about foreign election interference. ""I believe I made it clear to him,"" Mr. Stevenson wrote, ""that I considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned."" Russia did not deliver on Mr. Trump's request for Mrs. Clinton's deleted emails. But it had obtained something just as useful: 50,000 emails of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, stolen via a phishing attack by the G.R.U. Roger Stone, a political operative and longtime Trump friend, seemed to have advance word. ""Trust me,"" he wrote on Twitter on Aug. 25, it would soon be ""Podesta's time in the barrel."" But WikiLeaks withheld the Podesta emails for months after receiving them from ""Guccifer"" in June, evidently waiting for the right moment to have the biggest impact on the race. The time came on Oct. 7, amid two blows to the Trump campaign. See the timeline of events that surround the release of the emails. That day, American intelligence agencies made their first official statement that the Russian government, with the approval of its ""senior-most officials,"" was behind the hacking and leaking of the Democratic emails. And then came a potentially lethal disclosure for the Trump campaign: the shocking ""Access Hollywood"" recording in which Mr. Trump bragged of groping and sexually assaulting women. The candidate desperately needed to change the subject -- and that was the moment WikiLeaks posted the first of thousands of Mr. Podesta's emails. They were invaluable for political journalists, offering embarrassing comments from staffers about Mrs. Clinton's shortcomings and the full texts of her highly paid speeches to banks and corporations, which she had refused to release. WikiLeaks assisted by highlighting interesting tidbits in yellow. Soon, Mr. Trump was delighting his supporters by reading from the stolen emails on the campaign trail. ""Now, this just came out,""he told a fired-up crowd in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in October, brandishing a page of highlights. ""WikiLeaks! I love WikiLeaks!"" ""Crooked Hillary"" had said ""behind closed doors,"" Mr. Trump declared, that terrorism was ""not a threat""; that she had ""a great relationship with the financial industry""; that ISIS might infiltrate groups of refugees coming to the United States; that a politician needed to have ""both a public and private position"" on policies; and on and on. The quotes were taken out of context, of course, and subjected to the most damaging interpretation. But they seemed to offer a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton's hidden views. For the last month of the campaign, in daily releases that kept the Clinton team on the defensive, WikiLeaks delivered the Russians' gift. If the July D.N.C. dump had been an explosion, the October series was more like unrelenting sniper fire. Whether the timing was decided by the Russians or by Mr. Assange, it proved devastatingly effective. Imaginary Americans Russian trolls, using fake accounts on social media, reached nearly as many Americans as would vote in the election. David Michael Smith, a Houston political scientist and activist, spotted the alarming call on Facebook. A group called Heart of Texas was suddenly urging Texans to come at noon on May 21, 2016, to protest a 14-year-old Islamic center in downtown Houston. ""Stop Islamization of Texas,"" the post declared, with a photo of the Islamic Da'wah Center, which it called a ""shrine of hatred."" It invited protesters to prepare for battle: ""Feel free to bring along your firearms, concealed or not!"" ""We immediately asked, 'What the blank is the Heart of Texas'?'"" recalled Mr. Smith, who started calling friends to organize a counterprotest. Months later, he would find out. Heart of Texas, which garnered a quarter-million followers on Facebook, was one of 470 Facebook pages created 5,000 miles from Houston at the Internet Research Agency, the oddly named St. Petersburg company that would become the world's most famous manipulator of social media. The two Russian employees who had visited Texas during that 2014 American tour, Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova, evidently had returned home with big ideas about how to exploit the emotional chasms in American politics and culture. Just as the Russians' Guccifer character had reached out to American activists, journalists and WikiLeaks, the Russian online trolls understood that their real political power would come from mobilizing Americans. The Russian company's formula was simple: tap into a simmering strain of opinion in the United States and pour on the fuel. Consider the Texas protest. After the Russians put up the ""Stop Islamization"" Facebook post, several dozen like-minded Texans added their own incendiary comments. ""Allah Sucks,"" wrote one, adding a threat to kill any Muslim who tried to visit him. Another wrote of the Islamic center, ""Need to Blow this place up."" A dozen yelling white supremacists turned out for the protest, at least two of them with assault rifles and a third with a pistol. Others held Confederate flags and a ""White Lives Matter"" banner. Houston police managed to keep them away from a much larger crowd of counterprotesters -- some of whom had responded to a second Russian Facebook call. In a blatant attempt to create a confrontation, another Internet Research Agency page, this one called United Muslims of America, had asked people to rally at exactly the same time and place to ""Save Islamic Knowledge."" The event had no lasting consequences, though clearly it could have ended in tragedy. Still, it demonstrated that young Russians tapping on keyboards in 12-hour shifts could act as puppet masters for unsuspecting Americans many time zones away. When Facebook first acknowledged last year the Russian intrusion on its platform, it seemed modest in scale. The $100,000 spent on ads was a trivial sum compared with the tens of millions spent on Facebook by both the Trump and Clinton campaigns. See the timeline of events that shows Russia's social media campaign. But it quickly became clear that the Russians had used a different model for their influence campaign: posting inflammatory messages and relying on free, viral spread. Even by the vertiginous standards of social media, the reach of their effort was impressive: 2,700 fake Facebook accounts, 80,000 posts, many of them elaborate images with catchy slogans, and an eventual audience of126 million Americans on Facebook alone. That was not far short of the137 million people who would vote in the 2016 presidential election. And Facebook was only the biggest of the engines powering the Russian messages. On Instagram, there were 170 ersatz Russian accounts that posted 120,000 times and reached about 20 million people. Twitter reported that in the 10 weeks before the election some 3,814 Internet Research Agency accounts interacted with 1.4 million people -- and that another 50,258 automated ""bot"" accounts that the company judged to be Russia-linked tweeted about the election. The trolls created at least twopodcasts, posted Vine videos, blogged on Tumblr, sought donations via PayPal and even exploited the Pokémon Go craze. Without American social media companies, the Russian influence campaign could not have operated. The St. Petersburg trolls tapped the power of Silicon Valley for their stealth intervention in American democracy. Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University who has studied three million Internet Research Agency tweets, said he was ""impressed with both their level of absurdist creativity and keen understanding of American psychology."" They knew ""exactly what buttons to press"" and operated with ""industrial efficiency,"" he said. The Russian troll operation had gotten its start two years before, focusing at first on government targets closer to home. In 2014, Vitaly Bespalov, then 23, finished a journalism degree in the Siberian city of Tyumen and signed on as a ""content manager"" at the Internet Research Agency, which looked vaguely like a digital marketing firm and offered a relatively generous salary of $1,000 a month. Mr. Bespalov was surprised to discover that his job was to write or swipe stories to post on counterfeit Ukrainian websites, spinning the conflict there to fit the Russian government's view. He had to be sure always to use the word ""terrorists"" for the Ukrainian fighters opposed to the Russian invasion that was tearing the country apart. ""My first days on the job I was in shock -- I had no idea what kind of an operation this was,"" Mr. Bespalov said in a recent interview while vacationing in Ukraine: his first visit to the country about which he had written so many bogus stories. He was put off by the company's work but said he chose to stick around for several months, in part to study its operations. ""It was very monotonous and boring,"" Mr. Bespalov said. ""It seemed that almost no one liked this work. But almost nobody quit, because everyone needed the money."" Soon he began hearing about a new, secretive department inside the St. Petersburg company that was recruiting English speakers to focus on the United States. Like Peter the Great, the Internet Research Agency borrowed Western technology while shunning Western notions of democracy. As Mr. Bespalov quickly realized, the company was not a normal business but a well-compensated tool of the Russian state. It was owned by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who overcame an early prison sentence for robbery to create a thriving catering business. He then built a fortune as a loyal contractor willing to provide internet trolls, mercenary soldiers or anything else required by his patron, Mr. Putin. In the company's new department, some 80 young English speakers worked in shifts to feed Facebook pages and Twitter accounts imitating the snark and fury of outraged Americans. They stole photos, favoring attractive young women, for their Twitter profiles. They copied or created sharp poster-like commentaries on American life and politics, only occasionally slipping up with grammatical mistakes. They focused their efforts on pages that touched American nerves, with names like ""Guns4Life,"" ""Pray for Police,"" ""Stop All Invaders,"" ""South United"" and -- mimicking Mr. Trump -- ""America First."" If Mr. Trump was borrowing the hacked emails from the Russians for his stump speeches, the online trolls in St. Petersburg returned the favor, picking up the candidate's populist rhetoric. Even pages that seemed nominally hostile to him often worked in his favor: ""Woke Blacks"" critiqued Mrs. Clinton for alleged hostility to African-Americans; ""United Muslims of America"" showed her with a woman in a head scarf and a slogan -- ""Support Hillary, Save American Muslims"" -- that seemed aimed at generating a backlash. The Russians managed to call a dozen or more rallies like the one in Houston, sometimes paying unwitting American activists for their help via money transfer. The same method may have been used to get the bridge banners of Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama hung. An Internet Research Agency Twitter account, @cassishere, posted a photo of the Putin banner on the Manhattan Bridge, winning a credit from The New York Daily News. In Washington, the Russian account @LeroyLovesUSA tweeted about suspending the Obama banner, then added more tweets with critiques of Mr. Obama's foreign policy in stilted English. Facebook, reluctant to step into the divisive politics of the Trump presidency, did not acknowledge the Russian intrusion until nearly a year after the election, asserting that Russia had chiefly aimed at sowing division. A closer look suggested a more focused goal: damaging Mrs. Clinton and promoting Mr. Trump. Many of the Facebook memes portrayed Mrs. Clinton as angry, corrupt or crazed. Mr. Trump was depicted as his campaign preferred: strong, decisive, courageous, willing to shun political correctness to tell hard truths. The Russian operation also boosted Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who had dined with Mr. Putin in Moscow, to draw votes from Mrs. Clinton. It encouraged supporters of Mr. Sanders to withhold their votes from Mrs. Clinton even after he endorsed her. The impact is impossible to gauge; the Internet Research Agency was a Kremlin fire hose of influence wielded amid a hurricane of a presidential election. Christopher Painter, who had served under President George W. Bush at the Justice Department and as the State Department's coordinator for cyberissues from 2011 to 2017, said the propaganda flood and the leaked emails certainly affected the vote. But no one can say whether it made the difference in an election decided by the tiniest of margins, fewer than 100,000 votes in three states. ""It's impossible to know how much voter suppression it caused, discouraging people from coming out,"" Mr. Painter said. ""It's impossible to know how many votes it changed."" He added that ""people don't like to admit they've been fooled"" -- hence the strenuous efforts from Mr. Trump and his supporters to deny or dismiss the significance of the Russian interference. A case in point would be Harry Miller, a devoted Trump supporter in Florida who was paid to organize a rally in which a woman portraying Mrs. Clinton sat behind bars on the back of his pickup truck. It turned out that the people who had ordered up the rally, ""Matt Skiber"" and ""Joshua Milton,"" were pseudonyms for Russians at the Internet Research Agency, according to the Mueller indictment. But don't tell that to Mr. Miller. Contacted via Twitter, he insisted that he had not been manipulated by Russian trolls. ""They were not Russians, and you know it,"" Mr. Miller wrote, adding, ""If you don't then you are the one snookered."" 'It's a Hoax, O.K.?' The president has created doubts about the investigation and an affinity for Russia among his supporters. The White House statement released at 7:21 p.m. on May 17, 2017, was measured, even anodyne. Reacting to the news that Mr. Mueller had been appointed special counsel for the Russia investigation, the statement quoted Mr. Trump saying that he was ""looking forward to this matter concluding quickly,"" and that in the meantime he would be fighting ""for the people and issues that matter most to the future of our country."" Exactly 12 hours and 31 minutes later, early in the morning without his staff around him, he told the world what he really thought. ""This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!"" he wrote in a tweet. It had been little more than a week since the president had fired his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, but the ""Russia thing"" wasn't going away. Now the president was up against someone who could become even more formidable -- a careful, tenacious former Marine whose stewardship of the F.B.I. during the Bush and Obama years had been praised by Washington's establishment. Mr. Trump's instinct was to fire Mr. Mueller, but he settled for a different strategy. He has used all his power to try to discredit the special counsel's investigation. Revelation upon revelation about Russian encounters with Trump associates has followed in the months since Mr. Mueller was appointed, intensifying the fear in the White House. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter pulpit to repeatedly assault the Mueller inquiry, and has made scathing remarks at rallies about claims of Russian interference. ""It's a hoax, O.K.?"" he told a Pennsylvania crowd last month. The attacks have had an impact on how Americans view the country's national security apparatus, how they view the Russia story, even how they view Russia itself. See the full timeline of Mr. Trump's repeated denials and attacks. The strategy has helped sow doubts about the special counsel's work in part because Mr. Mueller and his prosecutors only rarely go public with the evidence they have been steadily gathering in secret interviews and closed-door sessions of a grand jury. During a period of 146 days over this year -- between the Feb. 16 indictment of the Internet Research Agency operatives and the July 13 indictment of Russian intelligence officers -- Mr. Mueller's office was effectively silent. The president was not, sending at least 94 tweets that denied he had been involved in ""collusion,"" called the Russian interference a ""hoax"" or labeled the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt."" By July, one poll showed that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the investigation, a 14-point increase from January. The shift was even more dramatic among Republican voters: from 49 percent to 78 percent. More recent polls, conducted since the indictment of the G.R.U. officers and Mr. Manafort's conviction, have shown a reversal of the trend. The president's aides hardly make a secret of their goal to discredit the investigation before a jury of the public. There is little expectation that Mr. Mueller would ignore Justice Department guidelines and try to indict a sitting president, so Mr. Trump's lawyers see Congress and impeachment as the only threat. Turn the public against impeachment, the thinking goes, and Congress is less likely to act. ""Mueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,"" Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's omnipresent lawyer, told The New York Times last month, without citing any data to buttress his assertion. ""So I think we've done really well,"" he said. ""And my client's happy."" Mr. Trump's frustration with the Russian investigation is not surprising. He is right that no public evidence has emerged showing that his campaign conspired with Russia in the election interference or accepted Russian money. But the inquiry has buffeted his presidency, provoked concern that his attempts to thwart the investigation amount to obstruction of justice and fed his suspicion that the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies -- what he calls ""the deep state"" -- are conspiring against him. The desire of the president to make deals with Mr. Putin, and the longstanding skepticism of the intelligence community about Russian intentions and actions, might have made a clash inevitable. But Mr. Trump appears to have had success in persuading some Americans that the spy and law enforcement agencies are corrupt and hyperpartisan. He has scrambled alliances that solidified over decades, including the Republican Party's reflexive support of the national security agencies. A president in open war with the F.B.I., once inconceivable, is now part of the daily news cycle. Mr. Trump began laying the foundation immediately after he won the presidency, when he questioned the intelligence agencies' findings that Russia had disrupted the election, and likened America's spies to Nazis. Since taking office, he has worked with partners in Congress to cast the agencies as part of an insurgency against the White House. It continued in July, when he stood next to Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declared that he trusted the Russian president's assurances that Moscow was innocent of interfering in the 2016 election. And it continues today. Early one morning last week, hours before flying to Pennsylvania to honor the victims of the flight that crashed on Sept. 11, 2001, the president fired off a tweet that appeared to quote something he had seen on Fox News. ""'We have found nothing to show collusion between President Trump &amp; Russia, absolutely zero, but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the FBI &amp; DOJ, the Hillary campaign, foreign spies &amp; Russians, incredible.'"" The reshuffling of alliances has seeped into the media, where the president's reliable allies have been joined by voices on the left to dismiss the Russia story as overblown. They warn of a new Red Scare. On Fox News, the network where Sean Hannity fulminates nightly about Mr. Mueller and his team, the journalist Glenn Greenwald, a founder of the left-leaning news site The Intercept and a champion of government whistle-blowers, has appeared regularly to dismiss revelations about the investigation and decry officials ""willing to leak, even at the expense of committing crimes,"" in order to damage Mr. Trump. Multiple frenzied television segments and hyped news stories have given credence to the concerns of Mr. Greenwald and others about a 21st-century McCarthyism. And critics of the ""deep state"" were given powerful ammunition after the release of text messages between two F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, that revealed their animosity toward Mr. Trump. The pair, who were involved in a romantic relationship at the time, have been skewered regularly on Mr. Hannity's show as the ""Trump-hating F.B.I. lovebirds."" Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's glowing words about Mr. Putin and Russia have created a new affinity for Russia -- in particular its social conservatism and toughness on terrorism -- among Mr. Trump's most devoted supporters. During a period of myriad accounts about Russia's attempts to disrupt the last election, the percentage of Republicans who view Mr. Putin favorably has more than doubled (from 11 percent to 25 percent), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Democrats are now far more likely than Republicans to see Russia as a threat. An October 2017 poll showed that 63 percent of Democrats and just 38 percent of Republicans said they saw ""Russia's power and influence"" as a significant threat to the United States. Once again, Mr. Trump has flipped the script in the party of Reagan: A country that was once seen as a geopolitical foe is now embraced by many Republicans as a bastion of Christianity and traditional values. Michael McFaul, ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that despite the country's relative economic and military weakness, Mr. Putin had often played a poor hand deftly. ""Across many dimensions, Putin is using all kinds of instruments of power,"" he said. ""It feels to me,"" the former ambassador said, ""like he's winning and we're losing."" On July 16, the president woke early in Helsinki, hours before he was to sit face to face with Mr. Putin. The meeting came three days after Mr. Mueller indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers. Once again, Mr. Trump dashed off a tweet. ""Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!"" he wrote.

He Took Home Documents to Catch Up on Work at the N.S.A. He Got 5\xC2 Years in Prison.,"BALTIMORE -- As a Vietnamese immigrant with imperfect English, Nghia H. Pho felt he was falling behind his fellow National Security Agency software developers in promotions and pay. So in 2010, after four years on the job, he began taking highly classified documents to his Maryland home to get extra work done at night and on weekends in an effort to improve his performance evaluations. But in the five years that Mr. Pho, 68, stored the material on his insecure home computer, officials believe it was stolen by Russian hackers using the antivirus software installed on the machine. Mr. Pho worked for the N.S.A.'s hacking unit, then known as Tailored Access Operations, and his cache is believed to have included both hacking tools and documentation to go with it.  On Tuesday, as family members wept in the courtroom, Mr. Pho was sentenced to five and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to a single count of willful retention of national defense information. Mr. Pho, a slender man with a thatch of white hair, chose to address the court in English despite the presence of an interpreter. ""I did not betray the U.S.A.,"" he said. ""I did not send the information to anyone. I did not make a profit."" Mr. Pho's lawyer, Robert C. Bonsib, noted repeatedly that David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general and former C.I.A. director, served no prison time after he pleaded guilty in 2015 to mishandling classified information, a misdemeanor. He shared the materials with the woman who was his lover and biographer. United States District Judge George L. Russell III expressed some sympathy for Mr. Pho's situation and admiration for his family. But he said the sentence was necessary to create ""a real deterrent"" for others who might consider mishandling sensitive information. Prosecutors, who had sought an eight-year term, emphasized that Mr. Pho had been repeatedly trained along with other N.S.A. employees in the rules governing secrets. Thomas P. Windom, an assistant United States attorney, took issue with Mr. Bonsib's assertion that Mr. Pho had made ""one mistake"" in an otherwise exemplary career. ""This was not one mistake,"" Mr. Windom said. ""This was five years of bad choices -- criminal choices -- that were devastating for the intelligence community."" Prosecutors did not explain in open court the evidence that Russia had targeted Mr. Pho's home computer, a topic presumably discussed in a separate closed court session. Mr. Windom did speak about the thousands of hours spent by N.S.A. workers to assess what Mr. Pho took home and what harm the loss of secrets might cause. Adm. Michael S. Rogers, then the N.S.A. director, wrote in an unusual letter to Judge Russell last March that Mr. Pho's breach of security rules had resulted in ""articulable harm to intelligence-gathering."" Security officials, speaking of the classified case on condition of anonymity, have said that Mr. Pho had installed the popular Kaspersky Lab antivirus software on his home computer and that Russian government hackers had essentially piggybacked on the software to steal his material. The company has acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on a customer's computer and removing it, but has said the material was subsequently destroyed. It has denied that it knowingly works with Russian intelligence, but American government agencies no longer use its products. Mr. Pho's case is only one of several N.S.A. breaches in recent years. In 2013, Edward Snowden, an N.S.A. contractor, fled to Hong Kong with a huge archive of documents that he shared with journalists. In 2016, another contractor, Harold T. Martin III, was arrested after spending years taking sensitive agency data to his Maryland home, where he stored it in his car and in a shed in his yard. Around the same time, a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers began to post some of the agency's most guarded software tools on the web; the source of the leak has not been found. Last month, an N.S.A. translator, Reality Winner, was sentenced to five years and three months in prison for sharing classified documents about Russian election hacking with The Intercept, an online publication.

Why You Shouldn't Use Facebook to Log In to Other Sites; State of the Art,"I'm going to quit using Facebook to log in to apps and sites online. You should, too. That's the most reasonable way to respond to Facebook's announcement last week that a security breach allowed hackers to infiltrate the accounts of at least 50 million users, and possibly tens of millions more. The hack gave attackers access to not just your Facebook account but also possibly the many accounts you used Facebook to log in with -- services like Instagram, Spotify, Airbnb, Tinder, Pinterest, Expedia, The New York Times and more than 100,000 other places online. I say ""possibly"" because neither Facebook nor third-party sites seem to know the precise extent of the damage. In a statement on Tuesday, Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of product management, said the company had ""no evidence"" that attackers breached other sites through the hack, but that the company was building more sophisticated ways for sites to do their own deeper investigation.  But the mere possibility is highly troubling -- and if the hack allowed access to any other sites, Facebook should be disqualified from acting as your sign-on service. This is a classic you-had-one-job situation. Like a trusty superintendent in a Brooklyn walk-up, Facebook offered to carry keys for every lock online. The arrangement was convenient -- the super was always right there, at the push of a button. It was also more secure than creating and remembering dozens of passwords for different sites. Facebook had a financial and reputational incentive to hire the best security people to protect your keys; tons of small sites online don't -- and if they got hacked and if you reused your passwords elsewhere, you were hosed. But the extensive hack vaporizes those arguments. If the entity with which you trusted your keys loses your keys, you take your keys elsewhere. And there are many more-secure and just-as-convenient ways to sign on to things online. The best way is to use a dedicated password manager -- a service, like LastPass or 1Password, that creates and remembers strong passwords for different sites. Operating systems and browsers are also getting better at managing passwords; newer iPhones, for instance, let you unlock sites with facial recognition, which is just as convenient as pressing Facebook's button. If for some reason you don't want to use a password manager, you can use another tech giant's sign-on service. When presented with different ways to sign on to sites, you can choose Google or Microsoft instead of Facebook. Yes, it's possible those companies could be hacked one day, too. After all, Yahoo was hacked, as was LinkedIn, as was Equifax. But at this moment, a sign-on service by Google or Microsoft has one big advantage over Facebook's: Those companies did not lose control of 50 million people's accounts, and Facebook did. I decided to quit using the social network as a login service after chatting with Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who has studied the security of sign-on services like Facebook's. Mr. Polakis allowed that there are tremendous convenience benefits and even some security benefits to a single sign-on. ""Obviously, big companies like Facebook and Google have amazing engineers, and their security practices are generally ahead of the curve compared to other, smaller websites,"" he said. But no company, not even one as big and wealthy as Facebook or Google, can guarantee perfect security. And in some ways, Mr. Polakis said, Facebook's size and complexity work against its security. The Facebook hack, for instance, seems to have been caused by three different bugs acting in concert. ""The codebase of these services is massive,"" Mr. Polakis said. ""You have different teams working on different components, and they can interplay in different ways, and you can have a crazy hack that no one expects."" The other danger to signing on to everything with Facebook is the threat of phishing. Even if millions of Facebook accounts hadn't been hacked, people's individual accounts are hacked all the time through online trickery. Single sign-on compounds the damage -- whoever hacks your Facebook account gets access to everything else you tied to Facebook. Why is a password manager a better way to protect yourself than signing on through a big platform? Password managers can also be hacked, Mr. Polakis said, but ""compared to massive platforms that have millions of different lines of codes and different functionalities, a password manager has one specific job, and so it minimizes the chances of something going wrong."" I asked Facebook for a counterargument to stop using it for signing on. A spokesman said Facebook's sign-on was still more secure than the weak passwords that people create and reuse for everything. That's not a bad point. Password managers aren't as convenient to use as Facebook's button; if people respond to the Facebook hack by rolling their own passwords instead of using Facebook, that may be worse for everyone. The spokesman also noted that Facebook was taking this hack very seriously and had been investing heavily in security and privacy practices during its last two years of scandal. I don't argue otherwise. I believe Facebook is taking this seriously. At some point, maybe, Facebook will regain my trust enough to handle my digital keys. But it will do so only if there's some cost to losing them. For now, that cost is: When I see the blue Facebook button offering an easy way to sign up for this or that digital doodad, I'm not tapping it. Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjoo.

The Election Has Already Been Hacked,"As the 2018 midterm election nears, an ominous question looms: Will this election be hacked? The answer is: Yes, it has already been hacked. This election has already been hacked even if not a single voting machine has been compromised. It has already been hacked even if not another ruble has been spent on spreading disinformation. It has already been hacked even if voter registration information has been undisturbed and no vote tallies are altered. Why? Because the legitimacy of an election depends on the electorate accepting that it was fair, that everyone who tried to vote got to vote and that every vote counted. Lose that, and your voting system might as well have suffered a devastating technological attack.  Unfortunately, in much of the United States, we are no longer able to assure people that none of those things has happened. A recent poll shows that 46 percent of the American electorate do not think their votes will be counted fairly, and about a third think it is likely that a foreign country will tamper with the results. That loss of trust has itself become a form of voter discouragement. Why vote, when you feel it may not matter? Why register, when you fear you may be tossed off the rolls? Creating or allowing the loss of trust in democratic institutions is a great facilitator of authoritarianism. It works though a vicious cycle: The more that you can convince people that democratic institutions aren't working, the less that people will fight to protect and improve them -- and the less that people fight to protect and improve democratic institutions, the worse they will perform. The actual problems in the electoral infrastructure are considerable. For example, just three companies produce all the voting machines. Such centralization would be dangerous even if the machines weren't so vulnerable -- which, unfortunately, they are. But apart from such clearly urgent concerns, there is a bewildering array of concerns of a less valid nature, ranging from the uncertain to the dubious to the exaggerated to the outright baseless. On social media, I regularly come across all of these. I can't blame people even for the baseless concerns. As someone who has studied electoral infrastructure for years, I, too, sometimes struggle to differentiate the grounded worries from the ungrounded ones.  Yes, Georgia is running its election on old Windows 2000 machines (so old that Microsoft no longer supports the operating system for security updates), with no means of voter verification, audits or recounts. No, people in Georgia whose names aren't exact matches between voter rolls and other forms of identification will not be blocked from voting in this election -- thanks to a federal judge who ruled on Friday that the state's ""exact match"" rules for registration won't apply for this election. But yes, they could be removed from the voter rolls for the next election. And so on. If experts have to scramble to stay abreast of the latest news, how are most voters supposed to know what's what? We have done something even worse than letting our electoral infrastructure crumble, something even worse than allowing the instruments of the voting process (voter registration data, polling places) to become political weapons. We have gotten ourselves into a place where the mechanisms of accountability and transparency that are the bedrock of any sensible election process no longer operate in many parts of the country. This has all the makings of a political crisis. It needs to be stopped now, before the vicious cycle spins beyond our control. Stopping it will require embracing every democratic institution that is failing to some degree (electoral infrastructure, media, local government) and trying to fix it. That means fighting cynicism -- standing up for important institutions even as they are letting us down. It also means voting, even in an imperfect system. Voting remains the key tool of legitimacy for any government. If it didn't matter, it wouldn't be so much under attack. Even dictatorships hold mock votes, because ""we won the election"" remains the strongest argument for legitimacy of rule. Voting is so powerful that even a hollowed-out version holds sway. But overhauling the electoral infrastructure has to be a priority. The voting process should be overseen by nonpartisan officials or monitored through an adversarial process (with input from representatives of all parties). Recently, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine released a comprehensive study, ""Securing the Vote,"" which offers extensive practical recommendations. Luckily, fewer and fewer electronic voting machines remain in use around the country; they should be replaced with optical-scan ballots. Meaningful audit processes should be instituted nationwide. States need federal money to upgrade their voting machines, train their poll workers and secure and upgrade their pollbooks (which maintain voter identification information). Paradoxically, the crumbling, mismatched and patchwork nature of our electoral infrastructure makes it unlikely that we will see large-scale computerized hacking that alters the political landscape. The failure to vote because of cynicism and mistrust is the bigger threat to the integrity of our elections. To fix that, we need to elect politicians whose platforms include the need for demonstrably fair elections. And that requires voting -- warts, failings and everything else aside. Sometimes, working with what you have, rather than surrendering to cynicism, is the only strategy. PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Lauren Justice for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) "
Another Use for A.I.: Finding Millions of Unregistered Voters,"The mechanics of elections that attract the most attention are casting and counting, snafus with voting machines and ballots and allegations of hacking and fraud. But Jeff Jonas, a prominent data scientist, is focused on something else: the integrity, updating and expansion of voter rolls. ""As I dove into the subject, it grew on me, the complexity and relevance of the problem,"" he said. As a result, Mr. Jonas has played a geeky, behind-the-scenes role in encouraging turnout for the midterm elections on Tuesday. For the last four years, Mr. Jonas has used his software for a multistate project known as Electronic Registration Information Center that identifies eligible voters and cleans up voter rolls. Since its founding in 2012, the nonprofit center has identified 26 million people who are eligible but unregistered to vote, as well as 10 million registered voters who have moved, appear on more than one list or have died.  ""I have no doubt that more people are voting as a result of ERIC,"" said John Lindback, a former senior election administrator in Oregon and Alaska who was the center's first executive director. Voter rolls, like nearly every aspect of elections, are a politically charged issue. ERIC, brought together by the Pew Charitable Trusts, is meant to play it down the middle. It was started largely with professional election administrators, from both red and blue states. But the election officials recognized that their headaches often boiled down to a data-handling challenge. Then Mr. Jonas added his technology, which has been developed and refined for decades. It is artificial intelligence software fine-tuned for spotting and resolving identities, whether people or things. ""Every time you get two pieces of junk mail from the same place, that's an entity resolution problem,"" Mr. Jonas said. ""They're missed, but entity resolution problems are everywhere."" Shortly after the election administrators tapped him, Mr. Jonas sketched out how his technology might be applied to their challenges. And they needed to take a very different path than another data-matching initiative, the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck System, which was already underway. Crosscheck was begun in 2005, led by Ron Thornburgh, then the Republican secretary of state in Kansas, and later championed by Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state who is running for governor of Kansas. Crosscheck was portrayed as a program to root out voter fraud. But election administrators and experts agree that voter fraud is a rarity. Voter rights advocates long argued that Crosscheck was a partisan effort to purge voter rolls of likely Democratic voters, and a recent study by the Brennan Center for Justice found a rising rate of people being removed from voter rolls. Last year, researchers at Stanford, Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Microsoft Researchconcluded that Crosscheck produced a flood of false positives, raising the risk of disenfranchising legal voters. Andan investigation by ProPublica found Crosscheck was riddled with security flaws. Today, the Crosscheck system is little used, essentially dormant. ERIC, by contrast, was meant to both increase voter access and clean up voter rolls. Member states have to agree to specific steps to do both. ""If we didn't do that, ERIC would become another politicized tool,"" said David Becker, former head of the elections program at Pew and the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. The organization's reach has grown gradually and its members now include the District of Columbia and 24 states, both traditionally Democratic ones like Connecticut and Illinois and Republican ones like Louisiana and Missouri. From each member, the group collects a minimum of voter registration and motor vehicle license data. The software Mr. Jonas and his team developed digests and links that data, and combines it with other information like postal change-of-address lists. Some states contribute other data. Any private personal information including date of birth, driver's license and Social Security numbers, receive a one-way encryption ""hash"" for privacy -- scrambled into a string of numbers and characters, which cannot be read by humans. The software finds people wherever they are. ""It connects the dots for us,"" said Shane Hamlin, executive director of the center. ""It's actionable data."" Among the actions required by member states is to mail out notifications to people identified as eligible but unregistered. Follow-up research in some states concluded that 10 to 20 percent of those contacted had later registered to vote, a high response rate for direct mailings, Mr. Hamlin said. That rate suggests 2.6 million to 5.2 million of the 26 million people notified became voters, though they could have signed up for other reasons. The software is not flawless. A couple of state administrators said determining a person's current address can be difficult, according to the Brennan Center study, and like any technology tool, much depends on how it is used, despite the safeguards. But the states using the ERIC software generally say false positives are few, and returned unopened mail -- evidence of a wrong address -- is much reduced. And the outreach seems to be working. Colorado had the highest percentage of eligible, registered voters in the country in 2016, at 90 percent, up from 82 percent in 2012. ""For my money, ERIC is a big part of that,"" said Judd Choate, Colorado's director of elections. ""ERIC has been a game changer in elections for those of us in it."" One thing Mr. Jonas finds satisfying is that ERIC has a two-person staff with one tending the constantly growing database of more than 275 million records. ""It's not beholden to an army of experts,"" he said. Mr. Jonas is advancing the technology in a start-up, Senzing, which he founded and spun out of IBM in 2016. He joined IBM after it bought his previous start-up, Systems Research and Development, in 2005. Senzing has no headquarters. Its 20 full-time employees work from wherever they please, following their founder's lead. Mr. Jonas, 54, has long been a road warrior, but recently he decided to go further -- a lifestyle experiment he calls ""full nomad"" and ""extreme minimalism."" He is selling his home in Venice, Calif., and jettisoning nearly all his possessions. He has digitized family photos, papers, awards, anything that stirs memories of his experience, and stored them on Dropbox. His clothes are laundered, stored and sent ahead to him to his travel destinations by DUFL, a travel valet service. On Sunday, Mr. Jonas completed his 61st Ironman Triathlon -- swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles and running a full 26.2-mile marathon -- in Florida. ""I'm unencumbered, so I can focus on stuff that matters,"" Mr. Jonas said.

"Behind Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Rise, Two Loyal Enforcers","BEIRUT, Lebanon -- When Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia convened an outdoor banquet this spring for his fellow Arab rulers, seated among the kings, princes and presidents were two friends with few qualifications other than their closeness to the young prince himself: a poet who has become known for orchestrating ferocious social media campaigns, and a former security guard who runs the Saudi sports commission. The two men had each played pivotal roles in many of the brazen power plays that have marked Prince Mohammed's sprint to dominance of the kingdom -- the ouster of the previous crown prince, the detentions of royals and businessmen in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, the kidnapping of the Lebanese prime minister, and the kingdom's diplomatic spats with Qatar and Canada. Even Saudi royals have come to fear the prince's two friends -- Saud el-Qahtani, 40, and Turki al-Sheikh, 37 -- and the Arab potentates around the table could scarcely object to their presence. Now the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents has focused attention on their roles as enablers of the crown prince's impulsiveness and aggression, and Saudi watchers consider the men's fate a bellwether of the royal court's direction as it grapples with the international outrage over the killing.  ""They are the closest people to the crown prince,"" said Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. ""They are his political enforcers and the face of the brash new 'Saudi first' posture at home and abroad, and those opposed to the hypernationalist, thuggish direction in Saudi foreign policy would be happy to see them cut down to size."" Neither man is among the 18 people Saudi Arabia says it has arrested in the course of its investigation into Mr. Khashoggi's killing. But the kingdom has already assigned some blame for the killing to Mr. Qahtani, the social-media czar. He lost his title as an adviser to the royal court because he contributed to the vitriolic rhetoric toward the kingdom's critics that led to Mr. Khashoggi's death, a Saudi official said. It is unclear which of his many duties Mr. Qahtani has relinquished. Mr. Sheikh, the sports commissioner, was in New York for medical treatment during the killing, according to Saudis who know him, and has since avoided the spotlight. Mr. Khashoggi, who was a Saudi insider before fleeing the kingdom last year to live in Virginia and write columns for The Washington Post, had said the two men exemplified what was dangerous about Prince Mohammed. The crown prince ""does not have political advisers except Turki al-Sheikh and Saud al-Qahtani,"" Mr. Khashoggi said in private comments published by Newsweek after his death. ""They are very thuggish. People fear them. You challenge them, you might end up in prison."" Mr. Qahtani did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Sheikh did not respond to a request for comment sent to the sports commission. Both men run portfolios -- social media and sports -- that resonate with the large population of young Saudis whom Prince Mohammed has courted as his base. Both have sought to fire up the fierce nationalism that the prince has encouraged by pouring money into battles against rivals in stadiums or on the internet. Although neither portfolio relates to foreign affairs, foreign envoys often seek out the two men because of their influence, said Dennis Horak, the former Canadian ambassador to Riyadh who was expelled in August after other Canadian diplomats called for the release of detained rights activists. Mr. Sheikh was approachable while Mr. Qahtani ""had a much fiercer reputation,"" Mr. Horak said. The pair, he said, was ""not so much good cop-bad cop, more bad cop and lesser-bad cop."" Like Prince Mohammed, neither was well known before the prince's father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015. Both were educated inside the kingdom with scant experience abroad. Critics in the kingdom say that they sometimes failed to understand the dynamics of Western politics and culture, like when Mr. Qahtani orchestrated the plastering of billboards and trucks in London with his boss's photo during the crown prince's visit there last spring -- to the derision of Londoners unaccustomed to foreign personality cults. But each man had skills the prince treasured. Mr. Qahtani, who held an undergraduate law degree and wrote poetry, had been recruited to work in the royal court more than a decade ago. He gained a deep understanding of the royal family's secrets that members and associates of the royal family say he later exploited to help Prince Mohammed plot his rise and eliminate his rivals. He also appears to have developed an interest in hacking. As early as 2009, someone using credentials associated with Mr. Qahtani was trawling amateur hacking forums to learn about surveillance software, according to images of the posts captured by other forum members. In 2012, someone using Mr. Qahtani's government email address solicited services from the Italian spyware company Hacking Team, according emails later released by WikiLeaks. In one email, the writer sought a visit by people with ""high technical knowledge"" to ""explain the solutions you offer and training and costs."" ""Will bear all the costs of the trip from A-Z,"" the author of the email added. Mr. Qahtani has become Prince Mohammed's chief propagandist. With a Twitter following of 1.36 million users, he solicited names for a blacklist of enemies of the kingdom and then marshaled mass social media attacks against them, commanding followers his critics have called ""electronic flies."" His work has earned him the nicknames Lord of the Flies, Mr. Hashtag and ""Saudi Arabia's Steve Bannon."" Mr. Sheikh was a bodyguard in Prince Mohammed's security detail who charmed the prince with his sense of humor and intense loyalty, said associates of the royal family who know both men. Roughly the same age, they developed a personal rapport, and the prince rewarded Mr. Sheikh with a seemingly limitless budget to make the kingdom an international contender in tennis, boxing, soccer and other sports. He has welcomed wrestling legend Hulk Hogan to Riyadh and last April, he joked in the ring about keeping for himself the championship belt for the WWE's Greatest Royal Rumble. [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] In an extension of his royally financed campaign to build a sports empire, Mr. Sheikh became the honorary president of one of the most successful and popular soccer teams in Egypt, an honor widely believed to reflect heavy investments of money from the crown prince. But Mr. Sheikh resigned in a dispute with the board after just a few months and instead bankrolled his own rival franchise, Pyramid. He recruited three star Brazilian players and launched a sports channel dedicated to his team, reportedly pouring in as much as $33 million. But he complained publicly that Egyptian referees, fans and commentators were failing to appreciate his investments, and said he had asked Egypt's president to intervene. In September, a stadium of Egyptian soccer fans broke out in vulgar chants denouncing Mr. Sheikh and the Saudis, and he responded by abandoning the team. ""Strange attacks from everywhere, and a new story every day,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Why the headache?"" Mr. Sheikh also splurged last September on a $4.8 million limited edition Bugatti Chiron sports car, according to a sales contract obtained by The New York Times. The seller, the Emirati businessman Saeed Mohammed Butti Alqubaisi, declined to comment. When an entertainment program on the Saudi-owned satellite network MBC last year seemed to hint at a rumored affair between Mr. Sheikh and an Egyptian singer, Mr. Sheikh ordered the network to fire the production team, according to industry executives familiar with the case. The show remains off the air. Both men played signal roles in Prince Mohammed's rise. In June 2017, Mr. Sheikh and Mr. Qahtani were among a handful of Prince Mohammed's loyalists who forcibly detained the previous crown prince and interior minister, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, holding him overnight and threatening him until he agreed to give up his claim to the throne, according to members and associates of the royal family. In a video made the next day, Mr. Sheikh can be seen hovering behind the ousted prince as he pledges allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman. A social media campaign spread rumors that a cocaine addiction had made the ousted prince unfit to rule, and people close to the royal family said Mr. Qahtani fueled the rumors. Both men sprang into action again when Saudi Arabia led a blockade of its tiny neighbor Qatar in June 2017, over its support for political Islam. They unleashed insults and promoted hashtags bashing Qatar, and Mr. Qahtani forced MBC to stop airing Turkish soap operas because of Turkey's support for Qatar, costing the network millions in losses, according to industry executives. He also persuaded Prince Mohammed to spend more than $100,000 on American television commercials denouncing Qatar, evidently unaware of how few Americans were following the Gulf dispute. A Qatari-owned network, BeIN Sports, had acquired the exclusive rights to broadcast this year's World Cup in the Arab world. So Mr. Qahtani helped promote BeoutQ, a bootleg operation beamed from Riyadh-based Arabsat. BeoutQ ripped live events from BeIN's feed and broadcast the games without paying for rights, spurring international lawsuits. The Saudi government has denied any relationship to the pirate network. Both men also played key roles again last fall when Crown Prince Mohammed arbitrarily detained hundreds of the kingdom's richest businessmen and several of his royal cousins in a Ritz-Carlton hotel in what was billed as a crackdown on corruption -- just a few weeks after Mr. Sheikh had picked up his $4.8 million Bugatti. Both men acted as interrogators, demanding that the captives confess to corrupt self-enrichment and pledge to surrender vast sums, according to relatives and close associates of several detainees. Although blindfolded during some interrogations, detainees told relatives that they saw the two men or recognized their voices from broadcast interviews. Others said that through hotel room windows, they saw Mr. Sheikh coming and going surrounded by armed guards. Several former detainees have reported physical mistreatment during the interrogations, including beatings, electrical shocks and suspension upside down for long periods. Some have shown their family members lasting scars from the beatings and shocks, and in one case photographs of the bruises and scars have been shared with The New York Times; some of the pictures included the electronic monitoring bracelet that the government has forced released detainees to wear to track their movements. One was forced to make his consent to a forced confession with only a thumb print because he was too incapacitated to write out his signature, according to a relative informed by the detainee. Although no evidence has emerged that either man directly abused the captives, both questioned detainees who had been abused. The government of Saudi Arabia has called the allegations of physical abuse ""absolutely untrue."" A few weeks after his release from the Ritz, Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, once the kingdom's wealthiest investor, made a donation of more than a half-million dollars to a Saudi soccer club, writing on Twitter that he was ""responding to the invitation of my brother Turki al-Sheikh."" Neither Mr. Qahtani nor Mr. Sheikh have commented publicly on the killing of Mr. Khashoggi. But Mr. Qahtani, who lost his title as a royal court adviser, appears to believe his days of serving the prince are not over. After his dismissal, he tweeted his thanks to the king and crown prince for ""this great opportunity to have the honor to serve the homeland."" ""I will remain a loyal servant of my country forever,"" he added. Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and David D. Kirkpatrick from London.

Democrats Should Un-Friend Facebook,"In their recent book ""LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media,"" P.W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking describe the surprising role of online communication in spurring gang violence in Chicago. They quote Chicago Alderman Joe Moore saying that, contrary to popular belief, most gang disputes begin not with conflict over drug sales or territory, but with insults hurled on the internet. (Slang terms for online threats, the authors report, include ""Facebook drilling"" and ""wallbanging."") According to Singer and Brooking, ""80 percent of the fights that break out in Chicago schools are now instigated online."" Chicago, of course, is far from the only place where Facebook -- and social media more broadly -- seems to have acted as an accelerant to violence. United Nations investigators concluded that Facebook played a ""determining role"" in fomenting  genocidal attacks against Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims. Hate speech on Facebook incited murderous mobs in Sri Lanka; as The Times reported, ""Facebook's newsfeed played a central role in nearly every step from rumor to killing."" Social media was key to the elevation of brutal Filipino demagogue Rodrigo Duterte, and, as Bloomberg reported, his government uses Facebook as a weapon against his enemies.  Without Facebook, Donald Trump probably wouldn't be president, which is reason enough to curse its existence. The platform was an essential vector for Russian disinformation. It allowed the shady ""psychographics"" company Cambridge Analytica to harvest private user data. And Facebook helped decimate local newspapers, contributing to America's widespread epistemological derangement. [Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] In general, people trust local papers more than the national media; when stories are about your immediate community, you can see they're not fake news. Without a trusted news source, people are more vulnerable to the atmosphere of disinformation, cynicism and wild conspiracy theories in which fascism -- and Trumpism -- flourishes. Politico found that ""Voters in so-called news deserts -- places with minimal newspaper subscriptions, print or online,"" voted for Trump in higher-than-expected numbers, even accounting for employment and education. So well before The Times's blockbuster story on Wednesday about how Facebook deals with its critics, we knew it was a socially toxic force, a globe-bestriding company whose veneer of social progressivism hides amoral corporate ruthlessness. Still, it was staggering to learn that Facebook had hired a Republican opposition-research firm that sought to discredit some of the company's detractors by linking them to George Soros -- exploiting a classic anti-Semitic trope -- while at the same time lobbying a Jewish group to paint the critics as anti-Semitic. Or that C.O.O. Sheryl Sandberg, who has spent years cultivating an image as Facebook's humane, feminist face, reportedly helped cover up the company's internal findings about Russian activity on the site, lest they alienate Republican politicians. Now we're nearing something close to a progressive consensus: Facebook is bad. The question, as always, is what is to be done. In theory, there could be a bipartisan coalition against Facebook, since many conservatives also fear and resent it, believing it is biased against them. (Trump has floated the idea of using antitrust law against some of the major tech platforms to pressure them to give more exposure to right-wing voices.) Given the polarization of our politics, however, it's hard to imagine Republicans actually siding with Democrats to regulate Facebook, as opposed to simply using the threat of regulation as a cudgel. Democrats, of course, are hardly united in seeing Facebook as a problem. As The Times reported, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer -- who in 2016 received more donations from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress -- pressured Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, to back off from his pointed inquiries into the company. Sandberg, a veteran of Bill Clinton's administration, has lots of connections in Democratic politics; there were rumors she was being considered as a potential Treasury secretary in a Hillary Clinton administration. Still, there are plenty of Democrats who are ready to take on Facebook, and we can expect the new Congress to hold hearings about the exponentially expanding influence of the biggest tech platforms. The ""challenge of this enormous concentration of economic power and corresponding political power is a very serious problem facing our country,"" said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is in line to head a House subcommittee that deals with antitrust law. If Democrats can muster the will to regulate Facebook and other enormous tech companies, next comes the complicated question of how. Warner has laid out some intriguing ideas in a white paper. Among them are amending the Communications Decency Act to open platforms up to defamation and invasion of privacy lawsuits, mandating more transparency in the algorithms that decide what content we see, and giving consumers ownership rights over the data that platforms collect from them. The important thing is that there are solutions; the overweening dominance of the tech platforms need not be seen as an immutable fact of nature. ""We've seen these problems in the past,"" said Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Institute and organizer of the Freedom From Facebook coalition, which Facebook sought to smear. ""We've seen analogous types of corporations in the past."" He pointed to &#34;network monopolies&#34; like railroads, AT&amp;T and electrical utilities, saying, ""there was a period in every single instance in which the people who commanded those corporations exploited the power within them to enrich themselves and to control other people in bad ways. And in every case, America said, 'Hey, we know how to regulate this problem.'"" America once had the confidence to subdue tyrannical plutocrats. We'll see if we still do.

"A Case of 'Catfishing,' Blackmail and Sexual Abuse Rattles Norway","LONDON -- The 26-year-old man pretended to be a teenage girl to meet boys and young men on online chat forums. He called himself ""Sandra"" or ""Henriette,"" met boys from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and asked them to send explicit images and videos, prosecutors say.  When they complied, he threatened to publish the footage on YouTube if they did not keep the images coming. He talked a few into meeting in person. Then, officials said, he raped some of them. The Norwegian man -- identified only as Henrik, a soccer referee -- was charged last Friday with sexually abusing more than 300 boys in three countries beginning in 2011. The authorities found more than 16,000 explicit films of victims on the suspect's computer.  Two years after another major sexual assault case in the small Norwegian community of Tysfjord in Lapland sent shock waves through the country, the scale of the abuse in this ""catfishing"" case prompted a lawyer for the victims to describe it as ""incomparable in Norwegian legal history."" ""This is the largest case of abuses that has ever been uncovered, with an enormous scope, and harsh acts,"" Christian Lundin, the main lawyer representing victims in the case, said in an email. The case is set to go to trial on Jan. 22, with 11 lawyers representing the victims, who have not been named. 'The Problem Is the Internet' ""The indictment is 81 pages long, and it covers a range of different sexual offenses, including rape,"" Guro Hansson Bull, one of the three prosecutors handling the case, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. The large number of victims was possible because of only one thing, Ms. Hansson Bull said: the perpetrator having access to children online. ""The problem is the internet,"" she said. ""It's possible to reach so many victims through the internet."" While the issue is not unique to Norway, the country has grappled with high-profile cases of sexual abuse, like the one in Tysfjord, where officials identified more than 150 victims. In another so-called catfishing case in 2017, a 27-year- old man was convicted of online abuse in a case involving 53 girls, ages 12 to 17, whom he met via chat apps. He was sentenced to 17 years in prison. According to the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, 21 percent of Norwegian women and 8 percent of Norwegian men say they were sexually abused before the age of 18.  Thor Steinhovden, an adviser at the Norwegian think tank Agenda, says the catfishing case may be the largest incidence of online sexual abuse in Norwegian history. ""We've definitely had similar, online-related molestation cases,"" Mr. Steinhovden said in a phone interview on Friday. ""These cases have increased quite a bit in the last five to six years,"" he added.  Under Norwegian criminal law, sexual abuse over the internet is legally the same as physical sexual abuse, and the number of online sexual offenses is increasing as more young people get access to smartphones and the web, according to the authorities. Reports to the police of criminal sexual acts against children under 16 rose to 833 from 227 between 2004 and 2017, according to the Norwegian Statistical Bureau. Like the prosecutor, Mr. Steinhovden suggested that Norway's increasing cybersophistication had opened a gateway to more such cases. ""Norway has one of the highest digital competencies in the world -- 87 percent of children aged 9 to 11 have access to smartphones, and it makes them more vulnerable,"" Mr. Steinhovden said. The rate increases to 97 percent for children 12 to 14 years old, according to a report by the Norwegian Media Authority. ""We're just catching up with the side effects,"" he said, ""and the debate about whether we should regulate our use, and how we should do it, is just getting started."" 'It's the Shame' In the latest case of catfishing -- in which someone adopts a phony online personality to lure others -- only two victims initially came forward, despite hundreds of them being identified in videos and via chat logs. One boy spoke to his parents about it, the authorities said, and the mother of another boy figured it out and alerted officials. Those two complaints spurred an investigation in 2016, which concluded in June. Indictments were handed up this month.  The reluctance of victims to step forward further complicated the case; some have declined to talk to investigators even after police identified hundreds of victims, Ms. Hansson Bull said. ""I think maybe it's the shame; they're trying to minimize the case, trying not to tell,"" she noted.  Until the police approached them, some victims had not realized they were part of a scam.  ""Some victims didn't even know they were abused, even when they were threatened,"" Ms. Hansson Bull said, as the suspect was still pretending to be a girl. 300 Cases Go to Court The online abuse started in 2011, but most of the offenses in the indictment were committed from 2014 to 2016, according to Ms. Hansson Bull. During that period, 460 boys and young men, ages 9 to 18, were abused, she said, but only 300 -- ""the most severe cases"" -- were included in the indictment. The offender used messaging applications like Kik and LINE to contact victims. He persuaded the boys to send him sexually explicit images and videos. In some cases, boys were promised corresponding images from Sandra or Henriette. In others, they were threatened with public humiliation and release of the sensitive material online to get them to send him more. One boy sent Henrik 91 explicit videos, according to the indictment.  He also met about 20 boys in person, pretending to be a friend of his female alias, Ms. Hansson Bull said.  Besides sexual assault, the defendant is accused of paying some of the boys for sexual acts, which took place in his home in Fetsund, a riverside town less than 18 miles east of Oslo, Norway's capital, and in other places nearby. Some victims have asked for compensation for the abuse and the deception from the courts; the exact amount will depend on the claims victims put forward, according Ms. Hansson Bull. The suspect, in custody since 2016, faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. But if he is deemed to be a threat to society, he may be detained for life, said Ms. Hansson Bull.  Gunhild Laerum, one of his lawyers, could not be reached for comment. But she told Varingen, a local daily newspaper, ""He had an addiction to this online world.""  ""He lived a forbidden life online,"" she said, adding, ""In retrospect, he's glad he was caught,"" or he would not have been able to stop otherwise.  She said the defendant wished to apologize to his victims.  Henrik Pryser Libell contributed reporting from Oslo, Norway.  PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY  FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) "
Twitter's Caste Problem,"On Nov. 13, Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, met with several female journalists and activists in New Delhi to talk about online safety in India. Female journalists and activists from religious and cultural minorities face relentless harassment and abuse on Mr. Dorsey's platform. The meeting with Mr. Dorsey and other Twitter executives was aimed at helping them better understand the magnitude of the problem in India. My colleague Sanghapali Aruna, who runs Project Mukti, an organization that leverages technology to empower Dalits to fight caste prejudice, was among the attendees. ""Dalit,"" which means ""oppressed,"" refers to the caste of people who suffer the greatest violence, discrimination and disenfranchisement under India's caste apartheid that structures Hindu society.  When Ms. Aruna met Mr. Dorsey she had already left the platform, fearing for her safety following a Twitter doxxing incident after which she was confronted and threatened. As she shared her experiences of discrimination and intimidation on Twitter, Vijaya Gadde, the company's head of legal, policy, trust and safety, openlywept. Dalits and another Indian minorities are regularly harassed on, if not forced off, Twitter by right-wing troll armies.  Twitter's position as a platform for political discourse in India was cemented after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party famously used social media during his campaign in the 2014 national elections. Since Mr. Modi came to power, his followers have been conveying positive messages about his government, often using doctored images.  India has also seen an increase in the atrocities against minorities and incidents of religious and caste-based violence. Many blame Mr. Modi's followers, who have emerged as a majoritarian, casteist troll army for inciting hatred of India's caste and religious minorities. While most of the world understands America's troll culture and its foundations in white supremacy, it is still learning about how caste is the bedrock for India's online troll ecosystems. Dalits need to be at the table during discussions of platform accountability because our stories carry the urgency of what our people face. Whether in the real or the online world, Dalits refuse to be the canary in the coal mine for caste atrocity any longer.  It was in this fraught context that I designed a series of political posters. One that Ms. Aruna gave to Mr. Dorsey featured a woman protesting and three words: Smash. Brahmanical. Patriarchy. The Brahmins sit at the very top of the caste hierarchy and are longstanding gatekeepers of power. Their voices collectively dominate public debate and opinion in traditional and social media, extending their supremacy beyond traditional Indian institutions. The poster was a piece of Dalit resistance art, an artifact of solidarity and resilience. After the meeting in New Delhi ended, Mr. Dorsey held my poster while posing with participants for a picture. The photograph was seen as Twitter endorsing our call to end caste and patriarchy.  A fierce backlash on Indian Twitter from India's caste elites, particularly the Brahmins, followed.  Mr. Dorsey and his team were relentlessly harassed. He was smeared as a racist and accused of disrupting Indian society in the run-up to the 2019 national elections.  A campaign for Brahmins to boycott Twitter trended on Twitter.  Mr. Dorsey has my empathy. He had a fleeting taste of what it is to be a Dalit woman on Twitter. But these attacks remind us of the pervasiveness of the problem that had prompted his New Delhi visit: online safety in India. India, with almost eight million active Twitter users, is the platform's fastest growing market. An increasing number of these users are Dalits or belong to other religious, cultural and gender minorities. There are over 260 million Dalits in India, and for many, Twitter truly represented a platform where they could speak and be heard while offering an alternative to mainstream Indian media, which has scant Dalit representation. But India's entrenched structures of caste privilege and power replicated on Twitter and forced caste-oppressed communities off the platform, traumatizing many in the process. Twitter executives quickly cowed before the oppressive power of caste. After the intense Brahmin outrage and calls for a boycott, Ms. Gadde apologized for the photograph of Mr. Dorsey with my poster, saying she and her colleagues should have been more thoughtful and, ""Twitter strives to be an impartial platform for all."" The apology translated to an endorsement of deeply problematic power dynamics -- an unacceptable position given the platform's positioning as a free and open space for discussion. And given the magnitude of caste-based aggression and harassment on Twitter, its blindness to caste in India is alarming. The platform has a responsibility not to simply promote free speech but to also guarantee the freedom of expression and safety of its most vulnerable users. Coordinated attacks on vulnerable voices are shutting them out and turning Twitter into yet another tool of persecution. In the light of Mr. Dorsey's encounter with the vitriol on Indian Twitter, I hope he and his colleagues take a step back to assess, reflect and pivot. The platform urgently needs to make corrections to protect minorities in India and elsewhere in the world. There are immediate, specific measures Twitter could take. It could introduce a formal option to report caste-related abuse and hate speech. It could commission an independent assessment of the human rights risks on the platform, with particular attention to the safety, freedom of expression and privacy and experience of its most vulnerable users, and create ways to mitigate those risks. And it should dedicate resources into investigating India troll networks and the growing cost of disinformation that results from their actions. Mr. Dorsey and his colleagues also need to engage in broad consultations with governments and civil society groups, especially with representatives from gender, religious and cultural minorities. These difficult conversations will reflect a difficult reality, but they need to happen if Twitter wants to be a platform where marginalized voices can be visible and heard without fear. As one of the first Dalit women on Twitter, I long for the time when the platform meant community and sharing, not endless casteist abuse, rape and death threats. It is time for executives like Mr. Dorsey to ensure that the trolls do not and will not own the virtual public sphere.

"Where There's Bubbles, There Could Be a Bath","John Schwartz is a New York Times reporter and author of ''This Is the Year I Put My Financial Life in Order,'' coming in April. Follow him on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jswatz Sometimes life shows you what absurd really is. This is one of those times. I'm talking about the phenomenon known as Bitcoin, a monetary system based on computation, complex algorithms and -- let's face it -- communal delusion. You've probably heard about this funny money, digital tokens that can be sent securely from computer to computer, with records kept through an online accounting system known as blockchain. (My colleague Nathaniel Popper has been writing great stuff about it.)    Millions of people now have accounts with Coinbase, the leading marketplace for digital currencies. And the rush into the market has helped push prices up. At the beginning of last year, you could pick up a Bitcoin (not literally, because they're virtual, DUH) for about a thousand bucks. Its gyrations briefly brought its price near $20,000, according to Blockchain.info, which tracks such things.   So what's the problem?    Let me answer that question with a question: What do you know about tulips? Yes, I am referring to the Dutch tulip craze back in the 17th century, and the speculative bubble that preceded the stock market crash of 1929, and the dot-com boom and crash that started in the late 1990s. Remember that last one, when learned analysts told us that advancing technology had eliminated the business cycle?   Good times. No bubble is too big to burst.   But hey, no regrets! Carpe Bitcoin! (But not literally.)   Signs of a bubble seem to be everywhere in the Bitcoin world today. Companies are trying to cash in by sprinkling themselves with a little Bitcoin fairy dust. Take the company called Long Island Iced Tea, which makes, you know, tea. The price of its shares nearly doubled one day last month after it announced that it would change its name to ''Long Blockchain Corp.'' The company's announcement claimed it would ''pursue opportunities'' in blockchain technology. Which makes it sound as if some of those teas they brew are highly caffeinated. Or that people are indulging in that other kind of Long Island Iced Tea.   I called Christian Day, a professor at Syracuse University law school who has written about bubbles and panics. He said that comparing Bitcoin to the tulip craze was unfair to tulips: ''The Dutch were not as crazy as they've been portrayed.''   For one thing, the tulip bulbs were real, he said, and the hybrids that were the subject of speculation could be extremely valuable. What's more, much of the trading was done by people who knew their horticulture. With the modern techno-tulips, he said, ''I don't think there's anything there.''   Some of the most skeptical folks are experts in cryptography and computer security. Steven Bellovin, an adept in computer security and a professor at Columbia University, told me that the technology is still too buggy, ''a lab experiment that escaped into the wild.'' It's hard to trust a currency, he said, that's ''backed by the full faith and credit of software that has to be updated monthly.''   Another security expert, Matt Blaze, recently tweeted, ''Cryptocurrency somehow combines everything we love about religious fanatics with everything we love about Ponzi schemes.''   Ouch, currency guys. Well, you can afford some very expensive salves for those burns. For now.   For another point of view -- because I'm all about even-handedness, people! -- I checked with Jim Harper, executive vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He served on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and says the promise of Bitcoin is to create a payment system people can use anywhere in the world with privacy and security. He says its true value will be in commerce, not speculation.   Well, that hasn't happened yet; the price is too unstable. He said the currency will move beyond some of the early notorious uses in illegal commerce. As for the tulip comparisons, he joked, ''Laugh all you want: My initial coin offering for cryptotulips will be worth billions!''   I have discovered that the cryptocurrency revolution has reached my own family. My 22-year-old son told me that he had tried to buy a bit of a Bitcoin a few weeks ago and actually lost the money. It was his cash to spend, so there was no lecturing him about it. But I did ask why he had tried to invest in Bitcoin when he's shown little interest in, say, mutual funds.   He said that he had been unaware of the speculation in Bitcoin. Instead, he said, he was trying to use it for precisely what Mr. Harper says it will be best for: currency transactions with vendors who do not accept, for example, debit cards or PayPal.   ''What I was actually trying to do was buy porn,'' he said patiently. ''From Japan.''   As I said, he's a millennial, full of that generation's bracing honesty. I'm glad he told me, but I sure don't need to know more about the particular transaction, except for the clarifying fact that this vendor would take Bitcoin.   He said he followed the instructions and created a ''wallet'' and went to an exchange and, after entering a great deal of personal information, bought a small fraction of a bitcoin -- in fact, 0.005 of one, ''the lowest quantity you could purchase'' on the site. Then he found that he couldn't figure out how to get to his money, grew frustrated and gave up. Well, I told him, losing 70 bucks is hardly ruinous; it's more like the cost of an education.   As we discussed the aborted transaction, he grabbed his laptop and took another look at the exchange site.   ''Oh,'' he said. ''I got in.'' A calmer state of mind had led to success.   The result? ''I've got 0.00545679 Bitcoin,'' he said, reading off the screen, ''which is now worth ... $96.'' In the time the money had been locked up, it had jumped in value by about a third. ''This has been a profitable evening!''   Tell me about it. In sheer percentage terms, his little investment outperformed my 401(k)'s return for an entire year.   Now I am trying to figure out how to cash in on all of this, though without buying Bitcoin myself. It's exactly the kind of market that a fool like me might be tempted to rush into, but I've learned enough over the years to know that by the time I finally try the hot new thing, it is already cold and old. I am the maker of markets, the loser who helps to create winners.   Instead, maybe I'll just pull a Long Island Iced Tea and change my name to Blockchain Schwartz. It has a nice ring to it! But that's just a start.   I think I'll write all of my articles from now on in an encrypted form and publish them via blockchain. This means, unfortunately, that no one will be able to read them.   You may say that nobody can read your stuff anyway! You can be cruel, reader. But I say that the exclusivity and security built into my cryptoprose will make each article surge in value. Until I lose my passwords.    "
"Bubble, Bubble, Fraud And Trouble","The other day my barber asked me whether he should put all his money in Bitcoin. And the truth is that if he'd bought Bitcoin, say, a year ago he'd be feeling pretty good right now. On the other hand, Dutch speculators who bought tulip bulbs in 1635 also felt pretty good for a while, until tulip prices collapsed in early 1637. So is Bitcoin a giant bubble that will end in grief? Yes. But it's a bubble wrapped in techno-mysticism inside a cocoon of libertarian ideology. And there's something to be learned about the times we live in by peeling away that wrapping.     If you've been living in a cave and haven't heard of Bitcoin, it's the biggest, best-known example of a ''cryptocurrency'': an asset that has no physical existence, consisting of nothing but a digital record stored on computers. What makes cryptocurrencies different from ordinary bank accounts, which are also nothing but digital records, is that they don't reside in the servers of any particular financial institution. Instead, a Bitcoin's existence is documented by records distributed in many places.   And your ownership isn't verified by proving (and hence revealing) your identity. Instead, ownership of a Bitcoin is verified by possession of a secret password, which -- using techniques derived from cryptography, the art of writing or solving codes -- lets you access that virtual coin without revealing any information you don't choose to.   It's a nifty trick. But what is it good for?   In principle, you can use Bitcoin to pay for things electronically. But you can use debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, etc. to do that, too -- and Bitcoin turns out to be a clunky, slow, costly means of payment. In fact, even Bitcoin conferences sometimes refuse to accept Bitcoins from attendees. There's really no reason to use Bitcoin in transactions -- unless you don't want anyone to see either what you're buying or what you're selling, which is why much actual Bitcoin use seems to involve drugs, sex and other black-market goods.   So Bitcoins aren't really digital cash. What they are, sort of, is the digital equivalent of $100 bills.   Like Bitcoins, $100 bills aren't much use for ordinary transactions: Most shops won't accept them. But ''Benjamins'' are popular with thieves, drug dealers and tax evaders. And while most of us can go years without seeing a $100 bill, there are a lot of those bills out there -- more than a trillion dollars' worth, accounting for 78 percent of the value of U.S. currency in circulation.   So are Bitcoins a superior alternative to $100 bills, allowing you to make secret transactions without lugging around suitcases full of cash? Not really, because they lack one crucial feature: a tether to reality.   Although the modern dollar is a ''fiat'' currency, not backed by any other asset, like gold, its value is ultimately backed by the fact that the U.S. government will accept it, in fact demands it, in payment for taxes. Its purchasing power is also stabilized by the Federal Reserve, which will reduce the outstanding supply of dollars if inflation runs too high, increase that supply to prevent deflation. And a $100 bill is, of course, worth 100 of these broadly stable dollars.   Bitcoin, by contrast, has no intrinsic value at all. Combine that lack of a tether to reality with the very limited extent to which Bitcoin is used for anything, and you have an asset whose price is almost purely speculative, and hence incredibly volatile. Bitcoins lost about 40 percent of their value over the past six weeks; if Bitcoin were an actual currency, that would be the equivalent of a roughly 8,000 percent annual inflation rate.   Oh, and Bitcoin's untethered nature also makes it highly susceptible to market manipulation. Back in 2013 fraudulent activities by a single trader appear to have caused a sevenfold increase in Bitcoin's price. Who's driving the price now? Nobody knows. Some observers think North Korea may be involved.   But what about the fact that those who did buy Bitcoin early have made huge amounts of money? Well, people who invested with Bernie Madoff also made lots of money, or at least seemed to, for a long time.   As Robert Shiller, the world's leading bubble expert, points out, asset bubbles are like ''naturally occurring Ponzi schemes.'' Early investors in a bubble make a lot of money as new investors are drawn in, and those profits pull in even more people. The process can go on for years before something -- a reality check, or simply exhaustion of the pool of potential marks -- brings the party to a sudden, painful end.   When it comes to cryptocurrencies there's an additional factor: It's a bubble, but it's also something of a cult, whose initiates are given to paranoid fantasies about evil governments stealing all their money (as opposed to private hackers, who have stolen a remarkably high proportion of extant cryptocurrency tokens). Journalists who write skeptically about Bitcoin tell me that no other subject generates as much hate mail.   So no, my barber shouldn't buy Bitcoin.

Blockchain Bureaucracies,"If you buy a house in Chicago and want to register the deed, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds will accept two kinds of submissions: paper records and scanned images of paper records. No matter which option you choose, the clerks will manually type the information into the county database. Roughly once a week, someone -- for example, an addict claiming a home that actually belongs to a grandparent with dementia -- will mail in a fake document, and ''if they formatted it correctly, we have to record it,'' said John Mirkovic, the deputy recorder. ''It's one of the main reasons we're so interested in blockchain.''    Blockchain is a data structure popularized by the digital currency Bitcoin. It's also one of the biggest buzzwords in Silicon Valley, finance and government, where proponents say it can save money and increase trust in public institutions.    In 2017, more than 200 government agencies around the world, including the Department of Homeland Security, were exploring the use of blockchain, according to the Blockchain in Government Tracker compiled by the Illinois Blockchain Initiative.   Britain's National Archives is testing it for storing digital records. Australia is building a prototype system for welfare payments. Estonia is using it to secure health records, court files and wills. Dubai aims to become ''the first blockchain-powered government,'' weaving the technology into many vital systems.   [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here's what you need to know.]   ''We're throwing a lot of things at the wall right now and seeing what will stick,'' said Andrew Young, knowledge director at New York University's GovLab.   Blockchain Is a Very Broad Term   The term blockchain was first used to describe the public record that exists for every transaction on the Bitcoin network, copies of which are kept by thousands of entities around the world. Now it's used to describe a wide range of systems that incorporate cryptography or decentralized data storage.   ''I think it's important to make clear that there is no one 'blockchain,''' said Stefaan Verhulst, the co-founder of GovLab. ''What we see right now is massive experimentation in different versions of blockchain technologies that provide for different results.''   What Blockchain Could Do for Government   In theory, blockchain can save money and reduce errors by replacing workers, while adding accountability by generating a public record of all activity.   This has even greater implications for countries with low trust in government, said Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor who specializes in distributed systems.   ''If you look at a government system that is opaque, that's closed behind doors, versus one where I can inspect what's going on behind it, it's an amazing leap forward,'' Mr. Sirer said. ''It means sleeping better at night.''   Blockchain can also enable seamless transactions with people outside the jurisdiction and give residents greater control over their data, advocates say.   ''We want you to buy a house while you're lying on a couch somewhere,'' said Zeina El Kaissi, head of emerging technology at Smart Dubai, which is leading the city's blockchain initiative. ''Blockchain can make that possible.''   Dubai identified 21 uses for blockchain, including charging electric vehicles, obtaining notary services and ensuring food safety. About 12 blockchain-based services are being built, Ms. El Kaissi said.   One goal is to ensure that Dubai residents can submit documentation for common tasks, like buying a home or applying to schools, digitally and only once. The current system often requires multiple visits to government offices.   ''Today we're using human beings as data transfer tools,'' Ms. El Kaissi said. ''That's just a waste of my human life, to be honest.''   Real World Challenges   Government agencies usually aren't the first to try new technology, but the momentum around the blockchain industry has spurred adoption. It helps that some vendors are offering their services pro bono or at a discount, avoiding what is typically an arduous procurement process.   Still, there are significant challenges. The technology is immature, with problems around speed, volume and security, Mr. Sirer said. The industry is also immature, with new vendors popping up and dropping out. Finally, political bureaucracy can be a hindrance.   Some high-profile projects have stalled. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority concluded that a digital currency would ''look broadly similar to, and not clearly superior to, existing infrastructures.'' The Texas company building a blockchain-based land registry in Honduras gave up because of communication problems with officials. Isle of Man's plan to secure internet-connected devices with blockchain halted after the start-up behind it shut down because of a founder spat.   Perhaps the biggest gap between expectations and reality occurred in Sierra Leone, where the Swiss foundation Agora was widely reported to have powered the first blockchain election. This turned out to be overzealous marketing. The National Electoral Commission denounced the reports as ''fake news,'' and Agora acknowledged that it had merely been allowed to record some votes in its presidential election on a blockchain as a demonstration.   The Cook County Recorder of Deeds worked on a land registry pilot with velox.RE, a California-based start-up, as well as the New York office of the law firm Hogan Lovells, the Chicago law firm Goldberg Kohn, and Onyx Electronics of Valparaiso, Ind., all of which did the work for free. The pilot, which included creating blockchains for more than a million parcels, as well as research and encryption, took a team of nine people eight months. The system is accessible through a rudimentary website. If you look up the property status of 5801 South Ellis Avenue, for example, you will see hundreds of pairs of 64-character strings, which correspond to transactions going back to 1985.   The pilot made it clear that some foundational work is needed before Illinois can move to a blockchain land registry, Mr. Mirkovic said. Records must be digitized. Data formats must be standardized. A law must be passed to require that title transfers be registered with the government. Finally, Illinois voters recently decided to merge the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and the Cook County Clerk's office, which would delay any decision on blockchains until 2020.   The pilot also showed that the agency could solve some problems without blockchain. The pilot inspired the office's existing software vendor, Conduent, to integrate some blockchain-like concepts into its more conventional design. And in his post-mortem, Mr. Mirkovic pointed to Iowa, where land records were accurate, title insurance was cheap, and citizens could look up information in a statewide online database that did not use blockchain.   Mr. Mirkovic hopes that his office can eventually use the technology. ''I still believe the idea is too good to ignore,'' he said.   What's next   In the United States, some of the momentum around blockchain comes from a desire to attract blockchain businesses, investment and high-tech jobs. Illinois, which ran six blockchain pilots, promised to create a ''welcoming regulatory environment'' to draw companies to the state. Arizona, Delaware, Nevada, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming have passed blockchain-related laws.   Proponents in those states praised legislatures for acting quickly to keep up with technology, but Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London, is concerned that they're making bad law.   ''A bunch of states are really in a rush to pass some sort of legislation to demonstrate how crypto-friendly or tech savvy they are,'' she said.   Estimates vary as to when blockchain will have an impact in government. Dubai's goal is to have its systems running by 2020, but Mr. Sirer said it would take at least 10 years to see an improvement. ''It's definitely not a fast process,'' he said.    "
"Timothy May, 66, Agitator Who Anticipated Problems Of Privacy on the Internet","Timothy C. May, a physicist, polemicist and cantankerous advocate of internet privacy who helped start a movement aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals online, died on Dec. 13 at his home in Corralitos, Calif. He was 66. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff-Coroner's office confirmed his death but said that the cause had not yet been determined.    As the rabble-rousing leader of a group called the Cypherpunks, Mr. May, in his writings, foreshadowed and influenced many of the concerns about privacy and government control that have come to dominate the internet age.    In the one-page Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, which he wrote in 1988, Mr. May said, ''Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions.''   Much of Mr. May's writing, incorporating elements of advanced math, libertarian politics and even science fiction, was circulated by the Cypherpunks, a group he co-founded with John Gilmore and Eric Hughes in 1992. It inspired later online movements like WikiLeaks and cryptocurrency technologies like Bitcoin.   In recent years, Mr. May's legacy had been clouded by his frequent and unapologetically offensive statements in online forums. In 2003 he wrote that he would welcome a nuclear strike on Washington because it would kill ''a million criminal politicians and two million inner-city welfare mutants.''   His friends said that his troublesome views were an outgrowth of the style that had made him so influential.   ''He would try to get people's attention by saying things in a deliberately confrontational way,'' said Mr. Gilmore, who later co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.   Once he got someone's attention, Mr. May was interested in having an honest conversation, Mr. Gilmore said. ''He actually cared about the truth and about coming to understand things,'' he said.   Timothy Christopher May was born on Dec. 21, 1951, in Bethesda, Md. His father, Thomas, was in the Navy, and the family moved frequently, to California, Virginia and France. His mother, Hazel (Heden) May, was a homemaker.   Mr. May's sister, Kathleen Fox, said his unquenchable intellectual curiosity was always combined with a defiant streak. After being accepted into Mensa, the high I.Q. society, and attending its meetings, Mr. May told her that the members were a ''bunch of dummies'' and that they weren't worth his time.   Mr. May studied physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. On graduating he took a job at Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, which had been founded a few years earlier.   Only several years into the job, after the company's chips had been found to be malfunctioning, Mr. May discovered the source of the problem through a process involving radioactive alpha particles. His discovery earned him his own laboratory and an award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. But calculating that his Intel stock options could sustain him through retirement, he resigned at 34.   Mr. May set out to write a science fiction novel inspired by the evolving science of cryptography and the writings of libertarians like Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. When he struggled to bring off the novel, he turned to writing on early online forums run by groups like the Extropians and his own Cypherpunks.   As the Cypherpunks' most frequent contributor, and at the group's in-person meetings in the Bay Area, Mr. May advocated using cryptography to spread government secrets, as WikiLeaks later did, and to evade surveillance of individuals, which he believed would become more pervasive with the spread of computers.   These ideas brought the Cypherpunks into conflict with the government, which wanted to limit the spread of cryptography. But people who successfully fought to integrate cryptography into the internet in its early days, to protect the privacy of individuals, hailed Mr. May's writing as an inspiration.   ''He was ahead of the game and understood what was going to be happening and what these obscure technologies were going to bring about,'' said Steven Levy, who wrote about Mr. May extensively in the 1990s for Wired magazine and in the book ''Crypto'' (2001).   In addition to Ms. Fox, Mr. May is survived by his brother, Michael.   Mr. May kept a careful distance from the real world, leading a reclusive life. He often wrote about arming himself and waiting for government agents to show up. After the Cypherpunks faded in the early 2000s, he began expressing racist sentiments to other online groups.   Despite alienating many of his old allies, some of his ideas have recently come into vogue again with the rise of WikiLeaks and Bitcoin and the growing concerns about government surveillance.   In an interview in October with the website CoinDesk, Mr. May accused social media companies of helping to ''build the machinery of the Dossier Society,'' in which private citizens' personal information can be monitored and sold. He was also critical of the get-rich-quick mentality of the cryptocurrency industry.   ''I cannot give a ringing endorsement to where we are,'' he told CoinDesk, ''or generate a puff-piece about the great things already done.''   Susan Beachy contributed reporting.    "
Policing Cryptocurrencies Has Become a Game of Whack-a-Mole for Regulators,"The lure of quick riches has attracted a growing number of investors to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. It has also drawn scam artists. The nonprofit Anti-Phishing Working Group estimated that about $1.2 billion in cryptocurrencies has been stolen since early 2017. Just this week, the Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an emergency court order halting an initial coin offering by Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services that the agency claimed had defrauded investors out of about $21 million.    Regulators have become so concerned about misconduct that the S.E.C. even unveiled a fake website for an initial offering of HoweyCoins -- a play on a 1946 Supreme Court case that gave a broad definition of what constitutes a ''security'' -- to demonstrate just how easy it is for investors to be fooled into parting with their money.    But fighting fraud in virtual currencies has almost become a game of Whac-A-Mole for regulators and federal prosecutors, who find each new iteration seemingly a few steps ahead them.   The challenge the authorities face is that cryptocurrencies are so new that they do not fit neatly into laws that were passed decades ago prohibiting misconduct in the securities and commodities markets. It will take time for those regulations to catch up.   Bloomberg reported that federal prosecutors were working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to determine whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies. Unlike fraudulent schemes or theft from individual investors, this type of conduct cuts to the heart of the market for virtual currencies. It means that prices may not reflect any true value but instead are being driven up or down artificially by those seeking to profit.   The S.E.C.'s jurisdiction only covers investments used to help fund companies, and Bitcoin hardly fits that model. Instead, the agency has focused on companies using initial coin offerings to raise money, arguing that doing so is the same as selling stocks or bonds to investors, and therefore the complex securities registration rules must be followed.   The trading commission may have better luck policing transactions in cryptocurrencies. A decision in March by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn held that virtual currencies ''are 'goods' exchanged in a market for a uniform quality and value,'' so they come within the definition in the Commodity Exchange Act that covers ''all other goods and articles.'' That means trading designed to defraud investors or manipulate the price of a commodity is subject to civil and criminal prosecution.   The decision was the first designating cryptocurrencies as a commodity. Whether other courts will agree is an open question. Defendants are sure to challenge any charges based on violating the commodity laws. They would most likely argue that virtual currencies are a medium of exchange rather than a commodity like gold or wheat.   Even if the commodity laws apply, proving manipulation can be difficult. The government must show that the trader intended to artificially affect the price. The Federal District Court in Manhattan once explained that ''entering into a legitimate transaction knowing that it will distort the market is not manipulation -- only intent, not knowledge, can transform a legitimate transaction into manipulation.''   One challenge to proving a defendant tried to inflate (or deflate) the price of cryptocurrencies is that, unlike stocks, they are not traded on centralized exchanges. Even simply gathering information on trades may be a challenge for prosecutors and regulators trying to prove manipulation. Moreover, virtual currencies can be traded from just about anywhere on the planet, so even if there is a pattern of suspicious orders the perpetrators may be beyond the reach of federal authorities.   Still, federal prosecutors possess two powerful weapons that are not available to the financial regulators at the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C.: the mail and wire fraud statutes. These laws cover deception and schemes to defraud involving valuable property, including intangibles like Bitcoin and Ether.   Although cryptocurrency trading firms often call themselves ''exchanges,'' they are not registered with the S.E.C. or the C.F.T.C, and their clients have none of the protections afforded investors who trade stocks and commodities. If the government is serious about monitoring the markets for cryptocurrencies, it will need to require the trading firms to comply with the rules for exchanges, which include extensive record-keeping provisions.   Perhaps in a nod to the inevitability of greater regulation, Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency trading venue, is in talks with the S.E.C. about registering as a brokerage firm so that it can trade assets like Bitcoin and other tokens while complying with the securities laws. The company could create what is called an ''alternative trading system'' for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and tokens. Doing so would subject the firm to extensive capital and customer protection requirements along with oversight by the S.E.C. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra. Coinbase clients could only trade assets that are properly registered with the S.E.C., another step toward treating cryptocurrencies as subject to the registration and disclosure requirements of the federal securities and commodity law.   Although becoming a broker would be costly, Coinbase could use that status as a marketing tool by telling potential customers that they will be much safer trading through its platform rather than unregulated firms that could see assets stolen or prices manipulated. Much like car companies tout their safety measures under rules they long fought, a broker can offer much greater client protection that customers may be willing to pay for.   As the value of cryptocurrencies swing wildly and those looking to abuse their investors proliferate, it may be up to Congress to finally designate an agency to be responsible for overseeing the markets. As I proposed in February, maybe it is time to create a Crypto-Cop to bring some order to the system and combat those looking for an opportunity to cheat and steal.    "
"Trump, Treasonous Traitor","Put aside whatever suspicions you may have about whether Donald Trump will be directly implicated in the Russia investigation.  Trump is right now, before our eyes and those of the world, committing an unbelievable and unforgivable crime against this country. It is his failure to defend. The intelligence community long ago concluded that Russia attacked our election in 2016 with the express intention of damaging Hillary Clinton and assisting Trump.   And it was not only the spreading of inflammatory fake news over social media. As a May report from the Republican-run Senate Intelligence Committee pointed out: ""In 2016, cyber actors affiliated with the Russian Government conducted an unprecedented, coordinated cyber campaign against state election infrastructure. Russian actors scanned databases for vulnerabilities, attempted intrusions, and in a small number of cases successfully penetrated a voter registration database. This activity was part of a larger campaign to prepare to undermine confidence in the voting process."" And this is not simply a thing that happened once. This is a thing that is still happening and will continue to happen. As Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told the committee in February, ""Persistent and disruptive cyberoperations will continue against the United States and our European allies using elections as opportunities to undermine democracy."" As he put it, ""Frankly, the United States is under attack."" The Robert Mueller investigation is looking into this, trying to figure out what exactly happened in 2016, who all was involved, which laws were broken and who will be charged and tried. That investigation seems to be incredibly fruitful. According to Vox's tally: ""Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has either indicted or gotten guilty pleas from 32 people and three companies -- that we know of. That group is composed of four former Trump advisers, 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies, one California man, and one London-based lawyer. Five of these people (including three former Trump aides) have already pleaded guilty."" Twelve of those indictments came last week with a disturbingly detailed account of what the Russians did. As The New York Times put it: ""From phishing attacks to gain access to Democratic operatives, to money laundering, to attempts to break into state elections boards, the indictment details a vigorous and complex effort by Russia's top military intelligence service to sabotage the campaign of Mr. Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton."" Whether or not Trump himself or anyone in his orbit personally colluded or conspired with the Russians about their interference is something Mueller will no doubt disclose at some point, but there remains one incontrovertible truth: In 2016, Russia, a hostile foreign adversary, attacked the United States of America. We know that they did it. We have proof. The F.B.I. is trying to hold people accountable for it. And yet Trump, the president whom the Constitution establishes as the commander in chief, has repeatedly waffled on whether Russia conducted the attack and has refused to forcefully rebuke them for it, let alone punish them for it.  In March, the White House, under pressure from Congress, seemed to somewhat reluctantly impose some sanctions on Russia for its crimes. As CNN reported that month, Congress almost unanimously passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act last summer, ""hoping to pressure Trump into punishing Russia for its election interference."" But as the network pointed out: ""Trump signed the bill reluctantly in August, claiming it impinged upon his executive powers and could dampen his attempts to improve ties with Moscow."" Instead, Trump has repeatedly attacked the investigation as a witch hunt. Just last week at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May, Trump said:  ""I think I would have a very good relationship with Putin if we spend time together. After watching the rigged witch-hunt yesterday, I think it really hurts our country and our relationship with Russia. I hope we can have a good relationship with Russia."" Now Trump is set to pursue just such a relationship as he meets one-on-one with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday in Finland. As Trump said earlier this month at a rally: ""Will he be prepared? Will he be prepared? And I might even end up having a good relationship, but they're going, 'Will President Trump be prepared? You know, President Putin is K.G.B. and this and that.' You know what? Putin's fine. He's fine. We're all fine. We're people."" Actually, none of this is fine. None of it! Trump should be directing all resources at his disposal to punish Russia for the attacks and prevent future ones. But he is not.    America's commander wants to be chummy with the enemy who committed the crime. Trump is more concerned with protecting his presidency and validating his election than he is in protecting this country. This is an incredible, unprecedented moment.  America is being betrayed by its own president. America is under attack and its president absolutely refuses to defend it.  Simply put, Trump is a traitor and may well be treasonous.

Eight Charged In U.S. Inquiry Into 'Spoofing' On Wall Street,"Federal authorities have filed civil and criminal charges against a group of Wall Street banks and individuals that they say tried to manipulate markets in gold, silver and certain financial products, including by showing potential customers fake prices.  The actions, filed over the past several days, are part of a yearslong effort by financial regulators and the Department of Justice to stamp out behavior that gives the biggest banks an advantage over smaller market players.    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined three European banks -- Deutsche Bank, HSBC and UBS Group -- for improperly influencing the prices of precious metals futures contracts, which traders use to wager on anticipated price changes in these assets. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $30 million to settle its case; UBS is paying $15 million and HSBC $1.6 million.   The Justice Department, which worked with the commission to investigate the banks, did not take any actions against them. A Justice Department spokeswoman said its investigation was continuing.   John P. Cronan, an acting assistant attorney general, told reporters Monday that the cases against the individuals ''reflect a systemic problem'' of misconduct in the futures markets.   The market-manipulation investigation has produced some of the first financial criminal charges in the Trump administration, which has vowed to make life easier for big companies while also enforcing the law.   The penalties are smaller than those in previous market-manipulation cases brought by American and European authorities. UBS, for example, agreed to pay $1.5 billion in 2012 to settle claims it manipulated a widely used benchmark interest rate.   Spokesmen for the three banks said the banks had cooperated with the investigation and were happy that the matter was resolved.   As part of the latest investigation, prosecutors charged individual traders with trying to manipulate markets. The authorities in the United States and abroad arrested five people on Monday who they said had tried to manipulate metals and other futures markets by posting fake prices, a practice called ''spoofing.''   Some had worked at major banks, but one man, Jitesh Thakkar, ran his own trading firm in Chicago. Authorities say he wrote a computer program that helped other traders create fake prices in the markets for bets on the movements of major stock indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average.   Mr. Thakkar was arrested in Chicago and could not be reached for comment.   In all, eight people who worked at various banks and trading firms are facing criminal charges as part of the spoofing investigation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed parallel civil actions against six of them.   One, Andre Flotron, a former UBS trader from Switzerland, was arrested in September after entering the United States to visit his girlfriend. The commission filed a separate civil action against him on Friday.   Mr. Flotron's lawyer Marc Mukasey said in an email Monday, ''This new C.F.T.C. complaint is an enormous waste of taxpayers' money because the C.F.T.C. knows darn well that there is a pending criminal matter, that Mr. Flotron has long been retired from the business, and that he lives in Switzerland.''    "
Former UBS Trader Is Cleared of 'Spoofing',"A federal jury on Wednesday acquitted a former trader for the Swiss bank UBS of charges related to market manipulation, dealing a blow to a Justice Department effort to crack down on a Wall Street practice known as ''spoofing.''  Prosecutors accused the former trader, Andre Flotron, of trying to move market prices for precious metals by making offers on electronic trading systems to buy or sell gold, silver and other financial products and then quickly deleting those offers before anyone could accept them.    But after only a few hours of deliberation, a jury in United States District Court in the District of Connecticut rejected their theory, according to Mr. Flotron's lawyer Marc L. Mukasey.   Mr. Flotron's acquittal could spell trouble for similar cases brought by the United States government. In January, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against seven other people for spoofing, among the first criminal charges brought for suspected financial crimes during the Trump administration. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission simultaneously brought civil cases against a number of the former traders, including Mr. Flotron. The traders' behavior, a Justice Department official said at the time, reflected ''a systemic problem.''   The Connecticut jury decided otherwise.   ''It's a huge setback for the government,'' Mr. Mukasey said. ''We basically smacked them in the face.''   Mr. Mukasey said he planned to ask the trading commission to dismiss its civil case against Mr. Flotron.   ''While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury's verdict,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said Wednesday.   A UBS spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   Follow Emily Flitter on Twitter: @FlitterOnFraud    "
The Problem With Prosecuting 'Spoofing',"Federal prosecutors sometimes lose trials, and it is usually not considered too much of a setback. But when the loss involves only the second prosecution for a new crime called ''spoofing,'' it raises questions about how the government will pursue future cases. A former UBS precious metals trader, Andre Flotron, was acquitted by a jury in Connecticut last month after only a few hours of deliberation. Mr. Flotron had been charged with conspiracy to commit commodities fraud for allegedly placing ''trick orders'' designed to fool others into believing there was more buying or selling interest than actually existed.     The verdict shows that prosecutors will continue to struggle to prove when a trading strategy crosses the line into criminal conduct. Seven other defendants are facing spoofing charges in Chicago and Houston, and their lawyers are sure to try the same tactics that worked in defending Mr. Flotron.   The crime of spoofing was added to the criminal lexicon in the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The law prohibits ''bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution.'' Like most white-collar crimes, it revolves largely around proving the defendant's intent to affect the market by placing orders with no plan to have them filled.   The problem is that most orders in the securities and commodities markets go unfilled, so canceling orders cannot be criminal just by itself. A 2013 study by the Securities and Exchange Commission found that fewer than 5 percent of orders placed on stock exchanges were filled. So simply showing that an investor canceled trades on a regular basis may not be enough to prove the intent necessary for a spoofing violation.   The first spoofing conviction involved Michael Coscia, who was charged with creating an algorithm to enter and cancel large orders in milliseconds. Mr. Coscia would simultaneously put in small orders that would be profitable once other traders reacted to the artificial ones. In that case, the government focused on the large number of orders his algorithm generated, making his testimony that he wanted every order filled questionable. The jury returned its guilty verdict after only one hour of deliberation, showing that it found the statistical evidence of large-scale order cancellations persuasive.   The prosecution of Mr. Flotron, though, started badly for the government. Jeffrey Alker Meyer, a federal district judge in New Haven, dismissed six of the seven charges in February. The judge found that the trades identified in those charges occurred only in Chicago, where the commodities exchanges operate, so under the constitutional venue requirement no crime was committed in Connecticut. That left just the conspiracy charge.   To prove spoofing, the Justice Department relied on two traders who worked for Mr. Flotron to explain how he taught them to enter and then cancel orders to influence the direction of the commodity prices. Both testified after receiving non-prosecution agreements from the government, which meant their claims were open to question about whether they got a deal to point the finger at Mr. Flotron.   In Mr. Flotron's case, there was no algorithm or automated trading for the government to point to. Instead, his orders were placed manually, and some were kept open for up to a minute. That made it more difficult for prosecutors to show that his goal was to manipulate other traders, when there was at least a chance the order would be filled.   Adding to the government's burden, there are few mom-and-pop investors putting in orders for precious metals like gold and silver futures and other complex financial products that Mr. Flotron traded. Most transactions involve sophisticated firms that use algorithms to try to predict price movements and profit from small changes. That meant prosecutors could not offer up appealing victims as witnesses.   The elusive issue in white-collar cases is almost always intent. Spoofing puts the spotlight on distinguishing between ordinary trading activity and a pattern of order cancellations that crosses an unidentified line of criminality.   Mr. Coscia's conviction gave prosecutors greater confidence in how to prove spoofing. Mr. Flotron's acquittal raises the question of how many cancellations are too many to show an illegal intent rather than a permissible trading program.   For defendants facing charges of spoofing, that means the more they can show the human element in trading -- and how their conduct differs little from that of other players in the markets -- the greater the possibility that the jury will return a verdict in their favor.

"From Bitcoin to Russia Investigation, a Look Ahead at 2018","From the surging value of cryptocurrencies to the continuing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, developments in 2017 were hard to forecast. Who could have predicted that an article in The New York Times in October describing sexual misconduct by the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein would unleash a torrent of claims about media stars, members of Congress and the judiciary and even an N.F.L. owner? With a little trepidation, here are my thoughts on a few topics that should continue to be of interest in 2018:     Initial Coin Offerings   For those of us who remember the dot.com boom, there is a sense of déjà vu with the frenzy over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has shot up to well over $10,000 in 2017 from about $1,000, according to Coindesk. Cryptocurrencies may be all the rage, but the Securities and Exchange Commission is focusing on initial coin offerings as a potential avenue for fraud. These I.C.O.s allow companies to raise money by creating their own private digital currency through a form of online crowdfunding, with some offerings raising millions of dollars in just a few days.   A company raising money from the public by selling something whose value depends on the success of its venture sounds like a security. That is why the S.E.C. has ramped up its scrutiny of I.C.O.s to determine whether issuers are skirting the detailed -- and expensive -- disclosure requirements for dealing with investors.   If anyone is going to rain on the I.C.O. parade, it will be the S.E.C. On Dec. 1, the agency filed an emergency action in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn to stop an offering of PlexCoin, which the complaint said raised more than $15 million by promoting a return of more than 1,000 percent in a month. The S.E.C. has also filed actions for fraud involving other I.C.O.s. We should expect it to continue to crack down on companies using digital currencies to raise money without following the requirements for selling securities.   On Dec. 11, the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, issued a statement warning investors and investment professionals about the potential problems posed by I.C.O.s if they operate as unregistered securities. He pointed out that ''there is substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.''   The Mueller Investigation   How the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the presidential election will be resolved is anyone's guess. In many white-collar criminal investigations, where prosecutors start is not always where they end.   The investigation has transfixed Washington like nothing since the sprawling investigation of President Bill Clinton. Mr. Mueller's team has already obtained two guilty pleas, including one from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and indictments of President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort Jr., and a top aide.   Additionally, The New York Times reported that an investigation by the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn into the financial dealings of the family company of Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, involves a subpoena for financial records sent to Deutsche Bank. There is no direct link between that investigation and Mr. Mueller's, but when prosecutors follow the money, they can find themselves in unforeseen places. Mr. Kushner has already been interviewed by the special counsel's investigators, and what the parameters of the inquiry are remain unknown.   Defense lawyers are usually hesitant to let a client speak with prosecutors without the protection of immunity, but Washington investigations are different because even the hint of asserting the Fifth Amendment could have significant political repercussions, so everyone is proclaiming their cooperation with Mr. Mueller's office. At the same time, President Trump's political allies have been increasingly questioning the propriety and objectivity of the Mueller investigation. We should expect the veneer of cooperation to fray over the next few months, especially if the investigation moves closer to the president's inner circle.   A Friendlier Justice Department for Corporations   A persistent criticism of the Justice Department in the wake of the financial crisis was the lack of prosecutions. Few individuals were charged, and the large banks and Wall Street firms paid fines and penalties that amounted to a fraction of their current profits. One response was a new policy, announced in 2015, that required federal prosecutors investigating corporate misconduct to prioritize the prosecution of individual employees and to put pressure on corporations to turn over evidence if they wanted credit for cooperating.   There are signs that this policy might be changed to give corporations a wider berth to avoid charges. In September, Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said that the policy was ''under review and I anticipate that there may be some change to the policy on corporate prosecutions.''   No changes have been announced yet, but one indication of where federal prosecutors may be headed is a new approach to corporate cooperation in overseas bribery investigations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act imposes liability on companies and individuals who pay bribes to foreign officials to ''obtain or retain business.'' It has been used against a wide range of companies with overseas operations, resulting in multimillion-dollar fines. For instance, Wal-Mart recently disclosed it had reserved $283 million for a possible settlement of fines for bribes it had paid that were first revealed by The New York Times in 2012.   A revised policy for treating companies involved in bribery investigations issued in November presumes they will avoid liability for violations if they have ''voluntarily self-disclosed misconduct in an F.C.P.A. matter, fully cooperated, and timely and appropriately remediated'' the misconduct. In a speech announcing the changed approach, Mr. Rosenstein said: ''It makes sense to treat corporations differently than individuals because corporate liability is vicarious; it is only derivative of individual liability.''   An interesting question is whether this more lenient approach will spread to other areas, such as securities, health care and environmental violations. If companies should be treated differently, then perhaps that portends a kinder, gentler Justice Department when a corporation reports its violations.   Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous new year!    "
"To Evade Sting of U.S. Sanctions, Nations Ponder Digital Currency","SAN FRANCISCO -- Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctions. Both governments, with ambitions to create state-sponsored cryptocurrencies, are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system: a new kind of money and financial infrastructure, outside the control of any central authority, particularly the United States.    The Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish, even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors. But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructure.   What has seemed like a fringe concept is starting to gain some level of acceptance in global finance. Several of the largest central banks in the world, including the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China, have said they are looking at using the technology introduced by Bitcoin to track and issue their own digital currencies.    In Venezuela, the idea has come from the top. President Nicolás Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro, which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the government's oil and natural resources.   In Russia, officials under President Vladimir V. Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoin-like crypto ruble.   ''When it comes to state-sensitive types of activities, this instrument suits us very well,'' one of Mr. Putin's aides, Sergei Glazyev, said last month in a conversation about the crypto ruble, according to several Russian news outlets. ''We can settle payments with our business partners all over the world regardless of sanctions.''   Economists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuela's Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate. That's because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies.   That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency.   All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by many independent computers. The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authority.   That would provide a good way to get around sanctions, which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rules.   But some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hacking.   In a speech last year, a member of the German central bank's executive board, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said the bank's ''conceptual study shows that blockchain technology can be adapted to meet the current needs and requirements of the financial system.''   ''The prototype works,'' he added.   These projects, though, have been slow to move from prototype to working systems, and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcome.   None of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can control.   Mr. Maduro introduced the idea on Dec. 3 in his regular Sunday television program. He said he had been monitoring so-called cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro, which would be backed by the country's gold, oil, gas and diamond reserves.   ''To overcome the financial blockade, this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing,'' he said.   Since then, the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operation.   The Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses, but will derive their value from the government's natural resources.   The link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago. The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, has experienced in recent years because of the government's unbridled expansion of the money supply.   The boldness of the Petro plan is in proportion to Venezuela's desperate economic condition, which has officials looking for anything that could help.   ''The country is in a social crisis,'' said José Ángel Álvarez, the head of a national association, Asonacrip, that has been working with the government on the Petro. ''How do we manage to build trust? Open technology, clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin: decentralization, for example.''   Mr. Álvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018.   But the link between the currency and the government's oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors, given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr. Maduros's government.   There is a measure of irony in the government's interest in cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years, Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr. Maduro's government.   An online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bolívar, which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation. This year, the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold, according to Chainalysis, a data analysis firm.   The Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activity.   Randy Brito, the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela, said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities -- more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until now.   In most cases, buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela. That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the country.   Mr. Brito, who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain, said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial system.   ''The irony is in front of us,'' he said. ''They have been blockaded by the U.S., just like they blockade their own people from operating.''   The Russian government has also not looked kindly upon its citizens' use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. While the government's policies have remained opaque, officials with the Russian Central Bank have talked about blocking the access of people inside the country to virtual currency websites, and Mr. Putin has pointed out the many potential illegal uses of the technology.   ''First and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim,'' he said in October.   But Mr. Putin has indicated that he is open to potential uses of the technology that would be under his control. In June, he had a much publicized conversation with Vitalik Buterin, the creator of one of the largest virtual currency networks, Ethereum. Mr. Buterin was raised in Canada and has dual Russian and Canadian citizenship.   A number of officials with the central bank and the Ministry of Communication have dropped hints about the creation of some sort of crypto ruble.   The efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better. But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctions.   The Russian minister of communications, Nikolai Nikiforov, said in October that a crypto ruble would be designed quite differently from Bitcoin, with no need for the mining process through which Bitcoins are released into the world.   Such a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions, which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as well.   The authorities in the United States have long been aware that virtual currencies might be used to evade sanctions. David S. Cohen, a Treasury official focused on terrorism and financial intelligence, said in 2014 that the American authorities were not seeing any widespread efforts to get around sanctions with virtual currencies.   But, he said at the time, ''these are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.''

Should You Buy Bitcoin? Ask a Different Question First,"Carl Richards, a certified financial planner, is the author of ''The Behavior Gap'' and ''The One-Page Financial Plan.'' His sketches and essays appear weekly. Have a question for him that he can answer in this column, with a customized sketch? You can submit it here. Follow him on Twitter: @behaviorgap I received these two messages within three minutes of each other recently: Several years back I used to mine Bitcoin, and then I sold most of them off for a down payment for our house. I had 400 BTC at one point, which would be worth $6.8 million today. Needless to say, I am really depressed now. I only kept one Bitcoin. I should have kept more.    And this one:    My husband has invested in Bitcoin, and my son has invested in Etherium! I am debating about switching my 401(k) to Bitcoin.   Everyone, including my mother, is wondering if they should buy Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. And since everyone is asking, there are plenty of semi-informed people providing answers. But if you try to find a solid answer to this question, you will probably just end up more confused. Answering the question means guessing where the price of Bitcoin is headed, and nobody who is being honest actually knows.   So may I humbly suggest that asking if we should all buy Bitcoin is the wrong question, and that we should ask a different one instead. The question we should be asking ourselves is this: Does buying Bitcoin fit into my investment plan?   That is a much more important question and one that we can all answer much more easily. It places the attention on the process of investing correctly and not on the outcome of events that we have no control over.   In order to answer the investing plan question, it might help to clarify a few things.   Investing is different from speculating or gambling. Investing is a means to an end, and that end is our collective financial goals. Beating the stock market, buying what's hot, outperforming a brother-in-law -- those are not financial goals. Financial goals are things like having money to send kids to college, buying a house, taking a trip or retiring someday. This is why we invest.   If we start by declaring that certain important goals are the reasons we are investing, then we can move on to figuring out the investment process that can help us meet those goals while taking the least amount of risk. The moment we start down that road, we run into the closest thing we have in finance to the law of gravity: diversification.   Investors do not put all their eggs in one basket. That's something speculators do. Our financial goals are important, and the consequence of failure are high. So we spread our risk out by diversifying across lots of different types of investments, like stocks and bonds and real estate, both in the countries where we live and far away. We choose each one carefully based on how it interacts with the others in our portfolio.   This is what the process of investing looks like. And yeah, it can be a little boring. But it is far better than repeatedly getting our teeth kicked in from buying high and selling low, which is often what happens when we chase the latest shiny thing that's grown in value exponentially or that Peter Thiel is betting on.   So this isn't really about Bitcoin at all. Just like it wasn't about real estate in 2007, or internet stocks in 1999. This is about investing versus something else we typically call gambling or speculating. It's not about where Bitcoin is going, or what we might have missed out on over the last year. All of that is out of our control.   What is in our control is the process of identifying goals, building a portfolio that matches those goals and then maintaining it for a very long time (even when it's scary, or hard) so we can achieve those goals.   So no, I cannot tell you if you should be buying Bitcoin. But I can urge you to ask a very different question.    "
Digital Money Pushes Into India,"ALIGARH, India -- Signs and banners for Paytm, India's biggest digital payments service, festoon Pooran Singh's cellphone shop, where people drop in all day to add data or talk time to their prepaid phones. Yet few of these people actually use Paytm at the store, which straddles two dusty streets in this sleepy north Indian city in which tractors jostle with cows for space on the narrow roads.    ''People recharge in cash,'' Mr. Singh said, after a young man handed him 20 rupees, about 32 cents, to top up his mother's phone.   The scene in Mr. Singh's shop underscores a persistent reality of India's economy: People prefer cash for most routine transactions, despite intensive efforts by the government and global technology companies to lure them onto digital platforms.    India's reluctance to give up paper money poses challenges for the firms that are vying to offer electronic payments, including local players like Paytm, which has received financing from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and American tech companies, like Facebook, Google and PayPal.   ''Cash is convenient,'' said Caesar Sengupta, who oversees Google's products for emerging markets. ''It's anonymous. You can use it everywhere.''   Even so, tech companies see India's low rate of digital payments as an opportunity. They all cite China, where in just a few years, mobile payments became so popular that it is now difficult to get through the day with cash alone.   ''In India, we're going to see a similar rise,'' Mr. Sengupta said in November, shortly after Google introduced Tez, a payments app for India.   One reason for tech companies' optimism is that digital payments in India have increased over the past year. The value of transactions using digital wallets, the business on which Paytm was built, rose 64 percent from December 2016 to December 2017. Transactions made with the Unified Payments Interface, a government-backed technology used by Tez and many other mobile apps, went from virtually nothing a year ago to $2.1 billion last month.   Leading India's budding payments shift are Paytm and its chief executive, Vijay Shekhar Sharma.   Mr. Sharma founded the company seven years ago as a way for cellphone users to pay their bills online. It is now India's largest consumer-payments app, with 302 million account holders and 90 million active users.   Customers can use it to buy goods at physical stores, book movie or airline tickets, send money to each other or order items from Paytm's online mall. A transaction requires a quick scan of a merchant's bar code or a few taps on a smartphone, rivaling Apple Pay or Venmo in simplicity.   Mr. Sharma aspires to put his company at the center of Indians' financial lives, and he has pledged to spend $1.9 billion over the next two years toward that goal.   ''Our truest ambition is for Paytm to be known as the bank for this new-age, digital, mobile world,'' he said in an interview at the company's headquarters in Noida, just outside Delhi.   Merchants like Mr. Singh are crucial to Paytm's plans.   The company pays Mr. Singh a bounty of 20 rupees for each of the eight or so customers he signs up each month, with additional payments if a newcomer continues to use the service. He earns an additional 18 rupees each time he verifies the identity of an existing Paytm user with his fingerprint scanner, a new requirement imposed by the government on all digital wallet companies.   Mr. Singh's phone shop has also become a virtual A.T.M. for Paytm's nascent banking division, which plans to turn 100,000 shops across India into mini-branches where customers can deposit and withdraw cash, get a loan and buy insurance policies.   ''We really want to reach the underserved, underbanked customer,'' said Renu Satti, who leads the Paytm bank.   Paytm's strategy dovetails with the goals of India's central government. Narendra Modi, who became prime minister in 2014, has sought to recast his country as ''digital India,'' and his government has heavily promoted cashless transactions.   In November 2016, Mr. Modi suddenly banned most of India's currency. The edict forced people to exchange their rupees for new notes at banks, setting off a short-term cash crunch and prompting many Indians to consider digital options.   Still, the country's cash economy has endured.   Only one-third of India's 1.3 billion residents have access to the internet. Of those who are able to go online, just 14 percent make mobile payments at least once a week, according to Kantar TNS, a research firm based in London.   Consumer trust is a big issue. Ghani Khan, who was finishing a snack with his wife at Aligarh's lone McDonald's, said that someone had once stolen 3,300 rupees, what would be about $52 now, from his Paytm account.   ''People feel scared to use these apps,'' Mr. Khan said. Although he got his money back, he now avoids payment apps, preferring to use cash or his debit card. (Paytm says that most such problems are related to thieves who call users and persuade them to turn over sensitive account data.)   Merchants also worry that officials are promoting digital transactions as a way to better track commerce -- and collect more taxes.   Anusheel Shrivastava, a top Kantar executive in India, said his firm found that 6 percent of mobile phone users made at least one digital transaction a day in 2017, up from 2 percent in 2016.   That number is likely to increase further when WhatsApp, the messaging service owned by Facebook, adds payments to its service in the next few months.   Paytm stands out in part because of the 10,000 employees that it has in the field to help new businesses use the service, educate existing ones about new features and troubleshoot problems. There are about six million merchants in its network, from giant multinationals like Uber to tiny neighborhood sweet shops.   ''We have to train them, we have to retrain them, we have to visit them,'' said Yashwin Gupta, who oversees a team of 65 Paytm representatives in the region that includes Aligarh. ''That's our daily job.''   The job is getting easier now that Paytm is better known.   Last month, Mukesh Gupta sought Paytm's help in setting up the service for his toy shop here after 10 to 20 percent of his customers asked to pay with Paytm. ''People like to spend money on more than just needs,'' he said.   Aligarh, with 1.2 million residents, is a barometer for Paytm's progress because it's a midsize city, and because Mr. Sharma, the company's chief executive, grew up nearby.   On one visit home, he said, he met a Hindi-speaking merchant who did not know how to get money out of Paytm and into his bank.   The problem? Paytm's app for merchants was in English, and the icons were not clear enough for those who did not speak the language. Paytm soon developed a Hindi version.   In recent months, skeptics have questioned whether Paytm can maintain its growth. The new regulations requiring customer verification could turn off some customers. The company is also spending heavily on incentives, such as giving cash back on certain purchases and free credit-card processing for merchants.   Mr. Sharma said such expenses were necessary investments.   ''The only way to grow digital transactions is to make them free,'' he said. ''This is a culturally different country being built.''

Kodak Last-Gasp Hope: KodakCoin,"What do you get when you cross the feverish world of cryptocurrencies and a faded industrial giant desperate for a new lease on life? The answer, provided Tuesday by Eastman Kodak, is KodakCoin.  Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after fumbling the shift to digital images. Now, the company is betting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering intended to help photographers sell their work. The announcement more than doubled Kodak's stock, but it's unlikely to do anything like the same to the company's sales or profit.    Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., emerged from bankruptcy in 2013, relieved of much of its debts and patents. It refocused around digital printing, packaging and a legacy film business that's a shadow of the glory days when Paul Simon had a hit song rhapsodizing about Kodachrome. None of those has caught on. Sales fell by a third in the first three years after bankruptcy. They dropped another 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, to $1.1 billion, and the bottom line dipped into the red. The company's market capitalization, nearly $30 billion at its peak in the late 1990s, fell to just $135 million early this week.   The announcement of the planned blockchain platform and initial coin offering changed the stock's trajectory. Kodak is just the latest to see the potential halo effect of cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin soared some 14-fold in 2017. In December, shares of the tiny Long Island Iced Tea tripled after it renamed itself Long Blockchain.   Start-ups raised more than $3 billion with initial coin offerings last year, led by Filecoin, a blockchain data-storage network that raked in $257 million. Yet the field is growing crowded. ICO Alert lists roughly 80 offerings in the market and a similar number planned in the next two months.   Jeffrey J. Clarke, Kodak's chief executive, will take whatever he can get. The company has been looking for assets to sell to pay down some of its $845 million in debt, according to Eikon data. A blockchain platform could give photographers a better way to license their images and receive payment. But it's hard to see how that will reverse Kodak's decades-long decline.

Meet Your Masters,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Recently the founder of something called Ripple briefly became richer than Mark Zuckerberg. Another day an anonymous donor set up an $86 million Bitcoin-fortune charity called the Pineapple Fund. A Tesla was spotted with a BLOCKHN license plate. There's a surge in people looking to buy Bitcoin on their credit cards. After the Long Island Iced Tea company announced it would pivot to blockchain, its stock rose 500 percent in a day. In 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it's over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys.     The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends -- developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks -- who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order.   The goal may be decentralization, but the money is extremely concentrated. Coinbase has more than 13 million accounts that own cryptocurrencies. Data suggests that about 94 percent of the Bitcoin wealth is held by men, and some estimate that 95 percent of the wealth is held by 4 percent of the owners.   There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize.   They also remember who laughed at them and when.   James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether.   ''One like,'' he said, pointing to his phone. ''It got one like.''   Inside the Crypto Castle   Whether it's all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There's an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers.   Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn't have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week.   ''I do I.C.O.s. It's my thing,'' he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. ''It's me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.''   An initial coin offering is a way to raise money: A company creates its own cryptocurrency and investors buy into the new coin, without actually buying a stake in the company. Mr. Gardner led an I.C.O. for his start-up Augur, creating an ''Augur token'' that he then sold to raise real world money. These tokens sold fast, and it is one of the forces that kicked off this boom. For a time, the value of Augur, a market-forecasting start-up with few customers, exceeded $1 billion.   About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and some of Mr. Gardner's tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. He recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party. ''You can I.C.O. anything,'' he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising $75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced ''awesome''). He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes.   ''They're going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,'' he said. ''But for me, it's too early in my career to check out.''   He wears a bracelet from his Burning Man camp (Mayan Warrior) and a necklace that is a key on a chain. ''I was given this necklace and was told my net worth would go up, and it's gone up six x since then,'' he said.   He drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all.   A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he'd ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: ''Probably not,'' he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he's skeptical that it can add to his life.   ''I literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,'' he said.   A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest.   ''Nothing feels real, it doesn't feel real,'' he said. ''I'm ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I'll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.''   Enter the Crypto Crackhouse   Nearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse.   Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital.   ''My neurons are fried from all the volatility,'' Mr. Hummer said. ''I don't even care at this point. I'm numb to it. I'll lose a million dollars in a day and I'm like, O.K.''   His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, 'The Lizard of Wall Street,' with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, ''memento mori,'' to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse.   ''The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,'' Mr. Hummer said. ""It's almost like the ultimate short trade.''   Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency.   He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn't give specifics other than to say he'd quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There's a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they'll be targeted and robbed since there's no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don't know how much they've made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course.   ''It's unforgiving,'' Mr. Buttram said. ''You make one mistake and it's all gone.''   They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency's founder frequently appears in fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini. Mr. Buttram says he's renting an orange Lambo for the weekend. And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin ''B'' necklace encrusted with diamonds that he had made. Otherwise, HODL.   This is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, ''hold'' typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD -- fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don't really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically.   ''HODL when everyone has FUD,'' Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. ''This will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.''   He knows this is strange.   ''When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,'' Mr. Hummer said. ''It's just a different level of consciousness.''   The tone turns somber.   ''Sometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,'' Mr. Buttram said.   Mr. Hummer said, ''A bomb would set back civilization for years.''   A few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder's apartment.   James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for ''going full YOLO'' and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him.   ''I'm taking over her education,'' Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms.   Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers.   ''It's the entire world reorganizing itself,'' Mr. Fickel said. ''We could get rid of our armies because for the first time you'll have people saying, 'I want to vote for a global order.' It's the internet waking up -- it's the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That's the blockchain.''   Mr. Hummer is skeptical.   ''All I know is the price of ether is going to go up,'' Mr. Hummer said.   At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel's personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum.   ''I'm retired, man,'' Mr. Chen said. ''I'm moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.''   ''Don't say I'm retired,'' he added. ''I'm going into business now. I'm going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.''   Nearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group.   ''Obviously the bubble's going to burst and everyone's going to need a lawyer,'' she said.   The Bitcoin Meetup Group Throws a Party   At the annual San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup Party, hundreds gathered under the fluorescent lights of a co-working space, and there was a line out the door. The waiting list had to be told not to show up. Many there wore Bitcoin- and Ethereum-themed clothes from Hodlmoon, which sells unisex cryptocurrency sweaters.   Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He's part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology.   ''The technology still needs time to evolve,'' Mr. Wuille said. ""This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can't fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.''   He said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. ''I tell them I have no idea,'' he said. ''I don't know!''   ''There's so many people rushing into the space, if it's a bit of speculation, I'm O.K. with that,'' said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. ''But we can't guarantee the website's going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.''   As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy -- Arya Bahmanyar, 28 -- was getting ready to perform.   Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (''you think I would dress up like this if I wasn't?''). ''Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture -- not inside crypto, and we've got to change that,'' he said.   He pointed to his outfit -- a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes -- and said, ''It's gold, right? It's gold. It's a niche, and I'm going to fill it.''   He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called ''Lambo Party'' and another called ''Cryptomom,'' about ''all these moms are pumping in their children's savings accounts.''   Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news.   She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, ''Cinemark, the best seats in town.'' She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn't support her.   ''Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,'' she said. ""And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.''   She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this.   ''And maybe I'm going to lose it,'' she said. ''Maybe I'm going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.''   She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.    "

"When Trading in Bitcoin, Keep the Tax Man in Mind","Bitcoin may grab headlines when it skyrockets in value, as it did much of last year, or when it plunges precipitously, as it has this week. But the virtual currency has a reputation for providing a sense of anonymity to those who own it.    That anonymity doesn't extend to the tax authorities, however.   Come April, people who have bought and sold Bitcoin -- or any of the other digital currencies that have quickly sprouted across the web -- will be expected to report any profits on their federal tax returns.   Considering Bitcoin's jump of more than 1,500 percent last year, there are probably many people who logged gains or losses for the first time, as people rushed in with the irrational exuberance of the early dot-com days.    But how much tax you owe will depend on how and when you acquired the digital currency -- which, in fact, isn't treated as a currency at all. Instead, for tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service views Bitcoin and its cryptocoin cousins as property.   For the most part, that means Bitcoin and other digital currencies will be treated similarly to an investment like stocks -- but not always. Given the speed at which these currencies have caught on -- Bitcoin was released only in 2009 -- regulators haven't quite kept pace. The I.R.S. issued basic guidelines in 2014 for digital currencies, but tax experts say some of the rules are subject to interpretation.   Other aspects, however, are quite clear.   ''Every time you transfer a cryptocurrency, you might trigger a gain and pay a tax,'' said Selva Ozelli, a tax lawyer and accountant who has recently written about the tax implications of virtual currencies.   In late 2016, the I.R.S. made it clear that it was searching for cryptocurrency tax evaders: The agency sent a broad request to Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, requesting records for all customers who bought digital currency from the company from 2013 to 2015.   Coinbase balked, but a court ruled that it must provide the records of roughly 14,000 customers, fewer than 1 percent of its patrons, who made transactions involving more than $20,000 of virtual currencies.   ''If you play audit roulette, you are a fool,'' said Daniel Morris, an accountant with expertise in digital currencies. ''If you made a single trade or more, report it.''   Here are some basics about the tax implications of virtual currency:   I sold some Bitcoin last year. What do I need to do?   If you are holding Bitcoin as an investment, any gains or losses on the sale are treated as capital assets, like a stock or bond. The gain or loss is calculated against the market value of the currency when you acquired it (known as your basis).   If you held the currency for more than a year, you qualify for the less onerous long-term capital gains rates (generally 0, 15 or 20 percent). Short-term gains, from digital coins held for a year or less, are taxed as ordinary income.   As on the stock market, losses can be used to offset capital gains, subject to certain rules, and losses that are not used to offset gains can be deducted -- up to $3,000 -- from other kinds of income. Unused losses can be carried over to future years.   I bought a computer (or another product or service) using Bitcoin. Are there tax implications?   The short answer: Yes.   More than 100,000 merchants worldwide accept Bitcoin, including big companies like Microsoft and Expedia, according to a 2017 report from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, a tax software and analysis firm.   So, for instance, if you bought Bitcoin as an investment in  late 2013, when it was trading at around $1,000, and used it to buy a car when the currency was trading at $18,000, you would have a long-term capital gain of $17,000, explained Ryan Losi, an accountant and executive vice president at Piascik, a tax firm.   Likewise, if you suffer a loss, that should also be reported on your tax return.   I've successfully 'mined' Bitcoins. Now what?   All Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger maintained by a decentralized network of computers. Mining refers to the process in which new Bitcoins are created and then awarded to the computers that are the first to process these transactions coming onto the network. The people whose computers do this most quickly collect a fresh helping of Bitcoins.   These virtual miners must report the fair market value of the currency (on the day they received it) as gross income. Miners are also required to pay self-employment tax -- that is, Social Security and Medicare taxes -- if the mining ''constitutes a trade or business,'' according to the I.R.S.   I was paid in Bitcoin. Are there any special tax consequences?   Receiving wages from an employer in a virtual currency is like being paid in dollars: It is taxable to the employee, must be reported by the employer on a Form W-2 and is subject to federal income tax withholding, according to Wolters Kluwer.   Independent contractors paid in digital currency must also treat that as gross income and pay self-employment taxes.   What if I paid someone else in Bitcoin for their services?   When you pay an independent worker (not on your payroll) in excess of $600 for services performed for your ''trade or business,'' that should be reported to the I.R.S. and the person receiving the payment (generally using Form 1099-MISC). The same rules apply when an individual is paid in virtual currency with an equivalent value.   Can I reduce my tax bill by donating my cryptocoins?   Potentially. Only people who itemize their tax returns can deduct their charitable contributions. But under the new tax code, far fewer people are likely to itemize starting with their 2018 return.   For those who still itemize, it may be possible to directly donate their Bitcoin (or Ether, etc.), just as they can directly donate, say, highly appreciated stock -- as long as the charity accepts it.   For example, Fidelity Charitable, a donor-advised fund, allows people to give money, take a tax deduction in the same year, and then invest and allocate the money to select charities over time. Fidelity Charitable collected roughly $22 million in Bitcoin donations through early December; it works with Coinbase, the exchange, to immediately turn the Bitcoin or Ether into cash, which is then invested as its donor wishes.   Will I receive any tax forms from my exchange? Do I have to track my own transactions?   Generally speaking, brokers and exchanges are not yet required to report cryptocurrency transactions to the I.R.S., as they do when you sell a stock at a profit or loss (and you receive a 1099-B or a 1099-DIV for a mutual fund).   But you will need to keep track of every move you make. Coinbase, for example, refers you to your account transaction history for records to compute your gains and losses; it also provides customers a ''cost basis for taxes'' report.   One of the most common questions TurboTax received from its users was how and where to report their virtual currency transactions, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, an accountant with TurboTax. (Use Form 8949 to add it all up, and report it on Schedule D, along with any other capital gains.)   Does the new tax bill change any of this?   The bill eliminated what some interpreted to be a tax break for virtual currency holders. Under the old rules, some cryptocoin investors applied a legal maneuver often used with real estate investments to defer their capital gains. Under what is called a 1031 exchange, taxpayers can sell one property and defer taxes as long as the proceeds were reinvested in a similar, or ''like-kind,'' property and met certain requirements.   The I.R.S. didn't say this strategy could be used with virtual currencies, but some tax experts argued that it was a reasonable -- albeit debatable -- interpretation since the coins were considered property. Now that the tax legislation limits the use of 1031 exchanges to real estate, they no longer apply, accountants said.   So ... should I finally buy Bitcoin?   Carl Richards, a certified financial planner, recently suggested asking yourself a different question: Does Bitcoin fit into my investment plan?   Warren E. Buffett said he believed the cryptocurrency story would end badly, while Abigail Johnson, chief executive officer of Fidelity, called herself a believer.   Whatever you decide, never gamble more than what you can afford to lose -- and you'll need to report it.    "
Powering Bitcoin,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Creating a new Bitcoin requires electricity. A lot of it. In the virtual currency world this creation process is called ''mining.'' There is no physical digging, since Bitcoins are purely digital. But the computer power needed to create each digital token consumes at least as much electricity as the average American household burns through in two years, according to figures from Morgan Stanley and Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry.    The total network of computers plugged into the Bitcoin network consumes as much energy each day as some medium-size countries -- which country depends on whose estimates you believe. And the network supporting Ethereum, the second-most valuable virtual currency, gobbles up another country's worth of electricity each day.   The energy consumption of these systems has risen as the prices of virtual currencies have skyrocketed, leading to a vigorous debate among Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts about burning so much electricity.    The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, is leading an experiment with a more energy-efficient way to create tokens, in part because of his concern about the impact that the network's electricity use could have on global warming.   ''I would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus's worth of electricity consumption to global warming,'' Mr. Buterin said in an interview.   But many virtual currency aficionados argue that the energy consumption is worth it for the grander cause of securing the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks and making a new kind of financial infrastructure, free from the meddling of banks or governments.   ''The electricity usage is really essential,'' said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at Coin Center, a group that advocates for virtual currency technology. ''Because of the costs, we know the only people participating are serious, that they are economically invested. That creates the incentives for cooperation.''   This dispute has its foundations in the complex systems that produce tokens like Bitcoin; Ether, the currency on the Ethereum network; and many other new virtual currencies.   All of the computers trying to mine tokens are in a computational race, trying to find a particular, somewhat random answer to a math algorithm. The algorithm is so complicated that the only way to find the desired answer is to make lots of different guesses. The more guesses a computer makes, the better its chances of winning. But each time the computers try new guesses, they use computational power and electricity.   The lure of new Bitcoins encourages people to use lots of fast computers, and lots of electricity, to find the right answer and unlock the new Bitcoins that are distributed every 10 minutes or so.   This process was defined by the original Bitcoin software, released in 2009. The goal was to distribute new coins to people on the Bitcoin network without a central institution handing out the money.   Early on, it was possible to win the contest with just a laptop computer. But the rules of the network dictate that as more computers join in the race, the algorithm automatically adjusts to get harder, requiring anyone who wants to compete to use more computers and more electricity.   These days, the 12.5 Bitcoins that are handed out every 10 minutes or so are worth about $145,000, so people have been willing to invest astronomical sums to participate in this race, which has in turn made the race harder. This explains why there are now enormous server farms around the world dedicated to mining Bitcoin.   This process is central to Bitcoin's existence because in the process of mining, all the computers are also serving as accountants for the Bitcoin network. The algorithm the computers solve requires them to also keep track of all the new transactions coming onto the network.   The mining race is meant to be hard so that no one can dominate the accounting and fudge the records. In the 2008 paper that first described Bitcoin, the mysterious creator of the virtual currency, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote that the system was designed to thwart a ''greedy attacker'' who might want to alter the records and ''defraud people by stealing back his payments.'' Because of the mining and accounting rules, the attacker ''ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules.''   The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going. Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work.   But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it.   For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble -- or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments -- any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it.   But Bitcoin aficionados counter that it has allowed for the creation of the first financial network with no government or company in charge. In countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina, Bitcoin has sometimes provided a more stable place to park money than the local currency. And in countries with more stable economies, Bitcoin has led to a flurry of new investments, jobs and start-up companies.   ''Labeling Bitcoin mining as a 'waste' is a failure to look at the big picture,'' Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog. The jobs alone, he added, ''are a direct, measurable and positive impact that Bitcoin already made on the economy.''   But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use.   Mr. de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example.   ''Visa is more centralized,'' Mr. de Vries said. ''If you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive. But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.''   The figures published by Mr. de Vries have been criticized by Mr. Bevand and other Bitcoin fans, who say they overstate the energy costs by a factor of about three. Many critics add that producing and securing physical money and gold also require lots of energy, in some cases as much as or more than Bitcoin uses.   Mr. Van Valkenburgh, of the Coin Center, has argued that Bitcoin miners, who can do the work anywhere, have an incentive to situate themselves near cheap, often green energy sources, especially now that coal-guzzling China appears to be exiting the mining business. Several mining companies have opened server farms near geothermal energy in Iceland and hydroelectric power in Washington State.   But the concerns about electricity use have still hit home with many in the industry. The virtual currencies known as Ripple and Stellar, which were created after Bitcoin, were designed not to require electrically demanding mining.   Perhaps the biggest change could come from the new mining process proposed by Mr. Buterin for Ethereum, a process that some smaller currencies are already using. Known as ''proof of stake,'' it distributes new coins to people who are able to prove their ownership of existing coins -- their stake in the system. The current method, which relies so heavily on computational power, is called ''proof of work.'' Under that method, the accounts and people who get new coins don't need existing tokens. They just need lots of computers to take part in the computational race.   Energy concerns are not the only factor encouraging the move. Mr. Buterin also believes that the new method, which is likely to be rolled out over the next year, will allow for a less centralized network of computers overseeing the system.   But it is far from clear that the method will be as secure as the one used by Bitcoin. Mr. Buterin has been fiercely attacked by Bitcoin advocates, who say his proposal will lose the qualities that make virtual currencies valuable.   Mr. Van Valkenburgh said that for now, throwing lots of computing power into the mix -- and the electricity that it burns -- was the only proven solution to the problems Bitcoin solves.   ''At the moment, if you want robust security, you need proof of work,'' he said.    "
The View From the Bitcoin Bubble,"Five years ago, I wrote my first article about virtual currencies, documenting the sizable stockpile of Bitcoins that the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, had amassed. At the time, I figured Bitcoin would be a flash in the pan, with roughly the life span of pet rocks or Furbys. But neither Bitcoin nor the Winklevii, as they're known, has withered under the unending stream of skepticism. The value of a single Bitcoin is now up more than 11,000 from when I wrote that first story, and the brothers have become billionaires, at least on paper. I have continued writing about Bitcoin throughout its remarkable rise, but I could have never anticipated the way the technology has broken out over the past year, with everyone from Vladimir Putin to mom-and-pop investors in South Korea looking at how to use and profit from the technology.  (Most recently, I wrote about the enormous electricity consumption of the network of computers supporting Bitcoin, which now uses as much energy as some medium-sized countries.) These developments have been enough to turn me, over the last year, into essentially a full-time cryptocurrency reporter. It's safe to say that's a first for The Times. Before this all began, I was covering financial markets and banks from New York. That gave me a grounding to begin understanding this, but Bitcoin has turned into a very different kind of financial market. At the banks, I kept hearing about how they were taking this technology seriously as something that might change their business in the long run. That is because beneath the digital tokens, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of crowdsourced financial infrastructure, known as the blockchain, that allows for the creation of money and financial records that aren't maintained by any central authority like a bank or a government. Claims about Bitcoin's longevity differ dramatically. If you listen only to virtual currency aficionados, you would think that digital money is certain to dethrone the dollar as the global reserve currency and kill Wall Street, to boot. I get dozens of emails every day from entrepreneurs who tell me how they are going to use the technology introduced by Bitcoin to revolutionize the music industry, or shipping business, or even democracy itself. Meanwhile, very smart people like Warren Buffett and Joseph Stiglitz have continued to say that the whole thing is just a bubble waiting to burst. How is a single journalist supposed to work through it all? It can feel a bit like being there at the invention of the stock market, but with no certainty that stocks would actually work as promised -- and with everything hinging on software that few people understand. Certainly one part of this requires understanding the technical details of how Bitcoin and other digital tokens work. The time I've spent grappling with the inner workings of virtual currencies has given me a sense of why so many computer scientists see the Bitcoin network as real technological innovation and not just a token that people buy and sell. I have a good stable of geeks who help walk me through the details when I get confused. And when I go to dinner parties it comes in handy -- everyone these days wants to talk about how Bitcoin works and whether it is a bubble. But from that first article about the Winklevoss twins, I have tried to focus, whenever possible, on the real people who are buying and using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, and what is motivating them. That has taken me to Argentina, where I saw how people are using virtual currencies to escape the inflation their local currency is experiencing. It has also led me to the online black markets, where virtual currencies have made it easier for addicts to buy deadly drugs from China and for criminals to collect ransom payments. It is also the real-world usage that tests whether Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are able to live up to the big promises that they are making. With most virtual currency projects, I've found that there are relatively few real-world transactions to back up the big, speculative bets that investors are making. Perhaps most fascinating is how these new currencies draw communities around them. It's a potent reminder that all money is a social construct: The more people who believe a Bitcoin or dollar will retain its value in a week, the greater the value the currency will have. But these are still early days. The death of Bitcoin has been wrongfully proclaimed many times already. For my part, The Times's rules against investing in what we write about has allowed me to be equally open to this going up or down. Beyond that, these virtual currencies are all living economics experiments, testing how different sorts of incentives create different behaviors. Bitcoin has an elaborate system of carrots and sticks designed to attract followers and to increase the cybersecurity of the Bitcoin network. But these incentives don't always work as expected. That uncertainty is what makes it so interesting to watch -- and to report on. PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Keith Rankin FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Related Articles  "
Why the I.R.S. Fears Bitcoin,"Richard Holden is a professor of economics at the business school of the University of New South Wales. Anup Malani is a law professor at the University of Chicago. The extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble. Many, including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, have warned about a ''Bitcoin bust'' that could rival the dot-com crash of 2000 and wipe out speculators. But the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do, in the long run, to government finances through lost tax revenue.     The core technology underlying cryptocurrencies, known as blockchain, is premised on anonymity: Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address. This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractive.   But anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy, which is now conducted largely via cash. The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around $500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone. And the underground economy in the United States -- estimated at 8.4 percent of output -- is relatively small compared with those of other countries.   If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become ''the next Swiss bank account.''   The I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions).   Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C.   A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., ''I sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.'' As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000.   The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are ''arm's length'' counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules.   It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be.   One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product.   More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs.   A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code.   The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion.   More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult -- but no less necessary -- challenge.

"Paddle8, Online Art Auctioneer, Is Merging With Swiss Tech Company","LONDON -- Paddle8, the online art auctioneer known for selling a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album to Martin Shkreli, has had a rough 12 months, including the bankruptcy of its parent company.  Now Paddle8 is trying a new tack: merging with The Native, a Swiss technology and e-commerce company, and adopting the use of blockchain, the technology that underpins virtual currencies like Bitcoin.    Paddle8 announced on Tuesday that it had taken an investment from The Native, creating what the two say is a partnership meant to adapt online art sales -- and potentially more -- to an age of wealthy millennials well versed in virtual currencies.   Their first partnership will be Paddle8 Lab, which is meant to help introduce tech to online art and luxury sales and will draw on The Native's Blockchain Lab division.   A revamped Paddle8 will open this spring with services meant to go beyond art auctions into other luxury offerings. And the company will hold its first art and luxury auction accepting Bitcoin -- already titled ''Bidcoin'' -- on Aug. 18.   ''This is a way for us to show we can better align with a new generation of collectors,'' Alexander Gilkes, a founder of Paddle8, said in a telephone interview.   In 2016, Paddle8 merged with Auctionata in an effort to create a next-generation trans-Atlantic online auction house -- but the marriage dissolved early last year when Auctionata filed for insolvency after serious questions about its business practices came to light.   ''Last year was a horrible start to the year,'' Mr. Gilkes said. Of the merger with Auctionata, he added, ''There were very many salient reasons for doing it, but we didn't see how the events would unfold.''   Sergey Skaterschikov, The Native's chairman, said he saw the benefits of applying blockchain technology, essentially an online ledger of transactions, to the art world.   ''A lot of the art trade is built on asymmetric information,'' he said. ''It was scaring a lot of potential buyers from the collectible market.''   The Native will buy a 15 percent stake in Paddle8 for 8.5 million Swiss francs, or $8.8 million. The Native will also have an option to buy an additional 36 percent of Paddle8 for 24.5 million Swiss francs, giving it a majority stake.   ''The nature of the transaction actually solved for our reservations,'' Osman Khan, another Paddle8 founder, said. ''It really is a somewhat more cautious approach, after what we'd gone through.''   Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the investors who have long been proponents of Bitcoin and virtual currencies, have advised Paddle8 since 2015 and had pushed the company to adopt blockchain technology.   ''We've long considered cryptocurrency as key to increasing transparency in markets around the world, including the art market,'' Cameron Winklevoss said in a statement.    "
"$800 Million in Illegal Opioids, and All Smugglers Needed Was the Correct Postage","WASHINGTON -- Nearly $800 million worth of fentanyl pills were illegally sold to online customers in the United States over two years by Chinese distributors who took advantage of internet anonymity and an explosive growth in e-commerce, according to a Senate report released on Wednesday. A yearlong Senate investigation found that American buyers of the illegal drugs lived mostly in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. The Chinese sellers primarily used Bitcoin, the digital currency, as their preferred method of payment and shipped the drugs through other countries to reduce the risk of the opioids being seized by customs officials, Senate investigators said.     The 104-page bipartisan report was produced by the Senate Homeland Security Committee's investigations arm. It was requested by Senators Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the panel's chairman, and Tom Carper of Delaware, the committee's top Democrat. They will discuss the report's findings in a hearing set for Thursday and are expected to press law enforcement and Postal Service officials for details on plans to combat the growing opioid shipments.   China has a large pharmaceutical industry and hosts thousands of illegal labs that manufacture counterfeit and illicit drugs, Senate investigators said. The country has long been identified by American officials as the source of much of the illegal opioids flowing into the United States.   The report, Senate investigators say, shows how easy it is for Americans to buy the drugs online, and why officials at the post office and Customs and Border Protection has struggled to track and stop the shipments.   The Senate investigators said drugs traffickers are exploiting a loophole in the international mail system to send hundreds of pounds of deadly opioids into the United States each year.   Commercial shippers such as UPS and FedEx are required by law to supply Customs and Border Protection with advanced data about packages before they are shipped. The information includes names, addresses and the contents of the packages. That information is matched against intelligence and other enforcement data to flag suspicious parcels.   But customs officials say they currently do not receive advanced shipping data from all packages shipped through Postal Service that can help the agency spot opioids hidden in international packages. The service is not required to obtain advanced data from foreign postal organizations; mailed packages are inspected manually by customs officers at nine mail facilities in the United States that receive international mail.   Congress is considering legislation that would require foreign post offices to provide that electronic information, but the Postal Service said many poor countries are unable to produce the data.   But even with the advance data, some drugs get through, federal law enforcement officials said. Drug trafficking organizations continue to use FedEx and UPS to send heroin and opioids into the country, according to investigators with Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   Investigators said synthetic drug traffickers are getting more creative in how they ship drugs through the postal system, exploiting the sheer volume of international mail and sending smaller packages.   According to federal investigators, the use of illegal fentanyl and other opioids in the United States has exploded since 2014. Nearly 43,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2016, the most recent data available, according to the Centers for Disease Control.   Last October, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency but did not make any new funding available to combat it.   On Monday, Patrick Kennedy, a former Democratic representative from Rhode Island and a member of Mr. Trump's commission to address the opioid crisis, said the administration's efforts were ''essentially a sham.''   Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Trump signed legislation to provide Customs and Border Protection officers with additional screening devices and other tools to detect illicit drugs.   The legislation provides $9 million to the agency to buy portable chemical screening devices and new laboratory equipment at land-based ports of entry, airports and international mail facilities.

Are Bitcoins More Real Than Boyfriends?,"Malka Fleischmann works as a speechwriter in Manhattan. Recently, my brother experienced a cryptocurrency windfall. Almost overnight, $300 ballooned into tens of thousands, and now he can remodel his basement. Maybe. I don't know. I suppose he can if he finds the money lurking behind the math. Since the spring, I have furrowed my brow through two lunches, three dinners and half a dozen kaffeeklatsches during which my conversation partners made pronouncements about the ever-mystifying Bitcoin. They were certain of the simplicity of what I call ''space money,'' certain of its life cycle, certain of its dynamics.    My mind, on the other hand, can manage only a few key words before it charges merrily toward free association: Bitcoin, blockchain, key chain, chain of fools, fools rush in, Salma Hayek, etc.   Throughout these brain-blitz discussions, my boyfriend sat beside me and, I assumed, shared my skepticism. But then the impassioned talk would animate him, and I wondered if he, too, may soon invest. And I judged them all for it.    I thought: ''Why invest in something you can never hold in hand?'' Faith in things unseen, with the stakes as high as they are -- I couldn't surrender to it.   And that's curious, because I'm a religious person: hopeful, faithful and forever looking toward the nothingness of sky knowing, in my bones, that there's a ''there'' there.   But with love, I was focused on something tangible. I could see what I was holding. The very flesh of it. And I knew it was substantial enough to warrant all of my beaten-down but unrelenting faith.   I was holding someone who generated so much noise, in me and for us. He stimulated thought and conversation in a way that felt endlessly curious.   He was insistent about everything: that people apologize, that he bring hot tea to his evening doorman, that deodorant and body spray are one and the same, that I drink more water.   He was set ablaze by the political news ticker. He had dreams for this country and suffered no one's apathy.   He preferred winter to summer and took to snow like a child.   When he painted -- a leisure habit he was trying to incorporate into his everyday life -- there was no leisure in it. He was fierce, self-deprecating and determined.   He loved his family as I did mine: completely, proudly and with the highest priority.   Whenever I placed a meal before him, he looked like a recent escapee from prison, wild-eyed and deliriously happy.   His absurd physical comedy worked like a charm on me.   And for someone born in the 1990s, he had an inexplicable love of jazz.   When we first met, I was battling to extricate myself from a relationship with someone profoundly kind but with whom I was misaligned. Months after the demise of that relationship, I saw him again, at a lazy Saturday gathering of friends. Engrossed in an hourslong conversation, we ignored everyone else all afternoon until I let him walk me home.   I knew he would ask me for a date before long, and, after twice declining in consideration of a friend who had once dated him, I could no longer resist. He felt too familiar to bypass. As if, despite having no shared roots, we had been growing toward this encounter all along.   On our first date, I belly laughed multiple times. I thought of my friend Rebecca, who instinctively knew that the man who is now her husband was ''it'' because of a sidesplitting first dinner.   On our second date, we lay awake on the cold cement in Joan of Arc Park until the birds began their morning repertoire.   And, at the end of our third, he huddled beside me in a bus station, pressed play on ''Try a Little Tenderness'' and slipped his phone into his breast pocket, the music drifting between us like the softest and most fated stitching of time.   Six months later, walking through Midtown amid the bitter November cold, we noticed a bedraggled man peering into the window of a pizza shop, retreating to the curb, and then returning to look through the panes.   My boyfriend asked if he was hungry and pressed a sandwich into his hands. The man thanked us, but then met our gaze beseechingly and said, ''How did you know?''   I listened long enough to hear my boyfriend say, ''We didn't. You just looked a little tired,'' before I turned my back and burst into tears.   A month later, my boyfriend would say that this was the moment he fell in love with me. For me, it was just one of hundreds of times I fell in love with him all over again.   Like the time he defended me against a critical friend. Or when he was waiting in my office one morning with a sly smile on his face and flowers in his hands. Or when he sneaked into my apartment to assemble a behemoth of an armchair. Or when he deferred to my expertise in conversations about education. Or when he fed my niece supper. Or when he capaciously took interest in my friends or childhood home, people and places to which he had no connection other than me. Or when he fearfully, but finally, said he loved me.   Every time I introduced him to friends, I felt proud. He was magnetic, interested, interesting and always warm.   To be fair, a month into our relationship, he said he was worried about the pressure my readiness for commitment might visit upon him. But I believed there was something between us that could not be replicated. I had a hunch, even then, that this union bore my sought-after truth -- that we vibrated at the same frequency and would always grow in lock-step pace.   Several months later, after a painful fight, we parted at the subway -- I in sadness and he in anger. But moments later, he came bounding down the stairwell just as my train arrived, followed me into the car and said he felt sick the instant he'd left me.   Over the coming months, he would say that we were his deepest love, that he had no reservations about me, just about his own readiness.   Piteously, I would hear only the first part.   For years before we met, I had been consumed by a numbness that utterly reduced me. The pain of leaving home to attempt adulthood was exacerbated by my inability to find peace in partnership. I tried to turn every relationship into a love that could replace the mighty one with which I was raised, but they left me feeling unseen or stagnant.   With him, though, I felt alive. I felt like the version of myself I long assumed had been dead and buried. And I began to believe that I was meant to be paralyzed by fear throughout all of those tumultuous years so that, when he finally appeared, I would be free to love him.   I started to understand what others had always described: the softening of edges that certainty affords us. All the things that might have troubled me about him -- his inability to hear me when he was fixed upon a computer screen, his lukewarm interest in fiction, his occasional melodrama -- could be set aside if it meant that I could keep him.   For the first time in my life, I didn't label our differences as damning. They were the space within which we divided, leaving room for us to yearn for each other, to be dazzled by our distinctiveness, to always want to draw the other closer.   Everyone with whom I have discussed Bitcoin has affirmed that it is a system based on trust. These elusive wonder coins bear and accrue value because of the shared faith that miners and moneymakers place in them.   And now, I'm kicking myself for not investing some paltry sum at an earlier date.   All along, I thought I was holding something of value because I could see and feel it. But realness and value are products of shared and equal faith, no matter if in things unseen. I can't find or visualize Bitcoins, and I will never understand how complex math brings them deeper into reality. But when people equally believe in them, they become viable.   He and I, on the other hand, were doing our arithmetic separately, in each of our messy minds. And while I will never understand how someone could hold the full weight of me in his arms and choose to let go, I understand that his final calculus was different from mine.   With Bitcoin, you know exactly how much you invest, how much you stand to lose, how much you own.   Going into this -- my hard-won, full-bodied love -- I only knew that I had everything to gain. And I just thought that, if I could see it, feel it and know it to be true, it couldn't possibly disappear.   But between my brother and me, one of us now has a soon-to-be remodeled home, its reliable cemented foundation paid for by ''space money.'' And the other, palms bare, remains suspended in space.

Questioning Brazen Steps By Kodak,"An eon or two ago, Eastman Kodak was a bleeding-edge technology company. It hired the smartest engineers and put them to work racking up patents, pioneering new chemical processes and building a globe-spanning camera and film business that, at its peak, employed 145,000 people. But the digital photo age passed Kodak by, and today, the Rochester, N.Y., company exists mostly in the past tense. Many of the patents have been sold, buildings have been rented out or demolished, and the company has continued to shrink since it filed for bankruptcy in 2012.    Now, the 130-year-old company is trying an unlikely sort of comeback -- one built by betting on cryptocurrency. It's a bold gamble that has excited some investors, perplexed others and raised questions about how closely Kodak vetted its cryptocurrency business partners, who now include a paparazzi photo agency, a penny-stock promoter and a company offering what has been called a ''magic money making machine.''    This month, Kodak lent its name to a digital currency called KodakCoin, which is billed as ''a photo-centric cryptocurrency to empower photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.'' The basic idea behind KodakCoin is to use the blockchain to help photographers manage their collections by creating permanent, immutable records of ownership. The company also struck a licensing deal for a Bitcoin-mining computer called the Kodak KashMiner, which allows users to generate their own cryptocurrency.   Kodak's stock rose more than 200 percent following the announcements, and has not fallen much since.   That's partly because the blockchain -- the mathematical ledger system that forms the basis of digital currencies -- has a kind of talismanic effect in today's stock market. As investors seek to capitalize on the popularity of currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a number of struggling companies have reversed their fortunes, at least temporarily, simply by adding ''blockchain'' to their names or announcing a new cryptocurrency venture unrelated to their previous line of work. (The most notorious example is Long Island Iced Tea Corp., a beverage company that tripled its value overnight after it rebranded itself ''Long Blockchain Corp.'')   These sudden, brazen moves have also attracted the attention of regulators. In a recent speech, Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the agency was ''looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology.''   Kodak is the most prominent old-line company to enter the cryptocurrency game so far, and maybe the most controversial. Almost immediately, critics pounced on the company's plans, characterizing them as a desperate money grab.   ''It feels like a publicly traded company issuing a token to raise its stock price from the grave,'' said Kyle Samani, a partner at the cryptocurrency trading firm Multicoin Capital.   ''I would not be sleeping very well if I was involved in this,'' said Jill Carlson, a blockchain consultant.   In an interview, Jeff Clarke, Kodak's chief executive, said that the company's blockchain ambitions were genuine. He began looking into blockchain technology last summer, he said, and realized that it could solve a perennial problem for photographers -- proving ownership of their images, tracking down copyright violators, and getting paid.   ''This is not a dog food company that's creating a currency,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''This is a real solution around digital rights management that Kodak has been involved in for many years.''   In theory, photographers will be able to upload their images to a platform called KodakOne, create a blockchain-based license for each image, and use web-crawling software to scour the internet looking for copyright violations. Instead of using dollars, photographers can have clients pay them in KodakCoins.   KodakCoin's initial offering, scheduled for Wednesday, is expected to raise as much as $20 million. (On Tuesday night, KodakCoin's website said that it would delay the offering by ''several weeks'' to verify the credentials of potential investors.) But there are few details about what that money will be used for, or why a similar system could not be built without the blockchain. There is also a more obvious question: Why would photographers want to be paid in digital tokens, rather than cash?   In several calls with KodakCoin leaders, I couldn't get straight answers to these questions. And KodakCoin's white paper, a technical document that details the plans for the currency, is a 40-page mishmash of marketing buzzwords and vague diagrams, like the one below:   Make no mistake: Digital rights management is a real issue for photographers, and the blockchain does, in theory, offer a compelling solution. But the specific attributes of KodakCoin present some red flags.   First, despite the name, KodakCoin is not actually a Kodak project. The company behind the offering, WENN Digital, is a California-based affiliate of a British photo agency that specializes in paparazzi photo licensing. Under their licensing agreement, Kodak will not receive any direct revenue from the public offering. It will receive a minority stake in WENN Digital, 3 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a royalty on future revenue.   Cameron Chell, a lead adviser to the KodakCoin project, told me that the initial offering represented a ''seminal moment'' for Kodak, and that the company's interest in blockchain technology was a savvy long-term investment.   ''The real story is that it's about to be a renaissance,'' he said.   But Mr. Chell, a Canadian entrepreneur and motivational speaker who once opened for Tony Robbins, has a troubled track record. In 1998, Mr. Chell agreed to a five-year ban from the Alberta Stock Exchange in Canada and paid a $25,000 fine in connection with a violation of the exchange's rules. A previous company of his ended in ignominy after its chairman was  charged with fraud.   Asked about these incidents, Mr. Chell said that he was ''young, inexperienced and was irresponsible in my actions,'' and that he had ''learned a lot since 1998 and work hard to conduct myself in a manner that does not reflect that poor judgment.'' A Kodak spokesman did not return a request for comment about Mr. Chell and whether it knew about the ban.   Mr. Chell has refashioned himself as a blockchain expert in recent years, and KodakCoin is his biggest project so far. He is the chairman of Appcoin Innovations, which was registered as a literary agency -- Redstone Literary Agents -- until last year, when it became a consulting firm that provides ''a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies,'' according to securities filings.   The company, which trades over the counter as a penny stock, earned no revenue in 2015 or 2016, according to S.E.C. filings. Appcoin Innovations is slated to receive 20 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a portion of the offering proceeds, a stake that could amount to millions if the offering is successful.   ''Once formally launched,'' Mr. Chell wrote to me in an email, ''the company will hopefully provide shareholders a traditional and transparent place to participate in the crypto space with projects that are regulatory compliant.''   Now, about those coins. You might think that a digital currency that is trying to ''democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists,'' in Mr. Clarke's words, would be easily accessible. But because of regulatory requirements, KodakCoins will be available only to so-called accredited investors in the United States. An accredited investor is defined as a person with a net worth of $1 million or more, or an annual income above $200,000.   How many cryptocurrency-obsessed millionaire photographers do you know?   Even if photographers do meet the requirements to participate, they could have a hard time spending their KodakCoins, or redeeming them for cash. The S.E.C. has warned that securities sold in private offerings, such as KodakCoins, may be difficult to resell -- and that investors may be required to hold on to them ''indefinitely.'' A KodakCoin representative told me that the company believes its tokens will eventually be freely traded, and that it may issue other types of tokens in the future that will not be subject to the same restrictions.   KodakCoin's white paper says that token holders may receive other benefits, such as a share of KodakOne's revenue and access to a ''marketplace'' that will allow them to spend their KodakCoins on camera equipment, studios for photo shoots, and travel expenses. But these benefits could fail to materialize.   Cryptocurrency experts also do not seem impressed with the Kodak KashMiner, a Bitcoin-mining machine advertised at this year's CES electronics trade show. According to the advertisement, users will pay $3,400 to rent the machine, a Kodak-branded computer that solves complex math equations to unlock new Bitcoin, for two years. Half the Bitcoins successfully mined with the Kashminer will go back to Spotlite, the company licensing Kodak's name, and the user will keep the other half.   Kodak hasn't shared many details about its KashMiner deal. But renting the machines could be a hard sell. In its CES advertisement, KashMiner estimates that each renter will earn $9,000 from mining Bitcoin over the two-year contract window. Experts told me that figure was most likely inflated, because Bitcoin mining gets harder over time. And they pointed out that the KashMiner itself appears to simply be a rebranded version of a popular Bitcoin-mining machine that can be purchased outright for less than the rental cost.   All of this -- the origins of KodakCoin, the currency itself and the lofty claims about the KashMiner's moneymaking potential -- adds up to a big question mark, and points to the possibility that Kodak may be in over its head.   ''The best-case scenario is that they believe that the technology will eventually be able to deliver what they've pitched,'' said Ms. Carlson, the blockchain consultant. ''The worst-case scenario is that they are just being very opportunistic.''   Mr. Clarke, Kodak's chief executive, characterized the blockchain projects as a small part of the company's overall strategy, and said it was ''ironic'' that critics were faulting Kodak for embracing a young technology like cryptocurrency, given that its past problems were caused by a failure to innovate.   ''This isn't speculative,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''We're taking an emerging new technology in blockchain, and we're using it to solve a real problem.''

Market Gives Millennials Crash Course On Volatility,"Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu. Watching the wild swings in the stock market has been a heartbreaking experience for Jasmine Okougbo, who started investing only last month. Ms. Okougbo, 26, a business operations manager in Tucson, has an individual retirement account set up through her company and shares she got from her parents for her birthday. In one week, the value of her investments sank 65 percent.    ''I don't think I will be buying or trading on the market again anytime soon,'' she said. ''I still don't think it has hit me how much I lost so quickly.''    For many millennials, the recent stock market gyrations have been a painful lesson in volatility that is being driven by fears that inflation and interest rates could rise faster than expected. Many have retreated from the market into savings accounts.   Twitter feeds quickly filled with teary, wailing GIFs and heart emoticons cracked in two -- pithy punctuation about anemic 401(k) accounts being whittled down to wisps. Many young investors bemoaned the misfortune of equity portfolios shriveling up weeks after their cryptocurrency holdings also began deflating.   Lulled into confidence by the second-longest bull run in history, some had forgotten the passwords to their trading accounts and, to their panic, were locked out.   Mario Tehuitzil, 27, ducked into a restroom to check his cryptocurrency and stock holdings on Monday and felt ''a punch to the gut,'' then a growing ''rush of anxiety and nausea.'' His $33,000 stock portfolio had plummeted by more than 40 percent, to $19,000 in value, before swelling back to $24,000 on Wednesday.   ''I'm aware of the risks but I never expected this rapid and severe drop,'' said Mr. Tehuitzil, a New York-based pediatrics assistant. ''Looks like the down payment for an apartment I've been eyeing will have to wait.''   Millennials, a sprawling and diverse demographic generally said to be born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, are known for their passion for social media and an affinity for instant gratification.   But as investors, haunted by the trauma of the Great Recession, they have been mostly cautious. Many young people struggling to find work retreated back to school or into part-time work. For millennials living paycheck to paycheck and sometimes bunking with their parents, saving for retirement seemed a remote priority as they watched debts pile up.   Since hitting bottom in 2009, however, the stock market has more than tripled its value. More millennials began venturing into investing, toggling between stock apps and cryptocurrency charts on their phones and boasting of good returns on Twitter and Snapchat.   Rather than turn to professional advisers, who tend to handle much larger amounts than most young people have to invest, many millennials also tapped a growing roster of so-called robo-advisers that offer low-cost, autopiloted portfolio management.   Josh Stillman, 27, was too afraid to look at his retirement account this week but saw on Wealthfront, a robo-adviser he began using last year, that his investments had slumped 3 percent during the sell-off before recovering somewhat.   Mr. Stillman, who produces and hosts digital videos in Los Angeles, said he taught himself about investing by conducting online research and watching YouTube tutorials.   ''I feel like my formal education did not educate me at all for investing or planning for my future,'' said Mr. Stillman, who has a bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of Rochester.   Only about a third of millennials currently hold stocks. And more than 80 percent of young investors -- a far higher share than among older age groups -- describe their investing strategy as ''conservative,'' according to survey data released this summer by the Legg Mason asset management firm.   But the survey, conducted as major indexes were surging to new highs amid ostensibly low volatility, found that the group expected to eventually take on more risk than their elders. Many have piled into virtual currencies like Bitcoin.   Accustomed to a steadily rising stock market and the allure of astronomical gains in cryptocurrencies, millennials have a far different expectation of what typical returns look like compared with investors who have seen more cycles.   Millennials now expect an average annual return of 13.7 percent, compared to the 7.7 percent return that baby boomers expect, according to a survey last year from the AMG asset management company. Young investors are four times as likely as boomers to consider themselves to be highly knowledgeable.   But when the slump overtook the market on Friday, many were stunned.   ''They've never seen a sell-off like this, and it's especially scary because they don't know who to ask for advice -- they may not have a relationship with a financial adviser they can call or text to walk them back from the cliff,'' said Jason Dorsey, president of The Center for Generational Kinetics, a research firm. ''For many of them, it's been a pretty rude awakening.''   Many millennials are familiar with debt because of their credit cards and student loans. But concepts like portfolio diversification and long-term investing are less well-known, experts said.   ''If you haven't been taught how markets truly work over time, and you don't have the historical perspective, then bouts of volatility like this could cause you to make bad decisions,'' said Brian Levitt, a senior investment strategist at OppenheimerFunds.   Many young investors were sanguine about the swings as the Dow Jones industrial average gained back 567 points on Tuesday after shedding a total of more than 1,841 points on Friday and Monday. On Wednesday, Wall Street edged lower; the Dow lost another 19 points, or 0.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.5 percent.   Paul Whited, 24, lost nearly $800 of the $12,000 in his portfolio as holdings in biopharmacy and technology stocks were walloped. On Tuesday, he made back $300.   The Knoxville-based accounting student began investing actively two years ago. His recent losses hurt, he said, but the volatility could present an opportunity to buy.   ""Investing in stocks to secure a safe retirement is too important to let fear change my plans,'' he said. ''I have plenty of time ahead of me to earn my money back and then more.''    "
Venezuela Begins Gamble to Save Economy With a Virtual Currency Backed by Oil,"MEXICO CITY -- With Venezuela suffering one of the most severe economic collapses of modern times, the beleaguered administration of President Nicolás Maduro announced on Tuesday that it had begun a presale of virtual currency backed by the nation's vast petroleum reserves. The government, which had announced plans for the new digital currency late last year, said the initiative was a response to a financial crisis marked by a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.    The country is suffering desperate scarcities of food and medicine, soaring crime rates and the collapse of public services and the health system. The crisis has driven hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee the country seeking a better life.   The Maduro administration hopes that sales of the digital currency, known as the petro, will help its treasury pay off debt and increase imports of vitally needed goods, as well as raw materials for manufacturing.    Venezuelan officials also asserted that the new digital currency -- the first to be issued by a nation -- would allow investors to do an end run around sanctions imposed against their country by the Trump administration. These sanctions ban the purchase in American markets of new securities issued by the Venezuelan government, and outlaw business dealings with Mr. Maduro and several top administration officials.   ''For big problems, big solutions,'' Mr. Maduro said Tuesday night at a ceremony in Caracas. ''We Venezuelans are indomitable.''   He called it a ''cryptocurrency to take on Superman.''   But many analysts and critics of the government did not give the digital currency much hope of success.   ''I just think it's a desperate move by a regime that is increasingly isolated and has an economy that has spiraled out of its control,'' said Cynthia J. Arnson, director of the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.   The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work, and many investors have said they would not trust the government to faithfully maintain the link between the petro and the price of oil.   ''The petro will most likely suffer all of the same ills as Venezuelan debt,'' predicted David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has researched Venezuela for more than two decades.   A spokesman for the United States Treasury Department warned American investors last month that the petro might still run afoul of the sanctions, telling Reuters that the currency ''would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government'' and could ''expose U.S. persons to legal risk.''   Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democratic, wrote to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in January, asking him to monitor the situation closely.   ''We have serious doubts about whether Venezuela has the capacity to launch a cryptocurrency,'' the letter said. ''But regardless, it is imperative that the U.S. Treasury Department is equipped with tools and enforcement mechanisms to combat the use of cryptocurrency to evade U.S. sanctions in general, and in this case in particular.''   Critics of the Maduro administration, including many in the international community, attribute the nation's economic problems to government mismanagement. Mr. Maduro blames a conspiracy involving the political opposition working in concert with foreign governments, especially the United States.   On Monday, Mr. Maduro made an overture to President Trump, inviting him for bilateral talks through a Twitter post.   ''@RealDonaldTrump campaigned promoting noninterference in other countries' domestic affairs, '' he said. ''The time has come to fulfill it and change your agenda of aggression for one of dialogue.''   Mr. Maduro added: ''Dialogue in Caracas or in Washington, D.C.?''   The Trump administration has sought to justify its sanctions against Venezuelan officials by accusing them of political repression and public corruption.   Last month, while adding four more names to the growing list of Venezuelan officials placed in the sanctions list, the Treasury Department criticized the nation's all-powerful Constituent Assembly for prohibiting three major opposition parties from participating in the presidential election.   Mr. Maduro will be running for re-election in the April race, and with his government in control of the electoral machinery and the highest court, he is expected to win. But the United States, Colombia and other countries have already declared that they will not recognize the results.   Ms. Arnson said the introduction of the currency could provide a political lift to Mr. Maduro's re-election ambitions.   ''Looking like you're doing something to save the economy, that goes beyond paying off your foreign creditors, is an important part of the electoral strategy,'' she said. ''But I think this is fantasy-land in terms of being an economic life jacket.''   The Venezuelan government's petro initiative is one of the wildest outgrowths of an explosion in activity around virtual currencies over the last year. Inspired by the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin in 2017, many entrepreneurs raised money by creating and selling their own virtual currencies in so-called initial coin offerings.   Many governments around the world have also been examining whether it would make sense to issue their own electronic currencies on something similar to the network that Bitcoin runs on, with the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China announcing experiments.   Russian government officials have also discussed issuing some sort of crypto-ruble, to evade American sanctions.   But no government has moved ahead more swiftly, and with more abandon, than Venezuela.   The documents that have been put out by the Venezuelan government suggest that the petro's release will be similar to the offerings done by private companies.   The petro white paper said the process would begin with a presale of digital tokens, to gauge demand, and then be followed by an ''Initial Coin Offer,'' with 82 million petros released to the public. The petros are then supposed to be tradable on virtual currency exchanges around the world, the white paper says.   A petro website says the Venezuelan government will accept the petro for tax payments and fees. Mr. Maduro directed the state oil company, PDVSA, and other public companies to handle a percentage of their sales and purchases in petros.   Coin offerings have been attractive to entrepreneurs because investors can send their money using Bitcoin or other existing virtual currencies, which do not go through banks or other institutions that could decline the transactions.   The movement of money outside of the traditional banking system has allowed coin offerings to go ahead even though American regulators have said that most of them are probably violating the law.   The same structure could be beneficial to Venezuela, given that it is facing American sanctions that have made it hard to raise money through established channels.   For investors, though, the petro may be a hard sell, given that the system will be designed and controlled by the Venezuelan government, which has not been the most reliable financial player.   The Venezuelan government has said the value of the petro will be tied in some way to the value of a barrel of Venezuelan oil. But the Maduro administration has not given many details on how this pricing would work, and many investors have said they would not trust the government to faithfully maintain the link between the petro and the price of oil.   The design of the petro, while clearly inspired by Bitcoin, would, in some ways, be the opposite of most virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which are designed to operate without any central government or authority in charge.   Bitcoin has largely won over investors because there is no central authority that could suddenly change the number of Bitcoins to be released, or the rules of the network.   With the petro, on the other hand, the confidence of investors is likely to be only as strong as their confidence in the Maduro government.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Virtual Coins, Real Resources","WASHINGTON -- A manufacturing start-up recently announced plans to move into a shuttered aluminum factory in upstate New York, taking advantage of abundant cheap electricity from the St. Lawrence River. Instead of smelting aluminum, however, the company plans to turn that power into Bitcoins.    Money is supposed to be a means of buying things. Now, the nation's hottest investment is buying money. And the investment rush is raising questions about whether one reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years is that the nation is busy distracting itself. While Bitcoin mining may not be labor intensive, it diverts time, energy and capital from other, more productive activities that economists say could fuel faster growth.   ''It appears that much of our evolving digital infrastructure is devoted to activities, like the proliferation of cybercoins, that are worse than frivolous,'' said James McAndrews, the former head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   By a wide range of measures, America has a productivity problem. The economy is growing slowly, and almost 20 percent of adults in their prime working years are neither working nor trying to find work. Americans who do have jobs are less likely to start their own companies. Even the most basic kind of production is in decline. Americans are having less sex and making fewer babies.    Some economists see evidence that people are playing video games instead of going to work, logging on instead of getting it on, and plowing a growing share of their time, capital and natural resources into virtual products like social media, games and the latest fad: virtual currencies.   Bitcoin, the largest virtual currency, is a particularly voracious consumer of resources because new Bitcoins are distributed in a kind of lottery where each ticket is purchased with electricity.   Bitcoin miners compete for the coins by submitting answers to difficult math problems. Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550.   Believers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions.   But Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth.   ''Once the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,'' he said.   Colin L. Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., also sees it as a public nuisance. The city was guaranteed a fixed supply of cheap electricity as part of the construction of power-generating dams on the St. Lawrence in the 1950s. Bitcoin mining companies are plugging into that power supply like a swarm of hungry mosquitoes.   Mr. Read said that Bitcoin mining now consumes about 10 percent of the city's power, and that is forcing Plattsburgh to buy a growing amount of extra electricity on the open market, at rates up to 100 times higher than its base cost.   Mr. Read, who is also an economics professor, said he would rather sell the city's supply of cheap power to companies employing large numbers of people. Mold-Rite Plastics, which makes bottle caps, also uses about 10 percent of the city's power, but it employs about 200 people. The mining companies? ''They hire a security guard,'' he said. ''And a guy who comes when something breaks.''   David Bowman, who describes himself as Plattsburgh's first Bitcoin miner -- ''I started a long time ago, around 2014,'' he said -- started with a handful of computers. Now he has 20 machines.   A few years ago, he rented a room in an old paper warehouse, where he runs the specialized hard drives around the clock. They sit side-by-side on wire racks, fans whirring to dissipate the heat. About half a dozen other mining companies have since moved into the same building.   Mr. Bowman, who is from Plattsburgh, said he sympathizes with the mayor's concerns. He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school.   And he doesn't see that Plattsburgh has better options.   ''The place needs all the jobs they can get,'' he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee.   Other governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns.   ''Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,'' the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement.   Some Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world's largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.   Some American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs.   ''They're thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,'' said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy.   And plenty of places are hungry for jobs -- even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings.   Massena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory.   The New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building.   The company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none.   ''The plan is to get anybody here that you can,'' said Steven D. O'Shaughnessy, Massena's town supervisor. ''I have said all along, I'll take whatever I can.''

A Rude Tax Awakening For Virtual Currencies,"Email Kevin Roose at kevin.roose@nytimes.com, or follow him on Facebook at facebook.com/kevinroose and on Twitter: @kevinroose. The room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren't nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets. No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how -- and whether -- to pay them.    With this year's April 17 tax filing deadline fast approaching, many virtual currency traders are sweating over their tax returns. They're confused by the complicated rules, many of them stemming from guidelines issued by the I.R.S. in 2014, governing the taxation of virtual currencies. They're afraid that the windfall profits created by last year's cryptocurrency boom, which sent currencies like Bitcoin and Ether skyrocketing and created a new class of crypto-millionaires, have left them with huge tax bills. And, of course, they're worried about drawing the eye of the Internal Revenue Service.   ''I've lost sleep over it,'' said Shaun, a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last year's cryptocurrency profits on his taxes. Shaun, who asked that his last name not be used because he has been audited in the past, said he was scared that increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market could lead the I.R.S. to pay special attention to cases like his.    ''I don't want to be made an example of,'' he said.   This gathering, which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics, a research and education company, featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation. For an hour, the audience peppered them with tax-prep questions that ranged from common (Do I have to pay taxes on Bitcoin if I haven't sold yet?) to esoteric (If my Bitcoin wallet got hacked and all my coins got stolen, can I deduct my losses?). By the end of the hour, there seemed to be many more questions than answers.   For answers to some common questions about cryptocurrencies and taxes, see my colleague Tara Siegel Bernard's column on the topic.   ''It's complicated as heck,'' said Mike Schreibman, an I.T. consultant who attended. Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis.   ''Nobody knows what's going to happen,'' said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. ''But the I.R.S. is the one agency you don't want to mess with.''   Taxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into ''privacy coins,'' such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users' transactions.   Cryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology's stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it's possible for users to conceal their identities.   Until recently, the I.R.S. showed little desire to go after cryptocurrency income, since there was so little of it. But last year's boom changed all that. The agency has formed a team of specialists to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes, including international money laundering and tax evasion. In November, after a yearlong lawsuit, the agency won a judgment that forced Coinbase, the largest American-based cryptocurrency exchange, to turn over account records for more than 14,000 customers. In January, Coinbase sent 1099-K forms to a number of its current users, informing them that their trading proceeds were being reported to the I.R.S. and reminding them to pay the taxes they owed.   All of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon.   Mario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business.   ''We're preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,'' Mr. Costanz said.   Laura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year.   ''A lot of crypto investors are younger and don't have a lot of experience trading stocks,'' she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, ''a lot of people are kind of shocked.''   Part of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else -- whether you're cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee -- you're creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for.   Complicating matters even more, the timing of last year's cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year's market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year's gains.   Ms. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. ''Now they're stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don't have the capital to pay it.''   Faced with such problems, some cryptocurrency traders have decided to avoid the issue entirely, by not declaring any cryptocurrency on their taxes and hoping for the best. According to Credit Karma, which provides tax-filing services, fewer than 100 of the 250,000 people who had used the company's tax-filing software as of February reported cryptocurrency transactions, a rate below 0.04 percent.   Even the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew weren't planning to pay taxes on their crypto-gains.   ''This is the smallest crypto event I've been to,'' said Mr. Schreibman, the I.T. consultant. ''No one believes they'll get in trouble.''   All the traders at the event said they would do their best to pay their taxes in full. And they looked a little shellshocked, as if they had been rudely yanked out of a thrilling, consequence-free virtual world back into the real one.   Peter Baniuszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader from Brooklyn, told me that this year's tax season had come as a jolt of reality.   ''It's not Monopoly money anymore,'' he said.    "
"Two Founders of Centra, a $32 Million Virtual Currency Project, Are Arrested","SAN FRANCISCO -- Federal authorities have arrested two founders of a virtual currency that raised $32 million from investors last year and won an endorsement from the boxer Floyd Mayweather. The co-founders of the Centra virtual currency, Sam Sharma and Robert Farkas, were arrested on Sunday, a day before the Securities and Exchange Commission released a complaint against the men and announced that it was halting the project.    Centra raised $32 million last summer and fall in a so-called initial coin offering, a method of fund-raising in which companies sell custom virtual currencies. The Centra team said at the time that the Centra token would give investors access to a new virtual currency exchange and a virtual currency debit card that would operate on the Visa and Mastercard networks.    The S.E.C. said in its complaint that the Centra team had never received approval from Visa and Mastercard and had misled investors on several other counts. The S.E.C. said that several of the executives listed on the Centra website were fictitious.   Most of the claims in the S.E.C. complaint were detailed in an article in The New York Times about Centra in October.   A co-director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, Stephanie Avakian, said in a statement that the Centra co-founders had ''sold investors on the promise of new digital technologies by using a sophisticated marketing campaign to spin a web of lies about their supposed partnerships with legitimate businesses.''   Lawyers for Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas did not respond to emails seeking comment Monday evening. The authorities did not charge a third man who had been listed as a Centra co-founder, Raymond Trapani.   Initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, emerged suddenly last year to become one of the most popular ways for start-ups to raise money, with investors pouring more than $6 billion into such offerings. But I.C.O.s operate in a regulatory gray area, and that has drawn a swift blowback from authorities around the world.   The S.E.C. is said to have sent subpoenas to dozens of I.C.O. projects, and has already sought to halt a handful of such projects.   The Centra founders appear to have been the first people arrested because of a coin offering. In addition to the S.E.C. complaint, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York brought criminal charges against Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas -- including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud.   Mr. Farkas had a flight reservation to leave the country on Sunday but was arrested before he could board the plane, according to the S.E.C. complaint.   The complaint alleges that the men ''engaged in an illegal unregistered securities offering and, in connection with the offering, engaged in fraudulent conduct and made material misstatements and omissions designed to deceive investors in connection with the offer and sale of securities in the Centra I.C.O.''   The chairman of the S.E.C., Jay Clayton, has said that most tokens offered through coin offerings should be categorized as securities and registered with regulators, which few have done.   Mr. Sharma announced that he was leaving Centra after the Times article was published last fall, but the company has continued its operations and said this week that it would release the ''Centra Roadmap 3.0'' at a conference in South Korea.   After the arrests were announced on Monday, the price of Centra's token on virtual currency exchanges crashed and the administrators of a Centra chat room on the Telegram messaging app expressed confusion.   ''The admins have no more info then you,'' an administrator named Tomo wrote to the other users.    "
The Currency Was Virtual. The Hunger Was Real.,"Good morning on this stormy Monday. Bitcoin can make you filthy rich, but it still won't buy you a buttered roll at your bodega.    How do we know? We tried.   For 36 hours last week I lived on Bitcoin alone. Surviving on the cryptocurrency, even in one of the world's financial capitals, wasn't easy. It required long subway rides to far-flung vendors where I was often the first Bitcoin-paying customer.   To get started, I bought 0.00737523 Bitcoin ($50) on Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. It took an hour, $1.99 in fees, uploading a photo ID, and calling my bank after the charge was flagged as possibly fraudulent.   Coinbase also canceled my first attempt to buy the volatile currency because the price had fluctuated in the 10 seconds or so it took me to check out.    I went to bed and woke up with Bitcoin worth $50.14 in my digital wallet and a list of things to accomplish: grocery shop, do laundry, buy socks, work out and get a haircut.   But first, I needed coffee.   The closest place I found was Kavasutra in the East Village, a 30-minute subway ride away. (The subway does not accept Bitcoin, so to ride I had to cheat.)   After pulling a shot of cold brew for 0.00014486 BTC, or $1, the barista called up a QR code on an iPad. I scanned it with an app on my phone, but it didn't work. He began coaching me like a child patiently setting up Grandpa's Facebook account, and then gave up.   But eventually I figured it out, the payment went through and I became his third Bitcoin-paying customer of the day.   Paying with cryptocurrency was like that: exciting, fraught and never the same twice.   I was invoiced by email for a load of laundry at the Eco Laundry Company in Chelsea. I texted with a hair stylist in Israel who accepted a tip on behalf of his colleague at Armando Piña Hair Salon on the Upper East Side. I waited -- fingers crossed -- for five minutes before a payment finally posted and I could dig into an ice cream sandwich at Melt Bakery on the Lower East Side.   And like an obsessive day trader, I would check my digital wallet and watch as the value went up and down by a few cents every few minutes.   It was fun, until I got hungry.   I had searched for restaurants and grocery stores using Coinmap, the Blockchain Wallet and filters on Yelp, but almost none took Bitcoin, and most said they never had.   ''No one is really using it the way it's supposed to be used, as a currency,'' said Dan Sim, who accepts Bitcoin at his Lean Crust pizza shop in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.   Circa 2013, he said, he'd process dozens of Bitcoin purchases a week, but as the currency became more valuable and volatile, that's dropped to zero. ''People don't want to part with their Bitcoin,'' he said.   I couldn't find anyone to sell me less than $200 worth of socks or a gym that accepted Bitcoin. By the time lunch rolled around on Day 2, I was ready to throw in the towel.   I headed to Sweetgreen. Its restaurants don't accept cash, but they still take good old-fashioned plastic.   Here's what else is happening:   Weather   We'd pay a pretty penny for better weather.   We could see two inches of rain, and thunder may rumble through the morning.   Today's high is around 60.

Goldman Will Open Trade Unit For Bitcoin,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Most big banks have tried to stay far away from the scandal-tainted virtual currency Bitcoin. But Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank.    In a step that is likely to lend legitimacy to virtual currencies -- and create new concerns for Goldman -- the bank is about to begin using its own money to trade with clients in a variety of contracts linked to the price of Bitcoin.    While Goldman will not initially be buying and selling actual Bitcoins, a team at the bank is looking at going in that direction if it can get regulatory approval and figure out how to deal with the additional risks associated with holding the virtual currency.   Rana Yared, one of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, said the bank was cleareyed about what it was getting itself into.   ''I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,'' Ms. Yared said. ''For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.''   Still, the suggestion that Goldman Sachs, among the most vaunted banks on Wall Street and a frequent target for criticism, would even consider trading Bitcoin would have been viewed as preposterous a few years ago, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a way to buy drugs online.   Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous figure going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who talked about replacing Wall Street banks -- not giving them a new revenue line.   Over the last two years, however, a growing number of hedge funds and other large investors around the world have expressed an interest in virtual currencies. Tech companies like Square have begun offering Bitcoin services to their customers, and the commodity exchanges in Chicago started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin futures contracts in December.   But until now, regulated financial institutions have steered clear of Bitcoin, with some going so far as to shut down the accounts of customers who traded Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously called it a fraud, and many other bank chief executives have said Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble.   Ms. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be ''mined'' in a complex, virtual system.   ''It resonates with us when a client says, 'I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,''' she said.   Ms. Yared said the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted Bitcoin millionaires and didn't know how to handle them. The ultimate decision to begin trading Bitcoin contracts went through Goldman's board of directors.   The step comes with plenty of uncertainties. Bitcoin prices are primarily set on unregulated exchanges in other countries where there are few measures in place to prevent market manipulation.   Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged -- and recovered significantly -- as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies.   ''It is not a new risk that we don't understand,'' Ms. Yared said. ''It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.''   Goldman has already been doing more than most banks in the area, clearing trades for customers who want to buy and sell Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.   In the next few weeks -- the exact start date has not been set -- Goldman will begin using its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of clients. It will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients.   The bank's first ''digital asset'' trader, Justin Schmidt, joined Goldman two weeks ago to handle the day-to-day operations, a hiring that was first reported by Tearsheet. In his last job, Mr. Schmidt, 38, was an electronic trader at the hedge fund Seven Eight Capital. In 2017, he left that job to trade virtual currencies on his own.   He will initially be placed on Goldman's foreign currency desk because Bitcoin trading has the most similarity to movements in emerging market currencies, Ms. Yared said.   Mr. Schmidt is looking at trading actual Bitcoin -- or physical Bitcoin, as it is somewhat ironically called -- if the bank can secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and New York authorities.   The firm also has to find a way to confidently hold Bitcoin for customers without its being stolen by hackers, as has happened to many Bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Yared said the current options for holding Bitcoin for clients did not yet meet Wall Street standards.   Goldman is known for pushing the envelope in the trading of complicated products. The firm faced significant criticism after the financial crisis for its profitable trading of so-called synthetic derivatives tied to the subprime mortgage markets.   Since the crisis, Goldman has made a big push to position itself as the most technologically sophisticated firm on Wall Street. Among other things, it has started an online lending service, known as Marcus, that has brought the firm into contact with retail customers for the first time. The virtual currency trading, though, will be available only to big institutional investors.   Mr. Schmidt said Goldman's sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world.   ''In terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading -- but it didn't exist,'' he said.    "
"Back in Jail, But He's Not Unhappy","REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- It has been more than four months since thieves pulled off the biggest heist in the history of Iceland, and the police here still have no idea where the booty -- roughly $2 million worth of Bitcoin-mining computers -- is stashed. A breakthrough in the case seemed imminent in early February when the authorities detained Sindri Stefansson, a 31-year-old man with a rap sheet that includes drug possession and burglary. Even though he hadn't been charged, let alone convicted, the media tagged him the ''mastermind'' of the crime, largely because he was held in prison longer than any of the 11 suspects who were questioned.    Then, like the computers, Mr. Stefansson disappeared. For the next five days he was an international fugitive. After escaping from the prison -- a feat that took surprisingly little effort, given the institution's bare-minimum approach to security -- he hopped a taxi to the country's largest airport, where he boarded an early-morning flight to Stockholm. In a twist that seems borrowed from a cheesy caper film, the plane also carried Katrin Jakobsdottir, the prime minister of Iceland.    ''We did not chat,'' Mr. Stefansson said, calling from a prison near Amsterdam in his first interview since he was arrested two weeks ago in the Netherlands. Speaking by phone in a gloomy monotone, he said he had worn a baseball cap and avoided the gaze of everyone on the plane. ''I kept my head down as much as I could.''   After the recent rash of cryptocurrency-related crimes, many of them gunpoint stickups of people forced to empty their virtual wallets, a theft like this seemed all but inevitable. And Iceland is one of the world's premier venues for mining operators, who are drawn to the country's cheap electricity and chilly weather, which helps keep computers cool.   Mr. Stefansson would not discuss what the media has named the Big Bitcoin Heist. Instead, he focused on his regret for having fled, a decision that, he said, he rued as soon as he landed in Sweden and realized that his mug shot was all over the media.   ''I did not eat and had a constant knot in the pit of my stomach,'' he said. ''I was disappointed in myself for making my family suffer, and nervous about being recognized.''   Detectives in Reykjavik would like to have a conversation of their own with Mr. Stefansson, and they will get the opportunity now that he has returned to Iceland, having been extradited on Friday. He returned to a country riveted by his case. Calls have poured into a tip line with theories about where the computers are stored and, until recently, where Mr. Stefansson may be found.   ''I can tell you the Icelandic public has been very interested,'' Olafur Kjartansson, the lead police investigator, said in an interview. ''I'm sitting in the public hot baths and friends and colleagues will say to me, 'Did you find him?'''   The theft suggests that security at some of Iceland's Bitcoin mining operations has yet to catch up to the value of the commodity, now trading at around $9,600 apiece. If the warehouse that was robbed were digging for gold instead of running an algorithm in a quest for cryptocurrency, odds are that the crime would have been far trickier to pull off.   Then again, this is Iceland, a place that seems to presume its citizens will abide by the law. An astonishing amount of social trust is embedded in society, a phenomenon that is especially evident when looking at the country's penal system.   Mr. Stefansson had been kept at Sogn, which is known as an open prison. Inmates live in their own rooms, which have flat-screen TVs, and talk on their own cellphones. During the day, inmates earn the equivalent of $4 an hour cooking, cleaning and maintaining a chicken coop.   ''It's a friendly atmosphere,'' said Gudmundur Thoroddsson, a prisoner advocate who was recently released from Sogn. ''There's a good relationship with the guards. Never any fighting or arguing.''   The prison is at the foot of a treeless hill and looks more like a rural two-story home than a penitentiary. During a recent visit, the entrance road was blocked by the sort of gate used by pay-by-the-hour parking garages. The property, which includes a soccer field, is surrounded by wire fencing a few feet high.   Mr. Stefansson wouldn't have needed a running start to jump it. The night he bolted, he started browsing for international flights on his cellphone at about 11, he said in the interview. After booking one under an assumed name, he opened his window and left. He claims that he walked a mile to Route 1, the road that rings the island, and hitchhiked 59 miles to Keflavik, a town near the airport. (The police maintain that an accomplice drove him.) From there, he called a cab.   Once in Stockholm, he traveled via train, taxi and ferry to Germany through Denmark. There he met ''individuals'' who drove him to Amsterdam. He enjoyed just three hours of freedom in the Dutch capital. Unbeknown to him, the local authorities had been quickly tipped off by two pedestrians with a cellphone photograph of a person they believed was the much-publicized wanted man. Soon after, an officer approached Mr. Stefansson and demanded identification.   ''I was just walking when it happened,'' he said.   The police in Iceland have said little about any evidence they have linking Mr. Stefansson to the computer theft. It was actually three separate thefts over the course of a few weeks, starting Dec. 5. One occurred at a compound near the airport, home to a handful of cryptocurrency mining warehouses leased to different companies. The warehouses look like hangars, though instead of containing jets these are densely packed with computers, numbered and neatly arranged on shelves. Giant fans hum noisily overhead.   ''If you spent a day here, you would probably go deaf,'' shouted Mia Molnar of Genesis Mining, which is based in Hong Kong and mines coins for Ethereum, a Bitcoin rival.   She was giving a tour of Genesis' warehouse and later, in a far quieter room, offered her best shot at explaining what all those computers are doing. The simplified version: They are engaged in a nonstop, worldwide race to process new transactions using cryptocurrencies, digital tokens that can be traded electronically. The task requires ever more powerful equipment. Success is rewarded, digitally and automatically, with a small batch of new coins.   Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been viewed warily by some governments and criticized by environmentalists for hoovering up vast and increasing amounts of electricity. Genesis and its competitors, on the other hand, see a financial opportunity, one that has sent the value of their mining equipment soaring.   ''I think a lot of companies have been more worried about hacks,'' Ms. Molnar said. ''Less about the hardware.''   The warehouse adjacent to Genesis' is the one that was robbed. The lessee of that building, which appears to be under construction, has not been publicly identified. Through the police, the company has offered $60,000 to anyone who leads detectives to the stolen property.   At the same time, the police have been searching for the machines by studying the electrical grid for surges in use. They have also followed up on ideas provided by the public, including one from a psychic. So far, said Mr. Kjartansson, the police investigator, the search has been fruitless.   His hunch, based on the sophistication of the theft, is that the perpetrators worked with an overseas syndicate of organized crime. Nothing in Mr. Stefansson's long record indicates international links of any kind. He has been convicted of possessing drugs and driving under the influence, and the grandest of his larcenies is the $2,000 he stole from slot machines in a Reykjavik bar.   He said in the interview that he had been sober for more than seven years and made apps and websites for a living. He minimized a recent arrest for growing marijuana as a ''side business.'' When he was arrested for the Bitcoin robbery, Mr. Stefansson said, he was two days away from restarting his life and moving to Spain with his wife and three children.   If Mr. Stefansson is ultimately charged with any heist-related crimes, his prison break won't be one of them. In Iceland, it is not against the law to escape from prison.   ''Our system supposes that a person who has been deprived of his freedom will try to regain it,'' said Jon Gunnlaugsson, a former judge on Iceland's Supreme Court. ''It's the responsibility of prison authorities to keep him there.''   Further, it is unclear whether the police had the right to continue holding Mr. Stefansson in prison in the first place. He was not under arrest at the time, because a judge's order to keep him in custody had expired hours before his escape. In advance of a hearing to extend the custody order, the police persuaded Mr. Stefansson to sign a document agreeing to stay in prison voluntarily.   He immediately decided the agreement was bogus. In an open letter published in an Icelandic daily while he was on the lam, he wrote that given the circumstances, he was genuinely surprised to find himself the subject of a manhunt.   Paradoxically, returning to the very place he was so eager to leave became one of Mr. Stefansson's primary goals. At the prison near Amsterdam, he said, he was just a name and number, underfed and wary of his fellow inmates.   By comparison, he said, ''Icelandic prisons are a hotel.''    "
Should the Fed Create Its Own Bitcoin? Hear Him Out,"Many enthusiasts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are motivated by deep skepticism of the central banks that control the world's money supply. But what if central banks themselves entered the game? What would happen if the Federal Reserve, or the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan used blockchain technology to create their own virtual currencies? Besides, that is, having some cryptocurrency fans' heads explode?    A former Fed governor -- who was also a finalist to lead the central bank -- thinks the idea deserves serious consideration.    ''Most central banks have a view that these crypto-assets are clever, like guys in the garage did it and it's kind of cool, or risky,'' given the potential investor losses and widespread fraud, said Kevin Warsh, who was a governor at the Fed from 2006 to 2011 and was a top contender to become its chairman late last year when President Trump instead appointed Jerome Powell.   If he had returned to the Fed, Mr. Warsh said, he would have appointed a team ''to think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin.''   ''Not that it would supplant and replace cash,'' he said, ''but it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy.''   He added that blockchain technology, which allows reliable, decentralized record keeping of transactions, could be useful in the payment systems operated by the Fed, which enable the transfer of trillions of dollars between banks.   ''It strikes me that a central bank digital currency might have a role to play there,'' Mr. Warsh, who is now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, told several reporters Thursday evening.   Some central banks are already doing work in this vein, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England. And Mr. Powell acknowledged the potential applications in his confirmation hearing for the Fed chairmanship in November, saying, ''We actually look at blockchain as something that may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.''   It would be quite a twist if a technology whose most ardent fans are motivated by distrust of central banks became a key tool for those banks.   But it would address some of the concerns connected to Bitcoin and its many privately created rivals. To the degree that the value of existing cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, they are ill-suited as a medium of exchange. Central banks have spent hundreds of years learning how to keep the value of money stable.   And to the degree Bitcoin and the like facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and fraud, they will be a target of global law enforcement. Central banks are used to building systems that allow enforcement of those laws.   It's clear that central banks weighing use of blockchain technology don't share the more anarchist impulses of some of the most die-hard cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But there may be more commonality than it might seem. As Mr. Warsh argues, if people really do believe that digital currencies in some form are the future of money, it would behoove central banks to treat them as more than a novelty.   ''Congress gave the Fed a monopoly over money,'' Mr. Warsh said. ''And if the next generation of cryptocurrencies look more like money and less like gold -- and have less volatility associated with them so they would be not just a speculative asset but could be a reliable unit of account -- as a purely defensive matter I wouldn't want somebody to take that monopoly from me.''   In other words, if cryptocurrency enthusiasts are correct that this technology could become a better way of carrying out even routine transactions, the Fed and its counterparts are the institutions that have the most to lose.    "
A Computer Chip Shortage Is Linked to 2 Tech Booms: A.I. and Digital Currencies,"Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz SAN FRANCISCO -- Two technology booms -- some people might call them frenzies -- are combining to turn a once-obscure type of microprocessor into a must-have but scarce commodity. Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin.    With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers.    ''The chips are simply going out of stock,'' said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft's research lab in Beijing in 2014. ''And the problem is getting worse.''   Malong, based in Shenzhen, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip.   When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier.   ''We need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive,'' Mr. Scott said. ''There is a tangible impact to our research work.''   But he did not blame other A.I. specialists for the shortage. He blamed cryptocurrency miners. ''We have never had this problem before,'' he said. ''It was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.''   G.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips.   Like Malong, those companies build what are called neural networks, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Large numbers of G.P.U.s, which consume relatively little electrical power and can be packed into a small space, can process the huge amounts of math required by neural networks more efficiently than standard chips.   Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining.   Crypto miners bought three million G.P.U. boards -- flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers -- worth $776 million last year, said Jon Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades.   That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners -- not to mention gamers -- has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G.P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day.   ''It is a tough moment,'' said Kevin Scott, Microsoft's chief technology officer. ''We could do more if we had more of these'' chips in data centers. ''There are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.''   AMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies say some of the current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company's annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia's chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough.   This has created an opportunity for many other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I.   Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices.   ''You want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability,'' said Mr. Scott of Microsoft.   The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year.   Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the Nvidia's technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing.   Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless.   Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow.   Mr. Zeiller said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures.   ''The demand,'' he said, ''is definitely crazy.''    "
"What's a CryptoKitty Worth? Try $140,000","On May 12, a crowd gathered in a former factory space in Queens for what was billed as the first-ever live auction of cryptocurrency-themed art. There were 10 works auctioned, but the big draw of the night was undoubtedly ''Celestial Cyber Dimension,'' an art piece with analog and digital components, which housed a CryptoKitty.    It was created by the art director of CryptoKitties, Guilherme Twardowski, who is known professionally as Guile Gaspar. His creation had been displayed at Christie's Auction House near a Basquiat earlier in the week.    A Christie's auctioneer was there to rally the attendees, many of whom were in town for a blockchain summit. Bidders could pay for the art in cryptocurrency or the American dollar; proceeds went to charity.   If you're wondering what a CryptoKitty is, and what kind of art it inspires, you're not alone.   Essentially, CryptoKitties are digital Beanie Babies -- collectible items that can be bought, sold, collected and traded with the cryptocurrency ether (which is generated by the Ethereum blockchain). Their value depends on how much people are willing to pay, but some command six figures.   They are part of a digital game of sorts: Players (i.e., Ethereum owners and enthusiasts) can purchase digital felines with certain attributes -- or ''cattributes,'' as they would call them -- like eye color, body size or pedigree.   They can then ''breed'' their digital pets with those of other players on the network, at an agreed-upon rate, to generate more cats. There's no guarantee to how the algorithmically produced kittens will appear. And because they are linked to the Ethereum blockchain, each new cat is assigned a generation. A limited number of highly desirable early-generation kitties commands the highest sales prices and ''stud fees.''   All of this probably sounds highly abstract. So, for what it's worth, the CryptoKitties themselves are awfully cute.   Aw.   Mr. Twardowski's CryptoKitty art piece looked something like a giant computer chip. A pixelated image of a first-generation CryptoKitty was embedded in a physical structure -- a hardware wallet assembled by the engineer Richard Moore -- that contained an ERC-721 token. In non-crypto speak, that essentially means there were lines of computer code in the artwork that proved the origin and ownership of the CryptoKitty. (The digital cat itself is purple and goggle-eyed, and around its neck, it wears an attractive orb.)   Attendees were eager to see how high the price would go. As bids for this most coveted lot rose from $10,000 to quickly surpass the $100,000 mark, the crowd roared with adrenaline.   Mike Novogratz -- a former hedge funder who had already acquired a print that read ''HODL,'' a misspelling of the word ''hold,'' for $8,000 -- was willing to outbid everyone in the room for it. ''Turn off the internet,'' he joked, trying to shut out online bidders.   In the end, he was bested. A buyer outbid him with an offer online of $140,000.   The buyer, Igor Barinov, turned out to be physically present in the room, as well. There were a number of reasons he spent so much on his CryptoKitty, he said: A love of the game, the cat's physical attributes, the real-life nature of the auction, and the fact that it was going to charity.   From his phone, he transferred $140,000 worth of ether and surreptitiously met the artists backstage to claim his prize.   Later, he reflected on his win over email: ''It's a cat number 127, which is a prime number and has some particular meaning for geeks like us.''   And who knows? Maybe Mr. Barinov got a bargain.   Mr. Novogratz, the former hedge funder who stopped bidding at $115,000, said, ''In 10 years, I think it's going to be worth millions.''    "
The Man Who Would Be a Coin,"Kevin Abosch wanted to turn himself into a coin. Why? Because he sold a photograph of a potato.    Let's back up.   Mr. Abosch, 48, is an Irish conceptual artist and photographer who lives in New York. He is also interested in the blockchain, the technology best known for its use in virtual currencies like Bitcoin and ether. The strange culture surrounding these cryptocurrencies is increasingly making its way into art, in works that explore value, decentralization and the buzz around digital money.   Which brings us back to ''Potato #345,'' a photo that made headlines around the world after Mr. Abosch said it was purchased by a European businessman in 2015 for a million euros, or about $1.08 million. On the one hand, the attention generated by the sale was exciting, he said. ''On the other hand, the focus shifts from the artistic value to monetary value of the work, and for most artists the art is an extension of the artist, so you yourself start to feel commodified,'' Mr. Abosch said. ''In order to sort of control that, I began to think of myself as a coin.''    Mr. Abosch turned to the blockchain, which essentially records a series of transactions across a large, open network of computers. The Ethereum blockchain allows coders to create virtual tokens, which can be transferred between users. They're not always currencies, exactly, but something like them.   Mr. Abosch created 10 million tokens in January. ''But I didn't want to just make these 10 million pieces of virtual art,'' he said. ''I wanted them to be connected to my body.''   So, he had six vials of his blood drawn. He stamped the contract address -- a long string of numbers and letters indicating where the tokens effectively live on the blockchain -- onto 100 pieces of paper, in blood. And he called the project ''IAMA Coin.'' He said he believes that he has ''successfully connected my physical body to the virtual works'' in such a way that he sees the art ''as pieces of me.''   Michael Connor, the artistic director of Rhizome, a center affiliated with the New Museum that aims to foster ''digital-born art and culture,'' said that he's seen a flurry of crypto-related projects in the past year.   ''Blockchain seems like it has some sort of potential to offer a different economic logic that structures society, and so a lot of artists are interested in the social implications of blockchain and crypto,'' he said.   Mr. Abosch's works -- and how they're bought and sold -- capture some of the strange ethos of the world of crypto: A former tech executive recently paid more than the price of a real Lamborghini for a neon sculpture Mr. Abosch made of a blockchain address that symbolized Lamborghinis.   The piece, ''YELLOW LAMBO'' (2018), made news much like Mr. Abosch's potato photo did. (The marriage of conceptual art, capitalism and the internet is a reliable generator of ''How can this be?'' headlines.) The work is a reference to a half-serious joke in the crypto community about using profits to buy Lamborghinis.   ''I became familiar with #lambo as a declaration of success-identity, and because I always think in terms of how to distill emotions around value, I wanted to explore that,'' Mr. Abosch said. He created another token, called YLAMBO, and turned its address into a physical sculpture in yellow neon. This sculpture then sold for $400,000 at a San Francisco art fair to Michael Jackson, the former chief operating officer of Skype.   The meta-weirdness around the purchase of the art is at the heart of the questions Mr. Abosch wants to explore.   ''You meet people in the crypto world who throw millions into coins backed by nothing, but don't understand how a piece of art has any value,'' he said. ''Then you meet people in the art world who don't understand why you would invest money in art that has no physical manifestation. That's where it gets exciting for me.''   He has a foot in both the art and tech worlds, and experiments with their intersection; while he works, Mr. Abosch has been wearing an electroencephalogram, or EEG cap, which can measure electrical activity in the brain. He wrote in an email that this is ''an attempt to understand to what extent ego is engaged or how it colors work, particularly when I'm photographing humans.''   He added, ''I have a sense that my ego is disengaged at the moment I press the shutter release, but this is just a theory.''   Some of Mr. Abosch's work has no visual presence whatsoever. ''Forever Rose,'' although inspired by a photograph of a flower, exists only as a single blockchain token that sold to 10 people in February for a total of $1 million. Mr. Abosch said this seems to him ''the purest form of art -- it's the idea, without the baggage of a vessel.'' He said wryly, ''When I get pushback sometimes from people, I suggest they might have an unhealthy relationship with the material.''   To some, these projects might seem like stunts. But the art world is starting to take them seriously. An extension of Mr. Abosch's ''IAMA Coin,'' titled ''Personal Effects,'' recently showed at the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. And at a recent Rhizome conference, Seven on Seven, three crypto projects were unveiled, Mr. Connor said. In one, two artists played with the idea of uploading a religion onto the blockchain.   ''I think that it's such a weird field at the moment, so art is evolving really quickly in response to it,'' Mr. Connor said.   Mr. Abosch, meanwhile, is tokenizing Manhattan. For a soon-to-be-unveiled project, he has created 10,000 blockchain tokens for every street in Manhattan, then printed the contract addresses on a 6-foot-tall map. This month, collectors will be able to buy the tokens, or virtual artworks, for a few dollars each. More projects are on the way.   ''Whatever this is,'' Mr. Abosch said, ''I'm right in the middle of it.''    "
Rebellion's New Phase: Bannon Bets on Bitcoin,"Follow Jeremy W. Peters and Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @jwpetersNYT and @nathanielpopper. WASHINGTON -- Stephen K. Bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to President Trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site Breitbart News, is betting that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way Mr. Trump disrupted American politics. Mr. Bannon won't reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans -- he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground.    But he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, Bannon & Company. And in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a ''good stake'' in Bitcoin.    In a small gathering of academics at Harvard University this spring, he even floated the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the ''deplorables coin.'' The name is a nod to Hillary Clinton's description of Mr. Trump's supporters as ''a basket of deplorables.''   The work that Mr. Bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. But he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies -- generally outside the United States.   The offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and the most staid institutions of Wall Street.   It is not a shocking place for Mr. Bannon, 64, to plot his re-emergence. Cryptocurrencies have many of the characteristics that drew him into Tea Party politics: They break old rules, they exist on the periphery and they pose a challenge to the powerful figures and institutions that have long called the shots.   ''It's disruptive populism,'' Mr. Bannon said in the interview at his Capitol Hill townhouse in Washington. ''It takes control back from central authorities. It's revolutionary.''   Even though he has no formal ties to the business anymore, Mr. Bannon still refers to his townhouse as the Breitbart Embassy, the nickname given to it because so much of the site's business was done there.   While Breitbart editors and writers no longer linger at all hours inside the embassy, remnants of the website remain in Breitbart mementos hanging from the wall and coffee mugs with the signature block B logo strewn about the kitchen. Mr. Bannon still accepts a steady stream of visitors who provide him intelligence and gossip from the conservative circles he once commanded. But these days he is just as likely to be convening meetings there on his new financial venture.   He won't talk about a possible return to politics someday. His messy rupture with the White House over critical comments he made in Michael Wolff's book ''Fire and Fury'' about colleagues and Donald Trump Jr. is still too fresh. But he does see a political component to virtual currency.   ''It was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency,'' Mr. Bannon said.   His vision for virtual currency has elements of his unorthodox ideology. He sounds like both an avowed libertarian who wants government out of his life and a progressive who wants Wall Street held to account when he insists that virtual currencies can help citizens take back power from the central banks that ''debase your currency'' and make citizens ''slaves to debt.''   His focus on creating new digital tokens, which are usually offered through initial coin offerings, puts him squarely in the edgiest, most scam-filled slice of the cryptocurrency business.   New companies have raised billions through these I.C.O.s, which allow them to bypass regulators and other middlemen and go straight to investors. That has also led to plenty of scams, and authorities throughout the world are starting to crack down.   Mr. Bannon's involvement in cryptocurrencies has raised eyebrows among people trying to move the business toward the mainstream. They fear he will further cement the technology's reputation as a plaything of fringe elements.   ''It almost seems like a natural progression for a man who gained prominence by shoveling out unfounded conspiracies to now shilling complex technology and financial instruments to an unsophisticated investing public,'' said Colin Platt, a cryptocurrency researcher and adviser.   Bitcoin are stored and moved around a global network of computers that allows for the system to work without relying on a central authority. That lack of oversight has made Bitcoin a favorite method of payment for online drug markets and ransom schemes.   Bitcoin has been popular with the alt-right and nationalist communities because it has provided them with a way to receive online donations and evade restrictions put on them by banks and payment companies. PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, shut down the accounts of some right-wing groups last year.   Cryptocurrencies are also gaining mainstream interest. Goldman Sachs, where Mr. Bannon worked in the 1980s, recently said it was creating a Bitcoin trading operation. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been looking at building an exchange for digital tokens. And Facebook has put top executives on a project exploring use of the technology.   These big companies are generally trying to take the technology away from its radical political roots. But Mr. Bannon is hoping to embrace those roots. ''Control of the currency,'' he said, ''is control of everything.''   Timothy Lewis, a hedge fund manager who met with Mr. Bannon to talk about cryptocurrencies last month, said he was impressed with the degree to which Mr. Bannon had delved into the details of the technology and the challenges it faces.   ''I didn't know what to expect going in, but he had clearly done his homework,'' said Mr. Lewis, who is a co-founder of the Ikigai hedge fund, which invests in cryptocurrency projects. He said they had talked about the laws governing new cryptocurrencies and a few initial coin offerings that had recently raised money from investors.   Mr. Bannon is particularly interested in the possibility that countries could create coins tied to national wealth -- an Italian coin tied to marble deposits in the country, for instance.   He found his way into the virtual currency universe through Brock Pierce, a former child actor who appeared in films like ''The Mighty Ducks'' before starting a company in Hong Kong that sold the virtual gold that players use in the video game World of Warcraft.   The company, Internet Gaming Entertainment, or IGE, brought on Mr. Bannon as vice chairman in 2005 to help Mr. Pierce expand the business and deal with legal threats.   Mr. Bannon credits the company with introducing him to the ranks of disaffected young men who gathered online around video games, and who became pillars of the alt-right movement.   Since leaving IGE in 2007, Mr. Pierce has become involved with a wide array of virtual currency projects, including an effort to create a cryptocurrency enclave in Puerto Rico that takes advantage of the island's low taxes, and a new virtual currency known as EOS, which has raised over $3 billion.   Mr. Bannon said he would have gotten involved with Mr. Pierce and cryptocurrencies back in 2016 if the Trump campaign hadn't intervened.   Mr. Pierce's big claims for cryptocurrencies -- and a recent turn toward new age spiritualism -- have made him a target for critics. John Oliver, on his HBO comedy show, recently held up Mr. Pierce as an emblem of the bombast that floats around the virtual currency community. After the segment, the company that created EOS said Mr. Pierce had left the company.   Mr. Bannon is not bothered by the mockery. Other causes he has taken on have worked out well despite low expectations.   ''These guys are visionaries,'' he said.    "
Demystifying the Blockchain,"This is bonkers. A new so-called blockchain company is selling virtual real estate online with prices as high as $120,000 for a 10-meter by 10-meter piece of virtual land. You can buy a plot of virtual land in a virtual city, with certain neighborhoods costing more than others, like in a real city. Except that it isn't a real city. It is all virtual. Follow? Me neither. Somehow this company, Decentraland, managed to raise $26 million in 30 seconds from investors last year. That money isn't ''virtual'' -- it is real.     Welcome to the world of blockchain, the latest technological revolution to those in-the-know -- and what seems like the latest get-rich-quick gibberish to the average person.   You've probably heard that the blockchain is a technology that is going to change the world -- it is the backbone of Bitcoin, the now infamous cryptocurrency. You might even have heard someone trying to explain blockchain by describing it as a ''trusted distributed ledger.''   If you're like most people, that's when you stopped understanding -- or even trying to understand -- what this whole blockchain thing is all about. (Stick with me for a moment and I promise you'll understand it very soon.)   It all feels a bit like 1999, circa the dot-com bubble. In Cannes, France, just last week, at an annual gathering of advertisers, there was a ''blockchain yacht'' and a ''blockchain villa.'' In Davos, Switzerland, earlier this year, there was a ''blockchain lounge.''   [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here's what you need to know.]   Meanwhile, Fortune 500 companies are investing billions in the blockchain. IBM has a whole division focused on blockchain, as do the consultancies Accenture and PwC. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, has dismissed Bitcoin, but says ''the blockchain is real.''   Silicon Valley venture capitalists have already sunk more than $1.3 billion into blockchain technology just this year. And just this week, Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent technology firms founded, in part, by Marc Andreessen -- who is credited with inventing the modern Web browser -- announced a $300 million ''crypto'' fund to exclusively invest in blockchain technologies.   ''For those of us who have been involved in software for a long time, it feels like the early days of the internet, web 2.0, or smartphones all over again,'' Mr. Andreessen and his colleagues said when introducing the fund.   That explanation of where this new technology sits within history feels right: While prognosticators love to talk about crypto and blockchain as a bubble, it is likely just very early days. And while 1999 marked what seemed like a high point for the internet before a precipitous fall, it proved to only be the first stage of the internet's ascendance. Yes, there were implosions like Pets.com, but there was also Amazon.   And what was arguably considered wild overspending in the late 1990s on internet infrastructure and an assortment of experimental companies, ultimately set the foundation for the modern era we live in today.   Think about blockchain like this: There will be huge failures and misspent money -- and yes, scams (the Securities and Exchange Commission can hardly keep up with the number of fraudulent players out there), but a decade from now, when you look back at 2018, it's more likely than not that blockchain will be embedded in our day-to-day lives in ways that, today, we can't even imagine.   ''New models of computing have tended to emerge every 10 to 15 years: mainframes in the 60s, PCs in the late 70s, the internet in the early 90s, and smartphones in the late 2000s,'' Mr. Andreessen said. And now blockchain.   The easiest and most basic way to think about the underlying technology is to think about a technology that keeps a master list of everyone who has ever interacted with it. It's a bit of an oversimplification, but if you've ever used Google Docs and allowed others to share the document so they can make changes, the programs keep a list of all the changes that are made to the document and by whom. Blockchain does that but in an even more secure way so that every person who ever touches the document is trusted and everyone gets a copy of all the changes made so there is never a question about what happened along the way. There aren't multiple copies of a document and different versions -- there is only one trusted document and you can keep track of everything that's ever happened to it.   The blockchain is, of course, being used to create all sorts of cryptocurrencies, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum.   But more important, it is touching all different industries.   The advertising industry plans to use it to track its ads all over the internet; the music industry is planning to use it to track songs; banks and mortgage companies want to use it to track the deeds of homes and the complicated process of tracking all the documentation; shipping companies are investing in blockchain technology to track bills of lading, the pharmaceutical industry wants to use the technology to verify the drug supply chain.   If it is successful, blockchain technology will bring a new level of enhanced trust to business and will also cut out the middlemen that have historically tracked -- and profited -- from the complexity of so many different systems trying to communicate with each other. That could lower prices for goods and services.   At the same time, for all the promise of blockchain, there are real questions about whether it may be applied to solve problems that don't exist. Databases already exist and, in certain cases, a centralized database might actually be preferable to the blockchain.   The blockchain is ultimately about solving society's ultimate challenge: trust. Or rather, lack of trust. Blockchain is about using technology to create a shared sense of trust by a group of disparate participants.   The biggest question is whether the hundreds of projects like Decentraland, where individuals are using real money to buy virtual property, will end well or badly -- and whether that experience will ultimately instill or undermine trust in this emerging technology.

"Despite Caution, Investors Are Bullish","For decades, the path to success for start-ups was clear: raise money from venture capitalists, and either start trading in the public markets or sell to a bigger competitor. These days, however, there's a buzzy alternative that carries ever-growing promises: the initial coin offering, or I.C.O.    No longer do companies have to sell shares in themselves to big investment firms. Coin offerings let start-ups go directly to individual investors over the internet, selling digital currencies akin to Bitcoin that can be used for some service that the companies build.   The pitch for such offerings: eliminating the hassle of dealing with venture capitalists and investment bankers, while also avoiding the thicket of regulations that accompany traditional initial public offerings. In the best-case scenario, proponents say, coin offerings are far more democratic than what came before.    But while I.C.O.s have become bigger and bigger business -- the Russian messaging service Telegram alone raised nearly $2 billion earlier this year -- skepticism, particularly from regulators eager to crack down on what they view as plentiful fraud, has cast clouds on the most fervent of expectations on the new way of raising money.   ''I have real concern on lack of transparency, oversight and accountability that these companies have as they're going out to raise capital through an I.C.O.,'' Adena Friedman, the chief executive of Nasdaq, said at an industry conference last week.   And the Securities and Exchange Commission has scrutinized these offerings closely, sending out subpoenas over several such deals even as officials say that they remain open to the fund-raising concept.   What's indisputable is that coin offerings are quickly growing in popularity. Roughly 309 offerings have been held this year, raising $10.3 billion, according to the data provider TokenData, compared with 77 offerings that raised $1.2 billion during the period last year.   That is catching up to the amount of money raised by initial public offerings, where companies hire investment bankers to help sell shares to investors and trade on the public markets. I.P.O.s in the United States raised $15.6 billion in the first three months of this year, the biggest quarterly haul in three years, according to Renaissance Capital, which tracks I.P.O.s.   But many entrepreneurs say they believe that, at least for them, coin offerings make more sense as a way to raise money than the old ways of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.   The attraction for some companies is simple: It's a potentially bigger version of a Kickstarter campaign, raising money from backers without giving up any voting control by selling stock. The tokens that investors receive differ from traditional company shares in that they offer no say in how the company is run, so buyers are betting that their value will rise as the digital currencies get used more.   And the process of selling a coin offering is relatively simple, where companies create their own cryptocurrency, write a document known as a white paper to describe the service that they're building and hope enough people are interested in buying into the sale.   Still, other entrepreneurs saw something much more interesting in I.C.O.s.   For Ted Livingston, coin offerings were just what he had been looking for. His messaging service, Kik, has grown steadily over its nearly decade-old existence, but has no hope of displacing rivals like Facebook. And Mr. Livingston has no interest in trying to make money from selling advertising, as much of the social network industry does.   Trying to sell that to public investors seems fruitless. But a coin offering could allow Kik to create its own token and sell it to backers, who would find and create uses for it in the company's own ecosystem.   Last year, Kik sold nearly $100 million worth of its token, known as Kin.   Mr. Livingston said that the hope was to create an entire digital economy based on Kin, with his company betting on its own holdings of the cryptocurrency eventually swelling in value.   ''Your value at the end of the day is how valuable the asset is multiplied by the amount of the asset you own,'' he said in an interview.   That view is echoed by other supporters of token sales, like Chris Dixon of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, who has argued that coin offerings represent a way to incentivize users, developers and service providers to grow the platforms on which these tokens live.   Still, the ease with which companies have been able to raise money has worried critics, who say that too many coin offerings are essentially scams. Many of these offerings, skeptics say, offer so little documentation as to throw up a host of red flags.   ''It's kind of comical how poor the disclosure is,'' said Matt Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital. ''It says you can't trust anything in this prospectus to the full extent of the law.''   Even offerings from well-known companies like Telegram are for services that are years away from completion, leaving many participants in these offerings essentially serving as speculators -- and losing out if the products promised by sellers fail.   The coin offering industry has also been waiting for regulators to crack down on the sales as well. China is among the countries that have banned such deals outright. And Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has testified that most I.C.O.s should have been registered as securities offerings with regulators, which would have subjected them to far greater scrutiny.   Then there was Centra, a start-up promoted by the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., whose founders, Sam Sharma and Robert Farkas, were arrested in April. In its lawsuit against the men, the S.E.C. argued that Mr. Sharma and Mr. Farkas deceived investors.   It is that sort of behavior that prompted Ms. Friedman, the Nasdaq chief executive, to say that coin offerings pose real issues, particularly to the average investor who tends to participate in them.   ''To make it no rules at all, when companies can just willy-nilly take people's money and offer no information at all, with no governance, that sounds to me like you're taking advantage of people,'' she said last week.   And some skeptics say that traditional fund-raising methods for companies will endure. Neil Rimer, a co-founder of the investment firm Index Ventures, argued that traditional venture capital backers could give entrepreneurs experience and business connections. The biggest technology darlings, including Uber and Airbnb, are still planning to hold mammoth initial public offerings as soon as next year.   There is one other potential issue for initial coin offerings: Through more regulations and the entrance of established investment giants, such deals look less and less like the democratic offerings their biggest fans say they are.   For instance, Telegram's blockbuster coin offering was restricted to well-known, sophisticated firms like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins.   Nevertheless, Ms. Friedman hasn't ruled out having Nasdaq host trading of cryptocurrencies, such as those sold in coin offerings, someday. And even investors who have looked critically at these kinds of deals acknowledge that there is some use for them.   ''Our feeling is that this is too powerful an idea and a technology to try to quash,'' Mr. Rimer said. But, he added, ''Regulators do need to find a way to live with it and to put a framework around it to avoid egregious blowups.''    "
Industry Frustrated by Regulation,"In a parable from ancient India, six blind men touch different parts of an elephant, like its trunk, leg or tusk, and come up with wildly divergent ideas about what the animal is -- a snake, for example, or a tree or a spear. And so it is with regulators in the rapidly evolving crypto space, who are coming up with wildly divergent ideas about what it is and how to regulate it.    The tumult hit peak farce in a couple of televised congressional hearings in the winter and spring that the crypto crowd turned into memes.   (One of the hearings made J. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an overnight hero for his testimony calling for thoughtful regulation of cryptocurrencies, with some Reddit users calling for a Giancarlo coin.) But they haven't produced clarity.    Asked to describe the current state of crypto regulation in the United States, Perianne Boring, president and founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an industry group, said, ''It's unorganized and incredibly complicated, and it's really putting the U.S. at risk of falling behind from an innovation and technology perspective. There are turf wars between the different regulatory agencies and turf wars between the feds and the states, and none of this is in the best interest of the U.S. or the blockchain technology industry.''   Two of the biggest issues that touch an alphabet soup of regulators are securities law and taxation.   Most pressing in the securities realm is the question of whether projects raising funds with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether should be subject to federal registration and disclosure requirements.   The fund-raising mechanism, known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., has made it easier for entrepreneurs to raise large sums of money without the hassles of regulators, investor protections or accountants.   The coin offerings were inspired by initial public offerings, or I.P.O.s, that companies use to sell stock to investors.   But unlike stock offerings, coin offerings are generally designed so that investors don't get an ownership stake in the projects. If the coin does provide an ownership stake, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, the companies must comply with all securities law. A few coins have done this, but most have tried to avoid it.   So complex has the securities question become that some law firms have decided they are no longer able to give guidance on whether a unit of cryptocurrency -- or token -- sold in an I.C.O. would be deemed a security. (However, the S.E.C. did recently clarify that Ether, in its current form, is not a security, though the agency sidestepped the question of whether its crowdsale constituted a securities offering.) Or they are advising that clients sell their tokens outside the United States. Another option would be to force token issuers to structure all their sales as securities offerings.   Two crypto unicorns, Coinbase and Circle, recently announced moves that would enable them to help customers buy and sell security tokens.   The state of Wyoming has addressed the issue by passing laws that carve out a new category of what crypto enthusiasts typically call ''utility tokens.''   The Wyoming law stipulates such tokens cannot be marketed as investments, and the issuers need to make reasonable efforts to prevent buyers from buyinging tokens as an investment. While some experts say they believe the new Wyoming laws suggest a path forward, others are proposing self regulation.   In a recent speech, Brian Quintenz, a C.F.T.C. commissioner, proposed ''a private cryptocurrency oversight body,'' or self-regulatory organization.   Ms. Boring of the digital commerce chamber said, ''It would have some oversight to a U.S. government agency or entity and congressional authority to levy fees and fines, and would have the actual teeth to be a regulator, but it would be an industry group.''   Donna Faulk-White, a spokeswoman at the C.F.T.C., said in an email that in Mr. Giancarlo's testimony on crypto assets to the Senate Banking Committee, he ''expressed the view that policymakers should explore potential improvements to the existing patchwork approach to regulating spot markets for virtual currencies. Any such effort should be thoughtful and deliberative, however, which means that there is an opportunity for industry participants to develop standards that could inform policy discussions and benefit retail market participants.''   ''We are not yet in a position to suggest or advocate for legislation, but the chairman would view proper, effective and balanced self-regulatory efforts favorably,'' Ms. Faulk-White said.   Another area getting regulator's attention is taxation. In late 2016, the Internal Revenue Service asserted that holders of crypto assets are evading taxes and asked for the data, even customer chat logs, on all of Coinbase's users over three years, causing privacy advocates to protest. After a legal battle, in November 2017 a court restricted the order to customers who had more than $20,000 in annual transactions on the platform.   In an email, the I.R.S. wrote, ''The I.R.S. generally does not discuss its ongoing compliance efforts to avoid providing assistance to those taxpayers trying to avoid their tax obligations.''   On the flip side, industry players complain that crypto assets are taxed as property, subject to capital gains tax, rather than as a currency, which is subject to ordinary income tax. To pay capital gains tax, users would have to record the dollar exchange rates for when they acquired their cryptocurrency and when they disposed of it -- even for transactions in which, say, Bitcoin was used to pay for coffee.   Ms. Boring said this had hampered the adoption of cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services.   ''If those taxes didn't exist where you have to report the valuation on every transaction, we would see a huge amount of activity and people using cryptocurrencies for payment,'' she said.   The chamber says cryptocurrencies and crypto assets should be taxed as an alternative to currency in the form of sales tax and income tax. Another blockchain advocacy group, Coin Center, supports a minimum exemption on transactions below $600 and also suggests that the I.R.S. make it easy for crypto exchanges to ''give a right kind of reporting to their customers so they can easily report what they owe,'' said Jerry Brito, the executive director.   I.C.O. issuers also are unhappy with taxation. While some regulators say the tokens that issuers release are securities, the issuers don't necessarily get the tax benefit that a company having an initial public offering would receive.   ''You've got the S.E.C. saying that things may be securities, but then your tax treatment isn't treating you as though it's a security,'' Joshua Ashley Klayman of law firm Klayman LLC, said. ''Your tax treatment is as though it's property, so you've got the onerousness of something potentially being a security, but you don't get the benefit from a tax perspective.''   Among the many remaining regulatory issues surrounding crypto assets, are state and federal regulations. To operate nationwide, many crypto start-ups need to obtain what are called money transmission licenses from 53 states and territories.   ''There is still today, in March 2018, not one company that has been able to get money transmitter licenses across the entire United States,'' Ms. Boring said. ''It is a complete regulatory failure and breakdown.''   Mr. Brito of Coin Center said going state by state was expensive, time-consuming and somewhat outdated for the internet era. Adding in the federal agencies, start-ups are required to deal with more than 60 regulators for the money transmission issue alone.   ''The state-by-state money transmission licensing regime makes no sense in a world where you have internet companies that are providing services not just on a national scale but a global scale,'' he said. ''It makes no sense to regulate them locality by locality, so we think a federal solution would be better.''   However, no such proposal is in the works, and a so-called national ''fintech charter'' on the table at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, likely would not work for any but the most well-capitalized crypto companies, Mr. Brito said. The charter is a federal license that would enable money transmissions without having to get state licenses.   ''Good actors are trying to comply,'' Ms. Klayman said. ''If good actors can't figure out how to comply, and feel safe about complying, then they're going to consider avoiding the U.S. for their transactions.''    "
Overstock's Business Evolution,"If you know Overstock.com only from its pop-up ads, internet searches or even its television commercials, you might think it's just an online retailer selling some cool-looking furniture. But you'd be wrong. That description is as outdated as a chintz sofa.    The company, created almost 20 years ago, has been a pioneer in the mysterious world of cryptocurrency. It was the first major retailer to accept Bitcoin and it's trying very hard right now to make an even bigger bet by selling off its retail arm and concentrating on the blockchain technology that not only supports cryptocurrency but could revolutionize an array of business sectors.   Its founder and chief executive, Patrick Byrne, thinks there's a bigger future in using the blockchain for trading in capital markets, voting, protecting property rights and more.    The plan is a bold one that is not without risks. The stock, which has risen steadily, dropped sharply earlier this year in the midst of overall uncertainty about the valuation of cryptocurrency. But it has stabilized and is now trading at nearly double its price last June.   Mr. Byrne seems undaunted despite the gyrations. ''When we started off we were proud of saying we're not a tech company, we're a lemonade stand with a computer in it,'' he said.   [Read more: Confused about blockchains? Here's what you need to know.]   But now, ''it's a logical time to sell our e-commerce business -- to cash in my chips and do this crypto stuff on my own. I want to share the upside with my shareholders.'' Mr. Byrne, along with his extended family, owns roughly 30 percent of Overstock.   The evolution of Overstock has been both deliberate and serendipitous. The company initially relied on third-party technology for its sales, but more than 10 years ago it began building its own. A turning point came in late 2013 when Mr. Byrne gathered together a group of Overstock programmers to figure out how to accept Bitcoin for purchases. They moved quickly; within a month, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept the cryptocurrency.   Bitcoin was never the end goal, he said; instead, it was only the first step in seeing what was possible with the nascent blockchain technology. Nearly five years later, the company generates from $68,000 to $120,000 in cryptocurrency revenues weekly. That translates to roughly ''0.2 percent of our revenue,'' Mr. Byrne said, adding that Overstock ''converts a lot of that into dollars.''   The handful of programmers and developers who came up with the initial Bitcoin capability has grown into a corps of about 65, based at the company's new headquarters, which was built on a former Superfund site about 12 miles from Salt Lake City.   In 2014, the company created a subsidiary, Medici Ventures, to manage and oversee its investments in blockchain-related firms. It was named for the Medici Bank of Florence -- a pioneer of the double entry bookkeeping that revolutionized money and banking in the Renaissance.   One of the investment results was tZero, described in the company's most recent quarterly report, as comprising a ''financial technology company, two related registered broker dealers, a registered investment adviser and an accredited investor verification company.'' More colloquially, Mr. Byrne describes tZero as the place where ''blockchain meets capital markets.''   The name tZero stems from the initial goal -- to trade securities that settle immediately, rather than after the three-day waiting period that existed under federal securities rules. (That time period was shortened to two days last September.) After several years of working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create the system, tZero got the regulatory go-ahead in December 2016, and a small class of Overstock equity is trading via that technology.   But that platform was itself upended by last year's proliferation of initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, which have created an alternative way to raise capital. Responding to the turnabout, tZero began focusing on the technology needed to develop a platform to trade the so-called coins or tokens created in offerings. And to raise capital, tZero itself designed what Mr. Byrne calls a security token offering -- as opposed to an I.C.O. -- saying that it complies with federal securities law.   Whether the S.E.C. agrees with that characterization is an open question. Earlier this year, the commission escalated its oversight of I.C.O.s, asserting that many were really equity offerings in disguise. TZero is among those under investigation, Mr. Byrne acknowledged. But he called the heightened S.E.C. oversight ''long overdue'' for a market he viewed as rife with fraud and he expressed confidence that tZero's offering was properly done.   He said he was looking forward to meeting with the S.E.C. again -- a not-so-veiled reference to the agency's investigations into Overstock following several earnings restatements roughly a decade ago. No action has been taken against Overstock in the past.   The S.E.C.'s current investigation, on which the agency has declined to comment, hasn't slowed tZero's expansion efforts. Mr. Byrne recently met with potential investors overseas but hasn't yet disclosed how much money has been raised. In addition to technology under development, in May, tZero and Box Digital Markets announced a joint venture to create what they say is the ''industry's first regulated security token exchange.''   Medici Ventures has backed other companies as well. With its president, Jonathan Johnson, a former Overstock board chairman from 2014 to 2017, Medici has so far invested an undisclosed amount in 13 blockchain companies.   Among those is Bitt, a Barbados-based start-up that aims to serve people without bank accounts by creating digital wallets that would circumvent the need for the accounts or for credit cards. The market could be a large one. The World Bank recently found that 1.7 billion adults do not have bank accounts, although two-thirds of those own mobile phones.   The company recently invested in Finclusive, which seeks to serve the estimated 7 percent of households in the United States without banking accounts as well as the approximately 20 percent of households that have a checking or savings account, but no other financial products through the banking system. The company, according to its website, connects financial service professionals with those currently underserved by the finance industry.   Medici's portfolio extends beyond the financial technology sector, including start-ups such as Voatz, a Boston-based company that seeks to secure voting via smartphones and blockchain. According to Mr. Johnson, colleges, unions and some municipalities, have tested the technology, which, he said, provided privacy and security through the use of biometrics and an ability to confirm that one's vote had been counted.   Most recently, West Virginia became the first state to test the technology in its recent primary election, allowing overseas members of the military to cast their votes. Michael Queen, a spokesman for the West Virginia secretary of state, said in an email that ''a comprehensive audit is being conducted to evaluate the security of the blockchain used for the mobile application.''   Six ago, Mr. Byrne and Medici formed a joint venture with the Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto Polar, a longtime proponent of protecting property rights -- especially for people in developing nations, where the rights are often exploited.   Mr. Byrne said he sought out Mr. De Soto, cultivating a friendship that resulted in De Soto Inc., a so-called social benefit company that would use blockchain to record property ownership.   Even with the prospect of selling its retail arm, Overstock continues to invest in its e-commerce efforts, including working on efficiency in its supply chain and adding a new distribution center to improve its two-day shipping.   Although it's clear from interviews and earnings calls that Mr. Byrne's sights are set on cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology, he cautions this is not an asset class for the general public.   ''While I wax enthusiastic, and while there's a pony in there somewhere, the public should stay away from cryptocurrency. At least until the S.E.C. gets its arms around it,'' he said.    "

If Money Managers Back Bitcoin,"Omid Malekan is the author of ''The Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner's Guide to the Technology Nobody Understands.'' A few years ago, I asked a friend at a major Wall Street trading desk if her colleagues ever talked about cryptocurrencies. She responded that one person would occasionally bring up Bitcoin, then the room would clear out. This was during Wall Street's ''Bitcoin is stupid'' period, which fell between the initial, ''I don't understand it'' era and the more recent ''it's a bubble'' phase. Since the advent of the first cryptocurrency nine years ago, professional money managers have almost universally dismissed it as a potential investment. Although many have come around on the power of the underlying technology, cryptocurrencies have often been ignored or ridiculed.    Last year, as the price gains of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether were generating daily headlines, some fund managers went on the attack, calling the sector a pyramid scheme. Although they probably really felt that way, they might have also been a little jealous. Wall Street money managers are not used to standing on the sidelines while amateurs get rich off something the pros don't really understand, or worst yet, own.    For the crypto faithful on the other hand, it's always been a question of when, not if, the rest of the world catches on. Their faith (despite the volatility) has put them on the right side of a powerful investment thesis, one best phrased as a question:   What happens when institutional money managers, who collectively control most of the world's investment capital, enter a new asset class for the first time?   The answer lies in basic math. Institutions control so much money that they own half a trillion dollars' worth of Apple alone, and that's just one stock within a single asset class. If all the hedge funds and family offices out there decided to commit a fraction of that capital to a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, they may double the size of the sector.   I've been making that argument to friends who work in institutional finance for years, but they've always brushed me off, and for good reason. Contrary to what an outsider might think, people who manage other people's money don't base their decisions on how to maximize returns. Their first consideration is whether they could justify their actions should something go wrong.   This is a smart way for individual managers to make investment decisions, even if the combined effect is a lot of groupthink and the familiar cycle of booms and busts. Traders who lost money in mortgages in 2007 still have a job today because most of their colleagues also blew up in that trade.   That attitude is one reason no career-minded professional has wanted to be the first to dip toes into crypto. Or the second, or the 12th. Not if they wanted to have a long career. But with each passing month, as more people talk about Bitcoin and more conferences are held where more products aimed at institutions are introduced, the barrier to entry gets a little lower.   Every chain reaction starts small and needs the help of at least one catalyst. The adoption of the crypto-asset class by institutional investors has recently enjoyed several, the biggest of which is the introduction of infrastructure that solves the crypto-custodian problem.   Since blockchain technology gives cryptocurrencies certain physical properties, storage is a significant issue. An institution that invests in stocks doesn't have to worry about a hacker infiltrating their servers to steal shares, but in crypto, that kind of thing happens all the time. Several solutions to this problem have been introduced by reputable crypto companies in recent months, including hardware products that help institutions secure their own cryptocurrencies and a storage service where a third party does it for them.   Then there are the recently introduced Bitcoin futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. These products allow institutions to gain exposure to crypto markets while bypassing the storage issue altogether. As an added bonus, their creation signaled a much-needed nod of approval from financial regulators, as did Goldman Sachs' decision to help clients trade them.   None of this means that the world's pension funds and endowments are about to dive in. But for the bullish thesis to work, they don't have to. Just the fact that they will start to consider the option is a major change. Throw in a sputtering stock market and a stalled bull market in bonds, and the argument becomes even more compelling.   On Wall Street, the only sin worse than being the first in a bad trade is being the last in a good one, or what crypto enthusiasts colloquially call FOMO -- or fear of missing out. That fear drives a lot of investment booms, and nobody knows that better than the biggest stewards of institutional money: hedge funds.   Twenty years ago, most people had never even heard of ''alternative assets.'' Then the dot-com bubble burst, leading the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, and it was no longer possible for pension funds and endowments to hit their annual return targets with only stocks and bonds. Within a few years, everyone was talking about the importance of allocating some capital to so-called absolute-return strategies, and the hedge fund boom was born.   We are still years away from when institutional investors will fully embrace crypto as an asset class, but 2018 is shaping up to be the year of the tipping point.    "
Measuring the Hurdles,"Blockchains mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. For Bitcoin fanatics, the original blockchain was a way to create a currency that could circumvent and eventually supersede central banks.    For central banks, the blockchain has become a promising way to record their own currencies in an effort to retain their dominant place in society.   For some cryptocurrencies, like Monero and Zcash, the blockchain is a way to ensure total privacy and anonymity. For others it is a way to make anonymity a thing of the past in financial transactions.   Beneath all these conflicting goals, the blockchain is just a new way to record data, generally in a communal fashion, with a bunch of people keeping the records, rather than just one central institution like a bank or government.    This basic idea, though, can be configured in countless different ways. And companies, start-ups and governments around the world have been engaged in what sometimes looks like a race to try out as many applications as possible, with billions of dollars chasing the promise.   What has not become clear, so far, is whether the blockchain design will really be able to accomplish any of the big promises that have been made for it.   Essentially every big category of project in the blockchain realm has run up against obstacles that have so far barred the way to real breakout success. That has led to a big decline in the price of many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies over the last six months -- the price of Bitcoin is down nearly two-thirds from the peak in December.   But while we don't yet know if blockchains will really work in the long run, we are starting to understand the problems they will have to overcome if they want to have a chance at working.   The blockchain we know the most about is the original one, linked to Bitcoin. In a simple sense, this blockchain has been a resounding success. Since it began recording every Bitcoin transaction in 2009, the Bitcoin blockchain has more or less seamlessly kept the records of a currency that is now worth over $100 billion -- and with no institution or person in charge.   But Bitcoin has so far failed at its goal of becoming a new kind of digital cash, which was the ambition described in the original documentation. So far, almost the only thing Bitcoin has been used for is a speculative commodity, like a digital gold, with lots of trading on the price. (The one place where Bitcoin has been used for regular real transactions is in the black markets.)   There are many reasons Bitcoin has not been more useful so far. The monetary policy and economics of Bitcoin -- with only 21 million of the coins ever created -- are a particularly fascinating question mark hanging over the project. As are the security issues that arise when every holder is responsible for keeping their own password, or private key.   But no problem has been more immediately stubborn than the limits on how many transactions the Bitcoin blockchain can handle. It turns out that when a whole bunch of people are keeping the records for something -- as the blockchain design requires -- there are limits on how many transactions all those computers can share and store in a set amount of time.   This issue -- the so-called scaling problem -- is now something that confronts essentially every major cryptocurrency out there. While Bitcoin can handle only around seven or so transactions each second, the second most valuable network, Ethereum, can do only double that, and none of them are getting close to the 50,000 a second that Visa manages.   Developers working on Bitcoin and Ethereum have been building several different solutions that might address this. Most of them involve adding new databases, with more capacity, on top of the ground level blockchain ledgers. So far, though, it's not clear if these can work without introducing new problems or sacrificing the qualities that attracted followers to these projects in the first place.   Ethereum, and a bunch of other valuable cryptocurrencies that have been inspired by it, have a separate set of problems that they will have to figure out.   The creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, wanted to build a system that would house a virtual currency like Bitcoin, but with the added ability to create programs, directly on the blockchain, that could make some of the currency's movements automatic. In the simplest type of transaction, the Ethereum blockchain will record money moving between wallets (which are like individual accounts) only in response to a particular event. In one simple type of transaction, for example, money would move between wallets only if a specific team won the World Series. These so-called smart contracts inside Ethereum are now being copied by many other projects.   Ethereum, though, has been dogged by new complexities that smart contracts have introduced into an already fiendishly complicated system. Ethereum smart contracts have been hacked and rigged in unexpected ways that have allowed for multiple thefts of tens of millions of dollars. That is a small minority of all the transactions, but it makes many people worry about whether blockchain smart contracts have, in the language of hackers, created too great a surface area for attack. Some worry that these sorts of smart contracts are just not the sort of thing that a shared database is equipped to handle.   Many of the problems facing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum arise from the fact that these systems are open to anyone with internet access. Anyone can go online and create a wallet and begin helping to keep all the records for these systems that run on so-called public blockchains. That creates a security headache that cryptocurrencies were designed to deal with, but that never goes away. What do you do when North Korea, or some other actor under sanctions, starts moving money on the system?   That kind of question has led most newcomers to the blockchain world -- many of them from the corporate and government worlds -- to take an interest in newer kinds of blockchain databases that aren't as open.   The world of private or permissioned blockchains has taken off over the last two years, with projects like Hyperledger and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance getting a lot of attention (the latter is working on private versions of the Ethereum software).   These systems have fewer people keeping track of any given blockchain. That makes it easier to scale up these systems to handle lots of transactions, because there are fewer computers that have to communicate. It also can make it easier to bar bad actors from getting access to the system because only people with permission have access to it.   Companies like IBM and Walmart have said that blockchains, even when they are open only to a select number of people, still can produce more reliable records of information -- that everyone can access at any time -- than the old systems that relied on a central bookkeeper.   But fans of Bitcoin and other so-called public blockchain systems have mocked these projects. The often-heard criticism is that a blockchain that is being maintained by only a few institutions is less at risk of an attack from the outside but much more at risk if one of the institutions on the inside is compromised, allowing one of the participants to fudge the old records. These private blockchains can lose the resilience to attack that is part of what made blockchains so attractive in the first place.   For now, private blockchains are too new to have gone through the security gantlet that Bitcoin has already passed through. Many private blockchain projects have been tested in pilots -- but almost none have entered into real commercial production.   As private blockchains begin to be used daily to track supply chains or copyrights, the other big question is whether they will be economically attractive enough to persuade companies to replace their old database systems -- with one person in charge -- with the inefficiencies that come with multiple people keeping records.   But the Bitcoin blockchain faced much more significant questions when it began -- like why would any serious person pay attention to some digital tokens that are worth nothing more than the ledger they are written on.   Now there are lots of serious people paying attention to Bitcoin and everything that has spun out from it -- the latest blockchain research center is about to be opened by professors at Stanford University. All those serious people make solving problems a lot easier.    "
Government Gives Online Lenders A Chance to Act More Like Banks,"The federal government began clearing a path on Tuesday for online lenders and payment companies to more easily and directly compete with traditional banks, a change that one regulator said would allow innovative businesses to expand nationwide. Online lenders and other so-called fintech firms -- including the payment processor Square, the online lender Lending Club and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase -- have pressed for regulatory routes that would let them cut through the thicket of state and federal laws that govern financial businesses.    Heeding those requests, the Treasury Department released a 222-page report laying out the Trump administration's view on how nonbank financial companies should be regulated. Hours later, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a national bank regulator, announced a new kind of charter that would potentially free such companies from the state-by-state approvals they currently need to offer loans and other financial products.    The agency had been considering the idea of a national charter for more than two years. Joseph M. Otting, the comptroller of the currency, said his office would immediately begin accepting applications.   ''Companies that provide banking services in innovative ways deserve the opportunity to pursue that business on a national scale,'' Mr. Otting said.   But legal challenges are almost certain. The Conference of State Bank Supervisors sued the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year to block such an action, but its case was dismissed because a charter had not yet been created. On Tuesday, it said the agency had exceeded its authority.   John W. Ryan, the president of the conference, called the charter ''a regulatory train wreck in the making.''   Decisions on charters would place the federal government in the business of picking ''winners and losers in the marketplace,'' he said. ''And taxpayers would be exposed to a new risk: failed fintechs.''   The new charter is available only to companies that do not take and hold deposits, and it comes with a thick set of rules. Applicants will be required to prove that they have the capital and liquidity needed to carry out their plans and adequate security technology and internal controls to protect their customers and comply with financial laws.   The Treasury's report also endorsed the idea of ''sandboxes'' -- live tests that allow companies to experiment, under a regulator's supervision, with new products and business models.   Industry representatives praised the changes. ''The O.C.C. has recognized that there's a new era, and they're updating their supervision and chartering framework to adapt to it,'' said Nat Hoopes, the executive director of the Marketplace Lending Association, whose members include Lending Point and Social Finance.   Christin Spradley, head of external affairs for OnDeck, an online small business lender, said, ''Things are coming up aces today.''   Tuesday's announcements ''can provide us with much greater regulatory certainty, which would be a watershed for the industry,'' she said.   Criticism of the new charter ranged from calling it unnecessary to calling it dangerous.   Maria T. Vullo, the superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services, said the new charter was an illegal move to undermine state supervision.   ''A national fintech charter will impose an entirely unjustified federal regulatory scheme on an already fully functional and deeply rooted state regulatory landscape,'' she said.   More than 250 consumer groups sent a letter last year to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency opposing the idea of a fintech charter, which they fear would allow companies to evade state interest rate caps and other consumer protections.   ''Giving national bank charters to nonbank lenders could open the floodgates to a wide range of predatory actors,'' said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center.   Change will come slowly, said Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, an investment firm.   ''There's undoubtedly going to be a number of companies that climb down the rabbit hole and test out this new charter, but I don't think we're going to see a sudden sea change,'' he said. ''There's still substantive questions about the requirements, and for some companies it might be easier to just go another route.''   Square, for example, applied last year for an ''industrial loan company'' charter from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which would allow it to hold government-insured deposits. The company recently withdrew its application in what it called a ''procedural step,'' but said it planned to refile.   A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the new charter.    "
Transaction Costs and Tethers: Why I'm a Crypto Skeptic,"I'm still on vacation, hiking and biking in various parts of Europe. I'm keeping up with the news, more or less, but am only occasionally and unpredictably in a place and condition where I can actually write something and post it. But this is one of those times, and I thought I'd post some thoughts in advance of stuff I'll be doing after I get back. Specifically, in a couple of weeks I'm going to play Emmanuel Goldstein -- the designated enemy -- at a conference on blockchain and all that. Hey, if you only speak to friendly audiences, you're not challenging yourself enough. So I thought it might be worth explaining why I'm a cryptocurrency skeptic.    It comes down to two things: transaction costs and the absence of tethering. Let me explain.   If you look at the broad sweep of monetary history, there has been a clear direction of change over time: namely, one of reducing the frictions of doing business and the amount of real resources required to deal with those frictions.    First there were gold and silver coins, which were heavy, required lots of security, and consumed a lot of resources to produce.   Then came bank notes backed by fractional reserves. These were popular because they were much easier to deal with than bags of coins; they also reduced the need for physical precious metals, which, as Adam Smith said, provided ''a sort of waggon-way through the air'', freeing up resources for other uses.   Even so, the system still required substantial amounts of commodity money. But central banking, in which private banks held their reserves as deposits at the central bank rather than in gold or silver, greatly reduced this need, and the shift to fiat money eliminated it almost completely.   Meanwhile, people gradually shifted away from cash transactions, first toward payments by check, then to credit and debit cards and other digital methods.   Set against this history, the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies seems very odd, because it goes exactly in the opposite of the long-run trend. Instead of near-frictionless transactions, we have high costs of doing business, because transferring a Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency unit requires providing a complete history of past transactions. Instead of money created by the click of a mouse, we have money that must be mined -- created through resource-intensive computations.   And these costs aren't incidental, something that can be innovated away. As Brunnermeier and Abadi point out, the high costs -- making it expensive to create a new Bitcoin, or transfer an existing one -- are essential to the project of creating confidence in a decentralized system.   Banknotes worked because people knew something about the banks that issued them, and these banks had an incentive to preserve their reputation. Governments have occasionally abused the privilege of creating fiat money, but for the most part governments and central banks exercise restraint, again because they care about their reputations. But you're supposed to be sure that a Bitcoin is real without knowing who issued it, so you need the digital equivalent of biting a gold coin to be sure it's the real deal, and the costs of producing something that satisfies that test have to be high enough to discourage fraud.   In other words, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are effectively celebrating the use of cutting-edge technology to set the monetary system back 300 years. Why would you want to do that? What problem does it solve? I have yet to see a clear answer to that question.   Bear in mind that conventional money generally does its job quite well. Transaction costs are low. The purchasing power of a dollar a year from now is highly predictable -- orders of magnitude more predictable than that of a Bitcoin. Using a bank account means trusting a bank, but by and large banks justify that trust, far more so than the firms that hold cryptocurrency tokens. So why change to a form of money that works far less well?   Indeed, eight years after Bitcoin was launched, cryptocurrencies have made very few inroads into actual commerce. A few firms will accept them as payment, but my sense is that this is more about signaling -- look at me, I'm cutting-edge! -- than about real usefulness. Crypocurrencies have a large market valuation, but they're overwhelmingly being held as a speculative play, not because they're useful as mediums of exchange.   Does this mean that crypto is a pure bubble, which will eventually deflate to nothing? It's worth pointing out that there are other currency-like assets that don't actually get much use as money, but which people hold anyway. Gold hasn't been actual money for a very long time, yet it retains its value.   And the same can be said, to a large extent, of cash. While cash transactions are common, they account for only a small and declining fraction of the value of purchases. Yet dollar cash holdings have actually risen as a share of GDP since the 1980s -- a growth entirely accounted for by $50 and $100 bills:   Now, large-denomination notes aren't regularly used for payments -- in fact, many stores won't accept them. So what's all that cash holding about? We all know the answer: tax evasion, illicit activity, etc. And much of that is outside the U.S., with estimates suggesting that foreigners hold more than half of U.S. currency.   Clearly, cryptocurrencies are in effect competing for some of the same business: very few people are using Bitcoin to pay their bills, but some people are using it to buy drugs, subvert elections, and so on. And the examples of both gold and large-denomination banknotes suggest that this kind of demand could support a lot of asset value. So does this mean that crypto, even if it isn't the transformative technology its backers claim, may not be a bubble?   Well, this is where tethering -- or, more precisely, its absence for cryptocurrencies -- comes in.   In normal life, people don't worry about where the value of green pieces of paper bearing portraits of dead presidents comes from: we accept dollar notes because other people will accept dollar notes. Yet the value of a dollar doesn't come entirely from self-fulfilling expectations: ultimately, it's backstopped by the fact that the U.S. government will accept dollars as payment of tax liabilities -- liabilities it's able to enforce because it's a government. If you like, fiat currencies have underlying value because men with guns say they do. And this means that their value isn't a bubble that can collapse if people lose faith.   And the value of those $100 bills sitting in drug lords' lairs or whatever is in turn tethered to the value of smaller denominations back in America.   To some extent gold is in a similar situation. Most gold just sits there, possessing value because people believe it possesses value. But gold does have real-world uses, both for jewelry and for things like filling teeth, that provide a weak but real tether to the real economy.   Cryptocurrencies, by contrast, have no backstop, no tether to reality. Their value depends entirely on self-fulfilling expectations -- which means that total collapse is a real possibility. If speculators were to have a collective moment of doubt, suddenly fearing that Bitcoins were worthless, well, Bitcoins would become worthless.   Will that happen? I think it's more likely than not, partly because of the gap between the messianic rhetoric of crypto and the much more mundane real possibilities. That is, there might be a potential equilibrium in which Bitcoin (although probably not other cryptocurrencies) remain in use mainly for black market transactions and tax evasion, but that equilibrium, if it exists, would be hard to get to from here: once the dream of a blockchained future dies, the disappointment will probably collapse the whole thing.   So that's why I'm a crypto skeptic. Could I be wrong? Of course. But if you want to argue that I'm wrong, please answer the question, what problem does cryptocurrency solve?

"Bitcoin Miners Descend on New York's Rust Belt, Thirsty for Power","MASSENA, N.Y. -- The hulking aluminum plant in this northern border town is starting to spew heat and noise again, four years after Alcoa shut it down. But now the hot hum comes from thousands of Chinese computer servers whirring away 24 hours a day for a very modern purpose: producing Bitcoins and other digital currencies. The crackerbox-size machines stacked inside rusty cargo containers are powered by the same cheap source of electricity once used to extract aluminum from ore. They represent the first stage of an obscure company's plan to convert the 60-year-old smelting works into the world's biggest cryptocurrency mine.    ''The size is overwhelming,'' said Prieur Leary, as he led a tour of the 1,300-acre site formerly known as Alcoa East. ''Maybe we're a little bit crazy.''    Mr. Leary is the chief technology officer of Coinmint, which has led an influx of entrepreneurs to this economically depressed region, all seeking to capitalize on the soaring value of digital currencies, like Bitcoin. Their arrival has been met with wariness -- just what are they doing? -- coupled with fears of their outsize thirst for electricity.   A backlash has spurred changes in state regulations and local building codes and some officials worry about becoming the East Coast counterpart to Wenatchee, Wash., which has been inundated by cryptocurrency speculators.   But neither local resistance nor a steep decline in the value of Bitcoin has blunted the demand for practically any space with a reliable power supply. Utility officials in this remote corner of New York -- known as the North Country -- continue to receive weekly inquiries from people aspiring to set up cryptocurrency mines.   [What Is Bitcoin, and How Does It Work?]   The region is an unlikely front in the global race to produce Bitcoin. Massena used to be a hub for making things -- tangible things, like V-8 engines and parts for the Apollo 11 spacecraft. The factories that churned out those products are, for the most part, gone. Thousands of union jobs that paid well and offered full benefits have vanished, leaving the area with one of the state's highest unemployment rates.   But the iconic American corporations that abandoned plants in Massena left behind the precious resource that drew them here in the first place: abundant, cheap electricity flowing from a dam in the St. Lawrence River.   Some locals had never heard of cryptocurrency before their utility bills increased last winter and they learned that start up ventures rushing to cash in on the Bitcoin boom were responsible. If they knew anything about this new type of intangible money, it was that Bitcoin's value had shot up last year to nearly $20,000 from $1,000. (It has since fallen back to about $6,300.)   Bitcoin is nearly a decade old, but that dizzying run-up and fall has put the North Country on the crypto-mining map. Before the speculators arrived in Massena, they discovered Plattsburgh, a small city about 80 miles to the east that was also awash in cheap hydropower from the St. Lawrence.   Mr. Leary showed up there two years ago, before Bitcoin had fully registered in the popular consciousness, and set up shop in an industrial park. Coinmint filled a small space with servers built for the singular task of creating cryptocurrency, running them nonstop. Each server, or miner, draws as much as 1.5 kilowatts, or about twice as much as a typical refrigerator.   As the Bitcoin market grew, Mr. Leary expanded into much bigger space in a nearby shopping center that had been a distribution center for comic books. Soon, Coinmint installed four transformers that could draw more than 13 megawatts, or enough power to run about 10,000 homes. It was more than one-tenth of the local utility's total allocation of low-cost hydropower.   This heavy usage was not a problem on most days, said Colin Read, the mayor of Plattsburgh. But during an extreme cold spell last winter, the people of Plattsburgh got a costly glimpse at the impact their new neighbors could have.   With electricity so cheap that most residents use it to heat their homes, the city's consumption exceeded its allocation on several days, Mr. Read explained. As a result, the Municipal Lighting Department had to purchase additional power at much higher prices -- a cost it spread across its customers.   ''We had a huge rash of complaints'' about the jump in utility bills, Mr. Read said.   Among those complaining was Thomas Recny, the chief financial officer of one of city's biggest employers, Mold-Rite Plastics. Mr. Recny said his company's electric bills were about $60,000 higher than normal for January and February, an unforeseen increase of about 30 percent.   Mr. Recny asked why an enterprise that required only a few people to run it should be able to drive up the operating costs of a company that employed about 500.   ''The only reason they're here is this unusually inexpensive rate for power,'' Mr. Recny said. ''But with two guys, they can consume more electricity than a hospital.''   Mr. Recny also said he was ''still somewhat puzzled'' about the need for digital currency, which he knew could be used for essentially anonymous online transactions. He questioned whether it was appropriate ''to have the electricity used for that purpose,'' which he said might involve some illicit activities.   Sitting in his office in City Hall near the shore of Lake Champlain, Mr. Read had a more positive view of cryptocurrency. He said he told his economics students at SUNY Plattsburgh that it would exist in some form, whatever the fate of Bitcoin itself, for many years. ''No doubt about that,'' he said.   The mining operations that ultimately survive will be those that get the most electricity at the lowest prices, he said. Whether they deserve it is a separate question that Plattsburgh, Massena and other towns in the region have been grappling with. Their municipal utilities have persuaded state regulators to allow them to charge higher rates for electricity to cryptocurrency miners.   In March, Plattsburgh became the first American municipality to impose a moratorium on new cryptocurrency mining while the city decides how to cope with the new burdens on its power grid.   In the meantime, Mr. Read said, city officials are adapting building codes to account for the fire hazards posed by the servers, each of which can generate as much heat as a small space heater. The concerns are part of a broader battle over the enormous carbon footprint  of Bitcoin mining, which on a global scale uses as much energy as a medium-sized country.   Mr. Read estimated that Coinmint had made a profit of more than $50 million in Plattsburgh. Leon Christman, who manages the company's operations there, said the larger installation in Plattsburgh -- the one with the leftover image of Spiderman painted on the back wall -- earned $600,000 on its best day last year.   Plattsburgh's temporary ban sent Mr. Leary to Massena, in St. Lawrence County, looking for an expansion site. Massena's municipal utility, owned by its ratepayers, was already trying to hold Bitcoin speculators at bay as it figured out how to accommodate their demands, said Andrew J. McMahon, superintendent of the Massena Electric Department.   ''Back last fall when Bitcoin was at $15,000 to $20,000, we were getting eight to 10 calls a week and they were wanting to set up within two or three weeks,'' Mr. McMahon recounted. ''These guys were wanting to plug in 10, 20, 30 megawatts. They were asking: How much do you have?''   The answer was nowhere near that much. Massena's system has never distributed more than 50 megawatts at a time, and the biggest users draw just a few megawatts. In its industrial heyday, Massena was home to two aluminum plants and a General Motors factory. But they were far too big to connect to the municipal system. They tapped directly into the state's power grid and purchased the lowest-priced wholesale power.   Mr. Leary wanted to follow that recipe. Earlier this year, the New York Power Authority agreed to provide 15 megawatts of subsidized power to Coinmint. But the authority grew skeptical of the company's promises for job creation and local investment, scuttling that agreement and leaving Coinmint to obtain its power on the wholesale market, Mr. Leary said.   Standing outside the old Alcoa plant, Mr. Leary pointed out new bundles of black cables leading from an electric substation to smaller transformers inside. Those cables could deliver more than 40 megawatts now, he said, with the potential to increase the capacity tenfold.   ''We're just getting started,'' Mr. Leary said.   Coinmint told state officials it would eventually employ 150 people in Massena, but only a few clusters of workers were visible on a recent midday tour of the plant.   Still, some residents welcomed the cryptocurrency miners -- even if they weren't too sure exactly what it is they do.   Over lunch at Spanky's, a diner on Massena's Main Street, Brad and Nancy Fletcher said they had no idea that Coinmint was already operating at Alcoa East. Mr. Fletcher, a retired state trooper, helps his wife manage her family's RV park in neighboring Franklin County, which Mrs. Fletcher said was ''even more depressed than St. Lawrence County.''   Besides the remaining aluminum works, the biggest employers in the area are prisons and a casino on the St. Regis Mohawk tribal land, the Fletchers said. If Coinmint fulfilled its promise, ''that's 150 more people that are going to be working,'' Mrs. Fletcher said. ''The area needs jobs. Anything that's going to bring some would be good.''    "
From Farm to Blockchain: Walmart Tracks Its Lettuce,"When dozens of people across the country got sick from eating contaminated romaine lettuce this spring, Walmart did what many grocers would do: It cleared every shred off its shelves, just to be safe. Walmart says it now has a better system for pinpointing which batches of leafy green vegetables might be contaminated. After a two-year pilot project, the retailer announced on Monday that it would be using a blockchain, the type of database technology behind Bitcoin, to keep track of every bag of spinach and head of lettuce. By this time next year, more than 100 farms that supply Walmart with leafy green vegetables will be required to input detailed information about their food into a blockchain database developed by I.B.M. for Walmart and several other retailers exploring similar moves.  The burgeoning blockchain industry has generated a great deal of buzz, investment and experimentation. Central banks are exploring whether it would be good for tracking money flows. Eastman Kodak has explored a blockchain platform that could help photographers manage their collections and record ownership of their work, while a group of reporters and investors are using the technology to start a series of news publications. But essentially the only real-world uses have come from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use their own blockchains to store transactions. Walmart is now trying to bring blockchain into the lexicon of everyday consumers. ""It is the first real instance of doing this at scale,"" said Brigid McDermott, vice president of I.B.M. Blockchain. For Walmart, the initiative fits squarely into two key strategies: bolstering its digital savvy and emphasizing the quality of its fresh food to customers. The blockchain could also save Walmart money. When another food-borne illness hits -- like the E. coli outbreak affecting romaine -- the retailer would only have to discard the food that was actually at risk. I.B.M. is trying to position itself as a leader in the emerging technology of blockchains. It is competing with established companies like Microsoft and upstarts like Ethereum, which have been developing projects in areas as varied as financial trading and music rights. The Walmart effort will take time to roll out. In the meantime, it is likely to face questions from critics of the technology, who are skeptical of whether the blockchains being developed by corporations are all that different from old-fashioned online databases. ""I can't see how doing this in a blockchain data format will make this magical in any way,"" said David Gerard, the author of ""Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain."" ""I think it's mostly a P.R. move, so these companies can sell themselves as blockchain leaders,"" he said. Walmart's embrace of the blockchain highlights how difficult it still is for grocers, including the nation's largest, to keep track of their food. Last year, Walmart conducted an experiment trying to trace the source of sliced mangos. It took seven days for Walmart employees to locate the farm in Mexico that grew the fruit. With the blockchain software developed by IBM, the mangos could be tracked in a matter of seconds, according to Walmart. ""The food chain is not always linear,"" said Frank Yiannas, vice president for food safety at Walmart. The original blockchain was the online database on which all Bitcoin addresses and transactions were stored. The database is maintained and stored by a network of volunteer computers, so that no single institution, like a bank, is required to keep the records. Because several computers have the records, it is much harder to change or fudge the data after the fact. Many large global corporations have been studying how they might use a similar database design to keep records among a wide array of parties -- like the hundreds of people involved in moving spinach from the farm to the grocery shelf. [Confused about blockchains? Here's what you need to know.] The blockchains being tested by companies, including the version adopted by Walmart, generally have nothing to do with Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency -- they are entirely new databases with no coins involved. And unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, which can be viewed by anyone, only certain people will be able to view and access the Walmart database. The system that Walmart is using, IBM Food Trust, has been developed for consumer companies, including Dole, Wegmans and Unilever, to track products moving through the supply chain. At each stop along the way, people handling produce for Walmart will make an entry on the blockchain, signing off when they receive it and then when they move it onto the next person in the chain. IBM and Walmart say they are already tracking other products like yogurt and poultry on the system. Blockchains are supposed to make it possible to keep updated databases without any central authority in charge. But currently, all of the records for the Walmart blockchain are being stored on IBM's cloud computers, for Walmart's use. That has led to questions about why a distributed database like a blockchain is even necessary. ""The idea is right but the execution seems off,"" said Simon Taylor, the co-founder of 11:FS, a consulting firm that advises companies on blockchain adoption. ""IBM took new tech that doesn't need a middleman and made themselves the middleman."" Ms. McDermott said that the data would be encrypted in a way that will make it impossible for IBM to access or change it. Efforts to track goods on blockchains have also faced a more fundamental challenge. A blockchain can capture the digital record of a box of spinach. But it cannot tell if someone opened the box and changed the spinach inside, replacing it with arugula or illegal drugs. ""Blockchains won't protect you from fraud,"" Mr. Gerard said. ""You need human inspectors who know the scams."" Walmart says its blockchain will allow it to track food from the field, through washing and cutting facilities, to the warehouse and finally to the store. It will even be possible to pinpoint which part of the field and at what time the vegetables were harvested. Mr. Yiannas said Walmart was focusing on leafy green vegetables because, along with beef, they tend to have the highest incidences of contagion. ""We can bring trust to the system,"" he said.

Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain,"A hodgepodge of boosterish arguments for blockchain technology, ''Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain,'' directed by Alex Winter (Bill of ''Bill & Ted'' fame), is not always a model of clarity, but it does a decent job of explaining the basic concept. Mark Jeffrey, an entrepreneur looking to blockchain for his start-up, describes the technology as a kind of shared, decentralized ledger: ''A record of all the transactions, and it's constructed in such a way that cheating is not possible.''  Bitcoin has its own ledger, and so does every other cryptocurrency. The question that hovers over this documentary, which generally subscribes to the rosy assessments of libertarians and others who view centralization as inherently dangerous, is just how much potential blockchain technology has to do even more.    We learn how, thanks to blockchain, neighbors in Brooklyn can trade solar electricity; how the technology might provide records for stateless refugees; and how it offers a way for fans to buy equity in an artist they like, without the middle men who come with sales on the internet.   But the arguments contradict one another. (Blockchain means privacy! And also, look at these supermarket shoppers in Jordan who pay with eye scans instead of cash.) The film also conflates issues. You can believe that blockchain has potential and still think that Bitcoin is a bubble -- as many economists, not just banking executives with vested interests, do.   By the time Rosario Dawson, the narrator, points out that blockchain will likely require some form of regulation to survive, the movie has become an unwitting endorsement of the status quo.

Utopia Here?,"STOREY COUNTY, Nev. -- An enormous plot of land in the Nevada desert -- bigger than nearby Reno -- has been the subject of local intrigue since a company with no history, Blockchains L.L.C., bought it for $170 million in cash this year. The man who owns the company, a lawyer and cryptocurrency millionaire named Jeffrey Berns, put on a helmet and climbed into a Polaris off-road vehicle last week to give a tour of the sprawling property and dispel a bit of the mystery.    He imagines a sort of experimental community spread over about a hundred square miles, where houses, schools, commercial districts and production studios will be built. The centerpiece of this giant project will be the blockchain, a new kind of database that was introduced by Bitcoin.   After his driver stopped the Polaris on a high desert plateau, surrounded by blooming rabbit brush and a grazing herd of wild horses, Mr. Berns, who is 56, pointed to the highlights of his dream community.    ''You see that first range of mountains,'' he said, pointing south. ''Those mountains are the border of our South Valley. That's where we're going to build the high-tech park,'' a research campus that would cover hundreds of acres. There are also plans for a college and an e-gaming arena.   As strange -- even fantastical -- as all this might sound, Mr. Berns's ambitions fit right into the idiosyncratic world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains.   The blockchain began as a digital ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Some aficionados have grander plans. They think it could be a new way of taking power back from the institutions they believe are calling all the shots.   Just as Bitcoin made it possible to transfer money without using a bank, blockchain believers like Mr. Berns think the technology will make it possible for ordinary people to control their own data -- the lifeblood of the digital economy -- without relying on big companies or governments.   There is a fuzzy line between these utopian visions and get-rich-quick schemes. Several cryptocurrency projects have been shut down by regulators; apparent hucksters have been arrested; and a plan to transform Puerto Rico with cryptocurrencies has been criticized as nothing more than a bid to take advantage of the island's status as a tax haven.   Mr. Berns was drawn to Nevada by its tax benefits, including the lack of income taxes. And the breadth of his ambitions certainly raises the risk of a boondoggle.   But he is different from his crypto-brethren in one big way: He is spending his own money. So far, he said, he has spent $300 million on the land, offices, planning and a staff of 70 people. And buying 67,000 largely undeveloped acres is a bit of old-fashioned, real estate risk-taking.   Still, Mr. Berns said his ambition was not to be a real estate magnate or even to get rich -- or richer. He is promising to give away all decision-making power for the project and 90 percent of any dividends it generates to a corporate structure that will be held by residents, employees and future investors. That structure, which he calls a ''distributed collaborative entity,'' is supposed to operate on a blockchain where everyone's ownership rights and voting powers will be recorded in a digital wallet.   Mr. Berns acknowledged that all this is way beyond what blockchains have actually accomplished. But that hasn't discouraged him.   ''I don't know why,'' he said over the roar of the Polaris engine. ''I just -- something inside me tells me this is the answer, that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by.''   Mr. Berns has managed to win over local officials who are eager for economic development. Nevada's governor, Brian Sandoval, read a proclamation that named the Blockchains property ''Innovation Park'' at an event last month where Mr. Berns sat on a panel with the governor and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla.   Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada, which has been described as the largest building in the world, is surrounded by Blockchains' land. Companies like Google, Apple and Switch also have properties in the industrial park that is surrounded by Mr. Berns's holdings.   This week, he announced a memorandum of understanding with one of the state's main power companies, NV Energy, to team up on projects that will run energy transactions through a blockchain.   The Nevada county where this is all located, Storey County, has only about 4,000 residents and was best known, until recently, for its history of silver mining and its modern brothels, including one owned by a county commissioner.   That same county commissioner, Lance Gilman, bought the land surrounding the brothel and turned it into the industrial park where Tesla and Google are now located.   Blockchains has already received preliminary county support for a new town along the Truckee River, with thousands of homes, a school and a drone delivery system, and is working closely with the county on a broader master plan.   But for now, Blockchains is empty land and a repurposed office building. Mr. Berns said the company won't begin construction on the broader property until late 2019, at the earliest, after putting together the master plan and getting it approved by the county.   The office manager from Mr. Berns's old law office in Los Angeles, Joanna Rodriguez, moved with her four children and husband to Nevada.   ''He has these crazy ideas -- but I know that every time he sets his mind to something he will get there,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, 29, who has worked with Mr. Berns for eight years and is now the manager of the Blockchains office in Nevada. ''That's why I decided to move.''   Mr. Berns spent most of his professional life on class-action lawsuits, many of them against financial companies. He learned about Bitcoin in 2012 but was won over by another cryptocurrency, Ethereum, which makes it possible to store more than just transaction data on a blockchain.   Mr. Berns bought Ether, the digital token associated with Ethereum, in a big sale in 2015. Thanks to an astronomical increase in the price of Ether and some well-timed selling last year before it crashed, he became wealthy enough to fund his dream project.   Ethereum is what he believes makes his community more than just a giant real estate project. To understand why requires more than a bit of imagination. And faith. Every resident and employee will have what amounts to an Ethereum address, which they will use to vote on local measures and store their personal data.   Mr. Berns believes Ethereum will give people a way to control their identity and online data without any governments or companies involved.   That is a widely shared view in the blockchain community, but there are significant questions about whether any of it can work in the real world. Most blockchain companies have failed to gain any traction, and Ethereum and Bitcoin networks have struggled to handle even moderate amounts of traffic.   Mr. Berns believes that one of the big problems has been security. People have been terrible at holding the private keys that are necessary to get access to a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet.   He wants to address that with a custom-built system where people's private keys are stored on multiple digital devices, kept in vaults, so that no one device can gain access to the keys. He has already purchased vaults that are burrowed into mountains in Sweden and Switzerland, and he plans to build additional vaults in the mountains in Nevada.   The other thing holding back Ethereum, Mr. Berns believes, has been a lack of real-world laboratories. His Nevada land, he hopes, will change that.   ''This will either be the biggest thing ever, or the most spectacular crash and burn in the history of mankind,'' Mr. Berns said. ''I don't know which one. I believe it's the former, but either way it's going to be one hell of a ride.''    "
American-Israeli 19-Year-Old Gets 10 Years in Bomb Hoaxes,"Follow Isabel Kershner on Twitter: @IKershner . JERUSALEM -- A Tel Aviv court on Thursday sentenced a 19-year-old American-Israeli man to 10 years in prison for sowing havoc and terror with fake bomb threats against hundreds of institutions, including schools, hospitals, malls, police stations and Jewish centers in the United States and other countries. For months, prosecutors said, the teenager, who has not been publicly identified, threatened airports and commercial airlines, prompting the authorities to scramble fighter jets to escort planes forced to make emergency landings.     His targets included the Israeli Embassy in Washington and a Delaware state senator, Ernesto Lopez, who had issued a statement condemning the hoaxer. Senator Lopez received a call warning him that if he did not pay blackmail, his daughter would be murdered.   The actions of the defendant caused panic and forced mass evacuations, and his focus on Jewish institutions stoked fears of rising anti-Semitism.   ''One can easily imagine the terror, the fear and the horror that gripped the airplane passengers who were forced to make an emergency landing, some of whom were injured while evacuating the plane,'' the judge, Zvi Gurfinkel, wrote in his verdict, ''and the terrified panic caused when there was a need to evacuate pupils from schools because of fake bomb threats.''   A United States indictment has also been served against the hoaxer, who holds both Israeli and American citizenship, as the Justice Department has accused him of hate crimes.   The teenager from southern Israel was legally a legal minor when he began his campaign of terror. He was convicted of the crimes committed after he turned 18, including extortion, making threats and false reports, conspiracy to commit a crime, and money laundering.   Using sophisticated software to camouflage his voice and disguise his location, he offered his services to others on the dark net and traded in drugs, bomb-making guides and child pornography -- all from his bedroom in the fifth-floor apartment in the southern Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, where he lived with his parents, officials said.   After months of an investigation by the cyberunit of the Israeli police, in cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other foreign police and security agencies, the apartment, in an upscale neighborhood, was raided in March 2017, and officers arrested the teenager.   During the search of his room, the police said, he grabbed a pistol from a police officer and had to be wrestled to the ground.   According to court documents, the defendant demanded payment for his services on the dark net in Bitcoin, the virtual cryptocurrency, and earned nearly 184 Bitcoin, now worth about $800,000.   In his decision, the judge provided details of the defendant's price list for his services. A phone threat to a private house cost $40; a call to a school cost double that; and for a call warning of a bomb on a plane, he charged $500.   Since the defendant refused to reveal the codes to access his Bitcoin wallet, most of his earnings have not been recovered. Only a few thousand dollars were found in cash, according to the Israeli authorities.   The teenager's defense lawyers argued that his judgment had been impaired because he had severe autism and a brain tumor and is not able to distinguish right from wrong, making him unfit to stand trial.   A medical panel found that he was autistic but concluded that he understood that his actions were forbidden and that he was responsible for them.   Judge Gurfinkel said the young man's condition had been taken into consideration in sentencing, otherwise he would have faced 17 years in prison.   After the sentencing in Tel Aviv on Thursday, the teenager's mother told reporters outside the courtroom: ''This is the most cruel, cruel thing in the world. I'm very sorry, but I am ashamed that the country acts this way.'' She added that her son needed treatment and rehabilitation and that ''his place is not in prison.''   Because of the court restrictions, little is known about the man's family. His behavior was considered unusual from an early age, according to court documents, and he was home-schooled because he never adapted to regular educational frameworks.   At the time of his arrest, neighbors said the defendant's father was an Israeli-born engineer and his mother was a Westerner, presumably an American.   The hoax calls appear to have started in the spring of 2015, when he would have been about 16. Between April 2015 and March 2017, prosecutors said, he called about 2,000 institutions, claiming that bombs had been planted or threatening an imminent shooting attack, prompting evacuations and bringing out the police and emergency services.   The hoaxer usually chose elementary schools, because those threats created more chaos and were taken more seriously.   In addition to the United States and Israel, threats were received in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.   Flights were canceled and planes grounded. In the family's apartment, a few blocks from the beach, the defendant had installed a powerful antenna enabling him to connect with distant wireless networks. He then followed the reports in the news media and documented the results of his actions.    "
End the Innovation Obsession,"TORONTO -- A year ago I stepped into the Samcheong Park Library in Seoul, South Korea, and saw the future. The simple building in a forested park had a nice selection of books, a cafe at its center and a small patio. Classical music played while patrons read, reclining on extra-deep window benches that had cushions to sit on and tables that slid over their laps so that they could sip coffee and eat cheesecake while gazing at the leaves changing colors outside. Seoul is one of the most modern cities in the world, a place suffused with the latest inescapable technology. This library was specifically designed as an antidote to that. ''What's so innovative about that?'' a friend who works for the library here in Toronto asked when I showed her pictures. Innovation to her meant digital technology, from drones and movie-streaming services and 3D printers, which the library was constantly showing off.    ''Why couldn't they both be innovative?'' I asked.    We are told that innovation is the most important force in our economy, the one thing we must get right or be left behind. But that fear of missing out has led us to foolishly embrace the false trappings of innovation over truly innovative ideas that may be simpler and ultimately more effective. This mind-set equates innovation exclusively with invention and implies that if you just buy the new thing, voilà! You have innovated! Each year businesses, institutions and individuals run around like broken toy robots, trying to figure out their strategy for the latest buzzword promising salvation.   What's your company's plan to onboard wearables? How's our Google Glass program coming? Where do you stand on Big Data? A.I.? Machine learning? How soon can we pivot to video? How many tablets should we buy? What's your child's school's V.R. budget? Are you all in on Instagram? Snapchat? Do you even know what cryptocurrency is? Yeah, me neither. How much can we afford?   At best, this is a waste of time and money. Gadgets are procured, deployed and discarded. Resources are squandered as the technology's actual capabilities fall short of its promise. People are forced to work at treadmills. Then everyone moves on. The drones stay grounded. The V.R. headset languishes in the box. Iced tea goes back to being iced tea and not some wildly speculative cryptocurrency mining scheme.   [Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]   But at its worst, this approach to innovation can truly be destructive. Schools that hastily purchased tablets for students cut drama, music and sports programs to pay for devices with few proven benefits. Districts that adopted untested computerized voting machines have seen elections compromised. Companies that integrated artificial intelligence into the hiring process have actually reinforced gender and racial stereotypes. Publications that increased their focus on video content while slashing reporters, all in response to Facebook's viewership numbers, later learned that these figures -- the entire basis of their new business models -- had been fudged.    Silicon Valley firms are not immune to this, even while deploying the fear of missing innovation as a sales tactic. They too need to please investors, customers and the media, which hangs on every news release, and so they traffic in their own illusions of innovation. They produce cool videos about blimps and solar planes sending Wi-Fi to remote villages in Africa (always Africa). They offer cryptic hints about flying cars, pizza drones and a variety of Facebook products no one cares about, from a video chat device that looks no different from a tablet running Skype (but with added data harvesting) to a version of the social network's Messenger app built for children. The latter is among the most ill-considered, ill-timed ideas of our era.   True innovation isn't just some magic carnival of invention, like a Steve Jobs keynote with a pretty toy at the end. It is a continuing process of gradual improvement and assessment that every institution and business experiences in some way. Often that actually means adopting ideas and tools that already exist but make sense in a new context, or even returning to methods that worked in the past. Adapted to the challenges of today, these rearview innovations have proved to be as transformative as novel technologies.   Look no farther than the streets of New York, which have been radically redesigned over the past decade to accommodate cyclists and pedestrians with bike lanes and car-free zones. These ideas aren't new. They were espoused by city planners and activists more than half a century ago, when Robert Moses was crisscrossing the city with expressways, bulldozing neighborhoods in the name of the car's transformational technology. At the time Jane Jacobs and other advocates of slower, friendlier streets were dismissed as Luddites. It took more than 50 years of evidence, accidents and political courage to realize what a colossal mistake the Moses approach was and to begin to undo that with proven ideas in people-centric urban planning that aim to bring cities back to those who live in them.   When you look at those cities, you'll also find some of the most innovative solutions to the way we conduct commerce. Not one-hour delivery or meal kits on demand, but the boom in a parallel retail model that is decidedly social and human focused. The past decade has seen impressive nationwide growth in farmers markets, flea markets and independent bookstores, despite all the competition from larger, more efficient organizations online and offline. Even though these places are based on a model that harks back to the roots of human commerce, they are innovative precisely because they propose a valuable community alternative solution to the supermarket or shopping mall that dominates retail. This model has been so effective that Amazon is opening more bookstores and Walmart just announced concept stores that will include food halls, farmers markets, bike rentals and parks -- the very things the company siphoned away from American towns.   Perhaps the best examples of rearward innovation are edible. The culinary story of the past several decades is dominated not by the scientific improvements we were promised, but by a return to food and drink's more delicious past. Traditional cooking, craft beer, heirloom vegetables and grass-fed beef have brought food forward by turning back. We take this as gospel today, but during the 1980s, when pioneering artisan bakers like Nancy Silverton and Jim Lahey were trying to get the world to abandon Wonder bread for traditional sourdough, their ideas were radical and innovative, and ultimately changed the way many of us cook, shop and eat.   This type of reflective innovation requires courage, because it calls into question the assumption that newer is necessarily better. But increasingly, as our worship of Silicon Valley gives way to a growing sense of unease, we are asking those questions and innovating appropriately. Countless schools have restricted technology use to foster better learning. Elections officials in Virginia recently traded computerized voting machines for more secure paper ballots. And while e-reader sales have been tanking, Penguin just announced it would publish tiny printed books, meant to be read on the go. Small books, which have been around since Gutenberg set up his press, are an ideal solution for a market that demands both convenience and physicality.   These innovations aren't mired in the past. They are solutions firmly focused on the future -- not some technocentric version of it, where we invent our way to utopia, but a human-centric future that reflects where we've been, what we've learned and how we actually want to live. If that means we build more libraries in parks, then we are moving in the right direction.   David Sax is the author of ''The Revenge of Analog: Real Things and Why They Matter.''

Small Worlds,"Sasha Chapin is the author of the forthcoming memoir ''All the Wrong Moves.'' He last wrote a Letter of Recommendation column for the magazine on airport layovers. There's a large spot reserved in the popular imagination for the Platonic ideal of an out-of-control market, a stunning collective enthusiasm that was bound to end in ruin: the tulip mania of the Netherlands, which ended in 1637. Tulips, a newly fashionable luxury item, temporarily became more valuable than houses -- until, obviously, the inevitable market correction, which ruined fortunes and tore a nation apart. Except this is a myth: The historian Anne Goldgar, in her 2007 book on the topic, wrote that while tulip prices certainly got a bit silly in the 1630s, she could find no evidence of anyone going bankrupt over them. The tulip was simply a luxury commodity that underwent a brief upward swing in value. The more entertaining version was brought to us by the anti-tulip propaganda of the age: pamphlets spreading exaggerated tales about these wilting, decadent symbols of wealth and the ruin they brought with them.     And yet the story of the tulips is still lodged in the modern mind as the perfect case study of a ''bubble'' -- more so, even, than the South Sea Bubble, one of several speculative crazes of the early 18th century, in which British investors were thrown into panic by the rise and fall of a preposterously overvalued trading company. To this day, people use tulips to express their incredulity over inflated values. Last December, the investor Dennis Gartman appeared on CNBC and called the rising value of Bitcoin a ''classic bubble'' that, compared with tulip mania, ''has gone even beyond that absurdity.'' At a recent conference, the Italian economist Massimo Amato said the cryptocurrency was ''like a virtual tulip.''   The persistence of such comparisons probably has something to do with how effectively tulip mania works as a fable, with a flattering moral at its core: If the people around you seem to be behaving irrationally, perhaps you're correct, and everyone else is deluded. Others are inside the ''bubble,'' incapable of spotting the distortions that are obvious to you. Of course houses are more valuable than flowers. Gartman and Amato, for instance, might have taken some grim satisfaction from what happened to Bitcoin in recent weeks: As of late November, it was trading at just over $3,700, down from a peak that neared $20,000, and the N.Y.U. economist Nouriel Roubini was tweeting about feeling ''vindicated'' that ''this cryptobubble went bust for good.''   The trouble is that financial bubbles turn out to be far harder to recognize than you might think. Economists have spent decades debating precisely what they are, and how an observer might spot one in the wild, without arriving at a clear consensus. The Nobel Prize-winning Robert J. Shiller, in his 2000 book ''Irrational Exuberance,'' considers them simple enough, but the equally Nobel Prize-winning Eugene Fama is skeptical of the very concept of a bubble, partly because he believes that it's impossible to predict, mathematically speaking, whether you're in one. Even after what looks like a catastrophic crash, value can rebound -- as has happened in the past, many of the times Bitcoin has been declared doomed. The temptation to spot bubbles is widespread; the ability to actually identify them, less so.   You could potentially blame a completely different kind of ''bubble'' for the once-soaring value of Bitcoin: the ideological enclave of cryptocurrency evangelists. In Forbes, Jason Bloomberg wrote that ''most of the noise around both blockchain and crypto is little more than the community talking to itself -- a massive 'echo chamber.' '' We like to imagine ourselves as cannily seeing through such echo chambers -- the self-reinforcing intellectual snow globes of people who get all their information from one another, who imagine that all the world works like their particular corner of it.   But we seem to have less faith in everyone else's ability to do the same. Witness recent accusations that liberals live in a ''coastal bubble,'' full of coddled elites who understand more about avocados than about the crises of Rust Belt towns. Or the counteraccusation: that rural Americans have alarmingly little real exposure to people or lifestyles even slightly different from their own. In a September article at Washington Monthly, Nancy LeTourneau warned of an ''information bubble'' that was, according to one poll, leading 57 percent of strong Trump supporters to doubt that Democrats had a chance of capturing the House in midterm elections -- calling back to the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez's blogged 2010 warning that the conservative movement was ''moving toward epistemic closure,'' though not the liberal activist Eli Pariser's 2011 book arguing that online ''filter bubbles'' were presenting us all with information that flattered our existing biases.   If you're trying to sort out why your ideological opponents seem, to you, so obviously foolish, here is one explanation that presents itself constantly. They are stuck in a ''bubble,'' unable to recognize any new information that doesn't match their convictions -- about life, about America, about politics, about the value of notional currencies, about the relative values of tulips and houses, about anything.   But this, too, may be less clear-cut than it feels. Pariser's notion of a ''filter bubble'' suggested that we were being divided by flaws in the infrastructure of the internet -- things like personalization algorithms, which offer us precisely the information we're already inclined to want -- meaning we might solve the problem with better engineering. More recent research, though, has suggested that this may not be where the problem lies; the statistician Seth Flaxman, writing with other researchers in Public Opinion Quarterly, has found that the influence of search algorithms on individual browsing bias may not be as strong as it seemed. And while it's often taken as a given that social media is politically polarizing, there's evidence to suggest that the demographic groups that have polarized recently are the ones least likely to use social media.   It's obvious that Americans live in social bubbles -- living and talking in circles divided by economics, race, ideology, geography, taste and so on. The problem arises as soon as you try to differentiate those that constitute real ''bubbles'' -- which is to say, self-reinforcing spheres of blindness or irrationality -- from those that might just as easily be called ''cultures'' or ''communities,'' groups of people who share experiences and convictions. Such groupings will certainly have drawbacks; our shared preconceptions often limit us. But to use the word ''bubble'' as a stand-alone pejorative is to focus on the ignorance inherent in a given worldview, rather than the insights; it's to examine ideological opponents and conclude that the only reason they could possibly believe what they do is because they haven't examined alternatives.   It's nice to imagine that we can broaden someone's understanding of the world by illuminating their blind spots. The problem is that our helpful corrections are likely to be totally wrong. A well-meaning diagnosis of conservative bubbles like LeTourneau's -- ''when everyone you know is a Republican,'' she writes, ''you can't imagine anyone who isn't'' -- might run up against complicated research results: say, one that indicates conservatives are actually better at modeling liberal beliefs than the other way around.   The difficulty of getting it right might explain the overwhelming vindication people clearly feel when someone else's ideological bubble really has been pricked. Less than two days after President Trump's electoral victory, The New York Post published a column by Michael Goodwin that was positively triumphant about it: ''The cluelessness in media and political circles about the Trump voter surge,'' he wrote, ''confirms that the ruling class is cosseted deeply in its bubbles and isolated from the concerns of other Americans.'' So long as we're not among a bubble's inhabitants, its popping flatters our own delusion: that we're among the few right-thinking people who accurately measure value, who accurately perceive reality, who see far more clearly than the sheeplike, tulip-loving half-wits around us.   What might be more helpful, when talk of a ''bubble'' crops up, is to think of yourself, rather than others -- to be vigilant about the possibility that the most meaningful bubbles are the ones you're not aware of, rather than the ones you're eager to spot. They are, after all, incredibly pleasant and convincing when you're on the inside. The value they create is not an illusion: There is much to be gained from being in mental harmony with those around you, let alone owning something people are paying absurd prices for. It's dispiriting, perhaps, to think our various blinkers might not be easy to identify, but knowing this offers a sort of peace -- the peace of spending less time wondering why everyone else is so hopelessly blinkered. If you're skeptical of your own ability to see everything clearly, you'll be less surprised when the actions of others refuse to blow up in their faces -- or, perhaps, when you hear your own world emit an unexpected pop.

America Could Lead the Transition to a Digital Currency Reserve,"Brian Brooks is the chief legal officer of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange. After spending decades as the dominant global reserve currency, the dollar's position is being challenged. The greenback's share of global central-bank reserves has declined in nine of the past 10 quarters, the International Monetary Fund reported in September. The slide is hardly new: It began a decade ago when European leaders attempted to replace the dollar with a euro-based ''basket'' of currencies as the common global reserve.    But the United States should not fight against the forces of globalization that challenge the dollar's reserve-currency status. Instead, it must seize the opportunity to incubate technologies that will enable future digital currencies, which could go on to power a transnational currency -- perhaps the best next option for a future global reserve.    Committing to this course would provide a check on attempts to supplant the dollar's role in the global financial system with other sovereign currencies. It would also put the United States at the heart of a more open and equitable financial system.   There are lessons in America's technological history that should inform future policy relating to digital currencies. More than three decades ago the United States government supported the development of the internet. Doing so unleashed huge economic impact on America that can still be seen today in the successes of the nation's biggest technology companies. The digital financial revolution that the world is on the cusp of has the potential to be just as significant for job creation and economic development.   Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, could prove to be as important to commerce as email and text messaging were to communications. New financial systems built on it could help connect people around the world who lack access to traditional banking services. And these innovations could be leveraged by developers in much the same way as entrepreneurs built web services on the internet -- from eBay to Facebook -- with the same enormous impact on the American economy.   That is, if we see the opportunity that is before us.   Countries around the world are racing to lead the next revolution in financial technology. While it is clear that the United States and companies like Coinbase were early entrants in this global movement, it is also true that many nations and individuals are jockeying for leadership. There are currently more than 1,400 digital currencies and tokens available, serving a variety of uses. Central banks from China to Sweden to Uruguay are considering issuing their own.   America must maintain its leadership role by leading the way on research and development of cryptocurrency technologies -- just as it did in the early days of the internet -- rather than stifling it. And if it does, it could ultimately build dominant cryptocurrency technologies that become the backbone of the 21st Century financial system.   Doing so could yield all sorts of wonderful possibilities. In the 21st century when a national market undergoes a major fluctuation, America could enable an alternative currency. It could make it easier for American farmers to sell to foreign customers without the friction of foreign exchange. And its development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D., could ''airdrop'' cryptocurrencies to hard-hit regions of the world that lack access to banking infrastructure.   That the dollar is under pressure as the world's reserve currency should only lend more urgency to the endeavor, as America should not come to rely on global cryptocurrency technologies that have been developed by other nations. The United States can retain its leadership role in the global financial system -- but only if it nurtures the development of the technologies that will underpin its future.

Worries Grow That the Price of Bitcoin Is Being Propped Up,"A growing number of virtual currency investors are worried that the prices of Bitcoin and other digital tokens have been artificially propped up by a widely used exchange called Bitfinex, which has a checkered history of hacks and opaque business practices. In December, Bitfinex was subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a United States regulatory agency. The news, first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday and confirmed by a source familiar with the subpoena but not allowed to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation, led to a sell-off in most virtual currencies. The people behind Bitfinex issue a virtual currency called Tether. Unlike most digitals tokens, every Tether is supposed to be backed by traditional money -- the United States dollar. New Tether tokens are issued when investors give them dollars. One dollar is worth one token. Because of the credibility that comes with that tie to the dollar, Tether are often used to buy other virtual currencies like Bitcoin.  In recent months, however, many investors have been raising alarm bells about Tether. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex. ""This became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,"" said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. ""It could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real."" Long before news of the subpoena, Bitfinex, which is believed to host more trading than any other Bitcoin exchange in the world, had gained a reputation for a lack of transparency and a confusing structure, with European executives, offices in Asia and registration in the Caribbean. It is not yet clear what information the regulators are seeking. Technically, the Tether tokens are issued by a separate company (called Tether) that is owned and operated by the same people who run Bitfinex. The C.F.T.C. subpoenaed that company at the same time that it subpoenaed Bitfinex, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bitfinex has not commented on the subpoena or recent reports about Tether, and company officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In the past, the exchange's executives and spokesman have said that its customers are simply using Tether to buy virtual currencies as they might otherwise use United States dollars. Bitfinex had contracted with an American firm, Friedman, to audit its records and prove that its operation of Tether is above board. But last week, Bitfinex said it was cutting ties with Friedman, after waiting months for it to finish the audit. That news generated more suspicion. ""It's a signal to the market of what those who have scrutinized the situation already believe: There is a problem here,"" said Jill Carlson, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who now consults with a variety of virtual currency companies. ""The dissolution of a relationship between an auditor and a company is very rarely a good sign that the company is behaving in accordance with market best practices."" The concern about Bitfinex is one of several issues that have helped depress the value of virtual currencies over the last month, after a roaring, yearlong rally. Regulators in several countries, like South Korea and the United States, have expressed concerns about manipulation and fraud, and hinted at a crackdown. In Japan, a large virtual currency exchange, Coincheck, was hacked in late January and lost nearly $500 million worth of a virtual currency known as NEM, raising questions about the relatively untested security practices of virtual currency exchanges. Still, Japan is one of the few places where virtual currency exchanges are overseen by regulators. Many of the largest virtual currency exchanges, including Bitfinex, operate with essentially no regulatory oversight. Bitfinex was hacked in 2015 and again in 2016, and Tether was hacked at the end of last year -- with the combined losses totaling more than $100 million. The company shared few details about these hacks. But after the biggest theft, in 2016, it was cut off by Wells Fargo and its banks in Taiwan. The banking problems have made it hard for customers to get money in and out of Bitfinex, but traders have continued to use the exchange, in part because of Tether. Tether offered a preliminary report last year from Friedman, the accounting firm, suggesting that it had bank accounts with dollars corresponding to all the Tether that had been issued. But the report was far from conclusive and Tether has never produced a real audit, leading to suspicions that Bitfinex may be printing virtual money backed by nothing. The Tether currency has been valuable to traders because it allows them to hold a stable token, tied to the value of the dollar, and move it quickly between virtual currency exchanges. But there is a downside. Because the identity of Tether holders is not always clear, the movement of the virtual token between exchanges -- and across national borders -- has raised concerns among lawyers about money laundering. The spread of Tether beyond Bitfinex has also spread the risk of its failure to other exchanges. Market analysts have grown particularly concerned with the rapid pace at which new Tether have been issued and their timing. In a single week in mid-January, $450 million new Tether were created, bringing the total amount of Tether to more than $2 billion. Several anonymous reports circulating among traders, including one posted to a website last week, have pointed to data from Bitfinex itself, showing that the price of Bitcoin has frequently gone up soon after new Tether were created, generally as a result of big trades on Bitfinex. ""This absolutely reeks of price manipulation,"" a security researcher and market analyst, Tony Arcieri, wrote on his blog in mid-January. Many investors and traders have pushed back against that criticism, noting that smart traders simply may be looking to buy when the markets are down. ""My personal biases make me inclined to believe that Bitfinex is not using Tether to manipulate the price of Bitcoin,"" said Jeremy Gardner, a managing partner at the investment firm Ausum Ventures. ""If they have attempted to do so, which would be deeply concerning, it's hard to imagine that such fraudulent issuance at its current volume could single-handedly buoy the price of Bitcoin."" But Mr. Krug, at Pantera Capital, said that if Tether were really being used by investors, they would probably also want to buy new Tether when the markets were going up, which has not been the case. Also, they would not always want it in exact increments of $100 million, as has been the case. ""After you see this enough times, you just start to wonder what's really going on here,"" Mr. Krug said. The Bitcoin community is sensitive to the possibility of price manipulation because a team of academics published an article in early January suggesting that the price of Bitcoin was artificially inflated in 2013 by a single player operating on the largest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox. One of the authors of that paper, Tyler Moore, said it could be hard to tell if similar price manipulation were going on today, though he noted that a lack of transparency made it hard for anyone to be certain of anything. ""Greater assurances are needed that the trades taking place are in fact legitimate and reflect buying and selling by independent actors,"" said Mr. Moore, an assistant professor at the University of Tulsa. ""Unless and until such oversight is implemented, we cannot trust the exchange rate to reflect only legitimate sources of supply and demand.""

Making a Crypto Utopia in Puerto Rico,"SAN JUAN, P.R. -- They call what they are building Puertopia. But then someone told them, apparently in all seriousness, that it translates to ""eternal boy playground"" in Latin. So they are changing the name: They will call it Sol. Dozens of entrepreneurs, made newly wealthy byblockchain and cryptocurrencies, are heading en masse to Puerto Rico this winter. They are selling their homes and cars in California and establishing residency on the Caribbean island in hopes of avoiding what they see as onerous state and federal taxes on their growing fortunes, some of which now reach into the billions of dollars. And these men -- because they are almost exclusively men -- have a plan for what to do with the wealth: They want to build a crypto utopia, a new city where the money is virtual and the contracts are all public, to show the rest of the world what a crypto future could look like. Blockchain, a digital ledger that forms the basis of virtual currencies, has the potential to reinvent society -- and the Puertopians want to prove it. For more than a year, the entrepreneurs had been searching for the best location. After Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico's infrastructure in September and the price of cryptocurrencies began to soar, they saw an opportunity and felt a sense of urgency.  So this crypto community flocked here to create its paradise. Now the investors are spending their days hunting for property where they could have their own airports and docks. They are taking over hotels and a museum in the capital's historic section, called Old San Juan. They say they are close to getting the local government to allow them to have the first cryptocurrency bank. ""What's happened here is a perfect storm,"" said Halsey Minor, the founder of the news site CNET, who is moving his new blockchain company -- called Videocoin -- from the Cayman Islands to Puerto Rico this winter. Referring to Hurricane Maria and the investment interest that has followed, he added, ""While it was really bad for the people of Puerto Rico, in the long term it's a godsend if people look past that."" Puerto Rico offers an unparalleled tax incentive: no federal personal income taxes, no capital gains tax and favorable business taxes -- all without having to renounce your American citizenship. For now, the local government seems receptive toward the crypto utopians; the governor will speak at their blockchain summit conference, called Puerto Crypto, in March. The territory's go-to blockchain tax lawyer is Giovanni Mendez, 30. He expected the tax expatriates to disappear after Hurricane Maria, but the population has instead boomed. ""It's increased monumentally,"" said Mr. Mendez, who has about two dozen crypto clients. ""And they all came together."" The movement is alarming an earlier generation of Puerto Rico tax expats like the hedge fund manager Robb Rill, who runs a social group for those taking advantage of the tax incentives. ""They call me up saying they're going to buy 250,000 acres so they can incorporate their own city, literally start a city in Puerto Rico to have their own crypto world,"" said Mr. Rill, who moved to the island in 2013. ""I can't engage in that."" The newcomers are still debating the exact shape that Puertopia should take. Some think they need to make a city; others think it's enough to move into Old San Juan. Puertopians said, however, that they hoped to move very fast. ""You've never seen an industry catalyze a place like you're going to see here,"" Mr. Minor said. The Monastery Until the Puertopians find land, they have descended on the Monastery, a 20,000-square-foot hotel they rented as their base and that was largely unscathed by the hurricane. Matt Clemenson and Stephen Morris were drinking beer on the Monastery's roof one recent evening. Mr. Clemenson had an easygoing affect and wore two-tone aviators; Mr. Morris, a loquacious British man, was in cargo shorts and lace-up steel-toed combat boots, with a smartphone on a necklace. They wanted to make two things clear: They chose Puerto Rico because of the hurricane, and they come in peace. ""It's only when everything's been swept away that you can make a case for rebuilding from the ground up,"" Mr. Morris, 53, said. ""We're benevolent capitalists, building a benevolent economy,"" said Mr. Clemenson, 34, a co-founder of Lottery.com, which is using the blockchain in lotteries. ""Puerto Rico has been this hidden gem, this enchanted island that's been consistently overlooked and mistreated. Maybe 500 years later we can make it right."" Other Puertopians arrived on the roof as a pack, just back from a full-day property-hunting bus tour. From the middle, Brock Pierce, 37, the leader of the Puertopia movement, emerged wearing drop crotch capri pants, a black vest that almost hit his knees and a large black felt hat. He and others had arrived on the island in early December. ""Compassion, respect, financial transparency,"" Mr. Pierce said when asked what was guiding them here. Mr. Pierce, the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, is a major figure in the crypto boom. He co-founded a blockchain-for-business start-up, Block.One, which has sold around $200 million of a custom virtual currency, EOS, in a so-called initial coin offering. The value of all the outstanding EOS tokens is around $6.5 billion. A former child actor, Mr. Pierce got into digital money early as a professional gamer, mining and trading gold in the video game World of Warcraft, an effort funded partly by Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser. Mr. Pierce is a controversial figure -- he has previously been sued for fraud, among other matters. Downstairs, in the Monastery penthouse, a dozen or so other expats were hanging out. The water was out that night, so the toilets and faucets were dry. Mr. Minor lounged on an alcove chaise. ""The U.S. doesn't want us. It's trying to choke off this economy,"" Mr. Minor said, referring to the difficulties that crypto investors have with American banks. ""There needs to be a place where people are free to invent."" Mr. Pierce paced the room with his hands in fists. A few times a day, he played a video for the group on his phone and a portable speaker: Charlie Chaplin's 1940 ""The Great Dictator,"" in which Chaplin parodies Hitler rallying his forces. He finds inspiration in lines like ""More than machinery, we need humanity."" ""I'm worried people are going to misinterpret our actions,"" Mr. Pierce said. ""That we're just coming to Puerto Rico to dodge taxes."" He said he was aiming to create a charitable token called ONE with $1 billion of his own money. ""If you take the MY out of money, you're left with ONE,"" Mr. Pierce said. ""He's tuned in to a higher calling,"" said Kai Nygard, scion of the Canadian clothing company Nygard and a crypto investor. ""He's beyond money."" The force of Mr. Pierce's personality and his spiritual presence are important to the group, whose members are otherwise largely agnostic. Mr. Pierce regularly performs rituals. Earlier that day while scoping out property, they had stopped at a historic Ceiba tree, known as the Tree of Life. ""Brock nestled into the bosom of it and was there for 10 minutes,"" Mr. Nygard said. Mr. Pierce walked around the tree and said prayers for Puertopia, holding a rusted wrench he had picked up in the territory. He kissed an old man's feet. He blessed a crystal in the water, as they all watched. He played the Chaplin speech to everyone and to the tree, Mr. Nygard said. That wrench is now in the penthouse, heavy and greasy. Later on, at a dinner in a nearby restaurant, the group ordered platters of octopus arms, fried cheese, ceviche and rum cocktails. They began debating whether to buy Puerto Rico's Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which measures 9,000 acres and has two deepwater ports and an adjacent airport. The only hitch: It's a Superfund cleanup site. Mr. Pierce had fallen asleep by then, his hat tilted down and arms crossed. He gets two hours of sleep many nights, often on a firm grounding mat to stay in contact with the earth's electric energy. Josh Boles, a tall, athletic man who is another crypto expat, picked him up, and the group headed back to the Monastery. They walked past a big pink building in an old town square, the start of their vision for Puertopia's downtown. Once a children's museum, they plan on making it a crypto clubhouse and outreach center that will have the mission ""to bring together Puerto Ricans with Puertopians."" The Vanderbilt Workdays are casual in Puertopia. One morning, Bryan Larkin, 39, and Reeve Collins, 42, were working at another old hotel, the Condado Vanderbilt, where they had their laptops on a pool bar with frozen piña coladas on tap. ""We're going to make this crypto land,"" Mr. Larkin said. Mr. Larkin has mined about $2 billion in Bitcoin and is the chief technology officer of Blockchain Industries, a publicly traded company based in Puerto Rico. Mr. Collins, an internet veteran, had raised more than $20 million from an initial coin offering for BlockV, his app store for the blockchain, whose outstanding tokens are worth about $125 million. He had also co-founded Tether, which backs cryptocurrency tied to the value of a dollar and whose outstanding tokens are worth about $2.1 billion, though the company has generated enormous controversy in the virtual currency world. ""So, no. No, I don't want to pay taxes,"" Mr. Collins said. ""This is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money."" He had moved from Santa Monica, Calif., with just a few bags and was now starting a local cryptocurrency incubator called Vatom Factory. ""When Brock said, 'We're moving to Puerto Rico for the taxes and to create this new town,' I said, 'I'm in,'"" Mr. Collins said. ""Sight unseen."" They soon went back to work, checking out Coinmarketcap.com, a site that shows the price of cryptocurrencies. ""Our market cap's gone up $100 million in a week,"" Mr. Collins said. ""Congrats, man,"" Mr. Larkin said. Welcome, Puertopians? All across San Juan, many locals are trying to figure out what to do with the crypto arrivals. Some are open to the new wave as a welcome infusion of investment and ideas. ""We're open for crypto business,"" said Erika Medina-Vecchini, the chief business development officer for the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, in an interview at her office. She said her office was starting an ad campaign aimed at the new crypto expat boom, with the tagline ""Paradise Performs."" Others worry about the island's being used for an experiment and talk about ""crypto colonialism."" At a house party in San Juan, Richard Lopez, 32, who runs a pizza restaurant, Estella, in the town of Arecibo, said: ""I think it's great. Lure them in with taxes, and they'll spend money."" Andria Satz, 33, who grew up in Old San Juan and works for the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, disagreed. ""We're the tax playground for the rich,"" she said. ""We're the test case for anyone who wants to experiment. Outsiders get tax exemptions, and locals can't get permits."" Mr. Lopez said the territory needed something to jump-start the economy. ""We have to find a new way,"" he said. ""Sure then, Bitcoin, why not,"" Ms. Satz said, throwing up her hands. Mr. Lopez said he and a childhood friend, Rafael Perez, 31, were trying to set up a Bitcoin mine in their hometown. But electricity has been inconsistent, and mining even a single Bitcoin takes a lot of power, he said. Follow Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @NellieBowles.  PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Erika P.

Cryptocurrencies Come to Campus,"BERKELEY, Calif. -- While the price of Bitcoin has dropped since Christmas, the virtual currency boom has shown no signs of cooling off in the more august precincts of America's elite universities. Several top schools have added or are rushing to add classes about Bitcoin and the record-keeping technology that it introduced, known as the blockchain. Graduate-level classes this semester at Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland, among other places, illustrate the fascination with the technology across several academic fields, and the assumption that it will outlast the current speculative price bubble.  ""There was some gentle ribbing from my colleagues when I began giving talks on Bitcoin,"" said David Yermack, a business and law professor at New York University who offered one of the first for-credit courses on the topic back in 2014. ""But within a few months, I was being invited to Basel to talk with central bankers, and the joking from my colleagues stopped after that."" For a class this semester, Mr. Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students, but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at N.Y.U. when enrollment kept going up. He now has 225 people signed up for the class. A course about virtual currencies created by a Princeton computer science professor, Arvind Narayanan, has been the fifth-most-popular class on Coursera, an online learning site. And last month at the University of California, Berkeley, students were lining the walls and sitting in the aisles for the first lecture of ""Blockchain, Cryptoeconomics and the Future of Technology, Business and Law."" ""This is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class,"" Dawn Song, a computer science professor, told the students. ""There are a bazillion other students who are waiting for your spot."" Because developments in the field are moving so fast, the business school professor also teaching the class, Greg La Blanc, said the students would have to forgive the teachers if they got things wrong on occasion. ""We aren't waiting until we perfect it,"" he said. ""Don't compare it to the perfect blockchain course. Compare it to having no blockchain course at all."" The 75 spots in the Berkeley class were divided evenly among the law school, the business school and the engineering department, and faculty from the three departments are teaching the course together. Ms. Song said she had around 100 students vying for the 25 places set aside for her department. The interest is a fueled by the rising price of virtual currencies over the last year. But they have created a host of issues that are worthy of study even apart from the price, professors in a variety of fields said. For lawyers, virtual currency projects have challenged traditional legal categories and definitions of what constitutes a security or a commodity. Regulators have been caught flat-footed as entrepreneurs have raised billions of dollars by selling virtual currencies without going through the traditional fund-raising channels, taking advantage of the legal fuzziness surrounding them. For economists and business school professors, Bitcoin and other digital tokens have raised questions about the nature of money. The first lecture in the Berkeley class, for example, considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of money. Several business school classes are also focusing on the decentralized methods of record keeping and decision making introduced by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is given credit for creating the first blockchain, a ledger of transactions that is updated by a network of computers without relying on any central company or government. Many big companies are now looking at how blockchains independent of Bitcoin might be used to do things like track music royalties or cargo containers with input from the many parties involved. ""The students in my class are from every possible discipline,"" said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke's business school, who is teaching a class with 231 students this semester. ""They understand that this is going to disrupt many different areas of business, and they want to be the disrupters, not the disruptees."" The computer scientists, meanwhile, are digging into the cryptography that virtual currencies use to secure their wallets and transaction data, as well as the design of the distributed computer networks that make blockchains possible. Last week, Stanford University hosted a three-day conference on the architecture and security of blockchain software, part of a new cottage industry in academic conferences and journals that have sprung up. ""Let's assume that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin drops down to $2,"" said Nicolas Christin, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, who is teaching a course on ""Cryptocurrencies, Blockchains and Applications"" this semester. ""I still think it's very cool from a technical standpoint."" Professors and students alike said that aside from the academic possibilities, familiarity with blockchain technology was becoming much more useful on the job market. The job site Indeed.com has reported a spike in job listings that mention the blockchain, and there is now an entire site, Crypto Jobs List, dedicated to opportunities in the young industry. Vinny Tuminelli, a business school student sitting at the back of the Berkeley class, said that during an internship at Anheuser-Busch last summer, the blockchain had come up in an ""innovation team"" he was on. When he met with his supervisor more recently, the topic came up again. ""My original understanding was that it was just thrown out there as a buzzword,"" Mr. Tuminelli said. ""But now it seems like it has some legs behind it, and people are putting real resources toward it."" Students appear to have caught on to the opportunity faster than their professors. Berkeley students have created a campus club that offers multiple courses on blockchain technology, taught by the students themselves. The director of M.I.T.'s Digital Currency Initiative, Neha Narula, said that when it didn't schedule a course for this semester, she got constant requests from students. So she put one together and is now co-teaching it. ""Students are just fascinated with this area,"" she said. ""They want to learn about it desperately.""

Virtual Currency Offerings May Hit a New Peak with Telegram Coin Sale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- It took Facebook seven years to raise $1 billion from investors. Uber did it in five. The messaging company Telegram has been around since 2013, but never tried to raise significant money until late last year. Now, thanks to an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., Telegram is on track to pull in a billion dollars in just four months -- long before the product the company is raising money for is even built. When programmers or entrepreneurs launch an I.C.O., what they are really doing is selling their own virtual currencies in order to raise money for software they say they are building. In return for real money, investors receive digital tokens, similar to Bitcoin. Regulators worry this novel fund-raising method is allowing people to flout the rules that are supposed to protect investors. Financial authorities around the world have been promising to crack down on coin offerings, which rose out of nowhere last year to become a popular way for start-ups to raise tens of millions of dollars, sometimes in minutes.  In recent months, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been sending out subpoenas, asking for information about coin offerings that may have violated the law -- although how existing laws may apply remains unclear. Nonetheless, companies like Telegram are still proceeding with their offerings and hoping they can stay out of trouble. Telegram's supercharged fund-raising has become the most visible and perhaps most lucrative example of an I.C.O. The company has taken in $850 million over the past two months from some of the biggest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, and it is now aiming to raise another $850 million over the next month or so. A third $850 million round is in the works after that, according to documents associated with the offering. Telegram already runs a popular messaging service. It plans to use the new money to create both an online currency for ordinary people -- outside the control of governments -- and a new kind of global computing network, combining the attributes of existing virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The project is being led by one of the most vaunted but enigmatic figures in the tech world, Pavel Durov, who built the biggest social network in Russia, VKontakte, before thumbing his nose at Vladimir V. Putin and fleeing the country. He now hops between bases in Dubai and around Europe. Despite Mr. Durov's credentials, the tech world is divided on the wisdom of putting money into his fund-raising campaign. Some of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture firms have signed up to invest in the project, including Benchmark, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, according to two people briefed on the private deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly. But the venture capitalists who have invested the most in the virtual currency space, like Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock and Polychain Capital, have stayed away. ""It's a pitch that sounds good to V.C.s that haven't participated but makes no sense to people that have been in the space,"" said Nick Tomaino, the founder of a virtual currency investment fund, 1confirmation, that didn't invest in Telegram. The most obvious reason to be skeptical of the project is that there is not even a prototype -- just a 132-page paper promising what the system will look like one day. The Telegram team is promising to release the software late this year or next year. What's more, Telegram is promising to do more than any other virtual currency and to fix the intractable problems that have plagued virtual currencies like Bitcoin, such as overcoming the network's difficulty handling all the transactions that have poured onto the network as it has become more popular. An analyst at one virtual currency-focused hedge fund, Pantera Capital, wrote a scathing essay noting that the Telegram team has given no evidence that they will be able to solve the problems that have dogged everyone else. ""I cannot, in 132 pages, gain the slightest intuition as to how to go about proving that the hard problems it needs to solve will be solved,"" the analyst, Charles Noyes, wrote about the Telegram project on Medium. Telegram representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Believers in the Telegram project have said that the company has a team of developers that have already proved themselves by building two incredibly popular tech products, VKontakte and Telegram. Mr. Durov, a self-described libertarian, founded VKontakte in 2006, but gave up his role and his ownership stake in 2013 after Mr. Putin's allies took control of the company. Since then, Mr. Durov and his brother, who is said to be the technical genius behind the projects, have built Telegram into a messaging giant with nearly 200 million users. (When Facebook raised a billion dollars, it already had half a billion users.) The Telegram app has been popular in authoritarian countries because it promises that all messages are encrypted and protected from government snooping. Its pro-privacy stance has made it popular with many in the virtual currency community. The virtual currency network that Telegram is building, known as the Telegram Open Network, or TON, would allow users of the Telegram app to send each other payments when they are not in the same country. It would be a Bitcoin equivalent to the popular payment systems that messaging programs like WeChat have built. ""TON can become a VISA/Mastercard alternative for the new decentralized economy,"" said a TON primer that was sent to investors. ""We believe that a whole new economy saturated with goods and services sold for cryptocurrency will be born."" The Telegram Open Network will use the idea of the blockchain, first introduced by Bitcoin, to maintain all the records of Telegram's currency, known as the Gram, on computers around the world, without any central authority. But Telegram is promising that its blockchains will do much more than Bitcoin: serve as the basis for a global super computer, somewhat like the popular Ethereum network. The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have both struggled to keep up with transactions, but Telegram said it will overcome this by using multiple blockchains that will allow it to process millions of transactions a second. The Bitcoin network limit is currently around five transactions a second. The Telegram documents say that 5 billion Grams will initially be released to users. The investors who put the first $850 million into the project paid 37 cents for each token, according to offering documents. The next round of investors, expected to come together over the next month, will pay about three and half times that for each Gram. If the current round raises another $850 million, Telegram said in documents that it may hold yet another round, to raise $850 million more. The price that Telegram is charging in the current fund-raising round -- $1.33 a Gram -- assumes the entire currency will grow to be worth at least $6.6 billion. There are already eight virtual currencies worth that much, and all the Bitcoin in the world were worth around $185 billion on Sunday. Given Telegram's experience, many investors think it won't be hard to achieve that long term value. Telegram's team has also been careful to stay on the right side of the law, only offering their token to accredited investors, and working with the established Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. Telegram initially said in its offering documents that it would do a public sale of Grams, to smaller investors, but it backed away from that after American regulators spoke in congressional hearings in February about their concerns over I.C.O.s, according to the people briefed on the deal. Despite those precautions, many virtual currency investors said the Telegram offering was too risky. ""This is an order of magnitude larger than any of the most hyped I.C.O.s we've seen,"" said Joe DiPasquale, the founder of BitBull Capital, a hedge fund. ""As an investor who looks at a lot of projects in this space, that for me is a concern.""

Think Cryptocurrency Is Confusing? Try Paying Taxes on It; The Shift,"The room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren't nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets. No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how -- and whether -- to pay them. With this year's April 17 tax filing deadline fast approaching, many virtual currency traders are sweating over their tax returns. They're confused by the complicated rules, many of them stemming from guidelines issued by the I.R.S. in 2014, governing the taxation of virtual currencies. They're afraid that the windfall profits created by last year's cryptocurrency boom, which sent currencies like Bitcoin and Ether skyrocketing and created a new class of crypto-millionaires, have left them with huge tax bills. And, of course, they're worried about drawing the eye of the Internal Revenue Service. ""I've lost sleep over it,"" said Shaun, a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last year's cryptocurrency profits on his taxes. Shaun, who asked that his last name not be used because he has been audited in the past, said he was scared that increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market could lead the I.R.S. to pay special attention to cases like his.  ""I don't want to be made an example of,"" he said. This gathering, which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics, a research and education company, featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation. For an hour, the audience peppered them with tax-prep questions that ranged from common (Do I have to pay taxes on Bitcoin if I haven't sold yet?) to esoteric (If my Bitcoin wallet got hacked and all my coins got stolen, can I deduct my losses?). By the end of the hour, there seemed to be many more questions than answers. ""It's complicated as heck,"" said Mike Schreibman, an I.T. consultant who attended. Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis. ""Nobody knows what's going to happen,"" said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. ""But the I.R.S. is the one agency you don't want to mess with."" Taxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into ""privacy coins,"" such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users' transactions. Cryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology's stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it's possible for users to conceal their identities. Until recently, the I.R.S. showed little desire to go after cryptocurrency income, since there was so little of it. But last year's boom changed all that. The agency has formed a team of specialists to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes, including international money laundering and tax evasion. In November, after a yearlong lawsuit, the agency won a judgment that forced Coinbase, the largest American-based cryptocurrency exchange, to turn over account records for more than 14,000 customers. In January, Coinbase sent 1099-K forms to a number of its current users, informing them that their trading proceeds were being reported to the I.R.S. and reminding them to pay the taxes they owed. All of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon. Mario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business. ""We're preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,"" Mr. Costanz said. Laura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year. ""A lot of crypto investors are younger and don't have a lot of experience trading stocks,"" she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, ""a lot of people are kind of shocked."" Part of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else -- whether you're cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee -- you're creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for. Complicating matters even more, the timing of last year's cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year's market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year's gains. Ms. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. ""Now they're stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don't have the capital to pay it."" Faced with such problems, some cryptocurrency traders have decided to avoid the issue entirely, by not declaring any cryptocurrency on their taxes and hoping for the best. According to Credit Karma, which provides tax-filing services, fewer than 100 of the 250,000 people who had used the company's tax-filing software as of February reported cryptocurrency transactions, a rate below 0.04 percent. Even the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew weren't planning to pay taxes on their crypto-gains. ""This is the smallest crypto event I've been to,"" said Mr. Schreibman, the I.T. consultant. ""No one believes they'll get in trouble."" All the traders at the event said they would do their best to pay their taxes in full. And they looked a little shellshocked, as if they had been rudely yanked out of a thrilling, consequence-free virtual world back into the real one. Peter Baniuszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader from Brooklyn, told me that this year's tax season had come as a jolt of reality. ""It's not Monopoly money anymore,"" he said.

How to Get $29 Million for Classroom Projects? Just Ask,"There was the class of Iowa teenagers seeking supplies for the homeless, and a Texas teacher who wanted $150 in headphones for her elementary school students. In Illinois, one educator wanted a set of laptops to better prepare her students for middle school, while a teacher in Massachusetts sought $41,000 to stock a library in an elementary school that serves low-income students, many of them refugees. This week, those requests, along with the more than 35,000 others listed on DonorsChoose.org, a crowdfunding website for school and classroom projects, were fully funded thanks to a single $29 million donation.  ""A million students, overwhelmingly in low-income communities, are going to feel the impact of this gift within the next few weeks,"" said Charles Best, chief executive of the nonprofit group, which he founded in 2000 while teaching history and English in a Bronx classroom. The gift, by far the largest ever received by the charity, came after the site reached out to Ripple, a virtual currency company that has amassed wealth at an astonishing pace, and its executives. ""We're surrounded by people who have benefited from having great educational experiences and we very much recognize that's not the case across the U.S.,"" said Monica Long, the senior vice president of marketing at Ripple, which is based in San Francisco. ""It's just a subject that we all care very passionately about and we were in a position to make it happen,"" she said of the decision to fully fund or top off all outstanding requests for supplies, books, technology, food, equipment, trips and more. The donation was announced this week by the late-night host Stephen Colbert, who himself helped to fund every project in his home state of South Carolina in 2015. It will reach at least some classrooms in more than 16,500 public schools, or about 1 in 6 public schools nationwide, according to the charity. Among them is Marina Del Rey Middle School in Los Angeles. Heather Vibbert, a special-education teacher there, had six requests fulfilled as a result of this week's donation. As a result, her students, many of them from low-income households, will benefit from new science DVDs, a Blu-ray player, art supplies and individual white boards, among other things. The highlight, though, will be a Google Expeditions Kit, which will enable them to take virtual field trips. ""I can guide them through the ocean bottom or Mars or any kind of crazy place we can dream of, which I'm very excited about,"" Ms. Vibbert said. ""That was kind of my big aspirational project that I never thought would get funded, but it never hurts to ask."" No one understands that better than Mr. Best, who in January reached out to the Ripple chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, a longtime supporter of the charity, with an audacious proposal: What if the business fulfilled every request on the website? Mr. Best hesitated to send the email at first, fearing that he might offend Mr. Garlinghouse, but pushed ahead, acknowledging upfront that he was making a ""wildly ambitious pitch."" ""I just hope you don't mind my swinging for the fences,"" he wrote. It paid off. Soon, Ripple invited him to San Francisco to make the case in person and, within about a month of receiving the email, the company had agreed to make the donation. DonorsChoose.org vets each project posted on the site. Once a funding goal is reached, the charity works with teachers and schools to fulfill the request, rather than simply transferring the money directly to the person who made it. In the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District in North Carolina, 212 projects worth about $130,000 were fulfilled by Ripple's donation. In Atlanta, it funded about 260 projects, valued at more than $280,000. The requests can be wide-ranging. Many are for necessities like supplies, clothing or food, but others can help teachers pursue passion projects that schools may not have the resources to support, school administrators said. ""It encourages teachers to be excited about their practice, to test things that we typically would not be able to fund,"" said Meria Carstarphen, the superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools. Most of the donations teachers receive come from outside of their community, allowing instructors in low-income areas to connect with those who have the means to help. This week's gift from Ripple not only eclipsed the previous top donation of $9 million, but it also sparked a flurry of activity for DonorsChoose.org. On Wednesday, 16,000 projects were created on the website, beating its previous weekly record of 15,000 new requests in a single day. Among them is one from Ms. Vibbert, who hopes to purchase a set of books for her students about the friendship between Alexander Hamilton and his sister-in-law Peggy Schuyler.

Venture Capitalists Seek 'Safe Harbor' for Virtual Currencies,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have been lobbying federal regulators to protect at least some virtual currencies from being categorized as securities, a designation that would carry significantly more oversight. The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz helped assemble a group of investors and lawyers that met with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late March. They also proposed a ""safe harbor"" for some virtual currencies, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by The New York Times and three people briefed on the effort who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the proceedings were confidential. Regulators have indicated in private meetings that they are considering whether virtual currencies -- including Ether, the second most widely used digital token -- should be categorized as a security, according to three people who have been in the meetings. That designation could cause a significant drop in the value of Ether.  ""It's a 'come to the lord' moment,"" said Richard Levin, a lawyer at the firm Polsinelli who works with companies in the space. ""We are seeing a watershed moment in which many firms in the digital asset community who may have been ignorant of the law -- or poorly informed -- are now coming to terms with the fact that they are subject to regulators."" The group led by Andreessen Horowitz called themselves the ""Venture Capital Working Group,"" according to the proposal, dated March 26. The group included the two largest venture capital firms in the virtual currency industry, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. It also included lawyers from Cooley, Perkins Coie, and McDermott Will &amp; Emery, the people involved in the effort said. The group met with the S.E.C. in Washington on March 28 to present their idea for a safe harbor that would allow some tokens to be categorized as ""utility tokens"" rather than securities. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on the meeting. Thousands of virtual currencies have been created through so-called initial coin offerings in which entrepreneurs sold digital tokens to raise money for their projects. The tokens are generally intended to serve as internal payment methods in software that the entrepreneurs are building. Over the past year, entrepreneurs have raised more than $6 billion through initial coin offerings. These coins mostly trade on unregulated virtual currency exchanges. Many entrepreneurs have said that because their tokens have a utility, as a payment method, they should not be considered investment contracts or securities. But Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has said in recent months that he believes almost every token issued through an initial coin offering should be registered as a security -- almost none are today. The S.E.C. has sent subpoenas to dozens of people and companies in the virtual currency industry asking for information about how various digital tokens were issued and marketed to investors. When investments are securities, they generally need to have paperwork filed with regulators and can only be traded on regulated exchanges, like those where stocks and commodities are bought and sold. No regulated securities exchanges offer virtual currency trading. Most investors assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or central organization. New Bitcoins are distributed on a daily basis to computers helping to maintain the network. Some large virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs. But Ethereum, the virtual currency network that houses the Ether virtual currency, did raise money by selling Ether tokens to investors through what was then called a pre-sale and is now often called an initial coin offering. The Ethereum Foundation took in Bitcoin that were worth around $18 million at the time. Ether are now distributed in a manner similar to that of Bitcoin. The group pulled together by Andreessen Horowitz said in its proposal that Ether ""has become so decentralized it should not be deemed a security."" The proposal suggests that digital tokens should generally be exempt from securities laws if they achieve ""full decentralization"" or ""full functionality."" It adds that full decentralization could occur under several conditions, including ""when the token creator no longer has control of the network based on its ability to make unilateral changes to the functionality of the tokens."" The proposal says a token is fully functional when it can be used for its intended purpose on a computer network and is not just useful as a speculative investment, which is the case with many tokens today. The group notes that these definitions are only suggestions, but the ""proposed safe harbor has been vetted by, and has the support of, many of the key players in the industry."" People briefed on the meeting said that regulators did not immediately embrace the safe harbor proposal. Many entrepreneurs and law firms have been creating new ways for virtual currency projects to issue their tokens as securities and some exchanges have talked about getting registered as official securities exchanges. It is still unclear what will happen to tokens that did not register as securities but are later categorized as securities.

A Former Top Wall Street Regulator Turns to the Blockchain,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Gary Gensler was one of the top financial regulators in the Obama administration, the finance chief for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and, before both of those jobs, a partner at Goldman Sachs. Now, like many other big names from business and government, he is plunging into the world of the blockchain, the data-tracking technology introduced by Bitcoin. Mr. Gensler, 60, has recently gone to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he will write and teach about the potential he sees for blockchains to change the financial world. He will also use his position to warn about how many of the current projects in the world of virtual currencies, including some of the biggest, are likely to face a significant moment of reckoning with regulators.  Mr. Gensler is set to say in a speech at M.I.T. on Monday that the second and third most widely used virtual currencies, Ether and Ripple, have most likely been issued and traded in violation of American securities regulations. ""There is a strong case for both of them -- but particularly Ripple -- that they are noncompliant securities,"" he said in an interview. He believes Bitcoin, the original virtual currency, can remain exempt from securities regulations. Mr. Gensler will be one of the most influential voices to weigh in on a series of questions that are likely to shape the future of the nascent industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the agency that Mr. Gensler led from 2009 to 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are in the middle of determining how to categorize and crack down on many of the virtual currencies created in recent years. Most of the focus has been on smaller currencies that were issued through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, a method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies. But Mr. Gensler believes that better-known virtual currencies like Ether and Ripple should be in that conversation as well and should likely be categorized as securities, given the way they have been created and sold. ""2018 is going to be a very interesting time,"" Mr. Gensler said. ""Over 1,000 previously issued initial coin offerings, and over 100 exchanges that offer I.C.O.s, are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with U.S. securities law."" The people behind both Ether and Ripple have argued that their tokens are not securities. But there are signs that the S.E.C. could be receptive to Mr. Gensler's argument. Regulators have indicated in private meetings with industry participants that they are considering whether Ether should be categorized as a security. All the outstanding Ether were worth around $65 billion at Sunday's price, while the Ripple tokens in the hands of investors are worth around $35 billion. If they are deemed to be securities, it could become illegal for Americans to trade them on most of the exchanges where they are now traded. That would make it harder to buy and sell them and depress their prices. Mr. Gensler developed a reputation for standing up to powerful financial interests when he was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Before he got into office, some worried that his background at Goldman Sachs would make him hesitant to take on the big banks. But as the chairman of the commission he became one of the most aggressive watchdogs in the effort to rein in Wall Street after the financial crisis. Joi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, said the combination of Mr. Gensler's record of independence and his knowledge of finance and policy was what made him so attractive to M.I.T. Mr. Ito has built the Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab in an effort to gather a collection of virtual currency experts who don't have a financial interest in them, though the initiative does provide financial support for some developers working on the Bitcoin software. ""It's important that you have a core group of people who aren't in it for the money, and who care about the proper architecture for the long run,"" he said. Mr. Gensler has a dual appointment as a special adviser to the Media Lab and a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he will teach a class on the blockchain in the fall. The original blockchain is the ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. The Bitcoin blockchain is updated by a network of computers so that no central authority is needed. While most blockchain experiments are in an early stage, Mr. Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industry. For now, though, his words are likely to have their greatest impact on the quickly evolving debate about how virtual currencies should be regulated. Most industry experts, including Mr. Gensler, assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or a central organization, and the software is maintained by a decentralized group of developers. Some other virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs. But Mr. Gensler said Ether could have more problems because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014, before the network was functional, by the Ethereum Foundation. Ether could get off the hook, Mr. Gensler said, because its development has been more decentralized recently, and new Ether tokens are now given out to so-called miners through a network. Aya Miyaguchi, the head of the Ethereum Foundation, said in an email that the foundation ""neither controls the supply of nor has the ability to issue Ether, and the quantity of Ether that the foundation holds (under 1 percent of all Ether) is already lower than that held by many other ecosystem participants."" But Mr. Gensler said it would be much harder for the Ripple token, known as XRP, to avoid being categorized as a security. The company that oversees Ripple's development still holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make the software and the token valuable, he said. A spokesman for the company Ripple, Tom Channick, said XRP should not be a security. ""XRP does not give its owners an interest or stake in Ripple, and they are not paid dividends,"" he said. ""XRP exists independent of Ripple, was created before the company and will exist after it."" Mr. Gensler, who has no virtual currency investments, said he was not tied to any coin's winning the race. But he does think changes are necessary before blockchains can go mainstream. ""I would be surprised if 10 years from now this isn't somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way,"" he said. ""But so much of the stuff that is being promoted now will not be around.""

"Blockchain Will Be Theirs, Russian Spy Boasted at Conference","SAN FRANCISCO -- Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles. Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B. They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards. ""Look, the internet belongs to the Americans -- but blockchain will belong to us,"" he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country's four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B.  Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: ""The internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians."" Both of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment. The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain -- a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting -- and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles. The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack. The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more. Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants. ""It is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,"" said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. ""To get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically."" The original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data. There are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations -- and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But in countries like the United States, China, Russia, Singapore and Switzerland, government groups have talked about using blockchains for myriad tasks, like issuing national currency or tracking identity records for citizens and visitors. Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes. Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group. Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity. ""In the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,"" said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. ""If something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale -- and won't be questioned on the way in."" Ms. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries. The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting -- first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations. [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] ""There has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward,"" said Mr. Dunn, who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committee. Few countries have made their interest in the blockchain as clear as Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin met briefly last year with Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the second most widely used blockchain-based virtual currency platform after Bitcoin. Mr. Putin also put the blockchain at the center of his ""Digital Economy"" program for Russia, and his government has talked about creating a crypto-ruble, similar to Bitcoin. One of the Russian delegates to the I.S.O. blockchain group, Maxim Shevchenko, gave a talk last summer in Russia in which he spoke about the country's goals in the I.S.O. group. The bullet points on the slide included ""possibility to influence the technology"" and ""implementation Russian standards and solutions worldwide."" Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B. Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains. At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants. The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology. At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France. Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology. ""It will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,"" he said. ""We all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few."" Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper. Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting from Moscow.

Bitcoin Sees Wall Street Warm to Trading Virtual Currency,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Some of the biggest names on Wall Street are warming up to Bitcoin, a virtual currency that for nearly a decade has been consigned to the unregulated fringes of the financial world. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential. The news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before, came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit -- most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank. The moves by Goldman and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a high-risk, speculative investment.  The new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of Bitcoin. The virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a still-anonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldn't be controlled by a handful of powerful organizations. But instead of being replaced, the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency, sometimes called cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions -- without any financial institutions getting involved -- it has mostly become a virtual investment, stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world. People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up, similar to the way they purchase gold or silver. Details of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart, given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies. A spokesman said that the company had no comment. Many corporations and governments have expressed interest in the technology that Bitcoin introduced, particularly a form of database known as the blockchain. Some large financial exchanges, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin, known as futures. But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer's account at the end of the trade. ICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day -- with the backing and security of the exchange, according to the people familiar with the project. The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws -- something today's Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do. The chief executive of Nasdaq, Adena Friedman, recently said her company could also create a virtual-currency exchange if regulatory issues are ironed out. While several hedge funds have been buying and selling Bitcoin, most large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions, have avoided it largely as a result of similar regulatory concerns. Bitcoin still faces plenty of skepticism in the mainstream financial world. Over the weekend, Warren E. Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long been critical of virtual currencies, said Bitcoin was ""probably rat poison squared"" in an interview with CNBC. The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates added his own skepticism, saying he'd ""short"" Bitcoin if he could. And the new efforts to trade Bitcoin don't help answer basic questions about what makes the virtual currency useful in the real world. Most attempts to use Bitcoin for everyday commerce haven't gained traction, and investors have treated it as a speculative commodity like gold or silver. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts have said that its increasing integration into the existing financial system has pulled it away from its founding ideals. Paul Chou, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who set up LedgerX, a regulated Bitcoin exchange that would compete with Intercontinental Exchange, said his company has made a point of focusing on large Bitcoin holders, rather than financial institutions. ""The reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank, but to replace them,"" Mr. Chou said, using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies. ""We deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoin's strengths, while avoiding brokers, banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transaction."" Goldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoin's price. But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual Bitcoins. Intercontinental Exchange's effort, if it pans out, could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base, including other financial firms. Several big corporate names, including the giant technology investor SoftBank, which has stakes in Sprint and Uber, have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way, the people familiar with the project said. But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involved. LedgerX, the exchange founded by Mr. Chou, is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed. LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months, but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institution is already hooked into it. The interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has, after a rocky start, improved. Regulators are currently looking at whether many virtual currencies, including the second most widely used digital token, Ether, have been issued and traded in violation of securities regulations. Institutional investors believe that because of the way Bitcoin was created and structured -- without any one company or organization behind it -- it would be on safer ground with regulators. ICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether, but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty, the people briefed on the effort said. Mr. Chou, at LedgerX, said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to Ether. With Bitcoin, on the other hand, Mr. Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involved. ""The industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoin's history,"" he said. ""I've been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical. It's a healthy skepticism. But at some point the perception shifts, and for many institutions -- I think we're finally there."" Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

"In the World of Cryptocurrency, Even Good Projects Can Go Bad","SAN FRANCISCO -- While scams proliferated in the unregulated world of virtual currencies over the last year, a company in Switzerland seemed to be among the more legitimate outfits creating its own cryptocurrency. The company, Envion, said it had collected $100 million from investors this year with a plan to bring clean energy to the computers that manage Bitcoin. The project was reinforced by partnerships with German businesspeople and politicians and with a German academic institution, as well as by promises of compliance with Swiss and American laws. But like so many other projects that have pulled in millions of dollars through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, Envion is now melting down, with its creators accusing one another of fraud. The business appears to be in limbo. And investors are bonding on social media about how much they figure they lost on the project. Adam Elfarouq, a 29-year-old in Morocco, said he had put $3,000 into Envion and encouraged friends and relatives to invest their money. ""I know most of the I.C.O.s out there are either fraud or won't deliver on their promises,"" he said. Envion, he believed, was different.  The Envion experience is the latest reminder of how the sudden rise of virtual currencies has allowed entrepreneurs to have direct access to investors without regulatory oversight -- often with financially disastrous consequences for investors. Initial coin offerings came out of almost nowhere last year to become one of the most popular ways for start-ups to raise money. Investors threw more than $5 billion at coin offerings last year. Most projects have raised money by selling custom cryptocurrencies -- akin to Bitcoin -- that are designed to be used as a method of payment on software the start-ups are building. The hope is that the coins will become more valuable as the software becomes more useful. But even for the people who work in the virtual-currency world, the complex structure and speed of initial coin offerings make it difficult to separate the good from the bad. Seif Shieshakly, an adviser to Envion who is based in the United Arab Emirates, said that the I.C.O. structure had ""cut out so many middlemen"" and created new investment opportunities, but that ""the lack of regulations, again because of the infancy of I.C.O.s, carries risks that regulated environments would generally have far less of."" Regulators around the world have scrambled to stay on top of I.C.O.s. China banned coin offerings last year, and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has done a broad sweep of the industry, sending out dozens of subpoenas. But so far, the authorities have cracked down on only a few projects, and coin offerings have continued at a blazing pace, raising more money so far in 2018 than they did in all of 2017. Envion tried to separate itself from the flood of scam offerings that have popped up over the last year. A spokesman for Envion, Chris Pfaff, sent out emails last year saying it was closing deals with IBM and the ruler of Dubai. But Mr. Pfaff said last week that those deals never panned out. Envion said it would use the money collected from investors to build mobile rigs, filled with computers designed to ""mine"" or digitally create new Bitcoin. The rigs could be moved between sources of renewable electricity, which would power the mining computers. Envion said people who bought its new tokens would have a right to a share of the new Bitcoins mined. The founders of the company, about half a dozen programmers and marketers, set it up in Switzerland, and said they were compliant with all the necessary regulations. In one of its many promotional posts on Medium, the Envion team wrote: ""As financial regulators across the globe look to regulate I.C.O.s and protect investors, Envion serves as a model for a compliant crowdsale that operates with the same transparency and integrity of traditional financial markets."" A current spokesman for the founders, Laurent Martin, said problems had begun even before the project started fund-raising late last year because of the chief executive the founders brought in, Matthias Woestmann. According to Mr. Martin, the founders gave Mr. Woestmann what they thought was temporary control of their shares in the company. Mr. Woestmann later refused to give them back, and then diluted the shares of the other owners, providing him with control of the money that was raised. Mr. Martin said the problems that had come up since then were not caused by the I.C.O. structure. Instead, he said, they are a result of Mr. Woestmann's tactics and his refusal to give back ownership of the company. ""Envion did something truly unique in the way they protected investors,"" Mr. Martin said. ""It's unfortunate that each of these bulwarks is being tested."" In an interview, Mr. Woestmann said he had taken control of the company because the founders created extra Envion tokens to enrich themselves -- a claim the founders deny. He has recently made efforts to sell the company to new owners. Most of the investors on Envion's channel on the messaging service Telegram have sided with the founders against Mr. Woestmann, who they say should either begin building the product that was promised or refund investors. But large Envion investors who have organized a group online say they distrust the founders as well. They note that the founders are now led by a man named Michael Luckow, who was never mentioned during the fund-raising process. They complain that the founders let investors buy tokens without providing any information about the turmoil behind the scenes. The investors have also turned up evidence that some of the founders sold their own tokens before the current mess spilled into the public. ""As an investor, this is a horrible situation to be in, as in my point of view both parties are to blame,"" said Peter Kozak, a 47-year-old in Switzerland who put $55,000 into Envion. ""So many questions and no answers."" Mr. Martin said that the tokens had been sold to pay Envion expenses and that Mr. Luckow simply hadn't wanted to take on a more public role early on. It is still possible that investors will get at least some of their money back. Mr. Woestmann said he still had control of most of the money in the bank, with the founders controlling another chunk. But he said the funds added up to only $50 million at this point, not the $100 million that the founders had claimed. Mr. Woestmann said the founders hadn't raised as much money as they claimed. And the declining price of virtual currencies has dropped the value of the various digital tokens Envion is holding. Jessica Smith, a 21-year-old in England, said she had put $28,000 into Envion -- almost all of the money she had made over the last two years of trading cryptocurrencies nearly full time. She said she was now looking for new work. ""This has been very painful,"" she said. Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Stephen Bannon Buys Into Bitcoin,"WASHINGTON -- Stephen K. Bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to President Trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site Breitbart News, is betting that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way Mr. Trump disrupted American politics. Mr. Bannon won't reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans -- he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground. But he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, Bannon &amp; Company. And in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a ""good stake"" in Bitcoin. In a small gathering of academics at Harvard University this spring, he even floated the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the ""deplorables coin."" The name is a nod to Hillary Clinton's description of Mr. Trump's supporters as ""a basket of deplorables.""  The work that Mr. Bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. But he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies -- generally outside the United States. The offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and the most staid institutions of Wall Street. It is not a shocking place for Mr. Bannon, 64, to plot his re-emergence. Cryptocurrencies have many of the characteristics that drew him into Tea Party politics: They break old rules, they exist on the periphery and they pose a challenge to the powerful figures and institutions that have long called the shots. ""It's disruptive populism,"" Mr. Bannon said in the interview at his Capitol Hill townhouse in Washington. ""It takes control back from central authorities. It's revolutionary."" Even though he has no formal ties to the business anymore, Mr. Bannon still refers to his townhouse as the Breitbart Embassy, the nickname given to it because so much of the site's business was done there. While Breitbart editors and writers no longer linger at all hours inside the embassy, remnants of the website remain in Breitbart mementos hanging from the wall and coffee mugs with the signature block B logo strewn about the kitchen. Mr. Bannon still accepts a steady stream of visitors who provide him intelligence and gossip from the conservative circles he once commanded. But these days he is just as likely to be convening meetings there on his new financial venture. He won't talk about a possible return to politics someday. His messy rupture with the White House over critical comments he made in Michael Wolff's book ""Fire and Fury"" about colleagues and Donald Trump Jr. is still too fresh. But he does see a political component to virtual currency. ""It was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency,"" Mr. Bannon said. His vision for virtual currency has elements of his unorthodox ideology. He sounds like both an avowed libertarian who wants government out of his life and a progressive who wants Wall Street held to account when he insists that virtual currencies can help citizens take back power from the central banks that ""debase your currency"" and make citizens ""slaves to debt."" His focus on creating new digital tokens, which are usually offered through initial coin offerings, puts him squarely in the edgiest, most scam-filled slice of the cryptocurrency business. New companies have raised billions through these I.C.O.s, which allow them to bypass regulators and other middlemen and go straight to investors. That has also led to plenty of scams, and authorities throughout the world are starting to crack down. Mr. Bannon's involvement in cryptocurrencies has raised eyebrows among people trying to move the business toward the mainstream. They fear he will further cement the technology's reputation as a plaything of fringe elements. ""It almost seems like a natural progression for a man who gained prominence by shoveling out unfounded conspiracies to now shilling complex technology and financial instruments to an unsophisticated investing public,"" said Colin Platt, a cryptocurrency researcher and adviser. Bitcoin are stored and moved around a global network of computers that allows for the system to work without relying on a central authority. That lack of oversight has made Bitcoin a favorite method of payment for online drug markets and ransom schemes. Bitcoin has been popular with the alt-right and nationalist communities because it has provided them with a way to receive online donations and evade restrictions put on them by banks and payment companies. PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, shut down the accounts of some right-wing groups last year. Cryptocurrencies are also gaining mainstream interest. Goldman Sachs, where Mr. Bannon worked in the 1980s, recently said it was creating a Bitcoin trading operation. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been looking at building an exchange for digital tokens. And Facebook has put top executives on a project exploring use of the technology. These big companies are generally trying to take the technology away from its radical political roots. But Mr. Bannon is hoping to embrace those roots. ""Control of the currency,"" he said, ""is control of everything."" Timothy Lewis, a hedge fund manager who met with Mr. Bannon to talk about cryptocurrencies last month, said he was impressed with the degree to which Mr. Bannon had delved into the details of the technology and the challenges it faces. ""I didn't know what to expect going in, but he had clearly done his homework,"" said Mr. Lewis, who is a co-founder of the Ikigai hedge fund, which invests in cryptocurrency projects. He said they had talked about the laws governing new cryptocurrencies and a few initial coin offerings that had recently raised money from investors. Mr. Bannon is particularly interested in the possibility that countries could create coins tied to national wealth -- an Italian coin tied to marble deposits in the country, for instance. He found his way into the virtual currency universe through Brock Pierce, a former child actor who appeared in films like ""The Mighty Ducks"" before starting a company in Hong Kong that sold the virtual gold that players use in the video game World of Warcraft. The company, Internet Gaming Entertainment, or IGE, brought on Mr. Bannon as vice chairman in 2005 to help Mr. Pierce expand the business and deal with legal threats. Mr. Bannon credits the company with introducing him to the ranks of disaffected young men who gathered online around video games, and who became pillars of the alt-right movement. Since leaving IGE in 2007, Mr. Pierce has become involved with a wide array of virtual currency projects, including an effort to create a cryptocurrency enclave in Puerto Rico that takes advantage of the island's low taxes, and a new virtual currency known as EOS, which has raised over $3 billion. Mr. Bannon said he would have gotten involved with Mr. Pierce and cryptocurrencies back in 2016 if the Trump campaign hadn't intervened. Mr. Pierce's big claims for cryptocurrencies -- and a recent turn toward new age spiritualism -- have made him a target for critics. John Oliver, on his HBO comedy show, recently held up Mr. Pierce as an emblem of the bombast that floats around the virtual currency community. After the segment, the company that created EOS said Mr. Pierce had left the company. Mr. Bannon is not bothered by the mockery. Other causes he has taken on have worked out well despite low expectations. ""These guys are visionaries,"" he said. Follow Jeremy W.

"With Cryptocurrencies in Free Fall, One Big Firm Doubles Down","SAN FRANCISCO -- Even with the cryptocurrency markets in an extended slump, the most prominent venture capital firm in the sector is doubling down. Andreessen Horowitz, the well-known firm that made early bets on Instagram and Reddit, said on Monday that it was creating a $300 million fund focused exclusively on projects inspired by the original virtual currency, Bitcoin. One of the leaders of the new fund will be the firm's first female general partner, Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor.  Last year, when Bitcoin and most other virtual currencies were gaining in value, most of the large venture capital firms began beefing up on cryptocurrency expertise and making investments. Andreessen Horowitz was ahead of many of its peers. It was one of the first venture capital firms to begin dabbling in cryptocurrencies in 2013, when digital tokens were a fringe business. Now, Andreessen Horowitz appears to be the first mainstream venture capital firm to offer an investment fund focused exclusively on cryptocurrencies. The new fund -- A16z Crypto -- is being created at a difficult moment for the digital token markets. The price of Bitcoin has fallen by more than two-thirds since hitting a peak in December. Many smaller tokens have fallen much more than that as regulators have said many cryptocurrency projects that raised money last year had most likely done so illegally. Chris Dixon, who has been at the front of Andreessen Horowitz's work on digital currencies, and who will be one of the leaders of the new fund, has been critical of many of the projects that raised money through so-called initial coin offerings last year. But Mr. Dixon has argued that digital tokens provide a new way to fund and create decentralized software and protocols, like those that are the foundation of the internet. Andreessen has already made investments in many tokens aiming to do this, including Filecoin and Basis. ""There are two axes of progress; there is genuine innovation and the prices,"" Mr. Dixon said in an interview on Monday. ""The prices got ahead of the genuine innovation. The metric I look at is: Are there great entrepreneurs coming in and building great projects? On that metric I think the space is in a really strong place."" Since leaving the federal prosecutor's office in San Francisco in 2017, Ms. Haun has taught classes on cryptocurrencies at Stanford University and joined the board of Coinbase, the largest virtual currency brokerage. Ms. Haun led the prosecution of the federal agents who stole money from the online black market Silk Road when they were supposed to be tracking down the leader of the site. Andreessen Horowitz was one of the earliest investors in Coinbase. Mr. Dixon is on the board of the company, along with Ms. Haun. Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

After the Bitcoin Boom: Hard Lessons for Cryptocurrency Investors,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Pete Roberts of Nottingham, England, was one of the many risk-takers who threw their savings into cryptocurrencies when prices were going through the roof last winter. Now, eight months later, the $23,000 he invested in several digital tokens is worth about $4,000, and he is clearheaded about what happened. ""I got too caught up in the fear of missing out and trying to make a quick buck,"" he said last week. ""The losses have pretty much left me financially ruined."" Mr. Roberts, 28, has a lot of company. After the latest round of big price drops, many cryptocurrencies have given back all of the enormous gains they experienced last winter. The value of all outstanding digital tokens has fallen by about $600 billion, or 75 percent, since the peak in January, according to data from the website coinmarketcap.com.  The virtual currency markets have been through booms and busts before -- and recovered to boom again. But this bust could have a more lasting impact on the technology's adoption because of the sheer number of ordinary people who invested in digital tokens over the last year, and who are likely to associate cryptocurrencies with financial ruin for a very long time. ""What the average Joe hears is how friends lost fortunes,"" said Alex Kruger, a former banker who has been trading in the cryptocurrency markets for some time. ""Irrational exuberance leads to financial overhang and slows progress."" It is hard to know how many cryptocurrency investors are now in the red, with holdings worth less than the money they put in. Many who have lost money in recent months had gotten into the markets before the big run-up last year, and their holdings are still worth more than their initial investments. But by many metrics, more people put money into virtual currencies last fall and winter than in all of the preceding nine or so years. Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency brokerage in the United States, doubled its number of customers between October and March. The start-up Square began allowing the users of its mobile app, Square Cash, to buy Bitcoin last November. Almost all of the new customers on Coinbase and Square would be in the red if they bought cryptocurrencies at almost any point over the last nine months and held on to them. The damage is likely to be particularly bad in places like South Korea and Japan, where there was minimal cryptocurrency activity before last year, and where ordinary investors with little expertise jumped in with abandon. In South Korea, the biggest exchanges opened storefronts to make investment easier for people who didn't feel comfortable doing it online. The offices of one big exchange, Coinone, had just one customer walk in during a two-hour period in the middle of the day last week. An employee, Yu Ji-Hoon, said, ""The prices of the digital tokens have fallen so much that people seem to feel upset."" Kim Hyon-jeong, a 45-year-old teacher and mother of one who lives on the outskirts of Seoul, said she put about 100 million won, or $90,000, into cryptocurrencies last fall. She drew on savings, an insurance policy and a $25,000 loan. Her investments are now down about 90 percent. ""I thought that cryptocurrencies would be the one and only breakthrough for ordinary hardworking people like us,"" she said. ""I thought my family and I could escape hardship and live more comfortably, but it turned out to be the other way around."" In the United States, Charles Herman, a 29-year-old small-business owner in Charleston, S.C., became obsessed with virtual currencies in September. He said he now felt that he had wasted 10 months of his life trying to play the markets. While he is essentially back to the $4,000 he put in, he has soured on the revolutionary promises that virtual currency fanatics made for the technology last year and has resumed investing his money in real estate. ""I guess I thought we were 'sticking it to the man' when I got on board,"" Mr. Herman said. ""But I think 'the man' had already caught on, and had an exit strategy."" Much of the anger that investors feel is toward the smaller virtual currencies, or alt coins, that entrepreneurs sold in so-called initial coin offerings. These coins were supposed to serve as payment mechanisms for new software the entrepreneurs were building. But almost none of these companies have delivered the software they promised, leaving the tokens useless, except as speculative assets. Several coins have been exposed as outright scams. ""I think I'd like to see most alts go to zero before I feel like the whole space isn't overpriced,"" Mr. Herman said. Bitcoin has generally held on better with investors. It is down about 70 percent from all-time highs, rather than the 90-percent losses that lesser-known digital tokens have suffered. But it, too, has struggled to win much use beyond speculative investments. ""We also saw that Bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption and day-to-day use,"" Mr. Herman said. Despite this pessimism, the social networks where cryptocurrency fanatics gather to trade information are full of people talking about their intention to hold on to their coins, in the hope that they will recover once the technology has time to catch up with the hype. Tony Yoo, 26, a financial analyst in Los Angeles, invested more than $100,000 of his savings last fall. At their lowest point, his holdings dropped almost 70 percent in value. But Mr. Yoo is still a big believer in the idea that these tokens can provide a new way to transact online, without the big corporate middlemen we rely on today. Many of the groups that raised money last year are still working on the products they promised, with lots of serious engineers drawn to the projects. ""There's just so much more behind this new wave of technology and innovation that I'm sure will take over our society in due time,"" Mr. Yoo said. With prices down so much, he said he was actually looking to put more money into the markets. That thinking has been encouraged by the people who invested in Bitcoin in 2013, when it first topped $1,000. That bull market was followed by a crash in which the price of Bitcoin dropped more than 80 percent. But after a long fallow period, the price recovered. Even with recent losses, the value of one Bitcoin was hovering around $6,300 on Monday -- up more than 500 percent from the peak of 2013. ""Five years ago, I was broke, unemployed, and ashamed to use my real name,"" Ryan Selkis, a popular virtual currency personality, wrote on Twitter last week. ""For the new fanatics, stick around for your own 14 month, 85% downdraft and you'll not regret it."" Twitter is also filled with complaints, like the one from a user named @Notsofrugaljoey, who wrote: ""It's really hard to stomach losing all my hard earned money. Just broke down and cried."" On Reddit, a user in the United Arab Emirates posted a picture of the $100,000 loan that he had taken out in December to buy cryptocurrencies -- and that he will now be paying back out of his salary for the next three years. Mr. Roberts, the British investor who has seen most of his $23,000 vanish, is holding on to his coins in case they turn around. But for now he has stopped trading and is looking for another job. ""I'm living off the little savings I have left still in my bank account,"" Mr. Roberts said. ""I've made a mistake, and now I'm going to have to unfortunately pay the cost for the next few years.""

Fine-Tuning Hublot's 'Art of Fusion',"NYON, Switzerland -- The centuries-old traditions that define Swiss watchmaking are a world apart from blockchain, the technological revolution that promises to change our lives forever, even if not everyone understands what the term actually means. Minute mechanical movements assembled by hand and a global, yet ephemeral, web of traceable data are opposites in terms of scale, albeit equally complex. And yet Hublot married these unlikely partners earlier this month with the introduction of its Big Bang Meca-10 P2P, a $25,000 watch exclusively available for purchase with Bitcoin, the digital currency powered by blockchain. This union of watchmaking tradition and 21st-century innovation is an apt one for the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned brand. ""The Art of Fusion"" has been its motto since Jean-Claude Biver took its helm in 2004. Ricardo Guadalupe, who followed Mr. Biver to become chief executive in 2012 and who has worked at the company since 2004, was in the room when Mr. Biver, laying out his vision for the brand, coined the phrase. Mr. Guadalupe said that Mr. Biver recognized an opportunity: The house could respect tradition but, at the same time, distinguish itself from more traditional brands by integrating high-tech materials like ceramic, carbon fiber and its proprietary Magic Gold (a fusion of liquid gold and ceramic) into its watches.  ""That was the genius idea,"" Mr. Guadalupe said during a recent interview at Hublot's appropriately high-tech headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. ""Nobody had done this before."" It was a vision that has paid off. A little more than six months after that initial inspiration, Hublot had developed the first Big Bang for the 2005 Baselworld watch fair -- and the watch remains its pillar timepiece today. That initial model took the form of a bold 44-millimeter watch with an innovative multilayered case construction that also stayed true to the brand's earlier combination of gold and rubber. In the first year of Big Bang production, Hublot almost doubled its sales, going from 20 million Swiss francs to 35 million Swiss francs, or what today would be $19.9 million to $34.8 million. ""The year after, we did 80 million; the year after that, 150 million,"" said Mr. Guadalupe, 53. ""We doubled every year at the beginning."" LVMH acquired Hublot in 2008. In a later email, Mr. Guadalupe said that this year the company's sales would exceed 600 million Swiss francs. As well as innovation on the product side, Hublot has driven its considerable growth through marketing might, building a brand profile with partnerships and special editions for worlds as diverse as soccer, music, art and motorsport. ""Event marketing is our strategy,"" Mr. Guadalupe said. ""We make partnerships and we activate them through events."" There also is an in-house studio producing round-the-clock digital content for multiple platforms (Hublot boasts 3.4 million Instagram followers and almost 4.7 million on Facebook). Hublot constantly tries to engage its young customers, Mr. Guadalupe said, the 25- to 45-year-olds who now account for 70 percent of its sales. ""For them, images and video speak more than any text,"" he added. ""Our job is to make them dream."" So whether it is capturing the appeal of contemporary art with a Big Bang codesigned by the graffiti artist Shepard Fairey or the tattoo artist Maxime Buchi or tapping the technological zeitgeist around Bitcoin, Hublot uses the same kind of strategy that Supreme or Gucci do in fashion: marketing around the desirability of a luxury product that few ultimately will be able to acquire. For example, the brand said that many (although it wouldn't confirm exactly how many) of the 210-piece limited edition Big Bang Meca-10 P2P sold out in presales even before details were released Nov. 6 in Hong Kong. As for marketing, what better platform could there be than the world's most popular sporting tournament? This year, for the third consecutive time, Hublot was the official timekeeper to the World Cup. For the occasion it debuted its first smartwatch, the snappily named Big Bang Referee 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, which was worn by all referees and 12 team managers, including Didier Deschamps of the winning French team. (Mr. Guadalupe wore it during his interview, too.) Although its $5,200 price is considerably more than that of many other smartwatches, including the $1,400 entry-priced model offered by TAG Heuer, the 2,018-piece limited edition sold out in two months. Mr. Guadalupe declined to share the cost of the tournament timekeeping role but he said the return on investment, as far as brand awareness was concerned, was worth every penny. He estimated that Hublot-branded boards were on TV screens for a total of 20 minutes during the tournament, which FIFA estimated to have attracted 3.4 billion viewers during the 2014 event in Brazil. In traditional advertising, he said, that kind of reach ""would cost you hundreds of millions of dollars."" (The executive is a dedicated soccer fan himself, but he actually wouldn't be considered a core Hublot customer: Only 13 percent of its sales are made to clients older than 50.) Mr. Guadalupe was born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, to Spanish parents. Unlike many Swiss children, it wasn't clear that his future lay in watchmaking -- but he was working at Bulgari when he met Mr. Biver, then chief executive of Blancpain, at the 1994 Basel fair and went to work there afterward. Mr. Biver had sold Blancpain to Swatch Group in 1992 but had continued in its management at the same time as joining Nicolas Hayek's Swatch Group management team. ""He had bought it for nothing and sold it for 50 million,"" Mr. Guadalupe said. ""He was already a kind of star."" (Mr. Biver, who stepped down as head of LVMH's Watch Division in September, has been credited with enhancing the group's houses, sometimes by taking temporary control himself -- and is well-known as an industry showman, famous for sharing wheels of his own farm-made Gouda at events.) Mr. Guadalupe, who is more reserved than his former colleague but demonstrates a strong drive and a ready wit, said their partnership endured for almost 25 years because their skills were complimentary. ""Mr. Biver is a genius in ideas and vision about a brand,"" he said. ""I'm a good person to interpret his vision and make the ideas happen."" ""Sometimes, I also have my own ideas,"" he added with a wry smile. Working in product development at Blancpain, Mr. Guadalupe said, gave him a complete eduction in watchmaking that has served his career well. ""My strength is I'm a generalist, like a doctor,"" he said. ""I know everything in every department, but I'm not a specialist in any one thing. That's why I'm good at what I do."" The approach has been valuable as chief executive of a brand that now boasts 90 stand-alone boutiques around the world and has plans to have 150 at the end of the next five years. Mr. Guadalupe said that he did not believe the time was right for Hublot to have a full e-commerce site, but that he hoped its new digital boutique service would appeal to people used to buying items with a few taps on their phones. When it comes to brick-and-mortar stores, the soccer fan was in his element in September, when he was joined by four members of the Hublot-sponsored Chelsea soccer team during London Fashion Week to open the brand's first independently operated boutique in that city. While he said that being a chief executive in the digital era means he is never entirely away from the business, he had to admit one thing: ""It's a good life.""

The Hope and Betrayal of Blockchain; Turning Points,"Turning Point: Interest in blockchain technology surges as it spawns a highly volatile virtual currency market. Blockchain is far more than just the technology underlying Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. It is a tool that promises to decentralize the structures governing all economic transactions and, in the process, redefine our concept of trust. This is the most revolutionary and innovative aspect of blockchain. But its promise could be undermined.  Trust -- the basis of social and commercial interactions -- has been guaranteed for centuries by institutionalized trust providers, such as hierarchically organized companies and other third-party authorities. These trust mechanisms have worked for offline business models, but they are becoming obsolete in our hyper-connected digital world. In the digital-platform economy, trust is best fostered by those who control the platforms. These are tech giants, like Uber and Airbnb, which are replacing the institutionalized trust providers and becoming the keepers of our digital identity and our trustworthiness. They control the mechanisms that build trust upon transaction-based feedback, establishing community-based reputations through the star-score rating system. In the past few years, however, some open platforms, such as Twitter, have become increasingly restrictive. Things have turned sour, as developers and early users feel betrayed. They had been promised open platforms but that dream was snatched away. Moreover, incidents involving several tech giants, such as Facebook, eBay, Uber and Experian, have shattered their credibility as reliable keepers of our data. Our fear of surveillance and data misuse has grown. Thanks to blockchain, people are now able and eager to take on the platform owners by engaging directly with one another via peer-to-peer, or P2P, distributed networks that run on a commonly agreed-upon set of rules. The resulting machine-driven trust allows users to avoid the fallout from centralized trust mechanisms, such as third-party control or unauthorized surveillance. In fact, the large centralized trust enforcers may soon give way to decentralized trust systems and P2P network-enforced reputation systems that blockchain makes possible. Under such systems, algorithms confirm the authenticity of each transaction and can record each party's identity, along with their trust and reputation rating, in the blockchain, which acts as a kind of ledger. Misbehavior is prevented because it is impossible to tamper with or falsify the ledger, and accountability is improved because all actions can be independently audited by any participant. The benefits of a decentralized system are clear: Users are able to build trust without involving a third party. Group cooperation is enhanced. Fraudulent transactions are minimized. In addition, users can build their personal reputation across multiple platforms, and they can not only control their vast transaction data but also build and manage their own digital identity -- bypassing the surveillance of the tech giants. It is Uber without Uber, Airbnb without Airbnb. This evolution is already happening. Payment and financial services providers like PayPal are being challenged by Ripple or Circle. Social media and networking services like Twitter and Facebook face competition from decentralized platforms such as Steemit or Akasha. Decentralized apps -- software making decisions and acting autonomously -- can be created and deployed on different blockchains like Ethereum or EOS. These are just a few examples. This beguiling transformation seems too good to be true, and distributed systems based on blockchain face a conundrum. In modern large-scale P2P markets, trust and growth are at odds: The more a network grows, the less trust users often place in it. But user growth is essential to the success of the P2P platform economy. This problem can be solved by making it harder to join the network (reducing user growth) or by centralizing control to a handful of trusted coders or nodes (reducing decentralization). Unfortunately, the blockchain community seems to favor increased centralization. Apart from business-to-business platforms, which generally run on top of private blockchains where governance is centralized by design, the fastest, most secure and most rapidly growing P2P platforms are based on public blockchain networks -- which are all centralized. A handful of people make and enforce the rules. For example, only a small group of ""superpower"" miners -- those who tally and authenticate transactions -- secure the majority of Bitcoin transactions, while a small core of developers make the vast majority of changes to Bitcoin's protocols. For Ethereum, the largest public blockchain stack, adopted by thousands of P2P platforms, the situation is even worse. The top five mining pools secure as much as 80 percent of the transactions in the ledger. The developers are concentrated as well: 20 percent of Ethereum's core code was written by the same coder. Machine-driven trust is about to jump from systems controlled by tech giants to systems controlled by a small group of anonymous tech gurus. If only a few members have the ability to edit the system's ledger and control the protocol, where are the open, transparent, free-to-use and universally accessible blockchains that so many hoped would bypass third-party control and surveillance? Ultimately, this new frontier of managing trust in the digital world presents a rather stark choice: Either we bargain away our privacy to centralized but accountable trust providers or we keep direct ""control"" of our data via a trust machine run by a limited group of anonymous people who could go rogue. These governance problems undermine the credibility of blockchain as a trust machine for the new P2P economy. It seems that synthetic trust among peers is not supported by a solid set of principles. This lack of trust inevitably atomizes the community and fragments group solidarity, as evidenced by the many chains that have forked off from the original protocols of Bitcoin and Ethereum. For the time being, there is warfare to control those blockchain systems, and not a new common good that the technology still has the potential to deliver.

Who's Living in a 'Bubble'?; First Words,"There's a large spot reserved in the popular imagination for the Platonic ideal of an out-of-control market, a stunning collective enthusiasm that was bound to end in ruin: the tulip mania of the Netherlands, which ended in 1637. Tulips, a newly fashionable luxury item, temporarily became more valuable than houses -- until, obviously, the inevitable market correction, which ruined fortunes and tore a nation apart. Except this is a myth: The historian Anne Goldgar, in her 2007 book on the topic, wrote that while tulip prices certainly got a bit silly in the 1630s, she could find no evidence of anyone going bankrupt over them. The tulip was simply a luxury commodity that underwent a brief upward swing in value. The more entertaining version was brought to us by the anti-tulip propaganda of the age: pamphlets spreading exaggerated tales about these wilting, decadent symbols of wealth and the ruin they brought with them.  And yet the story of the tulips is still lodged in the modern mind as the perfect case study of a ""bubble"" -- more so, even, than the South Sea Bubble, one of several speculative crazes of the early 18th century, in which British investors were thrown into panic by the rise and fall of a preposterously overvalued trading company. To this day, people use tulips to express their incredulity over inflated values. Last December, the investor Dennis Gartman appeared on CNBC and called the rising value of Bitcoin a ""classic bubble"" that, compared with tulip mania, ""has gone even beyond that absurdity."" At a recent conference, the Italian economist Massimo Amato said the cryptocurrency was ""like a virtual tulip."" The persistence of such comparisons probably has something to do with how effectively tulip mania works as a fable, with a flattering moral at its core: If the people around you seem to be behaving irrationally, perhaps you're correct, and everyone else is deluded. Others are inside the ""bubble,"" incapable of spotting the distortions that are obvious to you. Of course houses are more valuable than flowers. Gartman and Amato, for instance, might have taken some grim satisfaction from what happened to Bitcoin in recent weeks: As of late November, it was trading at just over $3,700, down from a peak that neared $20,000, and the N.Y.U. economist Nouriel Roubini was tweeting about feeling ""vindicated"" that ""this cryptobubble went bust for good."" The trouble is that financial bubbles turn out to be far harder to recognize than you might think. Economists have spent decades debating precisely what they are, and how an observer might spot one in the wild, without arriving at a clear consensus. The Nobel Prize-winning Robert J. Shiller, in his 2000 book ""Irrational Exuberance,"" considers them simple enough, but the equally Nobel Prize-winning Eugene Fama is skeptical of the very concept of a bubble, partly because he believes that it's impossible to predict, mathematically speaking, whether you're in one. Even after what looks like a catastrophic crash, value can rebound -- as has happened in the past, many of the times Bitcoin has been declared doomed. The temptation to spot bubbles is widespread; the ability to actually identify them, less so. You could potentially blame a completely different kind of ""bubble"" for the once-soaring value of Bitcoin: the ideological enclave of cryptocurrency evangelists. In Forbes, Jason Bloomberg wrote that ""most of the noise around both blockchain and crypto is little more than the community talking to itself -- a massive 'echo chamber.' "" We like to imagine ourselves as cannily seeing through such echo chambers -- the self-reinforcing intellectual snow globes of people who get all their information from one another, who imagine that all the world works like their particular corner of it. But we seem to have less faith in everyone else's ability to do the same. Witness recent accusations that liberals live in a ""coastal bubble,"" full of coddled elites who understand more about avocados than about the crises of Rust Belt towns. Or the counteraccusation: that rural Americans have alarmingly little real exposure to people or lifestyles even slightly different from their own. In a September article at Washington Monthly, Nancy LeTourneau warned of an ""information bubble"" that was, according to one poll, leading 57 percent of strong Trump supporters to doubt that Democrats had a chance of capturing the House in midterm elections -- calling back to the libertarian writer Julian Sanchez's blogged 2010 warning that the conservative movement was ""moving toward epistemic closure,"" though not the liberal activist Eli Pariser's 2011 book arguing that online ""filter bubbles"" were presenting us all with information that flattered our existing biases. If you're trying to sort out why your ideological opponents seem, to you, so obviously foolish, here is one explanation that presents itself constantly. They are stuck in a ""bubble,"" unable to recognize any new information that doesn't match their convictions -- about life, about America, about politics, about the value of notional currencies, about the relative values of tulips and houses, about anything. But this, too, may be less clear-cut than it feels. Pariser's notion of a ""filter bubble"" suggested that we were being divided by flaws in the infrastructure of the internet -- things like personalization algorithms, which offer us precisely the information we're already inclined to want -- meaning we might solve the problem with better engineering. More recent research, though, has suggested that this may not be where the problem lies; the statistician Seth Flaxman, writing with other researchers in Public Opinion Quarterly, has found that the influence of search algorithms on individual browsing bias may not be as strong as it seemed. And while it's often taken as a given that social media is politically polarizing, there's evidence to suggest that the demographic groups that have polarized recently are the ones least likely to use social media. It's obvious that Americans live in social bubbles -- living and talking in circles divided by economics, race, ideology, geography, taste and so on. The problem arises as soon as you try to differentiate those that constitute real ""bubbles"" -- which is to say, self-reinforcing spheres of blindness or irrationality -- from those that might just as easily be called ""cultures"" or ""communities,"" groups of people who share experiences and convictions. Such groupings will certainly have drawbacks; our shared preconceptions often limit us. But to use the word ""bubble"" as a stand-alone pejorative is to focus on the ignorance inherent in a given worldview, rather than the insights; it's to examine ideological opponents and conclude that the only reason they could possibly believe what they do is because they haven't examined alternatives. It's nice to imagine that we can broaden someone's understanding of the world by illuminating their blind spots. The problem is that our helpful corrections are likely to be totally wrong. A well-meaning diagnosis of conservative bubbles like LeTourneau's -- ""when everyone you know is a Republican,"" she writes, ""you can't imagine anyone who isn't"" -- might run up against complicated research results: say, one that indicates conservatives are actually better at modeling liberal beliefs than the other way around. The difficulty of getting it right might explain the overwhelming vindication people clearly feel when someone else's ideological bubble really has been pricked. Less than two days after President Trump's electoral victory, The New York Post published a column by Michael Goodwin that was positively triumphant about it: ""The cluelessness in media and political circles about the Trump voter surge,"" he wrote, ""confirms that the ruling class is cosseted deeply in its bubbles and isolated from the concerns of other Americans."" So long as we're not among a bubble's inhabitants, its popping flatters our own delusion: that we're among the few right-thinking people who accurately measure value, who accurately perceive reality, who see far more clearly than the sheeplike, tulip-loving half-wits around us. What might be more helpful, when talk of a ""bubble"" crops up, is to think of yourself, rather than others -- to be vigilant about the possibility that the most meaningful bubbles are the ones you're not aware of, rather than the ones you're eager to spot. They are, after all, incredibly pleasant and convincing when you're on the inside. The value they create is not an illusion: There is much to be gained from being in mental harmony with those around you, let alone owning something people are paying absurd prices for. It's dispiriting, perhaps, to think our various blinkers might not be easy to identify, but knowing this offers a sort of peace -- the peace of spending less time wondering why everyone else is so hopelessly blinkered. If you're skeptical of your own ability to see everything clearly, you'll be less surprised when the actions of others refuse to blow up in their faces -- or, perhaps, when you hear your own world emit an unexpected pop.

America Could Lead the Transition to a Digital Currency Reserve; Another View,"After spending decades as the dominant global reserve currency, the dollar's position is being challenged. The greenback's share of global central-bank reserves has declined in nine of the past 10 quarters, the International Monetary Fund reported in September. The slide is hardly new: It began a decade ago when European leaders attempted to replace the dollar with a euro-based ""basket"" of currencies as the common global reserve. But the United States should not fight against the forces of globalization that challenge the dollar's reserve-currency status. Instead, it must seize the opportunity to incubate technologies that will enable future digital currencies, which could go on to power a transnational currency -- perhaps the best next option for a future global reserve.  Committing to this course would provide a check on attempts to supplant the dollar's role in the global financial system with other sovereign currencies. It would also put the United States at the heart of a more open and equitable financial system. There are lessons in America's technological history that should inform future policy relating to digital currencies. More than three decades ago the United States government supported the development of the internet. Doing so unleashed huge economic impact on America that can still be seen today in the successes of the nation's biggest technology companies. The digital financial revolution that the world is on the cusp of has the potential to be just as significant for job creation and economic development. Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, could prove to be as important to commerce as email and text messaging were to communications. New financial systems built on it could help connect people around the world who lack access to traditional banking services. And these innovations could be leveraged by developers in much the same way as entrepreneurs built web services on the internet -- from eBay to Facebook -- with the same enormous impact on the American economy. That is, if we see the opportunity that is before us. Countries around the world are racing to lead the next revolution in financial technology. While it is clear that the United States and companies like Coinbase were early entrants in this global movement, it is also true that many nations and individuals are jockeying for leadership. There are currently more than 1,400 digital currencies and tokens available, serving a variety of uses. Central banks from China to Sweden to Uruguay are considering issuing their own. America must maintain its leadership role by leading the way on research and development of cryptocurrency technologies -- just as it did in the early days of the internet -- rather than stifling it. And if it does, it could ultimately build dominant cryptocurrency technologies that become the backbone of the 21st Century financial system. Doing so could yield all sorts of wonderful possibilities. In the 21st century when a national market undergoes a major fluctuation, America could enable an alternative currency. It could make it easier for American farmers to sell to foreign customers without the friction of foreign exchange. And its development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D., could ""airdrop"" cryptocurrencies to hard-hit regions of the world that lack access to banking infrastructure. That the dollar is under pressure as the world's reserve currency should only lend more urgency to the endeavor, as America should not come to rely on global cryptocurrency technologies that have been developed by other nations. The United States can retain its leadership role in the global financial system -- but only if it nurtures the development of the technologies that will underpin its future.

Rebooting The Internet Of Things,"Jonathan Zittrain (@zittrain) is a professor of international law and of computer science at Harvard, a co-founder of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society and the author of ''The Future of the Internet -- And How to Stop It.'' Last month the F.B.I. issued an urgent warning: Everyone with home internet routers should reboot them to shed them of malware from ''foreign cyberactors.'' Putting aside the strangeness that for once power-cycling a device could perform an effective exorcism upon it, the episode reveals more than just the potential for disruption of internet access for people using equipment they never expect to have to physically manage. It also underscores how unprepared we are to manage downstream-networked devices and appliances -- the ''internet of things'' -- that are vulnerable to attack.    A longstanding ethos of internet development lets anyone build and share new code and services, with consequences to be dealt with later. I call this the ''procrastination principle,'' and I don't regret supporting it. But it's hard to feel the same way about the internet of things.    Worries about security for these devices have become widespread, and they fall roughly into two categories.   First, compromised networked things can endanger their users. In 2015, Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles after researchers showed they could hack a Jeep and disable its brakes and transmission. Coffee makers and other appliances with heating elements could have safety features overridden, starting a fire. And an alert was issued on certain pacemakers last year after vulnerabilities were found that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and issue commands to the devices.   Second, hacking even a tiny subset of the 10 billion and counting networked things can produce threats larger than any one consumer. Individually these devices may be too small to care about; together they become too big to fail. Security systems in a city could be made to sound an alarm simultaneously. Light bulbs can be organized into bot armies, directed to harm any other internet-connected target. And worse than a single Jeep executing an unexpected sharp left turn is a whole fleet of them doing so.   Short of rejecting internet integration with appliances, dealing with this is not easy. As with home routers, we tend to keep appliances around for years, so vulnerabilities aren't phased out quickly.   In fact, many vendors might stop issuing firmware updates for physical objects even while they're still widely in use -- abandoning the public to problems lurking in embedded code. And otherwise-valuable ''over the air'' security updates could also be a gateway to a hack, especially for small vendors of cheap if useful objects like $5 drones.   The unusual problems of the internet of things call for unusual solutions.   The first confronts the life-cycle problem. Companies making a critical mass of internet-enabled products should be required to post a ''networked safety bond'' to be cashed in if they abandon maintenance for a product, or fold entirely. Insurers can price bonds according to companies' security practices. There's an example of such a system for coal mining, to provide for reclamation and cleanup should the mining company leave behind a wasteland.   For internet-connected appliances, ''reclamation'' can entail work by nonprofit foundations to maintain the code for abandoned products, creating an ''island of misfit toys,'' in the parlance of the famed 1964 Rankin/Bass stop-motion Christmas special. Proceeds from redeemed bonds would go to these foundations to maintain the products, like the way the Mozilla Foundation has transformed the 1998 Netscape browser long after its originators left the scene.   A second intervention would require networked products modeled after analog counterparts to work even without connectivity. A smart coffee maker shouldn't be so clever that it can't make coffee without internet access. Switchover to non-connectivity mode will not merely help prevent things from becoming useless when the internet goes down, or if the original vendor disappears or jacks up service prices. It can also provide a soft landing for appliances that reach the end of their supported life cycles while still beloved by owners.   Finally, networked devices made by different vendors need to be able to communicate with one another -- the way that, say, Mac and PC users seamlessly exchange email. That prevents a household from becoming locked into a single vendor for all its appliances. It also prevents us from flocking to one or two vendors whose compromise could cause widespread consequences.   While procrastination around security has been vital to the expansion of the internet, ''later'' doesn't mean ''never.'' We can create incentives to design networked devices for both interoperability and safety, and to plan for remediation when some things inevitably go wrong. We can enjoy the best rather than worst of both worlds.   Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.     "
A Russian Threat on Two Fronts Meets a U.S. Strategic Void,"WASHINGTON -- Just hours after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia boasted last week about producing ''invincible'' new nuclear arms designed to evade American missile defenses, President Trump's nominee to command the nation's military cyberunits was being grilled at a Senate confirmation hearing about another vexing Russian threat. Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the nominee to run the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, acknowledged that plans were in place to strike back at Moscow for its election hacking. Those actions would require Mr. Trump's approval.    But General Nakasone said the Russians, as well as America's other adversaries in cyberspace, seem unimpressed.    ''I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,'' he said. ''They don't fear us.''   The Russian muscle-flexing and the American hand-wringing captured a strategic vacuum that now envelops Washington as Mr. Putin pursues what he views as a complementary new-generation nuclear arsenal, as well as cyberweapons.   By comparison, the United States is still uncertain how to make use of its cyberweapons after spending billions of dollars to build an arsenal. It is concerned that the Russians -- along with the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans -- could easily retaliate against any attack, striking American banks, utilities, stock markets and communications networks.   And in the nuclear sphere, the Trump administration has yet to offer a strategy to contain or deter Russia beyond simply matching the weapons buildup. Mr. Trump himself has largely remained silent about his vision to contain Russian power, and has not expressed hope of luring Moscow into new rounds of negotiations to prevent a recurrent arms race.   The threat that Russia poses on both fronts has helped push the United States to declare a fundamental shift on national security: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asserted in January that ''great power competition,'' not terrorism, is now the primary American focus.   Washington's response -- at least in the nuclear realm -- also harks back to the Cold War era: a cycle of move and countermove. This time, however, it involves not just building larger stockpiles, but also developing new types of weapons of greater sophistication, matched with more advanced missile defenses.   ''Putin has become the best friend of the U.S. nuclear arms industry,'' said nonproliferation expert Gary Samore. He negotiated with the Russians during the Clinton administration, when optimism ran high that the era of nuclear competition was over, and again during the Obama administration, after Mr. Putin had begun Moscow's current nuclear modernization.   The Pentagon believes that many of the new plans that Mr. Putin announced last week to bolster his arsenal -- including undersea nuclear torpedoes, nuclear cruise missiles and other new weapons -- are years away from deployment. He has called his new missiles ''invincible,'' as some can evade missile defenses, and started a contest to name them.   Mr. Putin has blamed the United States' failure to embrace past arms control treaties as the reason for his buildup. But he has particularly complained about American nuclear defenses, which he said were aimed as much at Russia as they were at North Korea. American officials have said that is a wild misstatement of the technology's reach.   In his State of the Union speech in January, Mr. Trump demanded that Congress ''modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal.'' That was followed in February by the administration's Nuclear Posture Review, which was more specific. It called for new, low-yield nuclear weapons that it justified on the basis of recent Russian advances. It also described in detail a once top-secret Russian autonomous nuclear torpedo that is designed to cross the Pacific.   Additionally, the nuclear review abandoned earlier promises by the Obama administration that nuclear weapons would be a diminishing part of American security and defense. ''Past assumptions that our capability to produce nuclear weapons would not be necessary and that we could permit the required infrastructure to age into obsolescence have proven to be mistaken,'' the document said.   Drafts of a new missile defense strategy, which may be published later this month, include suggestions that the program may now turn to developing missile defenses against Russia and China, not just countering states like North Korea with smaller arsenals.   ''We must no longer think in terms of building just 'limited' missile defense capabilities,'' concluded a report that was issued last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. ''The United States should begin the journey to develop a next-generation missile defense.''   It called for pursuing a ''space-based kill layer'' that would try to shoot down swarms of enemy warheads and missiles -- a step that would go beyond the Reagan administration's ''Star Wars'' research on space arms and no doubt prompt new rounds of reaction from Mr. Putin and the Russian military.   Particularly striking is the absence of much interest in Washington or Moscow for arms control talks.   From President John F. Kennedy's time in office through President Barack Obama's, new treaties were negotiated that first limited atmospheric testing, then the numbers of weapons that could be deployed. The result was an 85 percent decline in the number of nuclear weapons in the world.   But the most recent arms reduction treaty, called New Start, expires in early 2021. Mr. Trump has not expressed interest in renewing it. And there is evidence that even before its scheduled sunset, expensive new cycles of technological action and reaction are beginning to take shape.   Over the past few months, most talk of restraint has been cast to the wind as Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump take steps to rebuild their arsenals, according to arms control advocates. Doing so portends a new generation of nuclear weapons, as such moves and countermoves create a rationale for building more.   Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass., said Mr. Putin's announcement last week ''further ratchets up what is clearly a new arms race, making the world a more dangerous place.''   But what worries veterans of that Cold War is less the new technology than the old rhetoric.   ''None of this changes the fundamental picture of what the U.S. and Russia do to each other,'' Matthew Bunn, a Harvard professor who is one of the directors of the Managing the Atom project, told a group of journalists at the Nieman Foundation in Cambridge on Friday.   He said what is changing ''is the degree of tension'' that revives the dangers of miscalculations that could lead to military action -- the great fear at the height of the Cold War during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.   The cyberchallenge is the newest one, and thus is not captive to the strategies of past generations. But in public statements in recent weeks, Mr. Trump's top intelligence officials have conceded that the president has yet to discuss strategies with them to prevent the Russians from interfering in the midterm elections this year. Mr. Trump has expressed severe doubts that the Russians meddled in 2016, contradicting the conclusions of his intelligence officials.   Two days before General Nakasone's hearing last week, the man he would replace at the N.S.A. and Cyber Command -- Adm. Michael S. Rogers -- offered striking testimony in what is likely to be his last public appearance on Capitol Hill before leaving office.   Four years ago, after he took command, Admiral Rogers said one of his goals was to assure that American adversaries would ''pay a price'' for their cyberactions against the United States that ''will far outweigh the benefit'' derived from hacking. He also frequently said that the retaliation might not necessarily be a counter-cyberstrike, but could involve economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation.   However, last week Admiral Rogers conceded that his own test had not been met.   Pressed about what pressure he had put on the Russians, he said: ''We're taking steps, but we're probably not doing enough.'' He also dismissed sanctions that Congress approved last year -- and that Mr. Trump has failed to impose -- as insufficient to change ''the calculus or the behavior'' of Mr. Putin.   At General Nakasone's confirmation hearing two days later, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said that ''the problem is not technical,'' but political, given the United States' impressive cyberarsenal.   ''We are not responding in any way that's adequate to the challenge we face,'' Mr. Sasse said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Froze Your Credit? How It Thaws Is Changing,"People who froze their credit files before September may notice some changes when the time comes to thaw the files. As of Sept. 21, a new law requires that the three major credit reporting bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- allow consumers to place or lift a security freeze on their credit files without charge. Freezing means lenders can't check your credit file unless you ''thaw'' the freeze, preventing criminals from opening credit cards or borrowing money in your name. Consumer advocates recommend a freeze at all three bureaus as a way to thwart identity thieves.    People who had already established security freezes, and now want to thaw them to apply for a loan or credit card, will see a difference. With the new law taking effect, two bureaus -- Equifax and TransUnion -- this month abandoned the use of personal identification numbers, or PINs, to manage freezes online. (PINs are still needed, though, if you want to lift a freeze by calling on the phone.)    Equifax, which suffered a major data breach last year, changed its approach on Sept. 19 in response to ''consumer feedback,'' said a spokeswoman, Nancy Bistritz-Balkan. (Consumers had complained after the breach that the PINs issued by Equifax were hard to keep track of and weren't generated in a secure way.) Now, instead of issuing PINs, Equifax has consumers establish a password-protected online account.   People who had placed a freeze at Equifax under the old system don't need to do anything to re-establish it, Ms. Bistritz-Balkan said. Their credit file remains on ice.   But if consumers want to suspend or lift the freeze at Equifax online, they must now create a ''myEquifax'' account by entering personal information including a Social Security number and a birth date. Their email address serves as their user name; they create their own password, using Equifax's criteria. And Equifax has added extra security steps, like sending a one-time code to your phone or email to activate the account. (The steps vary by consumer, Ms. Bistritz-Balkan said. People who don't have mobile phones may answer extra security questions.)   Once users are logged on, Ms. Bistritz-Balkan said, they may suspend or remove their freeze. The new process, she said, is intended to ''establish, verify and authenticate that the consumer's identity is connected to the consumer every time.''   TransUnion had already required consumers to have an account with a user name and a password, as well as a PIN. Now, users can log on to a computer or app using those credentials, to lift or suspend a freeze -- no PIN needed, according to its website. Bob Skwarek, a TransUnion spokesman, said in an email that consumers complete a ''stringent'' authentication process when they sign up for an account to freeze their credit.   ''Only users who can verify that they are who they say they are can create a user name and password to log in, create and manage a freeze,'' Mr. Skwarek said.   The third bureau, Experian, still requires a PIN to lift a freeze.   ''We've kept this in place as it provides a level of security that the consumer has control over,'' a spokesman, Greg Young, said in an email.   To lift a freeze, consumers enter personal details on Experian's website as well as their PIN. If consumers lose their PIN, Mr. Young said, they can complete an online process to get a new one.   Here are some questions and answers about security freezes:   How can I make sure my credit freeze password is secure?   Passwords tend to be more secure than PINs, said Lorrie Cranor, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. PINs are typically just a series of digits, while passwords include letters and symbols, enabling more combinations and making them harder to guess.   The addition of an extra step, like a one-time code texted to your phone, as Equifax is doing, provides extra security, Dr. Cranor said, adding, ''That's a good thing.''   But, she cautioned, no system is perfect. Many people reuse the same passwords or create passwords containing letters and numbers that are relatively easy to guess -- like birthdays or phone numbers. Dr. Cranor recommends using password-generating software to create truly random combinations, and then using a password manager to keep track of them. The Wirecutter, a New York Times affiliate, offers recommendations.   It's also fine to write down your passwords, she said, as long as you keep them in a secure location, like a locked file cabinet.   Does having a credit freeze mean I can't use my current credit cards?   No. The Federal Trade Commission says some consumers mistakenly think a freeze will prevent them from using their credit cards. A freeze prevents new accounts from being opened without your permission, but has no effect on cards already in your wallet.   Where can I complain if I have problems with a security freeze?   You can complain to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau either online at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint, or by calling 1-855-411-2372.   If you think you are a victim of identity theft, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.    "
Safely Shopping for Windows 10 Software,"Q. I was trying to install a new version of a program I've used for years and Windows 10 gave me a warning box about it not being a ''verified'' app. What exactly is a verified app, and should I be worried about installing this ''unverified'' program?  A. In an effort to keep unsuspecting people from inadvertently installing malicious software, Microsoft encourages users to get their Windows 10 software directly from its own online Windows App Store. While shareware sites and developers have traditionally offered software for sale or as free downloads on their own sites, some have bundled in spyware or malware with the goods. Programs purchased from the Windows App Store and downloaded directly from Microsoft have been approved and verified by the company as being safe, compatible and up to the company's guidelines for Windows software.    An up-to-date antivirus program can catch many kinds of rogue software, but if you do not want to worry as much (or have children who may download software indiscriminately) you can set Windows 10 to do more than warn about apps coming from other sources beyond the Windows App Store. You can block apps from anywhere but the Windows App Store -- or go the other way and allow apps from anywhere.   Go to the Start menu to the Settings icon; you can also press the Windows and I keys on the keyboard as a shortcut. In the Settings box, select Apps and then Apps & Features. In the Installing Apps section, use the drop-down menu to choose the sources the computer can use for software shopping.   Apple has a similar approach to third-party software security for its online storefronts, including those for desktop Mac programs, iTunes Store digital media purchases, iBooks, and iOS apps and games. Google has also stepped up screening of harmful apps in its Google Play store. As with all the online software stores (Apple's included), creative malware may find new ways to sneak in, even for a short time, so keep your guard up.

Keeping Up With the Meltdown and Spectre Bugs,"Q. Is it safe to install the Windows patch for these new Spectre and Meltdown bugs? Do they affect Linux? (And who names these security flaws, anyway?) A. Meltdown and Spectre, the two recently announced security flaws that can expose personal data to hackers, could potentially affect Linux systems, along with computers and devices running Windows, Mac and other operating-system software. These new bugs are actually in the computer's hardware -- specifically, in the central processing unit.     Check Microsoft's support site for the absolute latest news, but the company previously warned that its updates for Windows 7 and Windows 10 can conflict with certain antivirus programs; users should contact those software makers about updates. Early reports that the Windows patches were causing severe problems on computers with AMD processors prompted Microsoft to temporarily halt updates to many of those systems for a few days. The software fixes are expected to make the computer run more slowly, but Microsoft has noted that newer processors running Windows 10 should feel the least impact.   The Meltdown vulnerability exists in laptops, desktops and cloud-based computers running most types of Intel processors made since 1995. The Spectre flaw can affect those same systems as well, but also smartphones, tablets and other gadgets running on processors made by other companies, including AMD and ARM.   To find out details for your particular system, Graz University of Technology's ''Meltdown and Spectre'' site at https://meltdownattack.com has an extensive collection of links to information about patches from most major hardware and software makers, including several Linux companies. Intel also has a page on its site with links and information about updates.   As for the origin of the names assigned to these bugs, the ''Meltdown and Spectre'' site has an explanation. Meltdown gets is name because it ''basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the hardware.'' Spectre's moniker is ''based on the root cause, speculative execution,'' and as the researchers note, ''As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time.''

How a Stalker Can Be Hiding In Your Pocket,"KidGuard is a phone app that markets itself as a tool for keeping tabs on children. But it has also promoted its surveillance for other purposes and run blog posts with headlines like ''How to Read Deleted Texts on Your Lover's Phone.'' A similar app, mSpy, offered advice to a woman on secretly monitoring her husband. Still another, Spyzie, ran ads on Google alongside results for search terms like ''catch cheating girlfriend iPhone.''    As digital tools that gather cellphone data for tracking children, friends or lost phones have multiplied in recent years, so have the options for people who abuse the technology to track others without consent.   More than 200 apps and services offer would-be stalkers a variety of capabilities, from basic location tracking to harvesting texts and even secretly recording video, according to a new academic study. More than two dozen services were promoted as surveillance tools for spying on romantic partners, according to the researchers and reporting by The New York Times. Most of the spying services required access to victims' phones or knowledge of their passwords -- both common in domestic relationships.    Digital monitoring of a spouse or partner can constitute illegal stalking, wiretapping or hacking. But laws and law enforcement have struggled to keep up with technological changes, even though stalking is a top warning sign for attempted homicide in domestic violence cases.   ''We misunderstand and minimize this abuse,'' said Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. ''People think that if there's not an immediate physical proximity to the victim, there might not be as much danger.''   Statistics on electronic stalking are hard to find because victims may not know they are being watched, or they may not report it. Even if they believe they are being tracked, hidden software can make confirmation difficult.   But data breaches at two surveillance companies last year -- revealing accounts of more than 100,000 users, according to the technology site Motherboard -- gave some sense of the scale. The tracking app company mSpy told The New York Times that it sold subscriptions to more than 27,000 users in the United States in the first quarter of this year.   According to data published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of women and 11 percent of men in the United States at some point endure stalking or sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner that has significant effects. While comprehensive numbers aren't available on domestic abuse cases involving digital stalking in the United States, a small survey published in Australia in 2016 found that 17 percent of victims were tracked via GPS, including through such apps.   In a Florida case involving abusive surveillance, a man named Luis Toledo installed an app called SMS Tracker on his wife's phone in 2013 because he suspected she was having an affair. ''He said he was able to see text messages and photos his wife was sending and receiving from others,'' Sgt. A. J. Pagliari of the Volusia County Sheriff's Office recalled.   This January, Mr. Toledo was sentenced to three consecutive life terms after being convicted of killing his wife, Yessenia Suarez, and her two children. Sergeant Pagliari said Mr. Toledo told him he installed the app several days before her death. ''With the use of the app, Toledo was able to confirm his suspicion,'' the sergeant said.   Representatives for SMS Tracker, made by the Dallas-based Gizmoquip, did not respond to requests for comment about the app's role in the case. A recent review on the Google Play store for SMS Tracker tells potential users: ''I would recommend if you think your partner is cheating.''   An Opening for Abuse   There is no federal law against location tracking, but such monitoring can violate state laws on stalking. Spying on communications can break statutes on wiretapping or computer crime. And knowingly selling illegal wiretapping tools is a federal crime.   But it's not illegal to sell or use an app for tracking your children or your own phone. And it can be difficult to tell whether the person being surveilled has given consent, because abusers frequently coerce victims into using such apps.   In Everson, Wash., for example, Brooks Owen Laughlin is accused of beating his wife and using an app typically used for benign purposes, Find My iPhone, to control her movements.   ''If she would turn it off, he would instantly call her or text her and say, 'Why did you turn that off? What are you doing?' That was pretty much 24-7,'' Chief Daniel MacPhee of the Everson Police Department, said in an interview. Mr. Laughlin pleaded not guilty in April to charges of assault, harassment and stalking.   Such technical and legal ambiguity has created an environment in which tools are marketed for both legal and illegal uses, without apparent repercussion.   ''There are definitely app makers that are complicit, seeking out these customers and advertising this use,'' said Periwinkle Doerfler, a doctoral student at New York University and an author of the study on apps, which will be presented in the coming days. ''They're a little bit under the radar about it, but they're still doing it.''   The researchers, from N.Y.U., Cornell University and Cornell Tech, contacted customer support for nine companies with tracking services. The researchers claimed to be women who wanted to secretly track their husbands, and only one company, TeenSafe, refused to assist.   KidGuard, the app largely aimed at parents, also bought ads alongside Google results for searches like ''catch cheating spouse app.'' A spokesman for the business, based in Los Angeles, said in an email that the company worked with third-party marketers and customer service reps who had been ''testing new strategies.'' It deleted blog posts about tracking romantic partners and said it did not support that activity.   Spyzie, another app that ran such ads, did not respond to requests for comment.   On YouTube, dozens of videos provide tutorials on using several of the apps to catch cheating lovers. The videos frequently link back to the app makers' sites using a special code that ensures the promoter will get a cut of the sale -- a type of deal known as affiliate marketing.   Affiliate marketing also appeared on multiple websites that discussed using surveillance apps to track romantic partners. One site, spyblog.ml, had posts about spying on ''loved ones'' and linked to mSpy. The app company said that its terms of service prohibited illegal activity and that it would block the site from its affiliate program.   Reviews and online discussions about the apps suggest the market for spying on spouses has been important to the businesses. FlexiSPY, an app company, posted survey results on its site showing that 52 percent of potential customers were interested because they thought their partners might be cheating. Asked about the results, the company said the data was five years old and ''no longer relevant.''   Different Phones, Different Abilities   The proliferation of such tracking apps raises questions about the role of businesses like Google and Apple in policing their services.   The two companies, which run nearly all smartphones in the United States, have long taken different approaches to regulating apps.   Apple makes it difficult for iPhone users to download apps from outside the company's App Store, and has many restrictions on what apps in its store can do. After testing several programs available in the stores on both platforms, the researchers found that Apple's strict rules resulted in more limited surveillance capabilities on those apps than those running Google's software.   Many App Store apps offered location tracking for phones. But for more intrusive surveillance, spying companies had to work around Apple's restrictions by using the victim's name and password to get data. To combat misuse by predators, an Apple spokesman said, the company urges people to use a tool called two-factor authentication to help protect their accounts even if their passwords are stolen.   Google prides itself on being more open. Its smartphone software, Android, allows people to install apps from anywhere, and the most invasive ones were found outside the company's app store, Play.   The researchers found two apps in the Google Play store that allowed the app icon to be hidden from victims and the camera to run without notifications, as well as a handful of others that tracked users' locations without telling them, all apparent violations of Google's rules.   ''They're not enforcing their own policies,'' Ms. Doerfler, the N.Y.U. researcher, said. ''If someone reports it then they'll take it down, but it's not something they are checking within their operating system.''   In response to the researchers' findings, Google tightened several policies ''to further restrict the promotion and distribution'' of surveillance apps, a company spokesman said. The company provides funding to the N.Y.U. team that helped conduct the study.   Google removed many spying and tracking apps and blocked advertising on search results about spying on spouses and romantic partners. YouTube, owned by Google, took down some videos about spying services, although the company determined that others didn't violate its policies because the services could be used with consent.   Enforcing the Law   Many law enforcement agencies don't have the computer skills to quickly help survivors, or they don't devote forensic resources to domestic abuse and stalking cases, which in many states are misdemeanors.   One sheriff's department, in Dakota County, Minn., is trying to tackle the problem of abusive digital surveillance, and has used Justice Department grants to hire a forensic specialist for the task.   The sheriff, Tim Leslie, said that from 2015 to 2017, the department went to court in 198 cases involving technology and stalking or domestic abuse, on par with earlier years. Its conviction rate rose to 94 percent from 50 percent, with many more suspects pleading guilty instead of contesting the charges, he said.   In one case, the specialist analyzed a woman's phone and found it had a program on it called Mobile Spy, bought using her then-husband's email address. The specialist could see that it had been launched 122 times. The effect of the stalking was ''profound,'' the woman said.   Even though it had been more than a year since the app was last used, the man was charged with misdemeanor stalking and pleaded guilty in 2015.   ''We go after the misdemeanor stuff pretty hard, in the theory that if you stop that, it doesn't escalate,'' Sheriff Leslie said.   Federal cases involving such spying are rare. The Justice Department in 2014 charged the maker of a spying program called StealthGenie under a wiretap law that prohibits advertising and selling a device for ''surreptitious interception.'' The developer paid a $500,000 fine, shut down StealthGenie and was sentenced to time served.   Victims' advocates said they noticed after the case that makers of surveillance tools changed their tactics, sometimes moving computer servers overseas or scrubbing explicit language about spousal spying from their websites. ''As soon as these companies caught wind that they shouldn't be doing it, they just changed their marketing,'' Ms. Olsen said.   One app maker told The Times that he hired a legal team after the StealthGenie case to help him avoid running afoul of the law. ''There were a few modifications we had to make,'' said Patrick Hinchy, the founder of New York-based ILF Mobile Apps, which makes Highster Mobile and other services. Several apps, he said, removed call recording and delayed the the availability of the data by 10 to 15 minutes. Mr. Hinchy said the company only provided assistance to customers that it believed was legal.   When a researcher recently contacted the company and asked, ''If I use this app to track my husband, will he know that I am tracking him?'' the representative responded: ''Our software is undetectable from the home screen.''

Juggling Phones to Dodge Spyware in Mexico,"Follow Azam Ahmed on Twitter: @azamsahmed. How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Azam Ahmed, the Mexico bureau chief, who is based in Mexico City, discussed the tech he's using. What are the most important tech tools that you've found for doing your job?     My phone and the various messaging apps that I use are the only truly indispensable technology I have.    WhatsApp is probably the most widely used messaging service in Mexico. It's pretty much the only way to get busy people to respond to you. Some sources use Telegram and Signal, so I do as well, like other reporters covering sensitive issues they don't want monitored.   My colleagues will laugh about this, but I also use a GPS watch when I'm going off the grid, to have my coordinates wherever I am. When I was previously in Kabul, Afghanistan, a few of the other reporters teased me for using it, but I've found it reassuring to always have my whereabouts available when I'm in remote areas without any service -- especially if it's a violent area or one where kidnapping is a possibility.   On those same trips, I take a satellite phone and a Bgan, which is essentially a small transmitter that gets you internet when you're in the middle of nowhere. And I have come to love the extra-long charging cable -- I'm talking 10 to 15 feet. You find yourself in a crappy hotel with one outlet on the other end of the room, and you'll know why.   All of the above, however, are in an ideal world. Twice in the last two years I've been sent on breaking stories from vacation, without any of my tech tools. Once was in Haiti in 2016, after a devastating storm. And again last year, after a spate of hurricanes that passed through the Caribbean.   You've written about how journalists in Mexico have been targeted with spyware and other tech. How, from what you've found, does the government in Mexico use tech?   The government has a long history of heavy-handed surveillance, and its use of technology is just the latest iteration of that. There's no doubt it is using technology for surveillance, nor is there any doubt that it is paying exorbitant sums for it, as seen by various contracts made public and emails related to the government's purchases of Hacking Team software that leaked a few years back.   How the government uses the technology, however, appears far less sophisticated. I often wonder if it even has the manpower and resources to review all the material it gathers from surveillance operations. It has this incredibly sophisticated spyware, and yet most signs indicate reckless use without real material gain. Sometimes it can feel as if the government bought a Lamborghini to race around a go-kart track.   What do you do, in broad strokes, to keep your communications secure?    The least tech-forward thing you can imagine: I meet face to face with people.   I tend to avoid messaging or talking about specific work targets on my main Mexican phone. I'm pretty sure I was sent Pegasus, the spyware purchased by the Mexican government, and though I've wiped that phone and replaced it, I'm cautious. I use the typical encrypted apps for communications and maintain several phones, which I use for different purposes. It's annoying lugging all of them around, and I get funny looks at the airport when I toss three phones into the scanner basket. It's also a pain keeping them all charged.   How has the tech landscape changed in Mexico over the years? Is there a lot of tech start-up activity?   Lots has been written about the booming tech scene in Mexico, in particular in the city of Guadalajara, which is the latest place to be given some kind of Silicon Valley moniker. There are a bunch of start-ups there, taking advantage of the tens of thousands of engineering graduates coming out of prestigious programs in Mexico every year.   Is it a game-changer? I don't know, to be honest. The entrepreneurs and officials here were trying to drum up support for recruiting foreign-born Silicon Valley engineers, to take advantage of President Trump's immigration policies. Not sure that went anywhere past the headlines, though.   What are the most popular kinds of websites or apps or gadgets in Mexico?   Waze is especially popular in Mexico. In Mexico City, where I live, traffic is a force of nature. So if you don't find the best way to get through it, you're going to spend some nauseating hours stuck in the car. For me, and for a ton of others living here, Waze is essential unless you're an old-school cabby who happens to know the city.   Outside work, what gadget or software do you currently find yourself using a lot and why?   I live a relatively low-tech existence. I've never been an early adopter of the latest tech ''it'' item; my phones are really the only technology I can't function without.   I did get a pair of Bose SoundSport wireless earbuds that are pretty awesome. The case doubles as a charging station, and they never fall out while I'm running. It's also worth mentioning that they don't look as ridiculous as the Apple wireless ones.   As for apps: PayPal and banking apps to send and receive money and manage my finances, which can be a pain when living abroad.   Find Friends is an app I got used to using in Kabul to track colleagues as they were on trips into dangerous areas. It gives you the GPS coordinates of anyone in your group who is using the app, to monitor his or her whereabouts. I still use that on occasion.   Something has to be incredibly useful and life-altering for me to fold it into my daily life, and I haven't found an app yet that I use every single day no matter where I am or what I'm doing. One reason is I don't really have a fixed routine, given all the travel and the nature of foreign correspondence, where you are often in different places, covering different stories. The truth is I'm not really the ideal tech consumer.    "
"ID for the Security Line: Your Eyes, Nose and Mouth","Facial recognition may soon be coming to an airport security line near you. Earlier this week, the Transportation Security Administration released a 23-page report outlining changes it is proposing on how passengers are screened before boarding their flights. Key among those changes is the proposal that passports and other forms of identification will eventually be replaced by biometric technology.     ''With the threat to aviation evolving every day, developing the next generation of security technology with our industry partners is critically important,'' David Pekoske, the T.S.A. administrator, said in a statement. ''By expanding our use of biometrics, TSA secures its position as a global leader in aviation security and advances global transportation security standards.''   Early this year, the agency began testing facial recognition technology for international travelers at Los Angeles International Airport. The biometric technology matches facial images to photos in government databases, such as photos obtained from passports or visa applications.   And in 2017, the T.S.A. tested fingerprint technology at the T.S.A. PreCheck lanes at the Atlanta and Denver airports. The technology matches passenger fingerprints provided at the checkpoint to those provided to the T.S.A. by travelers who have enrolled in the PreCheck program.   Biometric technology is also being evaluated by individual airlines. Delta Air Lines announced in September that it is building a dedicated biometric terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The technology, to be installed at Terminal F, would allow passengers to check-in at the self-service kiosks, drop off their checked baggage at the counter and then be used as identification at the terminal's T.S.A. checkpoint.   ''Launching the first biometric terminal in the U.S. at the world's busiest airport means we're bringing the future of flying to customers traveling around the globe,'' Gil West, Delta's chief operating office, said in a statement.   Face-recognition technology is not only supposed to speed up security lines, but is also less susceptible to fraud then the manual checks of IDs.   ''By testing biometrics technology in the airport environment, T.S.A. hopes to increase security effectiveness and stay ahead of the threat,'' Mr. Pekoske said. ''We will continue to leverage our partnerships to deliver enhanced capabilities to checkpoint lanes throughout the country.''    "
Call for Privacy Hands a Crisis To Tech Giants,"Follow David Streitfeld, Natasha Singer and Steven Erlanger on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld and @natashanyt and @StevenErlanger SAN FRANCISCO -- The contemporary internet was built on a bargain: Show us who you really are and the digital world will be free to search or share. People detailed their interests and obsessions on Facebook and Google, generating a river of data that could be collected and harnessed for advertising. The companies became very rich. Users seemed happy. Privacy was deemed obsolete, like bloodletting and milkmen.    Now, the consumer surveillance model underlying Facebook and Google's free services is under siege from users, regulators and legislators on both sides of the Atlantic. It amounts to a crisis for an internet industry that up until now had taken a reactive, whack-a-mole approach to problems like the spread of fraudulent news and misuse of personal data.   The recent revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling company that had worked with Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign, harvested data from 50 million Facebook users, raised the current uproar, even if the origins lie as far back as the 2016 election. It has been many months of allegations and arguments that the internet in general and social media in particular are pulling society down instead of lifting it up.    That has inspired a good deal of debate about more restrictive futures for Facebook and Google. At the furthest extreme, some dream of the companies becoming public utilities. More benign business models that depend less on ads and more on subscriptions have been proposed, although it's unclear why either company would abandon something that has made them so prosperous.   Congress might pass targeted legislation to restrict consumer data use in specific sectors, such as a Senate bill that would require increased transparency in online political advertising, said Daniel J. Weitzner, director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   There are other avenues still, said Jascha Kaykas-Wolff, the chief marketing officer of Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the popular Firefox browser, including advertisers and large tech platforms collecting vastly less user data and still effectively customizing ads to consumers.   ''They are just collecting all the data to try to find magic growth algorithms,'' Mr. Kaykas-Wolff said of online marketers. This past week, Mozilla halted its ads on Facebook, saying the social network's default privacy settings allowed access to too much data.   The greatest likelihood is that the internet companies, frightened by the tumult, will accept a few more rules and work a little harder for transparency. And there will be hearings on Capitol Hill.   The next chapter is also set to play out not in Washington but in Europe, where regulators have already cracked down on privacy violations and are examining the role of data in online advertising.   The Cambridge Analytica case, said Vera Jourova, the European Union commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, was not just a breach of private data. ''This is much more serious, because here we witness the threat to democracy, to democratic plurality,'' she said.   Although many people had a general understanding that free online services used their personal details to customize the ads they saw, the latest controversy starkly exposed the machinery.   Consumers' seemingly benign activities -- their likes -- could be used to covertly categorize and influence their behavior. And not just by unknown third parties. Facebook itself has worked directly with presidential campaigns on ad targeting, describing its services in a company case study as ''influencing voters.''   ''People are upset that their data may have been used to secretly influence 2016 voters,'' said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. ''If your personal information can help sway elections, which affects everyone's life and societal well-being, maybe privacy does matter after all.''   In interviews, Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, seemed to accept the possibility of increased privacy regulation, something that would have been unlikely only a few months ago. But some trade group executives also warned that any attempt to curb the use of consumer data would put the business model of the ad-supported internet at risk.   ''You're undermining a fundamental concept in advertising: reaching consumers who are interested in a particular product,'' said Dean C. Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group in Washington whose members include Amazon, Facebook, Google and Twitter.   If suspicion of Facebook and Google is a relatively new feeling in the United States, it has been embedded in Europe for historical and cultural reasons that date back to the Nazi Gestapo, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe and the Cold War.   ''We're at an inflection point, when the great wave of optimism about tech is giving way to growing alarm,'' said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society European Policy Institute. ''This is the moment when Europeans turn to the state for protection and answers, and are less likely than Americans to rely on the market to sort out imbalances.''   In May, the European Union is instituting a comprehensive new privacy law, called the General Data Protection Regulation. The new rules treat personal data as proprietary, owned by an individual, and any use of that data must be accompanied by permission -- opting in rather than opting out -- after receiving a request written in clear language, not legalese.   Mélanie Voin, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the protection rules will have more teeth than the current 1995 directive. For example, a company experiencing a data breach involving individuals must notify the data protection authority within 72 hours and would be subject to fines of up to 20 million euros or 4 percent of its annual revenue.   In a January speech in Brussels, Facebook's Ms. Sandberg said, ''We know we can't just meet the G.D.P.R., but we need to do even more.'' Google declined to comment.   The United States does not have a consumer privacy law like the General Data Protection Regulation. But after years of pushing for similar legislation, privacy groups said that recent events were giving them new momentum -- and they were looking to Europe for inspiration.   ''With the new European law, regulators for the first time have real enforcement tools,'' said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''We now have a way to hold these companies accountable.''   But any ambitions for new rules may run into the realities of the tech industry.   Privacy advocates and even some United States regulators have long been concerned about the ability of online services to track consumers and make inferences about their financial status, health concerns and other intimate details to show them behavior-based ads. They warned that such microtargeting could unfairly categorize or exclude certain people.   In 2010, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission proposed a new option for consumers, called Do Not Track. Two years later, the Barack Obama administration introduced a blueprint for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, intended to give Americans more control over what personal details companies collected from them and how the data was used.   But the Do Not Track effort and the privacy bill were both stymied.   Industry groups successfully argued that collecting personal details posed no harm to consumers and that efforts to hinder data collection would chill innovation. Instead, the advertising industry created a program to allow consumers to opt out of having their data used for customized ads, although it does not allow people to entirely opt out of having their data collected.   ''If it can be shown that the current situation is actually a market failure and not an individual-company failure, then there's a case to be made for federal regulation'' under certain circumstances, said Randall Rothenberg, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group.   The business practices of Facebook and Google were reinforced by the fact that no privacy flap lasted longer than a news cycle or two. Nor did people flee for other services. That convinced the companies that digital privacy was a dead issue.   If the current furor dies down without meaningful change, critics worry that the problems might become even more entrenched. When the tech industry follows its natural impulses, it becomes even less transparent.   That would hamper any long-term understanding of the relationship between social media and political views, an urgent question in Germany, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the United States and many other places.   ''To know the real interaction between populism and Facebook, you need to give much more access to researchers, not less,'' said Paul-Jasper Dittrich, a German research fellow in digital economy at the Jacques Delors Institute.   There's another reason Silicon Valley tends to be reluctant to share information about what it is doing. It believes so deeply in itself that it does not even think there is a need for discussion. The technology world's remedy for any problem is always more technology.   ''If Facebook and Google were merely interested in maximizing profits, we could regulate them,'' said Maciej Ceglowski, who runs Tech Solidarity, a labor advocacy group. ''But well-intentioned people can break things not easy to fix. It's like a child running a bulldozer. They don't have any sense of the damage they can do.''    "
Private Equity Executive Chosen to Lead Equifax,"Equifax on Wednesday named Mark Begor, a private equity executive who once led General Electric's credit card business, as its new chief executive. Mr. Begor, 59, takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who has filled the role on an interim basis since September, when Richard F. Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 148 million people.     Mr. Begor, a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, will start at Equifax on April 16. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO, a position he plans to give up before joining Equifax.   Equifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.   Mr. Barros will stay through the transition and retire early next year, Equifax said.   Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, is one of the country's so-called big three credit reporting bureaus. It maintains files on about 220 million Americans.   After the data breach -- and a response by the company that was widely criticized as inadequate -- Equifax has continued to stumble. In January, an app it released that was meant to let people lock their credit files was riddled with glitches. This month, a former company executive was charged with insider trading for selling Equifax shares after the breach but before it was publicly disclosed.   ''The team has made meaningful progress in the last several months to address a number of well-publicized issues,'' Mr. Begor said in a statement. ''I will prioritize continuing our team's efforts to communicate transparently and restore confidence with consumers, customers, shareholders and policymakers.''   Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate's real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company's consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.    "
"Facebook, Generator of Envy and Dread; Big City","Long before the data breach that led to Mark Zuckerberg's Congressional testimony this week, during which the Facebook chairman acknowledged that he was unable to keep even his own personal information secure, we suspected that Facebook was something less than a net positive for civilization. We knew this because we have stood on sweltering subway platforms in Midtown, in July, scrolling through a Facebook feed and discovering that our friends -- in many cases people we did not really know or particularly care for -- were feeling blessed to be eating lobster salad on sailboats off Nantucket or learning so much about Joyce in Dublin with an Oxford don as a paid personal guide.  We felt bad in a way that was diagnosable; several years ago the popular psychological press had come up with the term ""Facebook envy'' to describe the particular sense of despair that arises when we encounter the gloating, verbal or visual, of others on the site. Studies confirmed instinct: certain kinds of social media engagement drain happiness rather than generate it. Two years ago researchers at the University of Copenhagen who looked at 1,095 Facebook users across Denmark asked: ""We are surely better connected now than ever before, but is this new connectedness doing any good to our well-being?"" The answer, they concluded, was ""no,'' adding that the predominant uses of Facebook are ""affecting our well-being negatively on several dimensions."" The experiment had half of its subjects continue their Facebook rituals and the other half abstain from them. Thirteen percent of the abstainers could not keep away and wound up succumbing to their addiction. In the end, those who had no contact with Facebook during the course of a week rated their general sense of satisfaction higher than those who retained their habit. An earlier German study found that ""this magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding,"" providing evidence ""that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings."" But apart from envy, Facebook, in my experience, primarily energizes profound feelings of dread, perhaps especially for those in middle age, because it serves to remind us over and over how many ways life can go horribly and dramatically wrong. Just this week, someone I do not know posted that she had just lost her best friend. I continued reading to discover that her friend, who lived in Grosse Pointe, Mich., was killed in a car accident in Colorado along with her husband and two children. The accident appeared to involve black ice (the terrifying subject the writer John Seabrook had recently published an article about in The New Yorker). At present I have 3,423 Facebook friends most of whom I do not know, or know only tangentially. Had it not been for Facebook, I would not have heard that the wife of a former colleague I had not seen or been in touch with for more than 15 years had suffered a brain aneurysm. She survived, miraculously, but she was a relatively young mother who was going about her life only to come very close to death unexpectedly. I felt horribly for her and her family, but because of the distancing intimacy that provides Facebook's context, I could more easily indulge my own spiraling anxiety than anything else. Facebook became the processing mechanism that quickly turned compassion into a kind of self-obsessed and paralyzing fear. ""Tomorrow, I could wake up with a brain aneurysm,"" became the predominant thought. Of course hearing this sort of story outside the world of Facebook could certainly produce the same reaction, it is just that Facebook allows you to go deep, to become privy to information you might not otherwise ever have, to see the hospital photos and read through the threads in which other people closer to the person afflicted might weigh in with the stories of their own similar ailments. Recently, a writer I had profiled years ago posted on Facebook that he had cancer. He specifically asked that others refrain from commenting with their own cancer stories because it was more than he could handle. Last year, I became compelled by the entry of a man whose wife had been hospitalized with an acute form of psychosis that followed a week of serious depression. Two weeks earlier, he had posted a picture of them looking cheerful at an Italian restaurant. What had happened in the interim? I felt I had the right to know, while at the same time, I felt it would have been awkward and intrusive to send good thoughts and caring wishes as his actual friends had done. This voyeurism seemed much more invidious than whatever bitterness I might feel over the fact that someone else was on an eating tour of Umbria when I was not. The news is a delivery system for misery of course, especially now, but Facebook brings us news we might otherwise never encounter, supplying it in bulk and elevating our relationship to it. The value of that remains dubious.

It's Google's Turn in Washington's Glare,"WASHINGTON -- Google executives, after months of mostly avoiding the harsh spotlight put on their internet peers, are being grilled in Washington this week by lawmakers questioning if the Silicon Valley giant is living up to its promise to be a neutral arbiter of online information. On Friday, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, will meet with Representative Kevin McCarthy, of California, the Republican House majority leader and a vocal critic of Google, and more than two dozen Republicans to discuss complaints the company is trying to silence conservative voices. ""Google has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior, and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,"" Mr. McCarthy said in a statement. The Friday meeting will cap a week of tech-related sessions in Washington in which Google -- in the cross hairs of Silicon Valley's conservative critics since late summer -- has played a starring role.  At a gathering of the heads of the Justice Department and a dozen state attorneys general on Tuesday, Google was mentioned more than any other company when it came to concerns about antitrust enforcement and privacy practices, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity. At a Senate hearing discussing online privacy on Wednesday, Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, received the toughest and broadest array of questions from lawmakers who wanted to know about the company's consideration of introducing search services in China. Google says it is not close to starting such a service. In a letter to the Senate committee holding the hearing, a former employee, Jack Poulson, said Google's building a search engine that would be acceptable to the government of China was a ""catastrophic failure of the internal privacy review process."" He said this was part of a ""broad pattern of unaccountable decision making."" Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, also questioned Mr. Enright about claims of bias against conservatives in search results. ""I can tell you that millions of Texans believe Google is actively censoring the speech of conservatives,"" Mr. Cruz said. On Thursday, Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer and Republican Party official, is set to testify in the House about anti-conservative bias in tech. Ms. Dhillon represents several former employees in a lawsuit filed last year against Google that claims the company discriminated against them based on their political beliefs. Google's week in Washington comes three weeks after executives from Twitter and Facebook testified in a Senate hearing dedicated to Russian disinformation on social media. Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, also spoke at a House hearing about claims of anti-conservative bias at Twitter. Google executives did not attend the Senate hearing, though they were invited. The company offered to send Kent Walker, a senior vice president for global affairs who is also the company's top lawyer. But urged on by Facebook officials, according to two people familiar with the matter, senators insisted on a more powerful executive. Google refused. It was the ""worst business decision of 2018,"" said Scott Galloway, a founder of the business research firm Gartner L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. ""It feels like the tide has turned substantially,"" Mr. Galloway said. ""They've sort of poked the bear."" A Google spokeswoman said officials from the company had testified before Congress 22 times since 2008. ""We're happy to continue explaining our products and practices,"" Becca Rutkoff, the Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. For longtime Google critics and even some of its Silicon Valley peers, it is surprising that Google has avoided the spotlight for so long. It has 90 percent of the global search market -- a share so high that it has for years had to sidestep concerns that it is a dominant monopoly that needs to be regulated. Competitors have long claimed that Google is using its search dominance to advantage its own services and should be controlled by antitrust laws. The Google-owned YouTube video service is also dominant, and has for several years faced questions about videos that show terrorist violence and disinformation, similar to issues that Facebook and Twitter have had to address in congressional hearings. And Google has faced several claims of bias. A video of a staff meeting held shortly after Donald J. Trump was elected president, leaked two weeks ago, showed several senior Google executives, including Mr. Pichai, expressing their alarm. Emails leaked last week showed lower-level Google employees discussing whether they could alter search results to counter President Trump's travel ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries. Google is adamant that no one in a position to make such a change seriously considered it. Employees are bracing for more embarrassing leaks. The company has long encouraged workers to speak their minds on internal message boards. That includes politics. The conservative pressure on Google started to escalate in late summer. On Aug. 28, Mr. Trump, in a series of tweets, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to suppress conservative media that was favorable to his administration. The next day, the president posted a video that seemed to show that Google did not promote his State of the Union address on its home page as it had in the past for President Obama. He used the hashtag #StopTheBias. The video was incorrect. Google said that it didn't promote Mr. Obama's inaugural address, a joint statement to Congress but not technically a State of the Union address, in 2009 either. Shortly after, other Republicans were calling for regulations and greater scrutiny. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, called for antitrust regulators to reopen an investigation into Google. Some Google officials wonder if competitors are organizing a campaign to prompt regulatory scrutiny. At the Senate hearing Google did not attend, lawmakers mentioned a report that had come out a day before from the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog group that often publishes research critical of Google. The group posed as Russian trolls to buy what it called politically divisive ads on Google's systems, which failed to stop them. Google called the report ""a stunt"" by its rivals and blamed the software maker Oracle for its release. Ken Glueck, a senior vice president at Oracle, said it had made a one-time financial contribution in 2016 to the Campaign for Accountability but denied that the company had any involvement in the report. Google has many business opponents in Washington, including telecommunication giants like AT&T and Comcast. Oracle and News Corp. have put significant resources into funding third-party coalitions and public relations firms to place ads and to lobby lawmakers on Google's dominance in search and on allegations it uses its power to unfairly harm publishers and other tech rivals. But few companies have been as tenacious as Yelp, a midsize internet outfit with far fewer resources. It has waged a seven-year battle to get regulatory agencies around the world to investigate Google. Until recently, its calls have been largely ignored in the United States. The company claims Google prioritized its own reviews over others, making it much harder for competing reviews sites like Yelp to be discovered. Early in September, a White House official received an email with an attachment from Luther Lowe, the senior vice president for policy for Yelp. ""Check out the attachment,"" Mr. Lowe wrote in an email. ""Tell me what you think."" The attachment was a document called, ""Executive Draft Order to Protect American Competition and Small Businesses From Bias in Online Platforms."" It was a draft presidential order instructing antitrust officials to recommend ways to protect competition and clamp down on content bias on internet search and social media sites. Mr. Lowe said in an email that he did not know the origins of the document and that it had been forwarded to him. While there is no evidence that administration officials are seriously considering such a move, the document's existence made clear that Google's problems could get worse. ""Although the White House is concerned about the conduct of online platforms and their impact on society, this document is not the result of an official White House policymaking process,"" said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary.

Become a Guest on Your Own Computer; TECH TIP,"Q. I have heard that making a guest account on the computer and using it yourself can help stop viruses. Why is this, and how would I go about making an extra account?  A. Administrator accounts on a Windows, Mac or Linux computer have the ability to adjust settings, install new programs, change passwords and perform other functions that affect the entire system. Accounts designated as ""standard,"" ""limited"" or ""guest"" have much less control over the entire system and can make only minor changes that are specific to that account, like changing the desktop wallpaper. Malicious software that invades a computer through the user logged in as the administrator can usually burrow in deeper to do more damage. To set up a limited account for yourself (or a child) on a Windows 10 Home or Professional system, go to the Start menu and select the gear-shaped Settings icon. On the Settings screen, choose Accounts, then ""Family & other people"" to ""Add someone else to this PC."" Follow the instructions on the screen to create the account. As with most account creation, you may need to enter the administrator password at some point. On a Windows 7 system, go to the Start menu and select Control Panel and then ""User Accounts and Family Safety."" Click User Accounts and then ""Manage another account."" Click ""Create a new account"" and follow the steps on the screen.  Mac administrators can set up the less powerful Standard accounts, Managed accounts with Parental Controls, or Sharing-only accounts for screen- and file-sharing. To get started, go to the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. In the System Preferences box, click Users & Groups. In the Users & Groups box, click the padlock icon, enter the Mac's administrator password and click the plus (+) icon to get started. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.

Lawyers for Neo-Nazi to Defend Fabulist,"Alex Jones, an online conspiracy theorist who claims the Sandy Hook massacre that killed 20 children and six adults was a hoax, has hired lawyers representing a founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website to defend him against defamation claims brought in Connecticut by families of seven Sandy Hook victims. Since days after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Jones has spread bogus theories that the families were ''crisis actors'' in a government plot to confiscate Americans' firearms. The families have endured online abuse, physical confrontations and death threats from Mr. Jones's devotees.     Marc Randazza and Jay Wolman of the Las Vegas-based Randazza Legal Group are defending Mr. Jones in Connecticut. The lawyers also represent Andrew Anglin, the co-founder of the Daily Stormer, who is being sued for harassment by a Montana woman after Daily Stormer followers subjected her to a torrent of anti-Semitic slurs and threats. Mr. Anglin has cited Mr. Jones as an early influence.   Mr. Jones is also facing lawsuits filed in Texas by the families of two other Sandy Hook victims, but he has different lawyers there. Together, the lawsuits pose a significant legal threat to his InfoWars empire, First Amendment lawyers say.   Mr. Jones, who has been using his InfoWars radio show and YouTube channels to broadcast the false claim, is seeking to have all of the lawsuits dismissed.   Mr. Randazza has appeared on Mr. Jones's radio show and in InfoWars videos. In a brief telephone interview, he acknowledged opinions by First Amendment lawyers not involved in the cases that the Sandy Hook families have a strong claim against Mr. Jones. ''I think if you look at the allegations in the complaint, that's an easy conclusion to make,'' Mr. Randazza said. ''But as these cases progress sometimes things turn in the other direction.''   ''We are going to be mounting a strong First Amendment defense and look forward to this being resolved in a civil and collegial manner,'' he said, asserting that Mr. Jones has ''a great deal of compassion for these parents.''   On his website, Mr. Jones has suggested that the victims' parents took part in an elaborate hoax, saying, ''I've watched a lot of soap operas, and I've seen actors before.''   Since founding InfoWars in 1999, Mr. Jones has drawn a vast audience with bizarre theories, including that American terrorist attacks and mass shootings are ''inside jobs,'' and that the government lines juice boxes with hormones that make children gay.   ''Alex Jones has built an opportunistic empire on the backs of families trying to pick up the pieces from shattering loss,'' Joshua Koskoff, a partner at Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder of Bridgeport, Conn., the firm representing Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuits, said in a statement.   Mr. Jones did not respond to requests for comment.   Last week a District Court judge in Travis County, Tex., set Aug. 1 as a hearing date for the first of the Texas lawsuits. That one was filed in April by the parents of Noah Pozner, who was 6 when he was killed at Sandy Hook.   Mark Bankston of Farrar & Ball, the Houston-based firm representing the Sandy Hook parents in the Texas lawsuits, said in an email that the firm was eager to ''finally hold Mr. Jones accountable for his malicious lies,'' adding, ''There are no more excuses for Mr. Jones to hide behind. Now he must answer to the law.''    "
Facebook and YouTube Give Alex Jones a Wrist Slap,"The digital walls are closing in on Alex Jones, the social media shock jock whose penchant for right-wing conspiracy theories and viral misinformation set off a heated debate about the limits of free speech on internet platforms. Facebook said on Friday that it had suspended Mr. Jones from posting on the site for 30 days because he had repeatedly violated its policies. The social network also took down four videos posted by Mr. Jones and Infowars, the website he oversees. ""We received reports related to four different videos on the pages that Infowars and Alex Jones maintain on Facebook,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. ""We reviewed the content against our Community Standards and determined that it violates. All four videos have been removed from Facebook.""  The 30-day ban applies only to Mr. Jones personally, not to Infowars or to any of the other administrators of his Facebook page, which has nearly 1.7 million followers. Those people will still be able to post to Mr. Jones's page as long as their posts don't violate the site's policies -- meaning that Mr. Jones could still appear in videos and stories posted to the page as long as he does not post them personally. In fact, Mr. Jones appeared on a live-streamed Facebook video on his page on Friday, shortly after the suspension went into effect, in which he claimed that he was the victim of a media conspiracy to ""de-platform"" conservative voices. ""This is war,"" Mr. Jones said in the video. Facebook may remove Mr. Jones's page altogether if he continues to violate its policies, the spokeswoman said. This week, Facebook determined that one of Mr. Jones's recent videos -- an inflammatory rant in which he accused Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, of supporting pedophilia and pantomimed shooting him -- did not violate its policies. On Tuesday, YouTube took down four videos uploaded to Mr. Jones's channel, which has 2.4 million subscribers, for violating its policies on hate speech and child endangerment. The violation placed a first strike against Mr. Jones's account on YouTube, preventing the channel from streaming live video for 90 days. If Mr. Jones receives two more strikes during that period, YouTube will terminate his account. ""We apply our policies consistently according to the content in the videos, regardless of the speaker or the channel,"" YouTube said in a statement. A request to Mr. Jones for comment was not immediately returned. This is not the first time that Mr. Jones's videos have received a strike from YouTube. In February, YouTube levied a strike for a video claiming that David Hogg, one of the outspoken student survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., was a ""crisis actor."" YouTube said the video had violated its policies around harassment and bullying. But since there were no additional violations during the next 90 days, the strike was removed from the account. Facebook and YouTube acted after weeks of controversy over Mr. Jones, who first gained notoriety by insisting that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were an ""inside job"" by the United States government. Since then, he has questioned whether the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax, promoted the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory and said fluoridated water was part of a government mind-control plot. Despite these unsupported views, social media platforms have allowed him to gain a wide audience. Conservatives have accused Facebook, YouTube and other platforms of censoring right-wing views in the past, and have rallied behind him before. This month, at a press event in New York about Facebook's efforts to combat misinformation and false news, a reporter from CNN questioned company executives about why Infowars was still allowed to have a Facebook account. At the time, the company appeared unwilling to say Mr. Jones's content violated its policies. ""Look, as abhorrent as some of this content can be, I do think that it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice,"" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in a Recode podcast interview. As an example, Mr. Zuckerberg cited Holocaust denial as a message that he found personally offensive but was wary of removing from Facebook, in order to protect users' free-speech rights. Within Facebook, the free-speech issues raised by Infowars and Mr. Jones have become an especially contentious topic. Employees have used internal chat forums to question executives about the site's policies, according to one Facebook employee, who asked to remain anonymous because of fear of retribution. One group of Facebook workers, which included people of Jewish and Eastern European descent, raised Mr. Zuckerberg's position on Holocaust denial with their superiors, saying they found it incomprehensible, according to the employee. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Democratic lawmakers pressed Monika Bickert, Facebook's global head of policy management, about why Infowars was allowed to remain on Facebook. Several days later, two parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook shooting wrote an open letter to Mr. Zuckerberg, criticizing him for allowing Mr. Jones and his followers to use Facebook to harass and intimidate the families of victims. ""Our families are in danger as a direct result of the hundreds of thousands of people who see and believe the lies and hate speech, which you have decided should be protected,"" the parents wrote. Facebook's policies about misinformation have been vague and inconsistently applied, and the company has appeared flat-footed when dealing with popular purveyors of conspiracy theories and hyperpartisan content such as Mr. Jones and Infowars. In briefings with reporters this month, Facebook executives struggled to define the company's policies regarding accounts that repeatedly post false or misleading news. The executives said that if third-party fact-checkers found roughly one-third of an account's posts false, the account would be demoted, or ""down-ranked,"" in order to limit its visibility. The company has refused to reveal a list of accounts that have been down-ranked. Later, the company said it would remove, rather than down-rank, misinformation that could lead to physical violence. Daisuke Wakabayashi and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting.

"'Feed Your Gladiator': Jones Urges Fans to Fight Back, and Send Money","WASHINGTON -- Summoning the Alamo, Roman gladiators and the First Amendment, the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is calling on his Infowars followers to rise up against anti-Trump ''sociopaths'' who he says are behind the removal of his Infowars programming from most major social media platforms. ''We knew this was coming,'' Mr. Jones said on his broadcast on Monday. ''They tried to break all the Republicans, persecute people. Trump broke through their bullying and lies. We stood beside him, and now they want to take out the press from under him, and they want to use me as the distorted poster child to do it. They think you're weak.''    Over the past several days, Apple, Facebook, YouTube and Spotify have removed most of Mr. Jones's programming from their services in a sweeping effort to rein in those who traffic in online misinformation that draws hundreds of thousands of followers and results in harassment and threats to their targets. Stitcher, LinkedIn and Pinterest have also removed Infowars content.    The moves drastically reduce the audience for Infowars, which sells diet supplements and survivalist gear through a radio broadcast, videos and online stories spreading bizarre conspiracy theories and misinformation.   YouTube's termination of Mr. Jones's channel cost him access to his 2.4 million subscribers and resulted in the removal of all his past videos. Those videos had amassed billions of views, in part because YouTube continued to recommend them to users who had shown interest in conservative topics.   Just one of his four Facebook pages had 1.7 million followers, now also gone. Apple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts on its service on Sunday, having determined that the sixth, ''RealNews With David Knight,'' did not violate its policies, which prohibit podcasts that ''could be construed as racist, misogynist or homophobic'' or that depict ''graphic sex, violence, gore, illegal drugs or hate themes.''   Mr. Jones has been trying to compensate by promoting his website and mobile app. On Tuesday, after news of Mr. Jones's bans spread, Infowars was Apple's fourth most popular news app, outranking those from every mainstream news media organization. Before the ban, it ranked 33rd on average since July 12.   In an interview on Friday at his headquarters in Austin, Tex., Mr. Jones said the effort to limit his access to social media platforms was part of an elaborate plot to silence him involving Democrats, China, ''globalists'' and ''corporatists.'' He suggested that it was his support for President Trump, not his spreading of falsehoods, that led to him being ''de-platformed.''   ''This is a war on free speech,'' Mr. Jones said. ''This is what the corporate media is doing in America because it's afraid of new independent media and asking questions.''   Money, he said in a follow-up interview on Saturday, was not a prime motivator for him. ''Money is the jet fuel for the jet bombers I use to drop truth bombs,'' he said.   Mr. Jones is eager to characterize his fight as a stand for constitutionally protected speech, but the private companies that have removed his programming from their platforms have broad latitude to control content, especially if it violates their written terms of service.   Facebook removed Mr. Jones's pages for violating its policies by ''glorifying violence'' and ''using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.'' YouTube terminated Mr. Jones's channel for repeatedly violating its policies, including its prohibition on hate speech. Spotify cited its own prohibition on hate speech as the reason for removing a podcast by Mr. Jones.   Indeed, Infowars' own website says in its terms of service that the company ''may review and delete any content you post on the website or elsewhere utilizing our services or system if we determine, in our sole discretion, that the content violates the rights of others, is not appropriate for the website, or otherwise violates this agreement.''   But Vera Eidelman, a fellow with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, sided with Mr. Jones.   ''While private companies can choose what to take down from their sites, the fact that social media platforms like Facebook have become indispensable platforms for the speech of billions means that they should resist calls to censor offensive speech,'' she said in a statement. ''The recent decision by Facebook and YouTube to take down Alex Jones's content may have provided a quick solution to a challenging situation, but encouraging these companies to silence individuals in this way will backfire.''   Mr. Jones was defiant on his program Monday, saying past efforts to screen offensive broadcasts have ''only made us stronger.''   ''But it has not allowed us to reach a lot of new people,'' he continued. ''That's why you have to understand now that Infowars is the most censored program in the world -- because we know the truth.''   Over two decades, Mr. Jones has built a profitable business selling diet supplements, survivalist gear, and air and water filtration equipment as he spread bizarre theories, including that the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, were an inside job, and that various government-orchestrated plots are responsible for poisoning Americans' water, air and food.   False claims spread by Mr. Jones, including one that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was a government-backed hoax and that the victims' parents were lying about it, have resulted in multiple defamation lawsuits against him. On Tuesday, lawyers for one victim's family sparred with Mr. Jones's lawyers over their demand that the parents submit their dates of birth and current address in a filing evidencing the parents' monetary damages.   Mark Bankston and Bill Ogden, who represent the parents, Leonard Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa, said in a court filing that requiring the Pozners to disclose the information in a public document could subject them to ''further harassment or attack.'' Death threats and harassment by Mr. Jones's followers have forced the Pozners to move seven times, and they live in hiding.   Mr. Jones has promoted himself and Infowars as near-solitary truth tellers in a news landscape dominated by left-leaning ''corporatist'' media -- even though the popular Drudge Report website broadcast his show on Monday. Now, what he calls his ''de-platforming'' has only increased his sense of grievance, and that of his followers -- even as it shrinks his reach before the November midterm elections.   ''I knew what the enemy was doing -- I knew their battle plan, I made the conscious decision to draw their fire,'' he said on his show Monday. ''When you see the Alamo assaulted and myself probably destroyed, I've been telling you this for years,'' he said, adding: ''Remember Infowars. Remember free speech.''   So far, Mr. Trump, who praised Mr. Jones during an appearance on his radio show during the presidential campaign, has remained silent as Mr. Jones issues appeals to Trump supporters. Democrats have praised the takedown of Infowars content as long overdue.   ''Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,'' Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a strident critic of Infowars in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, said on Twitter. ''These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.''   On Tuesday, Donald Trump Jr. posted on Twitter that Mr. Murphy was ''A Democrat Senator openly admitting that Big Tech's censorship campaign is really about purging all conservative media. How long before Big Tech and their Democrat friends move to censor and purge Breitbart News, Daily Caller and other conservatives voices from their platforms?''   On his show, Mr. Jones is using the moves against his business to raise money and encourage his followers to migrate to his Infowars website, where he has posted the content removed by other platforms. He is also asking followers to donate to him -- and buy his merchandise.   ''Don't forget the financial support; that is the strongest thing you can do to make sure that we continue on and are strong in the fight,'' he said. Referring listeners to his online store, he said, ''Go there today and send them a strong message that you stand for the First Amendment, you stand for us and get air filtration, water filtration, optics, preparedness gear, high quality storable foods, supplements that are so good for you and your family.   ''Feed your gladiator,'' he urged.    "
The Risks of Silencing Hate Speech,"Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify and most other major internet distributors took a bold step this week when they all but banned content from Infowars, a website run by the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The tech companies cited their policies against hate speech for their decision, rather than the trafficking in fake news by Infowars. It's tempting to applaud this move, but we should be wary. While Mr. Jones's rhetoric is certainly repugnant, mounting pressure from the political left to censor hateful speech may have unintended consequences, especially for people of color.    That's because ''hate'' is a dangerously elastic label, one that has long been used in America to demonize unpopular expression. If we become overzealous in our efforts to limit so-called hate speech, we run the risk of setting a trap for the very people we're trying to defend.    History offers countless examples. Consider black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s. Impatient with the lack of progress for African-Americans after the civil rights movement, leaders like Malcolm X routinely inveighed against white America using inflammatory rhetoric. He had no trouble expressing animosity toward the ''white devil,'' and he contemplated violent resistance.   That put him in the cross hairs of law enforcement, most notably J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. Of course, the FBI spied on many other so-called black radicals. Under Hoover's Counterintelligence Program, groups like the Nation of Islam and the Black Panthers were subject to routine surveillance, harassment and even violence. Hoover's justification? He labeled them hate groups. It was a cynical but effective way to turn the tables, framing them as antagonists in the centuries' long struggle for racial equality.   Hoover is gone, but the tendency to label black radical organizations as hate groups persists, even among groups with more admirable intentions. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist and hate organizations across the country, makes the dubious claim that nearly 25 percent of the 954 ''hate groups'' they follow are ''black nationalist'' groups.   There's no question that black nationalists often argue for racial separation or that many have engaged in bigotry. But it's false equivalence to label black nationalists and white supremacists alike as hate groups. Doing so ignores the centuries of racial terror that gave rise to black nationalism, as well as the power imbalance that keeps it alive. And it gives a powerful tool to people who want to silence radical perspectives. They can call these viewpoints hate speech.   Take, as one example, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, a Palestinian-led initiative that endorses a series of nonviolent measures to end Israel's systematic oppression of the Palestinians. As it has gained traction in the United States, in large part because of support from prominent African-American intellectuals and organizations, state and federal lawmakers have increasingly tried to shut the movement down by accusing it of hate speech.   The New York State Senate, for example, recently passed a bill that would prohibit from receiving public funds ''student organizations that participate in hate speech, including advocating for the boycott, divestment and sanctions of Israel and American allied nations.'' Meanwhile, Congress (with support from many Democrats) has been trying to criminalize the movement for years.   If people engaged in a boycott can be silenced, even criminalized, for discriminating against the group they accuse of discrimination, we begin to see how problematic it is to punish ''hate'' speech. It can devolve into the politics of choosing sides, and that is usually bad news for people who lack political clout to begin with.   Black Lives Matter would know. A movement formed in response to police violence against African-Americans, it has been accused by law enforcement officials, and even some state legislators, of being a hate group, despite the fact that it renounces violence and welcomes allies from all walks of life.   By accusing Black Lives Matter of peddling hate, politicians effectively turned the tables on the movement, allowing lawmakers, in some cases, to strengthen protections for the police. Since 2016, several ''Blue Lives Matter'' bills have been enacted across the country, many of which seek to add police as a protected class covered by hate crimes laws. Following this logic, Black Lives Matter's opposition to police brutality is a kind of hate itself, from which the police require additional protection. Yet killings by police officers are increasing while line-of-duty deaths of police officers are decreasing.   It is difficult to imagine a more ridiculous outcome. But it speaks to one of the most serious perils of limiting speech: a measure to protect minority perspectives can instead be used to further marginalize them.   Despite this, a significant number of young Americans, especially young Americans of color, believe that hate speech should be limited by the government or on college campuses. In addition, some scholars have recently argued for legal restrictions on hate speech.   But how would stronger limits on hate speech affect progressive protests against white supremacy? What would have been the fate, for example, of the historic Million Man March in 1995, an event organized by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan? The Nation of Islam is a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group, and Mr. Farrakhan has openly made anti-Semitic comments for years. At the same time, the March was a landmark effort focused on uniting black men in the face of widespread inequality and racism.   What about the equally historic Women's March in 2017, after it was revealed that some of the event's most prominent organizers had ties to Mr. Farrakhan? Or that they openly revered Assata Shakur, a black revolutionary who was convicted (albeit questionably) of killing a police officer and is now on the F.B.I.'s list of most-wanted terrorists? Predictably, they have been accused by some of embracing hate, yet they organized one of the most significant protests in United States history.   If we allowed these voices to be silenced on grounds that they promote hate, we'd find ourselves scrambling to defend the radical poets, musicians, filmmakers and other artists who have pushed the boundaries of expression into what could arguably amount to hate speech, but who have done so from the vanguard of social and political protest.   That almost certainly explains the response from the music industry when Spotify announced its decision to stop promoting artists who engage in hateful speech or conduct. A number of people, including representatives from Kendrick Lamar's record label, Top Dawg Entertainment, expressed concerns that such a policy would lead to censorship and threatened to pull their music from the service.   Within weeks, Spotify reversed course, noting that its policy was ''vague.'' But by silencing Mr. Jones on its platform, it's not exactly clear where Spotify is drawing the line.   And that's the inherent danger in attempting to limit something like hate. It can be so broadly defined that our efforts to counteract it will be broad, too.   If that happens, we risk silencing the voices and perspectives we can least afford to lose. That's not a triumph over hate. That's falling victim to it.

Russia's Information Warfare,"The Russian disinformation operations that affected the 2016 United States presidential election are by no means over. Indeed, as two new reports produced for the Senate Intelligence Committee make clear, Russian interference through social media -- contrary to the suggestion of many prominent tech executives -- is a chronic, widespread and identifiable condition that we must now aggressively manage. The Senate committee asked two research teams, one of which I led, to investigate the full scope of the recent multiyear Russian operation to influence American opinion executed by a company called the Internet Research Agency. The Senate provided us with data attributed to the agency's operations given to the Senate by Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet (Google's parent company), companies whose platforms were manipulated for that purpose.     Our report, announced by the committee on Monday, concludes that Russia was able to masquerade successfully as a collection of American media entities, managing fake personas and developing communities of hundreds of thousands, building influence over a period of years and using it to manipulate and exploit existing political and societal divisions. While Russia is hardly the only geopolitical actor with a well-thumbed disinformation playbook, a look at the data -- which concerned the Internet Research Agency's operation over the last three years -- reveals its enthusiasm for and commitment to modern information warfare.   Regardless of what any tech executives may have said, the data indicate that this was not a small-scale problem fixable by tweaking a platform's advertising purchase policy. Rather, it was a cross-platform attack that made use of numerous features on each social network and that spanned the entire social ecosystem.   Tech executives have also stressed that Russian disinformation efforts were a small percentage of the total content on any individual platform during the years in question. That is correct. But it obscures the more important point: For subgroups of targeted Americans, such as African-Americans, the messaging was perhaps ubiquitous.   And disinformation does not stay within a subgroup. ''Virality,'' a term beloved by internet marketers, is apropos here: A vulnerable few contract an initial ''infection'' that then spreads exponentially through the broader population, ultimately enabling the infection to ''jump'' into entirely different populations (including offline populations, in this case).   In official statements to Congress, tech executives have said that they found it beyond their capabilities to assess whether Russia created content intended to discourage anyone from voting. We have determined that Russia did create such content. It propagated lies about voting rules and processes, attempted to steer voters toward third-party candidates and created stories that advocated not voting.   Our analysis underscores the fact that such influence operations are not specific to one platform, one malign actor or one targeted group. This is a global problem. The consolidation of the online social ecosystem into a few major platforms means that propagandists have ready audiences; they need only blanket a handful of services to reach hundreds of millions of people. And precision targeting, made possible by a decade of gathering detailed user behavior data (in the service of selling ads), means that it is easy and inexpensive to reach any targeted group.   Ultimately, the biggest lesson from the Senate committee's request for our investigation of Russian interference is the troubling absence of adequate structures for collaboration among multiple stakeholders, private and public alike, to establish solutions and appropriate oversight.   The hard truth is that the problem of disinformation campaigns will never be fixed; it's a constantly evolving arms race. But it can -- and must -- be managed. This will require that social media platforms, independent researchers and the government work together as partners in the fight. We cannot rely on -- nor should we place the full burden on -- the social media platforms themselves.   The landscape of disinformation is, frankly, a grim one. Russia has already signaled its intention to continue information operations. Terrorists strategically counter attempts to kick them off popular platforms. Domestic ideologues adopt the manipulative distribution tactics used by foreign propagandists.   But there is some cause for hope. With our report (and that of others) on the Internet Research Agency data, we now have a far more complete picture of what happened with Russian disinformation efforts from 2014 to 2017. There is heightened public interest in the topic, the social platforms are actively participating in trying to find solutions and the government's investigation is fueling a conversation about regulation. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, has even proposed a comprehensive new cyberdoctrine.   With discipline, rigor and broad collaboration, we can meet this challenge, establishing standards, protocols and governance that will defend the integrity of our information.

Inside a 3-Year Russian Campaign to Influence U.S. Voters,"WASHINGTON -- In September, as the first detailed evidence surfaced of Russia's hijacking of social media in the 2016 election, Irina V. Kaverzina, one of about 80 Russians working on the project in St. Petersburg, emailed a family member with some news. ""We had a slight crisis here at work: the F.B.I. busted our activity (not a joke),"" she wrote of the project in Russia. ""So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues."" She added, ""I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people."" A 37-page indictment, handed up on Friday by a Washington grand jury and charging Ms. Kaverzina and 12 other people with an elaborate conspiracy, showed that she and her colleagues did not, in fact, hide their tracks so well from United States investigators. The charges, brought by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, introduced hard facts to a polarized political debate over Russia's intervention in American democracy, while not yet implicating President Trump or his associates.  The indictment presented in astonishing detail a carefully planned, three-year Russian scheme to incite political discord in the United States, damage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and later bolster the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, along with those of Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. The precise description of the operation suggested that F.B.I. investigators had intercepted communications, found a cooperating insider or both. The Russians overseeing the operation, which they named the Translator Project, had a goal to ""spread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general."" They used a cluster of companies linked to one called the Internet Research Agency, and called their campaign ""information warfare."" The field research to guide the attack appears to have begun in earnest in June 2014. Two Russian women, Aleksandra Y. Krylova and Anna V. Bogacheva, obtained visas for what turned out to be a three-week reconnaissance tour of the United States, including to key electoral states like Colorado, Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico. The visa application of a third Russian, Robert S. Bovda, was rejected. The two women bought cameras, SIM cards and disposable cellphones for the trip and devised ""evacuation scenarios"" in case their real purpose was detected. In all, they visited nine states -- California, Illinois, Louisiana, New York and Texas, in addition to the others -- ""to gather intelligence"" on American politics, the indictment says. Ms. Krylova sent a report about their findings to one of her bosses in St. Petersburg. Another Russian operative visited Atlanta in November 2014 on a similar mission, the indictment says. It does not name that operative, a possible indication that he or she is cooperating with the investigation, legal experts said. The operation also included the creation of hundreds of email, PayPal and bank accounts and even fraudulent drivers' licenses issued to fictitious Americans. The Russians also used the identities of real Americans from stolen Social Security numbers. At the height of the 2016 campaign, the effort employed more than 80 people, who used secure virtual private network connections to computer servers leased in the United States to hide the fact that they were in Russia. From there, they posed as American activists, emailing, advising and making payments to real Americans who were duped into believing that they were part of the same cause. The playing field was mainly social media, where the Russians splashed catchy memes and hash tags. Facebook has estimated that the fraudulent Russian posts reached 126 million Americans on its platforms alone. The Russian operatives contacted, among others, a real Texas activist who, evidently assuming they were Americans, advised them to focus on ""purple states like Colorado, Virginia &amp; Florida."" After that, F.B.I. agents found that the phrase ""purple states"" became a mantra for the Russian operation. Clinton Watts, a former F.B.I. agent who has tracked the Russian campaign closely, said that he had no doubt that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was behind the effort, which was carried out by companies controlled by his friend and ally, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin. But he noted that the so-called trolls employed by Mr. Prigozhin took elaborate steps to obscure their identities and locations and to avoid leaving government fingerprints. ""From the beginning, they built this so it could be plausibly denied,"" Mr. Watts said. Mr. Putin has repeatedly denied any government role in hacking and disinformation aimed at the United States, while coyly allowing that patriotic Russians may have carried out such attacks on their own. Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called the reported origin of the effort in April 2014 ""crucially important."" ""That's a little more than a month after the annexation of Crimea and the launch of Russia's covert war in eastern Ukraine,"" Mr. Weiss said. The resulting crisis ""vaporized U.S.-Russian relations overnight,"" he said, setting off multiple Russian efforts ""to undermine the United States, both in terms of our leading role in the world, but also via our own domestic political vulnerabilities."" Mr. Weiss said the fact that private companies conducted the social media campaign simply made it cheaper and more difficult to trace. Mr. Putin has been angry with Mrs. Clinton since at least 2011, when she was secretary of state and he accused her of inciting unrest in Russia as he faced large-scale political protests. Mrs. Clinton, he said, had sent ""a signal"" to ""some actors in our country"" after elections that were condemned as fraudulent by both international and Russian observers. Mr. Mueller's indictment does not present evidence that the campaign overseen by Mr. Prigozhin was ordered by Mr. Putin. American officials have traced other elements of the Russian meddling, notably the hacking and leaking of leading Democrats' emails, to Russian intelligence agencies carrying out Mr. Putin's orders. While the indictment certainly undermines Mr. Trump's blanket assertions that the Russian interference is a political ""hoax,"" it does not accuse anyone from his campaign or any other American of knowingly aiding in the effort. By the beginning of 2016, the Russian strategy was in place, and the conspirators began their campaign to sow conflict. An internal message circulated through the Internet Research Agency telling operatives to post content online that focused on ""politics in the USA."" ""Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump--we support them),"" the message read. The scope of the operation was sweeping. The Russians assumed their fake identities to communicate with campaign volunteers for Mr. Trump and grass-roots groups supporting his candidacy. They bought pro-Trump and anti-Clinton political advertisements on Facebook and other social media. They used an Instagram account to try to suppress turnout of minority voters and campaign for Ms. Stein, the Green Party candidate. Applying nearly two years' worth of political research, the Russians used all of these tactics to target voters in swing states, notably Florida, according to the indictment. By summer 2016, the Russian operatives were mobilizing efforts for coming ""Florida Goes Trump"" rallies across the state, all planned for Aug. 20. Using false identities, they contacted Trump campaign staff in Florida to offer their services. One operative sent a message to a campaign official saying that the group Being Patriotic was organizing a statewide rally ""to support Mr. Trump."" ""You know, simple yelling on the internet is not enough,"" the message read, according to the indictment. ""There should be real action. We organized rallies in New York before. Now we're focusing on purple states such as Florida."" Taking to Facebook, the Russians used the pseudonym Matt Skiber to advertise the rally. ""If we lose Florida, we lose America. We can't let it happen, right? What about organizing a YUGE pro-Trump flash mob in every Florida town?"" the message read, using one of Mr. Trump's favorite verbal flourishes. They reached out to local organizations to build momentum for the coming rallies and assign specific tasks. They paid one unwitting Trump supporter to build a cage on a flatbed truck that housed another person wearing a costume that portrayed Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform. After the rallies in Florida, the group applied similar tactics to organize rallies in Pennsylvania, New York and elsewhere. Weeks before the election, the Russians ratcheted up social media activity aimed at dampening support for Mrs. Clinton. In mid-October, Woke Blacks, an Instagram account run by the Internet Research Agency, carried the message ""hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL."" Then, just days before Americans went to the polls, another Instagram account controlled by the Russians -- called Blacktivist -- urged its followers to ""choose peace"" and vote for Ms. Stein, who was expected to siphon support from Mrs. Clinton's campaign. ""Trust me,"" the message read, ""it's not a wasted vote."" PHOTO: Casting ballots in Virginia, a swing state. The goal of the Russian campaign was to damage Hillary Clinton's presidential bid and later, to bolster Donald Trump's in the 2016 election in such battleground states.

"Yevgeny Prigozhin, Russian Oligarch Indicted by U.S., Is Known as 'Putin's Cook'","ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- Long before he was indicted by the United States in a case involving the troll factory that spearheaded Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 United States elections, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin emerged from prison just as the Soviet Union was collapsing and opened a hot-dog stand. Soon, he has said, the rubles were piling up faster than his mother could count them in the kitchen of their modest apartment, and he was set on his improbable career. He earned the slightly mocking nickname of ""Putin's cook."" Despite his humble, troubled youth, Mr. Prigozhin became one of Russia's richest men, joining a charmed circle whose members often share one particular attribute: their proximity to President Vladimir V. Putin. The small club of loyalists who gain Mr. Putin's trust often feast, as Mr. Prigozhin has, on enormous state contracts. In return, they are expected to provide other, darker services to the Kremlin as needed.  On Friday, Mr. Prigozhin was one of 13 Russians indicted by a federal grand jury for interfering in the American election. According to the indictment, Mr. Prigozhin, 56, controlled the entity that financed the troll factory, known as the Internet Research Agency, which waged ""information warfare against the United States"" by creating fictitious social-media personas, spreading falsehoods and promoting messages supportive of Donald J. Trump and critical of Hillary Clinton. He has denied involvement. ""The Americans are very impressionable people; they see what they want to see,"" the Russian state news agency Ria Novosti quoted Mr. Prigozhin as saying on Friday. ""I have a lot of respect for them. I am not upset at all that I ended up on this list. If they want to see the devil, let them see him."" Mr. Prigozhin's critics -- including opposition politicians, journalists and activists, the United States Treasury and now the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III -- say he has emerged as Mr. Putin's go-to oligarch for that and a variety of sensitive and often-unsavory missions, like recruiting contract soldiers to fight in Ukraine and Syria. ""He is not afraid of dirty tasks,"" said Lyubov Sobol of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an organization established by the prominent opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny to investigate abuse of state contracts and other illicit schemes. ""He can fulfill any task for Putin, ranging from fighting the opposition to sending mercenaries to Syria,"" she said. ""He serves certain interests in certain spheres, and Putin trusts him."" The United States imposed sanctions against Mr. Prigozhin in December 2016, followed by his two main, publicly acknowledged companies, Concord Management and Consulting, and Concord Catering. In doing so, the Treasury Department said he provided extensive support to senior Russian Federation officials, including constructing a military base near Ukraine that was used to deploy Russian troops. The most notorious venture linked to Mr. Prigozhin, however, is the troll farm that is accused of attacking opposition figures in Russia and seeking to magnify and aggravate social and political divisions in the West. Despite his frequent denials of any involvement, his critics say he and others like him provide a way for the Kremlin to engage in such activities while maintaining a discreet distance. The indictment on Friday says, among other charges, that Mr. Prigozhin frequently met in 2015 and 2016 with Mikhail I. Bystrov, the top official in the troll factory, which ran a disinformation campaign called Project Lakhta that by September 2016 had a monthly budget of $1.2 million. Boris L. Vishnevsky, an opposition member of the city council in St. Petersburg, who has called for an official investigation into threats by Mr. Prigozhin against journalists, said the Kremlin endorsed projects like the troll farm without directly organizing them. ""This is done by somebody who receives large-scale government contracts,"" he said. ""The fact that he gets these contracts is a hidden way to pay for his services."" When the troll factory was formed in 2013, its basic task was to flood social media with articles and comments that painted Russia under Mr. Putin as stable and comfortable compared to the chaotic, morally corrupt West. The trolls soon branched into overseas operations focused on Russian adversaries like Ukraine and the United States. Facebook, Twitter and Google have all identified the Internet Research Agency as a prime source of provocative posts on divisive American issues, including race, religion, gun laws and gay rights, particularly during the 2016 presidential election. Facebook found, for example, that the agency had posted 80,000 pieces of content that reached more than 126 million Americans. Last month, Twitter announced it had started emailing more than 677,000 people in the United States who interacted with accounts from the agency during the election. Mr. Prigozhin said he was too busy to be interviewed for this article; in fact, he has given just two extended interviews in the past decade. He issued a denial of the accusations of meddling in the 2016 election, however, after a recent investigation published by the Russian newsmagazine RBC. ""Neither Concord Company nor other structures owned by the businessman are in any way connected with the activities directed toward meddling in the U.S. election,"" RBC quoted one of Mr. Prigozhin's representatives as saying. Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin's spokesman, also denied any Kremlin connection to the Internet Research Agency. Despite Mr. Prigozhin's veil of secrecy, limited details about his personal life have emerged, mostly through the Instagram accounts of his two grown children. One picture featured his son, Pavel, walking naked on the deck of the 115-foot family yacht. Other pictures showed a private jet and a vintage powder blue Lincoln Continental, said to be Mr. Prigozhin's favorite car. His daughter Polina posted a picture of the sweeping view from his wooded compound in Gelendzhik, the resort town on the Black Sea. The compound, including a pier for the yacht, was built in an ostensibly protected forest much beloved by Mr. Putin and his cronies, according to the Anti-Corruption Foundation. The day after researchers from the foundation leafed through the Instagram accountsand took multiple screen shots, the accounts went private. The foundation launched a drone over the sprawling family compound outside St. Petersburg to photograph what it said were father-daughter mansions and various amenities, including a full basketball court and a helicopter pad. Delovoy Peterburg, an independent daily newspaper published in St. Petersburg, listed him last year as ranking 83rd among the city's 304 ruble billionaires, with 11 billion rubles, or almost $200 million. The newspaper included only property in the public record, said Irina Pankratova, an investigative reporter. If all property linked to him had been counted, she said, he would rank in the Top 5. Born in 1961 in what was then Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, Mr. Prigozhin showed adolescent promise as a champion cross-country skier that was cut short in 1981 by a prison sentence for robbery and other crimes, according to an extensive biography compiled by Meduza, an online investigative publication. When he got out after nine years, he started the hot-dog business, which led to his running a chain of convenience stores and eventually to starting several deluxe if kitschy restaurants in St. Petersburg. His patrons ""wanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka,"" Mr. Prigozhin told a magazine called Elite Society. An old rust bucket that he and his soon-to-be-jettisoned partners converted to the floating New Island Restaurant became St. Petersburg's most fashionable dining spot. Eventually, Mr. Putin himself showed up, towing world leaders. He hosted President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife in 2001 and President George W. Bush in 2002. President Putin celebrated his own birthday there in 2003. During these glittering occasions, Mr. Prigozhin made sure to hover nearby, sometimes even clearing empty plates. He was not a chef himself, despite the ""Putin's cook"" moniker. But Mr. Putin apparently admired his style. The president ""saw how I built my business starting from a kiosk,"" Mr. Prigozhin told Gorod 812, a St. Petersburg magazine. ""He saw how I was not above serving a plate."" The first significant state contracts began flowing in after Mr. Prigozhin founded Concord Catering. Starting with the St. Petersburg schools, he moved on to feeding the far more numerous Moscow schools and, finally, most of the Russian military. His trademark became lavish state banquets, including inauguration feasts for both recent presidents, Dmitri A. Medvedev and Mr. Putin. In just the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion, the Anti-Corruption Foundation reported. Lately, he has branched out into areas like recruiting contract soldiers to fight overseas and establishing a popular online news servicethat pushes a nationalist viewpoint, making him even more indispensable to Mr. Putin. A leading news website in St. Petersburg, Fontanka, which has reported extensively on Mr. Prigozhin's military contracts, recently discovered another potential source of revenue, perhaps the biggest yet. In exchange for providing soldiers to protect Syria's oil fields, companies linked to Mr. Prigozhin were awarded a percentage of the oil revenue, the website reported. Some Russian contract soldiers in Syria were back in the news this month after a Feb. 7 clash between Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, and Syrian government forces aided by Russian mercenaries. Reports about exactly what happened remain murky, but anywhere from five to 200 Russian soldiers have been reported killed. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Thursday confirmed five deaths, but has refused to confirm that it has contract soldiers fighting in Syria, fueling anger among the families of those fighting about the lack of information. It has always been difficult to find his fingerprints directly on any of these shadowy firms, said Denis Korotkov, a reporter for Fontanka. The only clues are the companies' overlapping ties, including the same managers, shared telephone numbers or IP addresses. After studying this material, Fontanka and the Anti-Corruption Foundation concluded in 2016 that significant government contracts were going to clusters of fake companies designed to circumvent federal rules on competitive bidding. State regulators also reviewed eight Defense Ministry contracts won by businesses linked to Mr. Prigozhin and issued a stern rebuke in May 2017. Russian law mandates that any contract go to the lowest bidder, but the winning tenders were only a fraction lower than the rest. Otherwise the bids were virtually identical, the Anti-Monopoly Service said, calling the 2015 bids fixed. The government announced that it would not press charges. Nobody anticipates Mr. Prigozhin appearing in a Russian court any time soon. ""We don't expect him to be punished given that he is among the president's closest friends,"" said Maksim L. Reznik, another St. Petersburg legislator demanding that he be investigated. Ivan Nechepurenko contributed reporting from St. Petersburg, Russia, and Oleg Matsnev from Moscow.  PHOTO: Yevgeny V.

What We Know About Russians Sanctioned by the United States,"[Updated March 15, 2018] ST. PETERSBURG, Russia - Operating from St. Petersburg, they churned out falsehoods on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. They promoted Donald J. Trump and denigrated Hillary Clinton. They stole the identities of American citizens. They organized political rallies in several states, and hired a Clinton impersonator for one event, in West Palm Beach, Fla. In February, 13 Russians were indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington on fraud and other charges, and on Thursday the Trump administration imposed sanctions against the operatives, freezing any assets they held in the United States and barring American businesses and individuals from doing business with them. Details of their roles in a three-year campaign to disrupt American democracy have emerged from the indictment, other records, interviews and press accounts.  The Oligarch: Yevgeny V. Prigozhin A former teenage champion cross-country skier who was later imprisoned for robbery, Mr. Prigozhin started a hot-dog business as the Soviet Union collapsed and eventually branched into convenience stores and restaurants. He received catering contracts and threw lavish state banquets. He has played host to world leaders like George W. Bush and Jacques Chirac. He developed a close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin, and has been derogatively called ""Putin's cook."" According to the indictment, he controlled two companies that financed the operations of the Internet Research Agency, a shadowy troll farm. Created in 2013, it began a so-called translator project in 2014 that targeted Americans and pursued ""information warfare against the United States."" It employed hundreds of people and, by the summer of 2016, was spending $1.2 million a month. In the past five years, Mr. Prigozhin has received government contracts worth $3.1 billion. Lately, he has branched out into areas like recruiting contract soldiers to fight overseas and establishing a popular online news service that pushes a nationalist viewpoint, making him even more indispensable to Mr. Putin. Mr. Prigozhin, 56, declined several interview requests from The New York Times in recent months. One sign of his connection to the trolls, according to the indictment: In what appeared to be something of an inside joke, people working for the Internet Research Agency paid an American to hold a sign outside the White House -- ""Happy 55th Birthday, Dear Boss"" -- to celebrate Mr. Prigozhin's birthday (June 1) in 2016. The C.E.O.: Mikhail I. Bystrov Mr. Bystrov is a retired St. Petersburg police colonel who, according to the indictment, joined the company in February 2014 and became its highest-ranking official. He also led shell entities that were used to conceal its activities, including one called Glavset, a so-called database and information company. It shared an address -- 55 Savushkina Street -- with the Internet Research Agency. (The troll farm has since moved to Optikov Street, according to the local press.) The troll farm soon drew notice in Russia: news outlets reported that it employed 250 people in 12-hour shifts to provide a round-the-clock flow of pro-Kremlin posts and comments, praising Mr. Putin and excoriating President Barack Obama and President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Monthly salaries ranged from $1,100 for a junior analyst to $1,400 for a blogger to $4,200 a month for senior management. Mr. Bystrov, who is believed to be 59, has avoided reporters and declined interview requests. The Executive Director: Mikhail L. Burchik A young tech entrepreneur, Mr. Burchik, 31, joined the company in October 2013 and became its executive director, the No. 2 official, by March 2014, according to the indictment. According to online records, he registered a company in 2009 called Add1.ru that was behind a 2014 hoax. In that hoax, a young woman in aviator sunglasses calling herself Zoe Foreman spent hours spamming politicians and journalists about a horrific -- and fictitious -- chemical plant explosion in Louisiana. ""I have heard of it, but I don't work in this organization,"" he told the journalist Adrian Chen, who wrote about the troll farm in 2015 for The New York Times Magazine. He said he had bought and sold many internet domains and didn't remember them all. Mr. Burchik also won government contracts to publish local municipal newspapers, organize lectures and do some video reports. Throughout the troll farm's operations to interfere in American politics, including the election, ""Burchik was a manager involved in operational planning, infrastructure and personnel,"" according to the indictment. The business news website RBC reported on Friday that Mr. Burchik claimed not to know English well enough to understand what he had been accused of. ""If a few hundred million Americans are so worried about the activities of a regular Russian small-business man from the IT-sphere doing website development, then it seems the situation in the country is completely grave,"" he said. Mr. Burchik told Komsomolskaya Pravda, a Russian tabloid, that he was not concerned about being detained while traveling abroad. ""I love my country. In Russia there are many beautiful places where you can go,"" he said. Mr. Burchik has worked on several small government projects in St. Petersburg. In 2015 he was awarded a contract worth about $20,000 to develop and publish a newspaper called Dvortsovy Ukrug, for the administration of one of St. Petersburg's municipal districts, according to government documents. That same year, another municipal district government awarded him a similar contract to prepare a film about its activities. And in 2012, he won a $4,500 contract for organizing a program for promoting ""tolerance and prevention of drug addiction"" for local schools. The Travelers: Anna V. Bogacheva and Aleksandra Y. Krylova Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova obtained visas to visit the United States in 2014 ""under false pretenses for the purposes of collecting intelligence to inform the organization's operatives,"" according to the indictment. They are said to have embarked on what amounted to a three-week reconnaissance tour, visiting California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Texas. Along the way, they bought SIM cards, cameras and drop phones and discussed ""evacuation scenarios"" and other security measures. According to the indictment, Ms. Bogacheva oversaw the data analysis group for the ""translator project."" A woman with the same name was listed in 2013 on the website of ITMO, a prestigious science university in St. Petersburg, as a doctoral candidate. She worked there from 2011 to 2014, as an engineer in the eScience Research Institute, according to a university spokeswoman. Many of the school's graduates have gone on to work for the Russian government or for large tech companies. Ms. Bogacheva also owns IT Debugger, a company that says it has worked with ""difficult clients."" Ms. Krylova became the No. 3 person at the troll farm, according to the indictment. According to what appears to be her LinkedIn profile, she is a graduate of the Moscow State University of Printing Arts, where she studied with the faculty of advertising and public relations. She was the head of the Federal News Agency, which is believed to be Mr. Prigozhin's flagship media outlet. The agency is known for its exclusive coverage of Russian private armies on Syria's front line. The I.T. Expert: Sergey P. Polozov Mr. Polozov ran the troll farm's I.T. department and oversaw the purchase of space on computer servers inside the United States to set up virtual private networks that masked the agency's Russian location, according to the indictment. After a co-conspirator traveled to Atlanta in November 2014, he gave Mr. Polozov a summary of his trip and expenses. According to business records and Mr. Polozov's page on the Russian social network Vkontakte, Mr. Polozov runs a software company called Morkov, which was registered in 2013, and began to recruit web developers and programmers in early 2014. ""In need of people with knowledge of website promotion for full-time work,"" he wrote in a Vkontakte post on May 28, 2014. ""If interested, send me a personal message. You can send your résumé immediately."" On Vkontakte, he shared political jokes at the expense of Russia's rivals and neighbors. One post he shared in June 2015 quoted the Chechen writer German Sadulaev: The 'Translators': Maria A. Bovda and Robert S. Bovda Not much is known about the Bovdas, including their relationship. According to the indictment, she was the head, and he the deputy head, of the ""translator project,"" the troll farm's campaign to target Americans with messages on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, starting in April 2014. The project employed hundreds of people and, by the summer of 2016, was spending $1.2 million a month. It hid activities through a web of shell companies. According to the indictment, Ms. Bovda and Mr. Bovda both worked for the troll farm for about a year, from November 2013 to October 2014. The America Specialist: Dzheykhun N. O. Aslanov According to the indictment, Mr. Aslanov oversaw many of the operations targeting the United States election. An investigation by RBC, a newsmagazine, found that Mr. Aslanov was in charge of the ""American department"" of the troll farm. It reported that Mr. Aslanov arrived in St. Petersburg in 2000 from his hometown Ust-Kut, in the Irkutsk region. His Vkontakte profile says he graduated from the Russian State Hydrometeorological University in St. Petersburg in 2012, and a university page indicates that he studied economics and wildlife management. The RBC report says that he spent several months in the United States in 2009, visiting New York and Boston. His work at the troll farm included registering legal entities in the names of his employees. His name appears in public records as general director of Azimut -- which, according to the indictment, was used to funnel money to the troll farm -- and of the Reputation Management Center. According to its website, the Reputation Management Center first determines what kind of reputation a client has online through media monitoring, and then creates bots that improve its image through positive posts, ""drowns negative reviews in a sea of favorable information about the company"" and ""creates hype"" around it. The Others: Irina V. Kaverzina, Vadim V. Podkopaev, Gleb I. Vasilchenko, Vladimir Venkov Ms. Kaverzina grew worried after Facebook revealed last September that it was cooperating with the authorities to look into Russian advertising on the platform. ""We had a slight crisis here at work: the F.B.I. busted our activity (not a joke),"" she wrote to a relative, according to the indictment. ""So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues,"" she added. ""I created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people."" Mr. Podkopaev was an analyst for the ""translator project."" He conducted research on the United States and drafted social media messages for the organization, according to the indictment. Mr. Vasilchenko posted to, monitored and updated social media accounts while posing as Americans or as American grass-roots organizations. He led two subgroups focused on political interference in the United States, including the election. On Vkontakte, he shared a meme in October 2016 that imagined a drinking game in which players took a shot every time Mr. Trump talked about building a wall along the Mexican-United States border or making America great again, told voters to believe him, or complained about being treated unfairly; and every time Mrs. Clinton coughed, sipped water, laughed awkwardly, or mentioned her daughter or President Barack Obama. Mr. Venkov inhabited multiple social media personas, according to the indictment. Someone with that name belongs to a Facebook group of social media marketing professionals and posted a photo last May of himself wearing a Republican elephant pin.

"Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.","Just days after Google, Facebook and Apple purged videos and podcasts from the right-wing conspiracy site Infowars from their sites, the Infowars app has become one of the hottest in the country. On Wednesday, Infowars was the No. 1 overall ""trending"" app on the Google Play store, a metric that reflects its sudden momentum. Among news apps, Infowars was No. 3 on Apple and No. 5 on Google, above all mainstream news organizations. And the app stood at No. 66 overall on Google, excluding game apps, while on Apple it reached No. 49, above popular apps like LinkedIn, Google Docs and eBay. The Infowars app, which includes news articles and the shows of the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, had likely been downloaded a few hundred to a few thousand times a day on average after its introduction last month, said Randy Nelson, head of mobile insights at Sensor Tower, which tracks app data. Now, it is likely getting 30,000 to 40,000 downloads a day, Mr. Nelson estimated based on its ranking.  The surge suggests the tech industry's recent action against Infowars has drawn new interest to the fringe outlet and the conspiracy theories it peddles. ""This is such a niche app with niche content, that for it to make that sort of jump means it has become very interesting to a much broader audience,"" said Jonathan Kay, a co-founder of Apptopia, an app analytics firm. ""Essentially, it's gone from being niche to being mainstream."" Still, the action by the tech companies likely reduced the overall audience for Infowars because it had relied so much on viewers fromApple, Faceook and YouTube, a unit of Google. That the Infowars app has also thrived on Apple's and Google's app stores just days after the companies removed its content from other parts of their sites highlights the confusing nature of the tech companies' rules and their enforcement of them. Apple banned five of the six Infowars podcasts from its popular podcasts service on Sunday, saying it ""does not tolerate hate speech."" Yet the Infowars app that Apple has deemed acceptable for its app store after a review is essentially a portal to some of the same podcasts that Apple removed. The Infowars app streams live and rebroadcasts the most recent episodes of three shows, ""The Alex Jones Show,"" ""War Room with Owen Shroyer,"" and ""Real News with David Knight."" Apple removed The Alex Jones Show and War Room from its podcast service; it left Real News. An Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company works to curate its app store. ""We strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store, as long as the apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and follow our clear guidelines, ensuring the App Store is a safe marketplace for all,"" she said. ""We continue to monitor apps for violations of our guidelines."" Google said it deleted Mr. Jones's channel from its YouTube site because he flouted a previous punishment -- not necessarily for the content he posted. Google has since left up Mr. Jones's podcast and his Infowars app. Google said it has different policies for YouTube and its Play Store. A Google spokesman added in an email, ""If an app violates our policies, we take action."" From July 12 through Sunday, the Infowars app ranked on average as the 23rd most popular news app on Apple and 32nd on Google, according to Apptopia. After Sunday, the app's rank among news apps on Apple jumped to 7th on Monday, 4th on Tuesday and 3rd on Wednesday, Apptopia said. The rankings were slightly lower on Google for those days. Researchers from Apptopia and Sensor Tower said Apple and Google use a number of signals to determine rankings, including the velocity of downloads and total downloads, but they are secretive about the exact formula. Mr. Jones has achieved infamy and financial success for spreading lies, such as many mass shootings are government hoaxes and Democrats run a global child-sex ring. Many of his most outlandish claims are made during his show, which runs live for four hours each weekday and is streamed and rebroadcast across the internet. YouTube, Facebook, Spotify and Apple's podcasts service were all important distribution points for the show, but Mr. Jones and his Infowars colleagues this week have urged viewers to find the show on Infowars' website and app. He and Infowars did not respond to requests for comment. The Infowars app has three main tabs: one for the shows, one for news articles and a third for merchandise. (There is also a settings tab and a ""you"" tab for saved articles.) On the tab that led to the outlet's news articles, a sampling of the app's stories on Wednesday showed a mix of headlines that ranged from highly partisan (""Democrats Blame Russians For Ohio Loss, Turn On The Green Party!"") to sensationalist (""Shock: FDA Acquiring 'Fresh' Aborted Baby Parts to Make 'Humanized Mice'"") to humdrum (""Calorie Counting Menus Help Diners Lose One Pound Over Three Years -- Study""). Many of the stories in the app also focused on Silicon Valley's removal of Infowars content. Most were aggregated from other news sources, including mainstream outlets like CNBC and Reuters and right-wing sites The Daily Caller and Breitbart. The news category ""Infowars Exclusives"" on the app included no stories. The merchandise tab on the app pushes people to purchase Infowars goods, such as T-shirts, diet supplements and male-vitality pills. One ad on the app showed a photo of Mr. Jones with ""censored"" tape over his mouth and said: ""Fight the bullies, save the internet, save Infowars super special. Shop now!"" The app has earned a nearly perfect rating on Apple after 5,500 reviews. ""Good to have IW on the go, able to keep up with what the Democrat globalist Luciferian communist are up to at all times,"" one recent review said. Follow Jack Nicas on Twitter: @jacknicas.

Facebook Banned Infowars. Now What?; The Shift,"Late on Sunday, after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home, Mark Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid. For weeks, the Facebook chief executive and his colleagues had debated what to do about Infowars, the notorious far-right news site, and Alex Jones, Infowars' choleric founder, who became famous for his spittle-flecked rants and far-fetched conspiracies, including the idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was an elaborate hoax promoted by gun-control supporters. Mr. Jones is just one Facebook user out of 2.2 billion, but he had become symbolic of tech platforms' inconsistency and reluctance to engage in a misinformation war. The pressure on Facebook to do something about him had intensified after executives gave a series of vague and confusing answers to lawmakers and reporters about the company's policies. Misinformation was allowed to stay on the platform, they said, but hate speech wasn't. So users dug up and reported old Infowars posts, asking for their removal on the grounds that they glorified violence and contained dehumanizing language against Muslims, immigrants, and transgender people.  These posts clearly violated Facebook's hate speech rules. And in a normal situation, a low-level content moderator might have reviewed them, found that they qualified, and taken them down. But Mr. Jones was no typical internet crank. He has millions of followers, a popular video show, and the ear of President Trump -- who once told the provocateur that his reputation was ""amazing."" Banning such a prominent activist would lead to political blowback, no matter how justified the action was. The situation was volatile enough that Mr. Zuckerberg got personally engaged, according to two people involved in Facebook's handling of the accounts. He discussed Infowars at length with other executives, and mused privately about whether Mr. Jones -- who once called Mr. Zuckerberg a ""genetic-engineered psychopath"" in a video -- was purposefully trying to get kicked off the platform to gain attention, they said. Mr. Zuckerberg, an engineer by training and temperament, has always preferred narrow process decisions to broad, subjective judgments. His evaluation of Infowars took the form of a series of technical policy questions. They included whether the mass-reporting of Infowars posts constituted coordinated ""brigading,"" a tactic common in online harassment campaigns. Executives also debated whether Mr. Jones should receive a ""strike"" for each post containing hate speech (which would lead to removing his pages as well as the individual posts) or a single, collective strike (which would remove the posts, but leave his pages up). Late Sunday, Apple -- which has often tried to stake out moral high ground on contentious debates -- removed Infowars podcasts from iTunes. After seeing the news, Mr. Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision: the strikes against Infowars and Mr. Jones would count individually, and the pages would come down. The announcement arrived at 3 a.m. Pacific time. In the days that followed, other platforms -- YouTube, Pinterest, MailChimp, and more -- said they, too, were banning Infowars. The notable exception was Twitter, which decided not to ban the site or Mr. Jones. The company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted a veiled shot at the way his rivals handled the situation. ""We're going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,"" he said. Now, cut off from most of his audience, Mr. Jones will have to chart a new course. He has already stepped enthusiastically into a role as a free-speech martyr. (After the ban took effect, Infowars slapped a ""censored"" label on its videos and launched a ""forbidden information"" marketing campaign.) And conservatives -- and even some free-speech advocates on the left -- worried that social media companies may be entering a new, censorious era. Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas, paraphrased the famous Martin Niemöller poem about German accommodation of Nazism: ""First, they came for Alex Jones."" Social media executives have a history of going to great lengths to assuage fears of anti-conservative bias, and this week was no exception. On Thursday, Richard Allan, a Facebook vice president of policy, published a blog post about the company's commitment to free speech. With the exception of violent threats and hate speech, he wrote, ""we lean toward free expression. It's core to both who we are and why we exist."" Mr. Dorsey also appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show, where he gave reassurances that Twitter does not discriminate against conservatives. Slippery-slope fears about mass censorship by social media platforms are probably overblown. For starters, Infowars presented an unusual case because of its size, the extreme nature of its content and the ferocity of Mr. Jones's critics. Mr. Zuckerberg does not have time to adjudicate every dispute over hate speech on Facebook, nor does he want to. In fact, taking action against Infowars could allow social media giants to avoid future conflicts over extreme content by setting a new, hard-to-beat standard for unacceptable toxicity. (""Yes, Jewhater McRacist is bad,"" they may say, ""but he's no Alex Jones."") Many other internet conspiracists have learned how to tiptoe to the edge of platforms' rules without breaking them -- speaking in code about Pizzagate, for example, or saying things like ""I'm not saying he's a crisis actor, but if he were ..."" One lesson Mr. Zuckerberg has taken from the Infowars saga, said the people involved in the handling of Mr. Jones's Facebook accounts, is that the social network's policies are overly complex and need to be simplified. Privately, company officials have also downplayed the Infowars bans, saying they don't represent a watershed moment in the online free speech debate, but are rather a matter of how to enforce Facebook's existing policies. This is a convenient narrative, of course, from a company that would rather haggle over terms of service than discuss the power and governance of its platform. There are legitimate questions, still unanswered, about what to do about the huge, unaccountable corporations that control large pieces of our modern communications infrastructure. Both fans and critics of Infowars can probably agree that a system in which one executive can decide to shut off a news organization's access to a large portion of its audience is hardly ideal. There are also valid questions about why Infowars got so popular in the first place, and whether attention-maximizing platforms like Facebook and YouTube are designed in ways so that people like Mr. Jones are incentivized to push the boundaries of acceptable speech. After all, these platforms didn't just host Infowars content for those who were seeking it -- they actively promoted it to millions of people for years, through algorithmic feeds and recommendation engines that decide which videos to show you next. Could these platforms be redesigned so that the next Alex Jones never gets that kind of boost, and remains on the ideological fringes? These questions will have to wait. For now, tech leaders seem satisfied to have dealt with their Infowars problems, at least temporarily. They will return to their defensive crouch, hiding their power behind policies, making small changes under pressure, and hoping that nobody notices the size of their footprints.

Conspiracy Theories Made Alex Jones Very Rich. They May Bring Him Down.,"AUSTIN -- More than ever before in his two-decade career built on baseless conspiracy theories, angry nativist rants and end-of-days fearmongering, Alex Jones is being called to account. In a Texas courthouse, his lawyers are battling defamation claims resulting from one of his most infamous acts: spreading false reports that the Sandy Hook massacre of 20 first graders and six adults was an elaborate hoax. In Silicon Valley, Facebook, YouTube and, as of Thursday, Twitter, under pressure to better curb hate speech and incendiary misinformation, have largely cut him off. On Friday, Apple removed the Infowars appfrom its App Store, eliminating one of the final avenues for Mr. Jones to reach a mainstream audience. Mr. Jones's latest stunt -- turning up on Capitol Hill this week to call attention to his claim that he is being unfairly silenced on ideological grounds -- led to an embarrassing rebuff by a conservative Republican senator.  The big question for him now is whether his bluster -- and the implicit support he has received from President Trump, who has channeled bogus or misleading claims promoted by Mr. Jones and echoed his complaints of anticonservatism by technology companies -- will be sufficient to see him past his current peril. He is facing a legal, public opinion and social media reckoning that poses the most serious threat yet not just to his ability to inject the outlandish into the mainstream, but also to the lucrative business he has built. Mr. Jones likes to portray his digital channel, Infowars, as a media outlet, and he is quick to wrap himself in the First Amendment. But in business terms, it is more accurate to describe Infowars as an online store that uses Mr. Jones's commentary to move merchandise. Its revenue comes primarily from the sale of a grab-bag of health-enhancement and survivalist products that Mr. Jones hawks constantly. A close look at his career shows that he has been as much a canny if unconventional entrepreneur as an ideological agitator. He has adapted to -- and profited from -- changes in both the political climate and the media business even as he has tested, and regularly crossed, the boundaries of acceptable public discourse. For more than two decades, Mr. Jones, who is 44, has built a substantial following appealing to an angry, largely white, majority male audience that can choose simply to be entertained or to internalize his rendering of their worst fears: that the government and other big institutions are out to get them, that some form of apocalypse is frighteningly close and that they must become more virile, and better-armed, to survive. ""I'm not a business guy, I'm a revolutionary,"" he said in an interview in August. If it is a revolution, it is one that he has skillfully monetized. His fundamental insight was that his audience is also a nearly captive market for the variety of goods he peddles via Infowars' website and his syndicated radio show -- products intended to assuage the same fears he stokes. Infowars and its affiliated companies are private and do not have to report financial results publicly. But by 2014, according to testimony Mr. Jones gave in a court case, his operations were bringing in more than $20 million a year in revenue. Records viewed by The New York Times show that most of his revenue that year came from the sale of products like supplements such as the Super Male Vitality, which purports to boost testosterone, or Brain Force Plus, which promises to ""supercharge"" cognitive functions. Court records in a divorce case show that Mr. Jones's businesses netted more than $5 million in 2014. Court proceedings show that he and his then-wife, Kelly Jones, embarked on plans to build a swimming pool complex around that time featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace. Mr. Jones bought four Rolex watches in one day in 2014, and spent $40,000 on a saltwater aquarium; the couple's assets at the time included a $70,000 grand piano, $50,000 in firearms and $752,000 in silver, gold and precious metals, in a safe deposit box, court documents say. People who have worked with him or studied his business said his revenues had probably continued to grow in recent years. But his problems are mounting. At least five defamation suits against Mr. Jones, including three filed by Sandy Hook families, are moving forward. Last month, a Texas judge ordered Mr. Jones and officers in his web of limited-liability companies to provide depositions to lawyers for the parent of a Sandy Hook victim in coming weeks, testimony that could shed new light on Mr. Jones's operation. He is also facing complaints of workplace discrimination from two ex-employees, a fraud and product liability case and a nasty court battle with Ms. Jones, now his ex-wife. She says that the couple have spent a combined $4 million on their four-year battle over custody of their three children and disputes over the business. At the same time, the crackdown on Mr. Jones in August by the social media giants -- he has been largely banned by Facebook, YouTube, Apple, Spotify and even Pinterest -- poses a severe test by limiting his access to his audience. The early evidence is that the bans have substantially reduced his reach -- and that was before a double blow this week when Twitter imposed a permanent ban on his account and the account for Infowars and Apple removed the Infowars app from its store. Apple had already removed Mr. Jones's show from its podcast service on Aug. 5. On Friday, an Apple spokeswoman said the app was removed under company policies that prohibit apps from including content that is ""offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste."" Mr. Jones will be forced to rely even more on his Infowars site and his radio show, which is heard on more than 100 stations nationwide. True to form, Mr. Jones is using the challenge to move more product. For several days in August, after the ban by the social media companies, his online Infowars Store offered deep discounts under an all-caps banner that read, ""FIGHT THE BULLIES, SAVE THE INTERNET, SAVE INFOWARS."" The best-selling Survival Shield X-2 nascent iodine drops were discounted 40 percent, to $23.95, while Alpha Power, a product marketed as boosting testosterone and vitality to ""push back in the fight against the globalist agenda,"" was half off, at $34.95. ""The enemy wants to cut off our funding to destroy us,"" Mr. Jones said on his broadcast, concluding a segment about being banned by the social media companies with a sales pitch for another product. ""If you don't fund us, we'll be shut down."" Mr. Jones operates from behind bulletproof glass at an Austin industrial park, in a dimly lit hive of studios and cluttered, open-plan desks. He invited a New York Times reporter there for an interview on two conditions: that the location of his headquarters not be specified and that he would record audio of the interview. There are no identifying signs outside. Inside, there are split-screen security camera monitors throughout, which Mr. Jones checks as he passes by. There are guns in the building for protection, he said. He added that armed snipers are positioned on the roof, then in a phone call the next day said that he had made that up. He wouldn't say how many employees he has, but in 2017 court testimony he said he employed 75 people, plus 10 contractors. Mr. Jones talked for nearly three hours, bouncing around the room, raising his voice, feigning menace, replaying themes and entire riffs from his show. ""I am here giving you the unfiltered truth of my soul,"" he said. He insisted that his troubles are proof that a globalist, leftist cabal aims to silence him. He claimed advance knowledge that technology companies, Chinese communists, Democrats and the mainstream media would ""try to use me as a 2018, 2020 campaign issue -- to hurt Trump, to misrepresent what I've said, to project it on Trump, and to go after the First Amendment and legitimize the censorship of all the Republican congresspeople."" It was classic Alex Jones: a nonstop mix of flimsy fact, grievance, paranoia, ideology, combativeness and solipsism. Mr. Jones often exhorts his listeners to ""investigate"" the hoaxes and theories he advances, pleas that may have inspired criminal acts by some of his followers. In 2000, Mr. Jones and his cameraman, Mike Hanson, infiltrated Bohemian Grove, an annual camping retreat for global business and political leaders near Monte Rio, Calif. The pair shot dim video of a pyrotechnic spectacle that Mr. Jones wrongly claimed was an ""occult ritual."" Early in 2002, a heavily armed man entered the grounds and set a fire. Citing Mr. Jones's reports, he said he was convinced that child abuse and human sacrifices were taking place at the retreat. A similar scenario unfolded more than a decade later, when during the 2016 campaign Mr. Jones helped spread the ""Pizzagate"" hoax, that Hillary Clinton and Democratic operatives were running a child sex ring from a pizzeria in Washington, D.C. An Infowars listener, Edgar Maddison Welch, entered the pizzeria in late 2016 armed with a military-style rifle to investigate and rescue children he believed were being held captive, firing the gun inside the restaurant as patrons fled. He is serving a four-year jail term. Mr. Jones for years spread the false claim that the Sandy Hook shooting was a fraud, and that the victims' relatives were actors in a hoax planned by government ""gun grabbers."" In 2015, after Leonard Pozner, whose son Noah died at Sandy Hook, got one of Mr. Jones's Sandy Hook hoax broadcasts removed from YouTube, Mr. Jones showed viewers Mr. Pozner's personal information, and maps to addresses associated with his family, according to court documents. Lucy Richards, an avowed Infowars listener, subsequently went to prison for issuing repeated death threats against Mr. Pozner. The Pozner family lives in hiding, and is suing Mr. Jones for defamation. On Father's Day 2017, Mr. Jones went on Infowars in a brief broadcast to offer the Sandy Hook parents ""my sincere condolences"" for the loss of their children in ""the horrible tragedy"" in Newtown, Conn. He said he wanted to ""open a dialogue"" with the families because it was essential for the nation to come together rather than ""letting the MSM misrepresent things,"" referring to the mainstream media. In the Times interview, Mr. Jones suggested that blame for the pain of the Sandy Hook families rests not with him but with the media and inconsistencies in coverage of the shooting. ""I was covering a giant phenomenon of people not believing media anymore because they've been caught in governments' lying so much,"" he said. Alex Jones grew up in a conservative, upper-middle-class family in the Dallas suburb of Rockwall, the son of a dentist. There was nothing particularly unusual about him during those days, except a conspiratorial nature and, from high school on, as he put it in court testimony, a commitment to ""seeking out ways to get on air."" Mr. Jones was inspired, he has said, by ""None Dare Call It Conspiracy,"" a 1971 book by Gary Allen that advanced the conservative theory that domestic decision making is not guided by elected officials, but international bankers and politicians. Mr. Allen also sold similarly-themed recordings by mail order. While a community college student in Austin, Mr. Jones landed a show on Austin community access cable hawking outlandish conspiracy theories. When Kelly Jones met him in Austin in the late 1990s, Mr. Jones was wearing a bumblebee costume in the Texas heat, doing promotional stunts for a local radio station. He dropped out of community college, and with money from his father, produced ""documentary"" videos, starring himself, about 9/11 being an inside job, ""police state"" abuses and the ""new world order"" he claimed was being engineered by the Bilderberg Group, an annual gathering of prominent financiers, economists and political leaders. He bought airtime on shortwave radio, and broadcast his theories out of an unused nursery in his house with ""choo-choo"" train wallpaper, Ms. Jones said in an interview. To the extent that his early shows were informed by coherent political thought, he was a libertarian, suspicious of Republicans and Democrats alike; Ron Paul, the three-time presidential candidate and libertarian icon, was an occasional guest. But with the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, Mr. Jones discovered that nasty partisanship was a moneymaker. In court in 2014, he said, ""We have had company meetings in the last two years preparing for the eventuality of a Republican takeover,"" which he considered a threat to his business, because when attacking Democrats in power, conservatives could ""be more provocative, more interesting and so it gets more viewers."" Mr. Trump, who entered electoral politics spreading the false assertion that Mr. Obama might not have been born in the United States, was a welcome surprise for Mr. Jones. He found in Mr. Trump a kindred anti-intellectual with an outsider's perspective and a willingness to entertain conspiracy theories and disseminate fact-challenged assertions. The two men were connected by Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump who is a paid host on Infowars. In December 2015 Mr. Stone arranged for Mr. Trump to do a 30-minute interview with Mr. Jones. The themes promoted by Mr. Jones sometimes make their way through the media ecosystem and win the attention of Mr. Trump, like a bogus assertion about the slaughter of white farmers in South Africa that the president invoked last month. In the wake of steps by the social media companies to ban Mr. Jones, the president has also repeatedly voiced concerns nearly identical to those expressed by Mr. Jones about efforts by technology companies to silence voices from the right. On Infowars last month, Mr. Jones suggested that he is coordinating his message with Mr. Trump. ""We advise the president,"" Mr. Jones said. ""We've got all the documents. We've got the proof. Other people are scared to tell him what's going on."" Two White House officials said they were not aware of any recent contacts between Mr. Jones and the president. Infowars operates through a series of interlocking companies, none of which publicly reports its results. But a rough picture of the operation's scale can be gleaned from the documents detailing its financial condition in 2014. One entity -- created to house the supplements business -- generated sales of $15.6 million and net income of $5 million from October 2013 through September 2014, according to an unaudited profit and loss statement viewed by The Times. During the same period, another entity, possibly recording overlapping revenues, listed net income of $2.9 million and sales of $14.3 million, with merchandise sales accounting for $10 million, advertising for nearly $2 million and $53,350.66 in donations, according to an unaudited company statement. Since then, current and former business associates said, the Infowars empire has continued to thrive. The heart of the business is sales of lightly regulated nutritional supplements that purport to improve health or virility or both. ""Supplements are popular,"" Mr. Jones said in the interview. ""They're good. They're a fast-growing market. I use it to fund the operation. Other revolutionaries rob banks and kidnap people, O.K.? I don't do that."" By late 2012, Mr. Jones decided to create a supplement line of his own, a move that would allow him to reap more of the profits. The next summer, he recruited his father, David R. Jones, to leave his dental practice and help manage the family business, negotiating a deal for Dr. Jones to be paid what he was making previously -- $300,000 to $500,000 a year -- plus an additional bonus of 20 percent of the profits from the entities he created. When Dr. Jones came on board, the business was in disarray. In court testimony, he said he found a series of ""green notebooks stuck in a cabinet"" outlining a number of entities that had been established over the years. Dr. Jones set about evaluating the business, getting the corporate entities sorted out, and creating opportunities to expand the supplement business. The company struck deals with a number of manufacturers, slapping its Infowars Life label on a range of products. A 2014 agreement with one of its most prominent suppliers, Global Healing Center, shows that the manufacturer made at least eight products for the brand, including ""Super Male Vitality"" a private label of Global Health's Androtrex, purchased wholesale for $14.99 and advertised on the Infowars Store for $69.95. Kelly Jones compared Mr. Jones's marketing to that of a televangelist, preaching to his faithful, selling cures and soliciting donations. His customers buy in -- and then they buy. For every threat he raises, there is a solution for sale. Matt Redhawk is the founder of My Patriot Supply. The company sells water filtration systems, emergency survival food and other products on Infowars targeting consumers in the preparedness movement, ""from someone who is preparing for a job loss or a weekend without power, up to the full blown Armageddon,"" Mr. Redhawk said in an interview. ""Controversy sells. You can't ignore the fact that there is a method there,"" he said. ""Preppers"" are an important market segment for Infowars, and ads on its website bring better response than on other conservative media shows, said Chad Cooper, who owns Infidel Body Armor, based in San Tan Valley, Ariz. He spent about $5,000 a month on Infowars advertising for his civilian body armor line until recently, when he suspended his advertising because Infowars started selling ads to too many of his competitors. While he does not take in Mr. Jones's show -- ""he's a nutter,"" he says -- ""I've spent quite a bit of time on the phone with these Alex Jones people who order from me,"" and described them. ""They're nonbelievers in what the media tells them. They think there's more to the story,"" he said. ""They think there's aliens, and the government knows about that and they're not telling them. They're all religious, and they're very concerned about the direction the government is going."" ""He's really good at scaring people,"" Mr. Cooper said of Mr. Jones. ""He gives them that sense of urgency -- they need to hurry up and do something. Now."" Last February, two former employees came forward with allegations that they faced discrimination at Infowars. In interviews, they depicted Mr. Jones as the leader of a racially charged workplace. Robert A. Jacobson, 43, started working with Mr. Jones in 2004 as a video editor, and said that over the years he was taunted for being Jewish. He said that the harassment escalated after August 2015 when Mr. Jones interviewed David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard. Ashley L. Beckford, who was hired as a production assistant in June 2016, said that she was called racial slurs, paid less because of the color of her skin and forced to fend off unwanted sexual advances, including from Mr. Jones. Ms. Beckford, 32, said that an employee once called her a ""coon,"" that she was shown swastikas in the office, that Mr. Jones once grabbed her buttocks, and that staff members repeatedly used the term ""fat black bitch"" around her. On his show, Mr. Jones denied the allegations and called both former employees liars. Mr. Jones's image and credibility as a provocateur are closely linked to his credibility as a marketer of supplements and other products. Consequently, sales of the fluoride-free toothpaste he promotes might decline if he recants his bogus claim that fluoridated water causes cancer and stunts the brains of children. Demand for Infowars-branded gun components that can be purchased without a firearms permit might fall if he backs off his predictions of a looming civil war. Mr. Jones had cited a desire to express contrition to the Sandy Hook parents as a reason for agreeing to be interviewed. But many times during the interview, his efforts at apology morphed into new theories. ""The idea they're pushing is that you can't ever question anything,"" he said, ""they"" referring to anyone who criticizes his twisting of the truth. ""I don't think you can establish that anything is 100 percent fact."" Jack Nicas and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting. Related Articles  "
America's Election Grid Remains a Patchwork of Vulnerabilities,"County officials in Maryland miscalculated how many ballots they would need on Election Day -- and quickly ran out in more than a dozen precincts. In New York City, voters were given a two-sheet ballot that jammed machines and caused delays and long lines. And in Georgia, some voters failed to provide details like a birth year, leading officials to reject hundreds of absentee ballots for ""insufficient oath information"" before federal judges intervened. Nearly two decades after voting problems in a handful of Florida counties paralyzed the nation, America's election grid this month remained a crazy patchwork of inconveniences, confusion and errors, both human-made and mechanical. The lumbering system, combined with claims of voter suppression and skewed maps from redistricting, once again tested confidence in the integrity of the vote. As in 2000, no evidence emerged of widespread fraud or political interference. But just finding enough qualified poll workers to make Election Day happen was once again a challenge, as voters navigated more than 100,000 polling places, staffed by 900,000 mostly volunteer workers and administered by some 10,000 local jurisdictions. (After the 2016 election, nearly two-thirds of local elections officials nationwide reported difficulties in recruiting workers.)  The unevenness of the system across the country -- in 22 states, elections at the local level were overseen by just one person -- made it a political process open to accusations of manipulation. In some states, including New Jersey, South Carolina and Louisiana, officials depended on electronic voting machines that have no paper backups in case of a contested outcome. In Georgia, 16-year-old machines led to the improbable scene of Brian Kemp -- the secretary of state overseeing elections and the Republican candidate for governor -- being briefly thwarted in his attempt to cast a ballot for himself. The computer system, running on Windows 2000 software, returned an error. Broader worries about the handling of provisional ballots in Georgia and the security of a computer system led a federal judge to delay certification of the state's results. On Friday, the Democrat Stacey Abrams ended her bid for governor in the race against Mr. Kemp, while denouncing what she called ""systemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment and incompetence."" Legal actions were initiated in Florida, where close margins forced recounts in the races for Senate and governor, and questions arose about whether eligible mail-in ballots were improperly rejected. Election officials were to conclude manual recounts in the Senate race by Sunday. But on Saturday evening, with a manual recount not conducted in the contest for governor, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee, conceded to Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate. Elsewhere, accusations of voter suppression flared. Civil rights lawyers sued Pennsylvania, claiming its requirement that absentee ballots be received on the Friday before Election Day cost thousands of people a chance to vote. In Kansas, where a court recently struck down a law requiring proof of citizenship for new voters, many mistakenly believed they still could not register without a birth certificate, according to Democratic voting organizers. ""I think the law did what it was intended to do,"" said Johnny Dunlap, the Democratic Party chairman in Kansas's Ford County, ""and that was to discourage people from voting."" With the nation polarized along party lines and many contests fiercely fought, tight races threw a harsh light on weaknesses in the system, fueling partisan accusations and legal challenges. In New Mexico, a Republican congressional candidate, Yvette Herrell, sought to have the police seize 8,000 absentee ballots but cited no evidence of suspected fraud. A judge in Florida rejected efforts by the Republican Senate candidate, Gov. Rick Scott, to impound voting machines, and the authorities declined to investigate claims of fraud, saying they had no evidence of it. And in Arizona, as the counting of mail-in ballots delivered a victory for the Democratic Senate candidate, Kyrsten Sinema, the state Republican Party leader lashed out at the elections official in Maricopa County, a Democrat, declaring, ""Such a man cannot be trusted to administer elections."" President Trump fanned the flames of distrust with tweets questioning votes in favor of Democrats in several states. As the counting of ballots continued in Arizona, Mr. Trump tweeted: ""Just out -- in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption -- Call for a new Election?"" Elections experts said that the process, while hobbled by vulnerabilities, was actually more orderly than one might glean from the partisan posturing, and that it had certainly improved since the 2000 presidential vote. Nationwide, voting equipment was largely more reliable, registration lists more accurate and election administrators better trained, they said. Still, said Marc Racicot, a former governor of Montana who once led the Republican National Committee, no election is perfect because there ""is a certain margin of humanity to be expected that doesn't amount to fraud."" Well-intentioned election officials, he said, should be permitted to do their jobs without fear of attacks. ""I think it's really important for the people of individual states across the country to understand that if they're going to maintain confidence in their government and their republic and their systems, which I think are critical to us these days, that you have to begin with a presumption of good faith,"" he said. 'A Perfect Storm' The 2000 presidential election recount, with its televised images of hapless county officials in Florida squinting at ballots to discern voter intent, was the debacle that launched a thousand fixes. The race between George W. Bush and Al Gore, ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, exposed the fragility of a system that Americans had previously taken for granted. Technical problems with decrepit machines had caused some votes to be counted more than once or not at all. A badly designed ballot confused thousands of people. And a poorly executed purge of registration rolls led to eligible voters being turned away at the polls. ""What we learned in that was how confusing the entire process was,"" said Adam Goodman, a Republican consultant who advised Florida's secretary of state at the time, Katherine Harris, during the recount. ""That was something the public back then didn't understand. It still doesn't understand."" Fallout from the recount contributed to the passage of the federal Help America Vote Act, which allocated billions of dollars for states to improve technology, ensure voter access and secure systems against fraud. In Florida, legislators rewrote state laws, switched to paper ballots and optical scanners (no more butterfly ballots or hanging chads), and mandated automatic recounts for races with margins of half a percentage point. Charles Stewart III, a leading expert on election administration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said complaints about this month's elections in some parts of the country should not be seen as evidence of a failing system, or lack of progress since 2000. ""Elections are incredibly complicated,"" Mr. Stewart said, and officials are legally required to take time beyond Election Day to count votes. ""Just the fact that we have a recount in Florida is leading people to say, 'Ah, here we go again,'"" he said. ""In fact, it's just a close election."" Though it wasn't a 2000 redux, the 2018 midterms exposed persistent problems and the haphazard way the voting process was administered across the country. In Arkansas, three-member boards handle elections at the county level, while in Connecticut all 169 towns and cities use their own registrars. The inherently political nature of running elections can call into question some officials' decision-making. In New York, party leaders fill county election boards in what critics say is little more than a patronage system. ""They are not chosen for their ability to manage or familiarity with election procedures,"" said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause in New York City. ""They are chosen for their party loyalty and to provide jobs to the party faithful."" Florida still does not have a standardized, statewide ballot format, and a poorly designed ballot in the heavily Democratic Broward County this month is believed to have led to a significant under-vote for Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, who was narrowly behind Mr. Scott. Some 30,000 people in Broward voted for governor but inexplicably bypassed the Senate race, which was tucked away in the lower left corner of the ballot, below the instructions and far from the rest of the contests. Palm Beach County voters were given ballots that required them to draw a line to complete an arrow pointing to their preferred candidates, a potentially confusing alternative to the more common methods of filling in a bubble or making a check mark. Meanwhile, Mr. Nelson has brought a lawsuit in federal court over how Florida counties validate signatures on mail-in and provisional ballots, a process his campaign claims is unconstitutional because of inconsistent criteria applied by elections staff; a judge gave voters till Saturday to validate their mismatched signatures. Improved technology and equipment, a major part of the response to the 2000 election, have in some instances contributed to new worries. Some 30 states use so-called direct-recording devices, usually with electronic screens, that were initially seen as an antidote to hanging chads and other foibles resulting from archaic punch-card devices. But some of them did not offer a paper audit trail, complicating the process of a recount, and there have been complaints about their reliability. Some voters in Texas reported being stymied when trying to cast a party-line vote on electronic screens, saying the machines appeared to reverse or erase their choices; state officials said that the voters had mistakenly touched a button before confirming their selection and that the machines operated correctly. More states have been turning to machines with a paper trail or optical scanners, which read paper ballots that the voter fills in with a marker. But voting machines are not expected to last more than 10 to 15 years. Aside from software problems in some states, aging machines at multiple polling places in New York City broke down, forcing voters to deposit ballots in boxes to be scanned later. Surveying the long Election Day lines in Cobb County, Ga., Janine Eveler, the director of the Board of Elections, described the challenges of a record turnout for a midterm election, an unusually complicated ballot and a shortage of voting machines. ""It's a perfect storm,"" she said. Restrictive Trends When James White moved from Atlanta to rural Baldwin County in Georgia, he registered to vote and was given a card certifying his eligibility. But when he went to the polls this month, he was turned away because his driver's license still bore an Atlanta address. Aided by a Democratic Party worker, Mr. White went to the county courthouse, where he was told again that he was ineligible to vote. Eventually, he won a judge's approval to cast a provisional ballot. ""Whether it got counted or not, I really don't know,"" he said. A central aim of the Help America Vote Act was to make it easier for people to cast a ballot on Election Day. But embedded in the law were requirements for voter identification and maintaining registration rolls, objectives that Democrats say Republicans have twisted for partisan ends, effectively disenfranchising certain groups that lean left. Georgia and 16 other states, most of them in the South, demand photo identification that low-income people and minorities disproportionately lack, and conflicting information about addresses and dates of birth -- even signature mismatches -- can cost someone the ability to vote. An analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found the laws inconsistently applied, with absentee ballot rejections in one county, Gwinnett, accounting for 37 percent of the total for the entire state in this month's election. Restrictive trends have accelerated since the Supreme Court invalidated part of the Voting Rights Act five years ago, with a number of states finding new ways to make it harder to vote. Some have aggressively purged voters' registrations for inactivity. Still others have closed polling places. Suspicions of political motives have fueled distrust and anger. When construction required relocating the only polling place in the heavily Hispanic Dodge City, Kan., this month, the local election official, a Republican, moved it four miles away, outside the city limits. Democrats cried foul, seeing a plot to discourage voting, which Republicans denied. Democrats' concerns in Kansas were heightened because of the involvement of the Republican secretary of state, Kris Kobach, in high-profile campaigns to crack down on voter fraud. Mr. Kobach championed a multistate system of checking registrations to prevent voters from casting ballots in two places at once, a system that critics contend is seriously flawed. A recent nonpartisan analysis estimated that it mistakenly flagged about 200 legitimate voters for every double registration it caught. Greg Shufeldt, an assistant professor of political science at Butler University who co-authored a recent study on electoral integrity, said groups most affected by restrictive voting laws tended to lose confidence in the system, which can limit turnout as much as the laws themselves. ""If you feel the system is set up in a way to disenfranchise people, and you feel that the wheels of government are turning in a way to make people less likely to participate, eventually you're going to have less trust in the system,"" Dr. Shufeldt said. ""And ultimately, you'll become less likely to participate."" Mr. Kobach, who lost the race for governor in Kansas this month, had been tapped to lead a White House panel investigating voter fraud after Mr. Trump asserted, without evidence, that voting by millions of undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote in 2016. The panel disbanded without finding any widespread fraud. Reporting was contributed by Maggie Astor, Patricia Mazzei, William Neuman and Simon Romero.  PHOTO: A polling center in Kirkwood, Mo. As Americans cast their ballots in the midterms this month, confusion and errors across the country once again tested confidence in the vote.

Australian Government Passes Contentious Encryption Law,"CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian Parliament passed a contentious encryption bill on Thursday to require technology companies to provide law enforcement and security agencies with access to encrypted communications. Privacy advocates, technology companies and other businesses had strongly opposed the bill, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government said it was needed to thwart criminals and terrorists who use encrypted messaging programs to communicate.  ""This ensures that our national security and law enforcement agencies have the modern tools they need, with appropriate authority and oversight, to access the encrypted conversations of those who seek to do us harm,"" Attorney General Christian Porter said.  Opponents of the bill argued that it not only compromised Australians' privacy but was vaguely written in a way that could lead to abuses. They also said it was being rushed through Parliament without proper consultation with the public. Lizzie O'Shea, a human rights lawyer, called it ""a terrible truncation of the process.""  Ms. O'Shea has written that the bill has global implications, arguing that the United States and other allies want Australia to ""lead the charge"" in giving security agencies access to encrypted data.  ""Once you've built the tools, it becomes very hard to argue that you can't hand them over to the U.S. government, the U.K. -- it becomes something they can all use,"" Ms. O'Shea said on Thursday. She was referring to the English-speaking countries that share intelligence under the so-called Five Eyes agreement: Australia, Britain, Canada New Zealand and the United States. Rodger Shanahan, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute for International Policy, said the bill addressed a legitimate need to give the authorities access to encrypted data.  ""I know it's a very sensitive issue, but the people arguing privacy just don't have a handle on how widespread it's used by the bad people,"" he said. ""It's pretty universal.""  Mr. Shanahan said he had been privy to many national security cases in which suspects used encrypted messaging services to communicate with people overseas. ""They're on WhatsApp and Telegram and Kik, that's how they do it,"" he said. Fergus Hanson of the Australian Security Policy Institute said that the bill had largely been framed as an antiterrorism measure, but it really had more to do with fighting crime on the state and federal levels. ""I think the police forces are looking at this through the lens that it's hard, much harder for them to get access to content now, and so they want to address the 'going dark' problem across the board,"" he said.  Australian tech companies have said that the bill could hurt their business overseas, because customers would doubt their promises to protect encrypted data. The industry has also argued that any ""back door"" that companies are required to create for law enforcement to access encrypted data would also be vulnerable to hacking.  In a submission to Parliament, Apple challenged ""the idea that weakening encryption is necessary to aid law enforcement."" It added, ""In just the past five years alone, we have processed over 26,000 requests from Australian law enforcement agencies for information to help investigate, prevent and solve crimes.""  The Australian Information Industry Association, an advocacy group representing digital companies, said it had ""no confidence"" in the government as far as the bill was concerned. ""The proposed powers are unprecedented, their remit unnecessarily broad, and the consequences of their use completely unknown,"" said Kishwar Rahman, general manager of policy and advocacy for the group.  She said its members were committed to working with the authorities ""to address operational concerns identified as arising from the use of encrypted technologies,"" but that they would ""use all available mechanisms to push back if the overly broad notices impact the security or privacy of their customers.""  The bill was nearly derailed on Thursday by an unrelated issue: Australia's widely criticized offshore detention policy, under which migrants who try to reach the country by boat are held on remote islands and denied permission to settle in Australia.  A few migrants who have been detained offshore for years have recently been allowed to enter Australia for medical treatment. Legislation debated Thursday, which Mr. Morrison opposed, would have allowed more migrants to do so.  The reason a fight over refugees nearly stalled the unrelated encryption bill is a little complicated. The encryption bill had passed the lower chamber of Parliament, the House, and was being debated in the Senate. Opposition senators wanted amendments that would have required sending it back to the House.  But that would have also led to a vote on the migrant legislation, which almost certainly would have passed. Rather than allow that to happen, Mr. Morrison let the session in the House expire without a vote. Parliament will not reconvene until February. In the end, the opposition Labor Party dropped its amendments to the encryption bill, after the government promised to take them up in the new year. The opposition seemed to be swayed by the government's argument that the bill was needed before the holidays, when terrorist attacks could be more likely.   ""I'm not willing to go home and see a terror event happen -- which we're told is less likely than more likely -- but I'm not going to have on my conscience Morrison's hostage-taking tactics where he cancels his own work, goes home and lets Australians swing in the breeze,"" the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, told reporters late Thursday.

The Big Phish; Turning Points,"Turning Point: Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network alerting users. We have long ago come to terms with the trade-off that to participate in social media, we must first give up our privacy. We sacrifice vital parts of our personal data so that we may amplify our voice, stroke our ego and connect with a virtual tribe. Turning Points asked the writer Maggie Shen King to explore a data-driven dystopia, and she responded with a piece of flash fiction. Sofie could not understand why the bidding stopped a week ago. Her database of 87 million Facebook records was the weapon of the century. Its cache of personal information made spear phishing child's play. A pre-emptive bid should have ended her auction before it even began. She checked her countdown clock -- 5 minutes 39 seconds. Auctions were, of course, all about the last seconds. She hadn't a doubt she'd lured all the right players to her party, so why was the bid stuck at half of where it should be?  Her stomach would not stop churning. She pinched her wrist and held her breath. These records were hers. She was the one smart enough to grab them before Cambridge Analytica blew up and kicked her to the curb. What she was doing was no different than what her employer had done to Facebook and what Facebook had done to their users. And had those users not valued the serendipitous reconnections with high school boyfriends, the ego strokes from bragging about their expensive vacations and their little child prodigies and a public forum in which to harangue their elected officials, they would not have put their private information out there. Facebook users understood that they had to give away a part of themselves for easy connections and the much-coveted limelight. Sofie tore off a hangnail with her teeth. She had become her father. She'd thumbed her nose at his poker dens and bookie operation, signed her name to a boatload of student loans and declared independence. But after Cambridge Analytica gave her the boot without so much as a kind word or her last paycheck, she finally understood that money bought self-respect. Without self-respect, she was nothing. She returned to her auction site on the dark web. Still no action. Her reserve price had surfaced the four whales. Would she be showing weakness or, worse, desperation sending them a reminder? No, she was in charge, and she would demonstrate that with a final prod, a do-it-or-lose-forever stick-in-the-eye. Above all else, her bidders could not abide losing. Nor could they afford to. She began with Saeed, her Iranian contact. Micro-targeted spear phishing would be much more potent than the SQL injection and DDoS attacks they had used to cripple American banking websites. Her database would provide a rash of entry points for their malware to take down Saudi oil fields. Salâam alaikum. Our auction ends in 4 minutes. Just between us, the Chinese are coming in with a billion at the close. I'd rather you win AND stick it to the American infidels by paying me with their hostage ransom money. Are you going to let their crippling sanctions and the Israeli destruction of your priceless centrifuges go unanswered? She waited for a reply, but heard just the drumming of her own heart. She moved on to Pak, her North Korean connection. Their Reconnaissance General Bureau was at least 5,000 hackers strong and adept at brute force cyberattacks. Their email hack of Sony Pictures for the lampooning of their supreme leader had devastated the company. With Sofie's database, they could take down more financial institutions and military agencies, keep themselves on the world stage and finance their feeble economy at the same time. [#xc815][#xc2dd][#xc5ec][#xbcf4][#xc138][#xc694]. Billion dollar bid just came in from your neighbor. Show your rivals you are no laughingstock. Long live North Korean strength, unpredictability and wily intelligence! Her laptop pinged. She pumped her fist: Her two messages were just opened. Three minutes and counting. Sofie forged ahead and considered how best to rile Misha. He represented a coalition that included the Russian government, wealthy oligarchs and criminal gangs. Should she emphasize the financial gain possible with the pairing of her database and the massive storehouse of credit card information that their mafia had already amassed? The opportunity to disrupt Western military, electrical and banking infrastructures? The ability to misinform, divide and reshape Western opinions? She went for the highest stake. [#x41f][#x440][#x438][#x432][#x435][#x301][#x442]. Auction for the weapon of the century is ending. The Chinese have sent in a kill bid. I'm obligated to take it, but hey, I make the rules. I'd prefer my database be used to change elections and blackmail hypocritical, holier-than-thou American politicians. And smarmy British toadies. And German rats. You have 90 seconds to win this. With less than 2 minutes left, she considered ignoring Lao Da. The Chinese had ticked her off with two insultingly low ""fill-or-kill"" bids and then threatened to walk away. They returned each time though, unabashed. They had more resources than all of the other bidders combined and were above spear phishing for petty gains. By combining Sofie's database with the 22 million U.S. Office of Personnel Management files in their possession, they could steal intellectual properties and military secrets at will for their industrial and state-owned operations. The Russians have come to play with a cool billion. Can you do better??? You have 30 seconds to enter your final bid. Watching her clock tick down, Sofie dug the tip of her father's lucky Montblanc -- the one he reserved for his second set of books -- into her thigh. She smiled picturing him tossing his apartment for it and cursing her. At 00:30, her message box began to ding. She was right. Auctions happened in the last seconds. Her body went limp with relief. $525 million final bid, $530 million, $505 million and $509 million. The bastards were colluding. Not only did they disregard her billion-dollar threat, their bids were obscenely close. Someone had unlocked the multilayer state-of-the-art security on her site and contacted their rivals. Of course they did. She was dealing with the best hackers in the world. Sofie's head pounded with rage. She should invalidate the auction and start over. The thought depressed her. It had taken her nearly a year to disguise her identity, set up her site, get the word out, vet all the players and create an airtight verification process. Moreover, portions of her data were time sensitive. By colluding, they would all get her database, so why shouldn't they each pay her price? They had invalidated the auction. A new game was in play. A corner of her lip crooked upward as Sofie crafted her message. She congratulated each player for winning the auction at their submitted bid and enclosed an OAuth token -- good for 1 minute only -- that would unlock the encryption keys to her database upon the transfer of funds. One way or another, she would get her billion dollars. Maggie Shen King is author of ""An Excess Male,"" published by Harper Voyager in 2017.

"Quit Equifax? Unlike You, Employers Can","Twitter: @ronlieber After the Equifax data breach in early September, readers asked one question repeatedly that had no good answer: Was there any way to punish the company? Federal regulators and state attorneys general probably won't provide much satisfaction. And as I reported in October, you just can't quit Equifax, no matter how angry you are that it may have exposed your personal data and then made you jump through hoops trying to freeze your credit files. Equifax won't erase your credit report, and lenders won't stop reporting your payment history to the company.    But Equifax does business with many large employers, and therein lies an opening. This week, as something of a case study, I asked my employer, The New York Times, to cancel its contract with Equifax for a service called Work Number, which provides employment verification and other details like work history and salary. After a few days of consideration, it said it would do so.   Why did readers want to go to these lengths? Let's start with the basics. The giant breach, which exposed the personal data of 145 million people, provided ample evidence that Equifax is not careful enough with information like Social Security numbers and home addresses.    In its work for employers, Equifax sucks up other data of all sorts and puts it to use in various ways. Brian Krebs, who runs the Krebs on Security website, reported in May 2017 that an Equifax payroll services unit had allowed thieves to wallow around in the individual salary data of many people for nearly a year.   Even after Equifax disclosed the big breach in the fall, sloppy practices continued. I tip my cap to the reader who somehow ended up on a long list of recipients of an urgent email and spreadsheet from inside Equifax, which I now have, too. It warned of ''inappropriate access'' across several company systems and a ''lack of an adequate review of operating system and database credentials.'' This reader is not an Equifax employee but ended up on the distribution list anyway, where recipients were asked to mark terminated employees in red, presumably so they wouldn't have access to internal systems anymore. Equifax said that it was inadvertent.   Now, a bit about this Work Number service that The Times will no longer be using. At its most basic level, it helps employers avoid all of the phone calls they get asking to verify someone's current or past employment and salary. Generally, if you give, say, a landlord or a lender permission to check your salary, they are free to contact your employer. Work Number helps automate the process.   Lots of employers use it. Equifax claims that more than 5,500 have signed up, including over 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies and many federal agencies. The service works by setting up a sort of central line to your employer's payroll operation, uploading your paycheck information each period. It also records your job title and tenure.   As you might guess, this information has a lot of value to outsiders. As long as those entities comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, they can generally gain access to it if you've given them permission. (You might have done this years ago, without even realizing it, when you signed up for a credit card or other financial service.)   If lenders want an early warning that you've been fired or demoted, Equifax's Work Number service can hand one over. ''This critical and timely information will maximize your efficiency on credit risk and collections decisions,'' the company promises lenders. Armed with information about what you're making or if you're no longer working, they can turn up the heat on efforts to get you to pay or reduce credit lines accordingly.   Equifax can also use the payroll data to help colleges track the financial progress of its alumni with its ''Graduate Outcome Metrics'' offering, allowing schools to avoid expensive surveys and what Equifax refers to in its marketing materials as ''self-reporting falsehoods.''   And if your mind wandered to where mine did in imagining other Work Number uses, yes -- employers can and do ask for job applicants' permission to check their current and previous salary where it is legal to do that. So fibbing about your past compensation in hopes of securing a raise may not work out so well.   Speaking of falsehoods, I found something that looked like one on my own Work Number report. (You can get yours free on Equifax's website the same way you would a normal credit report.) It said that in June 2017, Discover Financial Services was able to dive into my Work Number data.   But unless I'm forgetting some long-ago dalliance, I've never had a relationship with that company. So why -- and how -- has it been able to pry? I figured this was a mistake; credit reports tend to have lots of errors, after all. Equifax suggested disputing the item online through its normal process. Discover was unable to offer up an explanation by my deadline.   In the wake of the payroll unit breach that Mr. Krebs reported on, which resulted from thieves using personal information from affected employees to reset their passwords, the University of Louisville stopped doing business with the Equifax service. Another company, the building material manufacturer Saint-Gobain Corporation, made a different call in the moment and kept Equifax while also starting an examination of competing services.   Erickson Living, a retirement community operator, also continued doing business with Equifax, while adding additional security measures and shutting down online access to W-2s. The aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman declined to say what it did, and Mark Root, a spokesman, declined to say why.   (Equifax said that the number of Work Number employee records it handles had increased over the past four months.)   Here at The Times, we gave Equifax 90 days' notice of termination of our Work Number contract on Thursday. According to a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, an evaluation of alternatives is underway.   For those who may consider airing concerns with their own employer, I sought out the advice of my friend Bob Sullivan, who shined some of the brightest, earliest light on Equifax's Work Number service through reporting of his own.   He suggested making two points in particular. The primary one is the basic security argument about Equifax. ''They can't be trusted with data, and they've proven that over and over again,'' said Mr. Sullivan, who is also the author of ''Gotcha Capitalism.''   There is also the matter of internal communications, given that most employees (including me, until recently) have no idea whom their employers are working with. ''If all employees understood that every single pay stub was going to Equifax every week, there would be a mini-revolt,'' he said.    "
More Consumers Check Credit Scores,"More people are checking their credit scores and more are knowledgeable about how the scores work, new research from a consumer group finds. In a survey about credit scores published this week, 57 percent of adults said they had ''obtained or received'' their credit scores in the past year, up from about half four years ago. The eighth annual survey was commissioned by the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group, and VantageScore Solutions, a credit score model created to compete with FICO, the dominant score provider.    Credit scores are three-digit numbers that lenders use to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers. A score summarizes information in your credit report, which is a compilation of information about your loans and credit card accounts. Generally, the higher your score, the better interest rate you'll get when opening a credit card account or taking out a mortgage or car loan.    Stephen Brobeck, the federation's executive director, called the findings ''encouraging'' because those who have checked their scores are more knowledgeable than those who have not. For instance, 93 percent of those who had recently checked their score knew that mortgage lenders use credit scores, compared with 74 percent of those who hadn't.   Mr. Brobeck said the rise in the number of people checking their credit scores predated the huge data breach last year at Equifax, one of the three major consumer credit bureaus. The breach at Equifax, along with data breaches at retailers and other companies, has highlighted the need for consumers to periodically check their credit reports -- rather than credit scores -- to help spot fraudulent accounts stemming from identity theft.   The federation survey also found that more people were checking their credit reports -- 36 percent, up from 29 percent in 2014.   In a call with reporters this week, Mr. Brobeck and Barrett Burns, chief executive of VantageScore, praised the wider availability of free credit scores.   In part because of prodding by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, many credit card companies and lenders in recent years began offering customers regular access to free scores -- particularly those from FICO, created by the company Fair Isaac. In the past, consumers could get free ''generic'' scores, but they often had to pay for the true scores that lenders would use.   Consumers actually have multiple credit scores, depending on the type of loan, the scoring model used and the credit bureau providing the score. Most lenders get scores from Equifax or one of the other two major bureaus, TransUnion and Experian. (FICO says its scores are used in 90 percent of lending decisions. The three credit bureaus in 2006 created VantageScore, which says it poses a ''rising challenge'' to FICO, with about 2,200 institutions using its model.)   The range for basic credit scores is 300 to 850. Slightly different ranges may be used for industry-specific scores; FICO's range for car loan scores, for instance, is 250 to 900. Generally, scores of 700 or higher are considered good.   ORC International, a market research and opinion polling firm, conducted the survey of 1,005 people by landline phones and cellphones from May 31 to June 3. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.   Here are some questions and answers about credit scores:   How can I keep a good credit score?   The two most important steps, the federation advises, are to make monthly credit card and loan payments on time, and to keep your card balances low -- ideally, about 25 percent of your credit limit.   Consumers can take a free online quiz to test their knowledge at creditscorequiz.org.   What can people with scant credit history do if a loan application is rejected?   One way to build credit history is with a ''secured'' credit card, available from some credit unions and banks, Mr. Burns said. With a secured card, the consumer makes a deposit -- say, $500 -- and draws on the money to make purchases. Payments on the card are reported to credit bureaus, helping to establish a credit history that can eventually qualify the borrower for a traditional credit card.   Using secured cards is preferable to opening a store credit card as a way to build credit, Mr. Burns said, because store cards typically carry high interest rates and often come with stingy limits, making it difficult to keep borrowing low. ''I'd veer away from store cards,'' he said.   Where can I get free credit scores and credit reports?   Consumers are entitled by law to one free credit report a year from each of the three major bureaus. You can get yours at a dedicated website, annualcreditreport.com.   Free FICO scores are offered by many credit card companies and lenders; ask yours what's available. (Discover offers free FICO scores to non-cardholders if they register on its website.) Experian offers free FICO scores on its consumer website. Free VantageScores are available through many websites, including CreditKarma.com.    "
Tech Worker Eyed by Right Admits Lying To Get Loan,"A former technology worker for the House of Representatives accused of data theft by conservative news outlets pleaded guilty on Tuesday to an unrelated charge of making false statements on a loan application.  The worker, Imran Awan, 38, was arrested last summer as he tried to board a flight to Pakistan. He had been at the center of a swirl of allegations that he and several associates had conspired to steal hardware, data and perhaps even Democratic National Committee emails published by WikiLeaks.    President Trump had tried to heighten the intrigue, posting tweets claiming a media cover-up of a ''Democrat I.T. scandal'' and referring to Mr. Awan as a ''Pakistani mystery man.''   Mr. Awan, who is Pakistani-American, had worked for more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers since 2004, including Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She defended him after the Capitol Police started looking into allegations by unnamed House lawmakers that Mr. Awan had executed some sort of fraud.   In the plea agreement, federal prosecutors debunked conspiracy theories about the case that had circulated online. They said that the government had interviewed about 40 witnesses, examined the House Democratic Caucus server and other data and devices, reviewed electronic communications and interviewed Mr. Awan on numerous occasions. They found no evidence that Mr. Awan had engaged in illegal conduct involving House computer systems.   Mr. Awan's lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the accusations were the product of an anti-Muslim, right-wing smear job targeting Mr. Awan and his family. He faulted Mr. Trump's Twitter posts on the case, arguing they violated his client's right to due process.   Mr. Awan admitted to submitting an online application in December 2016 in the name of his wife, Hina Alvi, to the Congressional Federal Credit Union for a home equity line of credit on a property that she owned in Alexandria, Va.   In the application, he stated that it was his wife's primary residence. But in fact, she was renting the property to tenants. In January 2017, the credit union approved a line of credit for $165,000.   Mr. Gowen said his client falsely listed the property as a primary residence in an effort to quickly transfer money to relatives in Pakistan to assist his father, who was gravely ill in Virginia.   ''He knows what he did was wrong,'' Mr. Gowen said. ''He made a mistake.''   Mr. Awan's sentencing was scheduled for Aug. 21. Under federal guidelines, he faces a likely range of zero to six months in prison. And as part of the agreement, the government will ask the court to dismiss all charges against Ms. Alvi when Mr. Awan is sentenced.    "
Qualcomm Files Claim Accusing Apple of Stealing Secrets to Help Intel,"Follow Don Clark on Twitter: @donal888 SAN FRANCISCO -- Qualcomm accused Apple of stealing proprietary software and sharing it with the rival chip maker Intel as part of a scheme to reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm technology. The claim, made in documents filed in California Superior Court in San Diego on Monday night, add to charges that Qualcomm leveled last year and escalates a broad legal battle that has been raging between the two technology giants since early 2017.    Qualcomm said Apple had engaged in a ''multiyear campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct to steal Qualcomm's information and trade secrets'' to help improve the performance of Intel chips so they could match Qualcomm products.    The material taken included computer source code, software development tools and log files providing data about the performance of Qualcomm products, according to the filing.   An Apple spokesman referred on Tuesday to statements the company has issued since it began the legal struggle by suing Qualcomm in early 2017 over patent royalties that handset makers are required to pay the San Diego company. Apple argues that Qualcomm's business practices are illegally harming Apple and the entire tech industry.   In court documents, Apple has complained that Qualcomm has failed to provide evidence of any stolen information, though Apple has provided extensive access to corporate records. Qualcomm, in turn, accuses Apple of dragging its feet on providing information needed to bolster its charges.   An Intel spokesman declined to comment.   Qualcomm, the leading supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks, became Apple's main source for those kinds of chips in iPhones in 2011. But Apple has moved to drop Qualcomm as a supplier; the new iPhones announced this month use only modem chips from Intel.   Qualcomm, which has also been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and foreign regulators over its patent licensing practices, filed patent-infringement suits and other actions in response to Apple's suit. In the San Diego case, Qualcomm initially accused Apple of violating a key agreement governing the use of the two companies' proprietary technology.   That agreement contained a series of restrictions aimed at protecting Qualcomm source code and other information, restrictions that Apple violated, in part, by sharing information with Intel, Qualcomm said in the initial complaint.   In its latest move, Qualcomm provided more claims in its effort to persuade a judge to broaden the suit to cover theft of trade secrets. That question is expected to be considered at a hearing on Nov. 30, while a trial has been set for April.   Qualcomm officials, and some analysts, believe the dispute with Apple is essentially a dispute over how much the smartphone maker pays to license Qualcomm patents. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm's chief executive, has held out hope that a settlement might be reached with Apple.   ''That really creates a much better environment for us to be able to resolve at least the licensing business issues that we have,'' Mr. Mollenkopf said in an interview in July.   Qualcomm's battle with Apple is one of many challenges the company has grappled with recently. It battled a takeover attempt by a rival, Broadcom, for four months before President Trump blocked the bid on national security grounds. More recently, Qualcomm called off a $44 billion bid to buy NXP after the Chinese authorities failed to approve the transaction.   Interested in All Things Tech?

Companies In China Face Charges Of Espionage,"WASHINGTON -- The Department of Justice charged a Chinese state-owned company, its Taiwanese partner and three individuals on Thursday with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company, the latest move by the Trump administration to crack down on China's ''economic espionage.'' The indictments come as the United States remains locked in a bitter trade war with China, which the Trump administration has accused of unfair trade practices, including stealing valuable intellectual property and technology from American companies. The charges filed on Thursday are the latest in a series of indictments that accuse China of elaborate efforts to steal corporate secrets through espionage and hacking.     The Justice Department unveiled charges against Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, United Microelectronics Corporation, a Taiwanese semiconductor company, and three Taiwanese nationals. They are accused of conspiring to steal technology from Micron Technology, an Idaho-based chip maker that does extensive business in Asia.   ''As this and other recent cases have shown, Chinese economic espionage against the United States has been increasing -- and it has been increasing rapidly,'' Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. ''I am here to say that enough is enough.''   Earlier this week, the Commerce Department said that Jinhua will be barred from buying American components because it poses a national security threat to the United States.   According to the Justice Department, a former executive of a Micron subsidiary left the company in 2015 and went to work for United Microelectronics Corporation in Taiwan. When he made the switch, the government alleges, he recruited two former colleagues to steal up to $8.75 billion in trade secrets from Micron. United Microeletronics then partnered with Jinhua, transferring the information to the Chinese market.   Jinhua is opening a $5.7 billion factory in China's Fujian Province and has become increasingly ambitious in its desire to become a global player in the memory chip business.   The Justice Department said the companies could face fines of more than $20 billion and the people accused could face 15 years in prison and $5 million fines.   The Micron case and the other recent indictments show the Chinese government that ''we notice what they're doing,'' John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department's national security division, said during a news conference on Thursday. The ultimate goal, he said, is ''not to have a fight with China,'' but to get Beijing to use legal methods to improve its economy.   The charges come just weeks before President Trump is expected to meet with President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina. The White House has been pressing China to lower its trade barriers and stop the theft of intellectual property from American businesses, and has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports as part of a campaign to get China to change its ways.   Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Thursday that he had ''a long and very good conversation'' with Mr. Xi and that their discussions are ''moving along nicely.''   But the administration has taken an increasingly tough approach to Beijing, which it says is trying to dominate industries of the future through nefarious means, including spying. China's pattern of incursion, including coercing companies to hand over technology, is what helped form the basis for the administration's decision to impose tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports and to more closely scrutinize foreign investment from China.   On Tuesday, Justice Department officials unsealed an indictment that accused two Chinese intelligence officers and five hackers of repeatedly penetrating corporate computer systems to steal intellectual property and other information about the aerospace industry.   ''No country presents a broader, more severe threat to our ideas, our innovation and our economic security than China,'' Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said in a statement on Thursday. ''The Chinese government is determined to acquire American technology, and they're willing use a variety of means to do that -- from foreign investments, corporate acquisitions and cyberintrusions to obtaining the services of current or former company employees to get inside information.''

"While Held As a Spy, Recruited To Be a Spy","LONDON -- Fifteen-hour interrogations. Harmful cocktails of medicines. Offers of freedom in exchange for his theft of British government documents. In his first public comments since being released last week from seven months of detention in the United Arab Emirates, Matthew Hedges, a British academic, described the extended psychological torture he says he endured at the hands of his interrogators.    Mr. Hedges, 31, was sentenced last month to life in prison after being convicted of spying for the British government during a research trip, part of his doctoral studies on the effects of the Arab Spring on Emirati diplomacy and security. He was pardoned by the Emirati government last week and returned to Britain after British officials lobbied for his release.    Locked up alone in a windowless cell with fluorescent lights that gave him migraines, Mr. Hedges was repeatedly accused by his captors of working for MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence service and questioned about his sources for information that was freely available online, he said.   He told The Times of London that the interrogators offered him leniency early in his detention if he agreed to steal documents from the British Foreign Office and give them to the Emiratis.   ''I started having a panic attack,'' he recalled. ''I was like, 'How am I supposed to get this information?'''   The British government and Mr. Hedges have denied he was a British spy. After denying the charges during one session, he was made to stand for the rest of the day in ankle cuffs, he said in a separate interview on Wednesday with BBC Radio 4 Today. Emirati security officials also threatened to take him to an overseas military base where he would be imprisoned and beaten, Mr. Hedges said.   After days of mounting pressure and promises from his interrogators that they would ease his treatment if he admitted to spying, Mr. Hedges said, he finally signed a confession. It was written in Arabic, which he said he did not understand. When his interrogators asked for his position in MI6, he falsely confessed to being a captain, a rank that he later learned does not exist in the agency.   Mr. Hedges, a graduate student at Durham University in England, was leaving Dubai following his research trip when he was approached at the airport by 10 Emirati state security officials, who led him away blindfolded and in handcuffs.   Mr. Hedges had received a diagnosis of depression and anxiety shortly before leaving for the United Arab Emirates, and his condition worsened during his incarceration. After he begged for medicine, he said he was given a cocktail of Xanax, Valium and another drug that gave him seizures as he slept.   Hiba Zayadin, an assistant researcher at Human Rights Watch focusing on the United Arab Emirates, said the coerced confession and inhumane conditions were consistent with other allegations of torture in Emirati detention. And with many British students, academics and businesspeople traveling to the country, Mr. Hedges was not the first to report abuse there. The British Foreign Office said in 2015 that in the previous five years it had received 43 complaints from British nationals of torture or mistreatment in the Emirati justice system.   Ms. Zayadin said the British government's early attempts to handle Mr. Hedges' detention quietly had failed, and that it should alter its approach in the face of increasingly aggressive Emirati behavior.   ''U.K. authorities should harshly and publicly criticize Hedges' treatment in detention and review their close relationship with the U.A.E. in the wake of it,'' Ms. Zayadin said, ''especially as countless others languish in prison in inhumane conditions and following grossly unfair trials.''   But another analyst said that Britain's looming departure from the European Union may weaken any appetite for cutting ties with the United Arab Emirates.   ''Given the Brexit backdrop, the U.K. government is loath to estrange a regional ally that is worth billions to the U.K. Treasury,'' said the analyst, David Roberts, a lecturer at King's College London.   Mr. Hedges said he would soon begin a legal campaign to hold the Emirati government accountable for his mistreatment.    "

Equifax said that it was inadvertent. Now, a bit about this Work Number service that The Times will no longer be using. At its most basic level, it helps employers avoid all of the phone calls they get asking to verify someone's current or past employment and salary. Generally, if you give, say, a landlord or a lender permission to check your salary, they are free to contact your employer. Work Number helps automate the process. Lots of employers use it. Equifax claims that more than 5,500 have signed up, including over 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies and many federal agencies. The service works by setting up a sort of central line to your employer's payroll operation, uploading your paycheck information each period. It also records your job title and tenure. As you might guess, this information has a lot of value to outsiders. As long as those entities comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, they can generally gain access to it if you've given them permission. (You might have done this years ago, without even realizing it, when you signed up for a credit card or other financial service.) If lenders want an early warning that you've been fired or demoted, Equifax's Work Number service can hand one over. ""This critical and timely information will maximize your efficiency on credit risk and collections decisions,"" the company promises lenders. Armed with information about what you're making or if you're no longer working, they can turn up the heat on efforts to get you to pay or reduce credit lines accordingly. Equifax can also use the payroll data to help colleges track the financial progress of its alumni with its ""Graduate Outcome Metrics"" offering, allowing schools to avoid expensive surveys and what Equifax refers to in its marketing materials as ""self-reporting falsehoods."" And if your mind wandered to where mine did in imagining other Work Number uses, yes -- employers can and do ask for job applicants' permission to check their current and previous salary where it is legal to do that. So fibbing about your past compensation in hopes of securing a raise may not work out so well. Speaking of falsehoods, I found something that looked like one on my own Work Number report. (You can get yours free on Equifax's website the same way you would a normal credit report.) It said that in June 2017, Discover Financial Services was able to dive into my Work Number data. But unless I'm forgetting some long-ago dalliance, I've never had a relationship with that company. So why -- and how -- has it been able to pry? I figured this was a mistake; credit reports tend to have lots of errors, after all. Equifax suggested disputing the item online through its normal process. Discover was unable to offer up an explanation by my deadline. In the wake of the payroll unit breach that Mr. Krebs reported on, which resulted from thieves using personal information from affected employees to reset their passwords, the University of Louisville stopped doing business with the Equifax service. Another company, the building material manufacturer Saint-Gobain Corporation, made a different call in the moment and kept Equifax while also starting an examination of competing services. Erickson Living, a retirement community operator, also continued doing business with Equifax, while adding additional security measures and shutting down online access to W-2s. The aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman declined to say what it did, and Mark Root, a spokesman, declined to say why. (Equifax said that the number of Work Number employee records it handles had increased over the past four months.) Here at The Times, we gave Equifax 90 days' notice of termination of our Work Number contract on Thursday. According to a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, an evaluation of alternatives is underway. For those who may consider airing concerns with their own employer, I sought out the advice of my friend Bob Sullivan, who shined some of the brightest, earliest light on Equifax's Work Number service through reporting of his own. He suggested making two points in particular. The primary one is the basic security argument about Equifax. ""They can't be trusted with data, and they've proven that over and over again,"" said Mr. Sullivan, who is also the author of ""Gotcha Capitalism."" There is also the matter of internal communications, given that most employees (including me, until recently) have no idea whom their employers are working with. ""If all employees understood that every single pay stub was going to Equifax every week, there would be a mini-revolt,"" he said.

Uber and Waymo Settle Trade Secrets Suit Over Driverless Cars,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Waymo and Uber settled their legal fight on Friday, nearly a year after Waymo first accused the ride-hailing company of plotting to steal important self-driving car technology. After four days of arguments and testimony in Federal District Court here, Uber agreed to provide Waymo, the self-driving car unit under Google's parent company, Alphabet, with 0.34 percent of its stock. According to Waymo, the settlement's terms value Uber at $72 billion, meaning the Alphabet unit's stake is worth about $245 million. The settlement closes a legal fight that riveted Silicon Valley. It pitted the most successful company from the dot-com era against this generation's biggest start-up in a fight over autonomous vehicles -- a potentially trillion-dollar industry that is expected to transform transportation. The trial also offered a peek into how Silicon Valley really works: the rise of promising start-ups that challenge incumbents; the inner workings of rich, but often chaotic, technology companies; the complicated rivalries among billionaire tech entrepreneurs; and the costly competition for engineering talent.  The dispute between the two companies started in 2016 after Uber acquired Otto, a start-up making self-driving trucks that was founded by Anthony Levandowski, an early member of Google's self-driving car project. Uber agreed to pay a reported $590 million for Otto just six months after it was founded. But Waymo -- which was spun out from Google in late 2016 -- claimed the deal was part of a plan to steal its laser-sensor technology, a key component for operating self-driving cars. Mr. Levandowski had begun talking with Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive at the time, about the possibility of working together on autonomous-vehicle technology while he was still employed at Google, according to evidence presented at the trial. Mr. Levandowski was accused of downloading thousands of Google files related to self-driving car technology before he left the company. Uber learned about what he had done but still went ahead with the deal, Waymo claimed. That was the basis of Waymo's claim that Uber had misappropriated eight trade secrets related mainly to lidar -- an abbreviation for ""light detection and ranging"" -- sensors that help self-driving cars see the world around them. The first few days of the trial revealed a number of embarrassing details connecting Uber with Mr. Levandowski. However, Waymo had yet to deliver on the substantive legal part of the argument that Uber knowingly stole Waymo's trade secrets for use in its products. The judge, William Alsup, admonished Waymo's lawyers on Wednesday for not having made much progress on its trade secret misappropriation claims. Before the trial started, Uber offered to settle with Waymo in exchange for 0.68 percent of the company's equity, or about $500 million, but its board of directors pulled the offer and allowed Mr. Kalanick to testify, according to two people familiar with Uber's thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. After testimony on Thursday, settlement talks restarted, and Uber offered the lower percentage, these people said. For Waymo, the financial terms were not as important as scoring concessions on not using Waymo's technology, said a person familiar with Waymo's deliberations who was not authorized to discuss them. The settlement included an agreement that none of Waymo's confidential information was being incorporated in Uber's autonomous vehicle technology. After almost a decade of work on self-driving cars, the Uber stake may be the first substantial money that Waymo has made from the technology. Alphabet was already a major investor in Uber through its venture capital arm, GV. It has also made a billion-dollar investment in Uber's main rival in the United States, Lyft. Although it settled the lawsuit, Waymo's court fight may have succeeded in embarrassing a rival while delivering a unspoken warning to former and current employees to be cautious about leaving the company with know-how developed there. It also struck a deal before Larry Page, Alphabet's chief executive, who rarely speaks in public, had to testify in court next week. Waymo's lawyers presented evidence that entertained the throngs of technology reporters gathered to cover the trial including texts and emails between Mr. Levandowski and Mr. Kalanick using chest-puffing terms like ""burn the village"" and ""second place is first"" loser. There were also pictures of notes on whiteboards from a brainstorming ""jam sesh"" led by Mr. Kalanick, declaring, among other things, that ""laser is the sauce."" The settlement helps resolve one of Uber's many lingering issues from Mr. Kalanick's tumultuous time as chief executive, which ended in June. His successor, Dara Khosrowshahi, has said he hopes to change the perception that Uber has been too quick to break rules. The settlement also clears away a significant legal risk as Uber prepares for an expected initial public offering. It is still dealing with a Department of Justice investigation into its business practices. Although the company insists it did not take any Waymo trade secrets, Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement that he regretted the events that led to the litigation. ""My job as Uber's C.E.O. is to set the course for the future of the company: innovating and growing responsibly, as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past,"" he said in the statement. ""The prospect that a couple of Waymo employees may have inappropriately solicited others to join Otto, and that they may have potentially left with Google files in their possession, in retrospect, raised some hard questions."" Mr. Kalanick released a statement that was not nearly as conciliatory. ""No trade secrets ever came to Uber,"" the statement said. ""The evidence at trial overwhelmingly proved that, and had the trial proceeded to its conclusion, it is clear Uber would have prevailed."" The loser in the legal proceeding may be Mr. Levandowski, who was fired by Uber over his refusal to cooperate with the company's defense. An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said the company had fired Mr. Levandowski in May before Otto could meet any of its performance targets. As a result, he lost out on an estimated $250 million worth of equity in Uber -- almost exactly how much Uber paid Waymo. Judge Alsup referred Mr. Levandowski's case to the Justice Department, although it was not clear whether a criminal case was being pursued against him. Mr. Levandowski, who received a $120 million bonus for his work on Google's self-driving car, was expected to refuse to answer questions if he had taken the stand as scheduled next week.

Facebook's Surveillance Machine; Contributing Op-Ed Writer,"In 2014, Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company that would later provide services for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, reached out with a request on Amazon's ""Mechanical Turk"" platform, an online marketplace where people around the world contract with others to perform various tasks. Cambridge Analytica was looking for people who were American Facebook users. It offered to pay them to download and use a personality quiz app on Facebook called thisisyourdigitallife. About 270,000 people installed the app in return for $1 to $2 per download. The app ""scraped"" information from their Facebook profiles as well as detailed information from their friends' profiles. Facebook then provided all this data to the makers of the app, who in turn turned it over to Cambridge Analytica. A few hundred thousand people may not seem like a lot, but because Facebook users have a few hundred friends each on average, the number of people whose data was harvested reached about 50 million. Most of those people had no idea that their data had been siphoned off (after all, they hadn't installed the app themselves), let alone that the data would be used to shape voter targeting and messaging for Mr. Trump's presidential campaign.  This weekend, after this was all exposed by The New York Times and The Observer of London, Facebook hastily made a public announcement that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica (well over a year after the election) and vehemently denied that this was a ""data breach."" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, wrote that ""the claim that this is a data breach is completely false."" He contended that Facebook users ""knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked."" He also said that ""everyone involved gave their consent."" Mr. Grewal is right: This wasn't a breach in the technical sense. It is something even more troubling: an all-too-natural consequence of Facebook's business model, which involves having people go to the site for social interaction, only to be quietly subjected to an enormous level of surveillance. The results of that surveillance are used to fuel a sophisticated and opaque system for narrowly targeting advertisements and other wares to Facebook's users. Facebook makes money, in other words, by profiling us and then selling our attention to advertisers, political actors and others. These are Facebook's true customers, whom it works hard to please. Facebook doesn't just record every click and ""like"" on the site. It also collects browsing histories. It also purchases ""external"" data like financial information about users (though European nations have some regulations that block some of this). Facebook recently announced its intent to merge ""offline"" data -- things you do in the physical world, such as making purchases in a brick-and-mortar store -- with its vast online databases. Facebook even creates ""shadow profiles"" of nonusers. That is, even if you are not on Facebook, the company may well have compiled a profile of you, inferred from data provided by your friends or from other data. This is an involuntary dossier from which you cannot opt out in the United States. Despite Facebook's claims to the contrary, everyone involved in the Cambridge Analytica data-siphoning incident did not give his or her ""consent"" -- at least not in any meaningful sense of the word. It is true that if you found and read all the fine print on the site, you might have noticed that in 2014, your Facebook friends had the right to turn over all your data through such apps. (Facebook has since turned off this feature.) If you had managed to make your way through a bewildering array of options, you might have even discovered how to turn the feature off. This wasn't informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person's personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook ""likes"" -- and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day? Given this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual -- especially since it is practically irrevocable. What did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time. The New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company's operations in the 2016 presidential election. If Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn't have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn't free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone's data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance. Should we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life -- from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests -- that are accessible or organized only via Facebook. The problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests? A business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.

Qualcomm Accuses Apple of Stealing Secrets to Help Intel,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Qualcomm accused Apple of stealing proprietary software and sharing it with the rival chip maker Intel as part of a scheme to reduce Apple's reliance on Qualcomm technology. The claim, made in documents filed in California Superior Court in San Diego on Monday night, add to charges that Qualcomm leveled last year and escalates a broad legal battle that has been raging between the two technology giants since early 2017. Qualcomm said Apple had engaged in a ""multiyear campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct to steal Qualcomm's information and trade secrets"" to help improve the performance of Intel chips so they could match Qualcomm products.  The material taken included computer source code, software development tools and log files providing data about the performance of Qualcomm products, according to the filing. An Apple spokesman referred on Tuesday to statements the company has issued since it began the legal struggle by suing Qualcomm in early 2017 over patent royalties that handset makers are required to pay the San Diego company. Apple argues that Qualcomm's business practices are illegally harming Apple and the entire tech industry. In court documents, Apple has complained that Qualcomm has failed to provide evidence of any stolen information, though Apple has provided extensive access to corporate records. Qualcomm, in turn, accuses Apple of dragging its feet on providing information needed to bolster its charges. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Qualcomm, the leading supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks, became Apple's main source for those kinds of chips in iPhones in 2011. But Apple has moved to drop Qualcomm as a supplier; the new iPhones announced this month use only modem chips from Intel. Qualcomm, which has also been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and foreign regulators over its patent licensing practices, filed patent-infringement suits and other actions in response to Apple's suit. In the San Diego case, Qualcomm initially accused Apple of violating a key agreement governing the use of the two companies' proprietary technology. That agreement contained a series of restrictions aimed at protecting Qualcomm source code and other information, restrictions that Apple violated, in part, by sharing information with Intel, Qualcomm said in the initial complaint. In its latest move, Qualcomm provided more claims in its effort to persuade a judge to broaden the suit to cover theft of trade secrets. That question is expected to be considered at a hearing on Nov. 30, while a trial has been set for April. Qualcomm officials, and some analysts, believe the dispute with Apple is essentially a dispute over how much the smartphone maker pays to license Qualcomm patents. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm's chief executive, has held out hope that a settlement might be reached with Apple. ""That really creates a much better environment for us to be able to resolve at least the licensing business issues that we have,"" Mr. Mollenkopf said in an interview in July. Qualcomm's battle with Apple is one of many challenges the company has grappled with recently. It battled a takeover attempt by a rival, Broadcom, for four months before President Trump blocked the bid on national security grounds. More recently, Qualcomm called off a $44 billion bid to buy NXP after the Chinese authorities failed to approve the transaction.

Google's Security Sweep for Apps,"Q. Can rogue Google app developers still sneak malware onto people's devices with Android app updates once the app has been initially approved as ''safe''?  A. Keeping deceptive and malicious apps out of online stores in a continuing battle for Google, as it is for Apple, Microsoft and other companies that invite outside developers to create and sell applications through official channels. Scammers have recently added new tactics to get their wares onto devices, like hiding code in flashlight and utility apps and releasing ''multistage'' malware that shows no initial security threat -- but gradually updates itself with more sinister software once it is installed.    Last year, Google announced a new security service for Android devices called Google Play Protect, which tries to thwart more malicious activity. Google Play Protect scans apps for safety before you download them to your device and then scans the apps on your device for malware to warn you of any security concerns. Newer forms of malicious software were originally able to evade detection, but after third-party security researchers notified the company of the deceptive apps, Google used its Play Protect software to remotely remove the malware from devices.   You can see the Google Play Protect settings on your device by opening the Google Play store icon, tapping the menu button in the upper-left corner and selecting Play Protect. The Play Protect screen shows the apps that Google has scanned recently for security issues and includes controls for disabling the scans after apps have been downloaded.

Russian Trolls Meddle in the Vaccine Debate,"''Don't get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it.'' ''Do you still treat your kids with leaves? No? And why don't you #vaccinate them? It's medicine!''    With messages like those, Russian internet trolls meddling in the 2016 presidential election also lashed out at Americans debating the safety of vaccines, a new study has found.   But instead of picking a side, researchers said, the trolls and bots they programmed hurled insults at both pro- and anti-vaccine advocates. Their only intent, the study concluded, seemed to be to raise the level of hostility.    ''You see this pattern,'' said David A. Broniatowski, a computer engineer at George Washington University and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. ''On guns, or race, these accounts take opposite sides in lots of debates. They're about sowing discord.''   [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]   With colleagues at the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Broniatowski looked at 899 vaccine-related tweets sent from mid-2014 to late 2017.   Some came from accounts known to send out spam or link to malware; more came from accounts that congressional investigators and NBC News have identified as belonging to Russian trolls.   While the spammer and malware accounts mostly disseminated anti-vaccine messages, the Russia-linked ones played both sides.   Most of the anti-vaccine tweets repeated well-known but long-discredited rumors, such as those that vaccines cause autism or contain dangerous amounts of mercury. Others accused pharmaceutical companies of caring only about profits, not children.   Pro-vaccine tweets from the same accounts argued that vaccines saved lives. Some said they should be mandatory. Some were insulting, such as ''You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination.''   But the Russians sometimes misread their audience, Dr. Broniatowski said, sending tweets that ''didn't quite make sense, given the way Americans usually argue about vaccines.''   Some, for example, suggested that God opposed vaccination. ""I don't believe in #vaccines I believe in God's will,'' one read.   Divine will is very rarely cited in the American debate except when HPV vaccine is discussed, and then not over the notion that God ordains which children fall ill. HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer, which is sexually transmitted, and some Christian conservatives believe it encourages extramarital sex.   Other tweets promoted class hostility, saying the elite get ''clean vaccines'' while normal people did not.   Yet others appeared designed to appeal to the audience for conspiracy websites like Infowars. One claimed that vaccines were part of the world domination plan of the Illuminati secret sect.   More than 250 tweets had the unusual hashtag #VaccinateUS. Anti-vaccination activists tend to use tags like #Vaxxed, #b1less or #CDCWhistleblower, Dr. Broniatowski said, while pro-vaccine groups use #vaccineswork, for example.   Tweets carrying the hashtag #VaccinateUS, the study said, were ''uniquely identified with Russian troll accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency,'' a propaganda operation linked to the Kremlin.   That account, which Twitter closed, ''was a failed campaign by Russian trolls,'' Dr. Broniatowski said.   Anti-vaccine sentiment is lower in Russia than in many other European countries. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 100 percent of Russian children have had all their shots.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
