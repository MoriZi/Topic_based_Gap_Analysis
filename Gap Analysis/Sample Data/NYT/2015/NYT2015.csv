Deadline to Disclose Data Breaches Raises Concerns in Europe,"BRUSSELS - Europe is getting close to testing a question increasingly central to data security: Will requiring companies to quickly inform regulators of a breach help protect people's information? Several prominent Internet hacking incidents, including at Target and JPMorgan Chase, have raised concerns that individuals' online information is increasingly vulnerable. Now, as part of a data protection overhaul expected to be approved by European officials in the coming months, a greater onus will be put on companies. Under the proposals, any company - even one based outside Europe - that collects and manages data about the region's more than 500 million residents would need to inform a national privacy watchdog within 72 hours of discovering a data breach. Companies also must notify customers as soon as possible, particularly when the use of the stolen data could violate individuals' privacy rights.  The regulators would have the right to fine companies up to 2 percent of their global revenue, or a maximum $1.1 million, if they do not comply with the privacy rules, which  already are some of the most stringent in the world. The fines authorized in the overhaul, which would be much higher than current penalties, vary depending on the severity of each data breach. The rules, which are still being negotiated, are expected to be completed by early next year and take effect as early as 2018. Yet while policy makers here have hailed the new obligations as a means to protect people's rights, companies, privacy lawyers and even some data protection advocates question whether requiring businesses to inform regulators within three days of any data breach - be it a minor hacking or a major attack - will make individuals' information safer. ""It's all very well to set deadlines, but what will this actually achieve?"" said Paula Barrett, head of privacy and information law at Eversheds, a law firm in London. ""Seventy-two hours is a very tight deadline. For many, it seems like this number was just plucked out of thin air."" Many executives say a mandatory three-day window would place a high regulatory burden on companies' fast-expanding use of the data they collect about their global customers. It also goes well beyond similar rules in other jurisdictions, according to company officials. In the United States, for instance, the most onerous laws require that companies inform authorities and customers within a month of discovering a data breach. Privacy specialists say companies may not be able to find a solution to a hacking within the period before notification of one of Europe's data protection regulators is required. That may allow other hackers to take advantage if authorities decide to make the breach public, potentially raising individuals' anxiety that their information is not secure. Under the proposals, the rules allow businesses to notify just one of the region's 28 regulators, which would then coordinate with counterparts across the Continent. The regulator that is notified would be based on where the hacking occurs or where a company has headquarters. The goal, lawmakers say, is to make it easier for companies to inform privacy authorities, while responding to data breaches immediately. ""Companies have to do all they can to notify regulators and consumers,"" said David Martin Ruiz, senior legal officer at BEUC, the European consumer association in Brussels. ""It's their duty."" But some of the region's privacy watchdogs could struggle to keep up with the increased authority from Europe's proposed rules. Many of the regulators have small staffs - and even smaller budgets - to handle the increasing workload awaiting them. The privacy regulator of Ireland, for example, where many American tech companies have international headquarters, primarily because of the country's low corporate tax, has an annual budget of just $4.1 million. That pales in comparison with those of its American counterparts, primarily the Federal Trade Commission,  which have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal to ensure that technology companies comply with domestic legislation. In the United States, almost all states now require companies to notify authorities and customers after a data breach. President Obama also called for new federal rules early this year that would require businesses to inform people within 30 days after their data has been hacked. Previous attempts to pass nationwide legislation did not gain traction in Congress. But as with many other aspects of data protection rules, European regulators are taking a stronger stand on how governments and companies protect data and privacy compared with the United States. In Europe, privacy is viewed as a fundamental right on par with freedom of expression. This month, for example, the European Court of Justice, the region's highest legal authority, struck down a data-sharing agreement between Europe and the United States that allowed the likes of Google and Facebook to move people's online information across the Atlantic. The judges said American privacy rules did not offer as much protection as those in Europe. The court's ruling ""stressed the importance that Europe places on protecting people's privacy,"" said Jacob Kohnstamm, the Dutch data protection regulator. While Europe's proposed rules go far beyond what is required in the United States, privacy advocates say the mandatory notification process would ensure that companies do not try to hide serious data breaches that put people at risk. The data notification changes build on rules that require European cellphone carriers and Internet providers to inform local authorities within 24 hours after discovering customers' information has been compromised. Several telecom executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the current rules had been a mixed blessing. While the 24-hour mandatory notification had ensured that data breaches were taken more seriously, particularly by senior management, the officials said it remained difficult to fix any security flaw before they were required to inform national authorities. ""The timing is absolutely crazy,"" said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, who runs the global privacy and data protection practice at Linklaters, a law firm, in Brussels. He has helped several telecom operators comply with the existing rules. ""When you are the victim of a data breach, you want to fix the problem first,"" he added, ""not spend time notifying the regulator."" "
Data Security Gaps in an Industry Student Privacy Pledge,"On the eve ofa congressional hearing to explore the use of new technology in classrooms nationwide, a software engineer has found significant gaps in an industry effort to bolster student data security and privacy. Over the last several months, more than 100 education technology companies and organizations have signed on to a voluntary student privacy pledge in which they have committed to a variety of data safeguards, including maintaining ""a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks."" Of the approximately 60 companies that have signed the pledge and have websites with logins for students, teachers or parents, however, about one-fifth of them did not use basic encryption - called Secure Socket Layer or SSL - during the login process, according to an investigation this week by Tony Porterfield, a software engineer in Los Altos, Calif.    (Earlier this week, I wrotean article about a previous ed tech security research project by Mr. Porterfield.) While these vulnerabilities do not appear to have been exploited by hackers, cybersecurity experts said they potentially exposed student, parent and teacher accounts to snooping or hijacking by unauthorized users.  The security lapses raise questions about an expected federal student digital privacy bill, to be modeled in part on the industry pledge. President Obama endorsed the pledge during a speech last month at the Federal Trade Commission. The industry pledge, for instance, does not require specific security measures, such as encryption of logins for sites that collect personal details about students. The pledge also does not require companies to protect teacher or parent information collected by educational sites or apps. ""Suppose a person logs in from a public wireless network, such as at a coffee shop or airport,"" said Jonathan Mayer, a lawyer and computer science graduate student at Stanford University, explaining the possible risks of sending login information in unencrypted plain text. ""Anyone sitting nearby could grab that person's password,"" he said, and take over their account. The New York Times had asked Mr. Mayer to confirm Mr. Porterfield's findings about the data security practices of signers of the privacy pledge. When contacted on Tuesday, executives for signers of the privacy pledge that did not have encrypted logins said they had been caught in the process of updating their data security measures.  Zearn.com is a fledgling nonprofit that aims to democratize digital learning by offering daily online math lessons free to elementary school teachers. Its site, which collects information on the speed and accuracy with which students add, subtract, multiply and divide, requires children to provide their birth dates, first and last names, and email addresses.  According to the site's privacy policy: ""Zearn has multiple security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control."" But the site committed to the privacy pledge before adding important security protection.  Shalinee Sharma, the executive director of Zearn, said that the organization had been testing encryption and had planned to add it this Friday.  ""We are striving to be exemplars on data privacy for kids,"" Ms. Sharma wrote in an email Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday evening, Zearn.org switched to encrypted logins. A spokeswoman for Otus, which created a free learning management system and has also committed to the industry pledge, said on Tuesday that its login was temporarily unencrypted while the site upgraded its systems.  The company's site, OtusPlus, collects personal details including students' names, email addresses, profile photos, school names, homework assignments, blog posts, grades, test results and attendance records. ""Our user base has grown very quickly and we outgrew our server,"" Jennifer Amdur Spitz, a spokeswoman for Otus, wrote in an email on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, the site's logins were encrypted. Jules Polonetsky, the executive director of the Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed think tank in Washington that helped develop the privacy pledge, said his group would be holding training sessions next week to ""help companies get in shape on security and privacy.""  Although the pledge does not require specific security measures, he wrote in an email on Wednesday afternoon, it does require the companies that sign to use security practices appropriate for the kinds of services they provide and the sensitivity of the student data involved. ""Companies that have security practice that fall short can face legal liability,"" Mr. Polonetsky said in the email. "
F.T.C. Calls for Strong Data and Privacy Protection With Connected Devices,"As consumers increasingly adopt devices that can collect information and transmit it to the Internet, the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday called on technology companies that sell those products to institute comprehensive measures to protect users' data security and privacy.  Advancements like in-car sensors, which can record vehicle location and speed, or glucose monitors that can send information on diabetic patients to their doctors, have huge potential benefits, like reducing traffic accidents or improving public health. But the agency said the devices, which make up the so-called Internet of Things, also raise serious security and privacy risks that could undermine consumers' confidence. ""The only way for the Internet of Things to reach its full potential for innovation is with the trust of American consumers,"" Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the F.T.C., said in a statement on Tuesday morning. ""We believe that by adopting the best practices we've laid out, businesses will be better able to provide consumers the protections they want and allow the benefits of the Internet of Things to be fully realized."" One concern is that hackers or malefactors could potentially hijack and misuse intimate information recorded by Internet-connect devices to the detriment of consumers. Last year, for instance, an electronics company that marketed what it said were ""secure"" Internet-connected cameras, allowing parents to remotely monitor their babies, settled a complaint by the F.T.C. that lax security practices had exposed its customers to privacy invasions. A security flaw allowed anyone with the cameras' Internet addresses to view, and in some cases hear, what was happening in customers' homes, the agency said. To reduce the risk of such incidents, the agency's new report recommends that companies institute security measures as part of their development process for Internet-connected devices and sensors, rather than as an afterthought. The report also recommended that companies ensure that their contractors can maintain reasonable security for those systems and that companies consider practices that would prevent unauthorized people from accessing consumers' devices or data. For security and privacy, the report also recommended that companies consider putting limits on the amount of information their devices collect from consumers and on the amount of time they retain that data. Such practices, the agency argued, would reduce the risk that information collected about people and their devices would be used ""in ways contrary to consumers' expectations."" But the report stopped short of calling on Congress to mandate data security and privacy measures for Internet-connected devices.  ""Any Internet of Things-specific legislation would be premature at this point in time, given the rapidly evolving nature of the technology,"" the agency said in a news release. "
A Push to Improve Data Privacy Laws,"WASHINGTON -- The White House accelerated its efforts on Thursday to bolster data privacy laws and announced a bid to scrutinize discriminatory pricing on the Internet, pressing to exert control on the use of data in Americans' lives. A year after President Obama ordered a review of the vast collection and use of digital information by private companies, his top advisers announced that they had recruited a Republican ally for a bill to protect data collected from students' educational apps. They said they were redoubling efforts to push broader measures, so far stalled in Congress, to safeguard consumer privacy.     And in a report released by Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, White House officials said they would scrutinize companies' use of personal data to charge different customers different prices online.   ''This big data revolution presents incredible opportunities to transform health care, boost economic productivity and to make government work better and save taxpayer dollars,'' said John D. Podesta, the counselor to the president, who has been leading the effort, ''but at the same time, those technologies raise concerns about how we protect personal privacy and our other values.''   The president asked Mr. Podesta, who will leave his White House position Feb. 13, to lead the review last year after the leaks by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor.   The renewed push from the White House came on the day after Anthem, one of the nation's largest health insurers, said that the personal information of tens of millions of its customers, including its chief executive, had been compromised in a ''very sophisticated external cyberattack.''   Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the breach was a ''useful opportunity'' to highlight Mr. Obama's cybersecurity and privacy proposals.   ''We are hopeful that by working with Congress, we can make some important progress and take some steps that would actually safeguard the American people and their data,'' Mr. Earnest said.   The White House announced that its student-privacy initiative would be sponsored by Representative Luke Messer, Republican of Indiana, and Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado.   But more comprehensive measures that Mr. Obama favors have yet to find bipartisan support. They include a bill to give Americans more control over how their information is collected and used and a separate measure to require that consumers be notified within 30 days of a breach that compromises their data.   The escalation of cyberattacks like the one on Anthem should add to the urgency, officials said.   ''I'm pretty confident that if we keep the pressure on, and the pressure keeps coming from data breaches, that we can both improve and enhance cybersecurity,'' Mr. Podesta said, ''as well as protect consumers by passing strong data-breach legislation.''   The report on differential pricing -- when companies charge different amounts to different consumers for the same thing -- did not propose new legislation or policies. The practice is not necessarily a problem, said Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, citing familiar examples such as movie theaters charging older adults less for a ticket and airlines giving frequent passengers special fares.   But the report said that the rise of data analytics and of companies collecting vast amounts of personal data on customers increased the risk that characteristics like race, age, gender or religion could drive how prices are set, leading to unfair prices on services like insurance for certain groups.   ''It raises new possibilities for businesses, new ways to empower consumers, but it also creates new challenges that we need to be very mindful of,'' Mr. Furman said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Uncovering Security Flaws in Sites for Schoolchildren,"When Tony Porterfield's two sons came home from elementary school with an assignment to use a reading assessment site called Raz-Kids.com, he was curious, as a parent, to see how it worked. As a software engineer, he was also curious about the site's data security practices. And he was dismayed to discover that the site not only was unencrypted, but also stored passwords in plain text -- security weaknesses that could potentially have allowed unauthorized users to gain access to details like students' names, voice recordings or skill levels. He alerted the site to his concerns. More than a year later, the vulnerabilities remain.    ''A lot of education sites have glaring security problems,'' said Mr. Porterfield, the principal engineer at a software start-up in Los Altos, Calif. ''A big part of the problem is that there's not even any consensus of what 'good security' means for an educational website or app.''    Contacted last week by a reporter, John Campbell, the chief executive of the Cambium Learning Group, the company behind Raz-Kids.com, said that his company took privacy very seriously and that the site did not store sensitive personal details like student addresses or phone numbers.   ''We are confident that we have taken the necessary steps to protect all student and teacher data at all times and comply with all federal and state laws,'' Mr. Campbell wrote in an emailed statement.   Mr. Porterfield, though, has gone on to examine nearly 20 digital education products, used collectively by millions of teachers and students, and found other potential security problems. He alerted makers of those products, too -- among them school-districtwide social networks, classroom assessment programs and learning apps.   Some, including Pearson, a leading educational publisher, and ClassDojo, a popular classroom management app for teachers, addressed the issues he brought to their attention. Others did not.   While none of the security weaknesses appear to have been exploited by hackers, some technologists say they are symptomatic of widespread lapses in student data protection across the education technology sector. They warn that insecure learning sites, apps and messaging services could potentially expose students, many of them under 13, to hacking, identity theft, cyberbullying by their peers, or even unwanted contact from strangers.   At fault, these experts say, is a common practice among start-ups of concentrating primarily on increasing their market share.   ''For many younger companies, the focus has been more on building the product out and less on guaranteeing a level of comprehensive privacy and security protection commensurate with the sensitive information associated with education,'' said Jonathan Mayer, a lawyer and computer science graduate student at Stanford University. ''It seems to be a recurring theme.''   The New York Times asked Mr. Mayer to review the vulnerabilities in education tech software discovered by Mr. Porterfield and described in this article.   To help schools evaluate companies' security practices, the Consortium for School Networking, a national association of school district chief technology officers, published a list of security questions last year for schools to ask before they sign purchase agreements with technology vendors.   ''It is a huge challenge because there hasn't been the time and attention and investment placed in security that school districts need,'' said Keith R. Krueger, the group's chief executive. His group has received financing from Dell, Google, Pearson, Microsoft and other companies involved in the education sector.   Security lapses are not limited to education software devised for prekindergarten through 12th-grade students, an annual market estimated at about $8 billion.   In the fall, as Mr. Mayer, the digital security expert, was preparing to teach a class at Stanford Law School for Coursera, a start-up that provides hundreds of free open online courses, he discovered a security weakness that could have allowed instructors to gain access to the names and email addresses of millions of Coursera students. Another flaw would have potentially allowed other websites, digital advertising networks or online analytics firms to compile lists of the students' courses.   Coursera, which has raised $85 million from investors, quickly ameliorated the situation. In an explanation posted on its site, the company acknowledged that it had been more focused on deflecting potential attacks from outsiders than on the possibility of misuse of student data by insiders.   ''If we were too trusting, we learned our lesson on this,'' Richard C. Levin, the chief executive of Coursera, said in a recent interview.   Protection of student data is gaining attention as schools across the country are increasingly introducing learning sites and apps that may collect information about a student's every keystroke. The idea is to personalize lessons by amassing and analyzing reams of data about each student's actions, tailoring academic material to individual learning levels and preferences.   But some privacy law scholars, educators and technologists contend that federal protections for student data have not kept pace with the scope and sophistication of classroom data-mining. Although a federal privacy law places some limits on how schools, and the vendors to which they outsource school functions, handle students' official educational records, these experts say the protections do not extend to many of the free learning sites and apps that teachers download and use independently in their classrooms.   In an effort to bolster confidence in their products, more than 100 learning companies recently signed on to a voluntary industry pledge on student privacy. The signers agree, among other commitments, to ''maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality and integrity of student personal information against risks -- such as unauthorized access or use.''   Although President Obama endorsed the industry pledge in a speech last month, it does not require ed tech vendors to comply with specific basic security measures -- like encrypting students' names, screen names or other personal details. Nor does it prohibit companies from using weak security, like storing users' passwords in plain text, practices that could easily permit hackers to hijack teacher or student accounts, potentially linking students' names to private details about their academic performance.   These kinds of security weaknesses are commonplace on consumer sites. But the law has long treated educational information as a category worthy of special protections, like credit or medical records. Considering the recent data breaches at even large, well-financed companies like Anthem and Sony, some privacy advocates want federal regulators to mandate that the education technology industry beef up student data protection.   ''Bottom line, both the Federal Trade Commission and the Education Department could and should ramp up their student privacy enforcement,'' said Khaliah Barnes, director of the student privacy project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit group. ''Students have little recourse against current abuses.''   Some learning companies were quite responsive to Mr. Porterfield's concerns. The Pearson product in which he found vulnerabilities last fall is an online student learning and assessment system, Pearson Realize. The weaknesses could have allowed unauthorized users to gain access to details about class rosters like student names.   The company's security experts corrected the issues in two days. Pearson was the only company to ask Mr. Porterfield to run his own tests afterward to make sure the fixes had worked.   ''We should welcome the reporting of even a suspicion,'' said Rod Wallace, Pearson's chief information security officer. ''We need to encourage the people who report them, engage them and let them know we are fixing them.''   Last fall, Mr. Porterfield also contacted ClassDojo, a free classroom management program for teachers that, according to its developer, is used by at least one teacher in roughly one-third of American schools. The software engineer alerted company executives to security weaknesses that could potentially have allowed unauthorized users to gain access to students' names, behavior records and behavior scores.   Since then, ClassDojo has encrypted its mobile apps and instituted other security measures. Liam Don, the co-founder of ClassDojo, said its software was regularly subject to audits by security experts.   ''We hope to see regular audits become standard practice across our industry,'' Mr. Don said.    "
Digital Learning Companies Falling Short of Student Privacy Pledge,"Last month, as part of an article about data security lapses by digital learning companies, I wrote about security vulnerabilities with Raz-Kids.com, a popular reading program for elementary school students. Since then, the service has upgraded its data security by, among other things, encrypting its student accounts.  As of Wednesday morning, however, it had not corrected some other serious security weaknesses, according to a new reportfrom Tony Porterfield, a software engineer and father of two elementary school students who, in his spare time, tests the security practices of digital learning companies.  For instance, Mr. Porterfield noted on his blog, edtechinfosec.org, the reading program had not encrypted teacher and parent accounts. And that security weakness, he said, could potentially allow unauthorized users to access students' personal information - like their real names, audio recordings and reading levels. Cambium Learning Group, the parent company of Raz-Kids, recently signed on to a nationwide student privacy pledge in which signatory companies promise to protect students' personal information. Digital learning products can collect and analyze a wealth of detail about student use of apps and online services. The pledge was designed to reassure parents and teachers that the education technology industry was committed to safeguarding the student information it collected and to using it responsibly.  In a speech at the Federal Trade Commission in January, President Obama endorsed the student privacy pledge. More than 100 companies have signed on, including major ed tech players like Apple, Google, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Microsoft.  Among other things, the pledge requires signatory companies to ""maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of student personal information against risks - such as unauthorized access or use."" Yet, Cambium Learning Group and several other digital learning companies signed the pledge even though, at the time they joined, they had not begun full encryption, an elementary security measure. For school officials, teachers, parents and students, this practice may call into question the trustworthiness of the industry pledge. ""Parents and educators who don't have the training to test for themselves wouldn't be able to tell which companies have reasonable security and which do not,"" Mr. Porterfield said in a phone interview on Wednesday, ""and that makes it hard to trust the pledge."" John Campbell, the chief executive of Cambium Learning, did not return an email seeking comment.  In an email to me last month, he wrote that the company took privacy very seriously. ""We are confident that we have taken the necessary steps to protect all student and teacher data at all times and comply with all Federal and State laws,"" Mr. Campbell wrote in the email. The Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed think tank that helped develop the pledge, is holding a series of workshops to help signatory companies understand their obligations. But that alone is unlikely to deter companies from signing on to the pledge even as they are aware of security vulnerabilities in their digital learning products. ""Security is clearly an area where ed tech start-ups have to make progress,"" said Jules Polonetsky, the executive director of the Future of Privacy Forum. He added: ""Companies that don't provide strong security for sensitive data can be at legal risk for violating the pledge, state laws, and contractual commitments."" "
CES: F.T.C. Chairwoman Notes Concerns Raised by Connected Devices,"The head of the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday offered a prescription for protecting consumer data collected by Internet-connected gadgets like wearable fitness trackers and ""smart home"" devices, previewing themes of a coming report by the agency on Internet privacy and security.  ""In the not-too-distant future, many, if not most, aspects of our everyday lives will be digitally observed and stored,"" Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the F.T.C., wrote in remarks for a speech Tuesday afternoon at the International CES technology industry event in Las Vegas. ""That data trove will contain a wealth of revealing information that, when patched together, will present a deeply personal and startlingly complete picture of each of us."" The F.T.C. has been scrutinizing the data collection practices of the technology industry for their effect on consumer privacy. For example, Ms. Ramirez has spoken publicly about the merits of ""privacy by design,"" in which privacy controls are built into a product from the outset instead of as an afterthought. Notably, she used her speech on Tuesday to expand that principle to data security, warning that, beyond the series of public hacking attacks affecting Sony and other companies last year, 2015 would be the year that ""smart-home hacking"" became a realistic threat. ""Any device that is connected to the Internet is at risk of being hijacked,"" said Ms. Ramirez, who added that the large number of Internet-connected devices would ""increase the number of access points"" for hackers. Ms. Ramirez seemed to be directing her remarks at the start-ups that are making most of the products - like fitness trackers and glucose monitors - driving the so-called Internet of Things. She said that some of these developers, in contrast to traditional hardware and software makers, ""have not spent decades thinking about how to secure their products and services from hackers."" Beyond security, Ms. Ramirez said that technology companies needed to pay more attention to so-called data minimization, in which they collect only the personal data they need for a specific purpose and delete it permanently afterward. She directly challenged the widespread contention in the technology industry that it is necessary to collect large volumes of data because new uses might be uncovered. ""I question the notion that we must put sensitive consumer data at risk on the off chance a company might someday discover a valuable use for the information,"" she said. She also said that technology companies should be more transparent about the way they use personal data and should simplify their terms of use. A spokesman for Ms. Ramirez, Justin Cole, said the speech was intended to set the stage for an F.T.C. report on the Internet of Things. It is expected in the next few weeks. "
Survey Finds Americans Don't Trust Government and Companies to Protect Privacy,"Americans highly value the privacy of their personal information and communications, but they have little faith that the government and private companies will actual protect their data, according to a report to be published Wednesday by the Pew Research Center.   The survey research, conducted online in 2014 and early 2015, found that more than nine in 10 adults said that controlling who gets access to their private information and what information those people can see is important to them. But half of the people surveyed felt they had little or no control over their data. Nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed said that the current limits on telephone and Internet data collected by the government were inadequate, even when the government says such information is needed to combat terrorism. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that the government's current bulk collection of telephone data is illegal. The House has voted to change the program to keep such data with the phone companies until the government requests it, and the Senate is expected to consider the legislation soon. It's not just the government that Americans don't trust. Corporations fared no better in the survey, with 76 percent of adults saying they had little confidence in online advertisers to keep their information private. More than two-thirds of adults said they were not confident that social media sites, search engine providers or online video sites protect their information. Although the researchers did not ask about specific companies, those attitudes could easily be interpreted as distrust of the big companies that dominate those categories, such as Facebook, the largest social network, and Google, the biggest player in web searches and online video. Pew also found that Americans have a general aversion to being monitored, with more than half saying they did not want to be watched at work or in public. At the same time, there seemed to be a general acknowledgment that surveillance is pervasive, with 81 percent of the respondents saying it was difficult to avoid being monitored by cameras in public places. Although respondents said they had taken some actions to protect their privacy, such as deleting the web tracking software known as cookies or lying about personal information when asked to fill out a form, few had resorted to more serious measures such as encrypting their personal data. Perhaps that was because two-thirds of those surveyed said they didn't believe it would be very hard for a determined person or organization to ferret out their personal information online. Pew's report was based on two separate surveys. One, conducted in January and February, surveyed a representative sample of 461 American adults on an ongoing research panel and had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. The other survey of 498 adults from the same panel was conducted in August and September, and had a similar margin of error of 6 percentage points. "
U.S. vs. Hackers: Still Lopsided Despite Years of Warnings and a Recent Push,"WASHINGTON -- In the month since a devastating computer systems breach at the Office of Personnel Management, digital Swat teams have been racing to plug the most glaring security holes in government computer networks and prevent another embarrassing theft of personal information, financial data and national security secrets. But senior cybersecurity officials, lawmakers and technology experts said in interviews that the 30-day ''cybersprint'' ordered by President Obama after the attacks is little more than digital triage on federal computer networks that are cobbled together with out-of-date equipment and defended with the software equivalent of Bubble Wrap.    In an effort to highlight its corrective actions, the White House will announce shortly that teams of federal employees and volunteer hackers have made progress over the last month. At some agencies, 100 percent of users are, for the first time, logging in with two-factor authentication, a basic security feature, officials said. Security holes that have lingered for years despite obvious fixes are being patched. And thousands of low-level employees and contractors with access to the nation's most sensitive secrets have been cut off.    But officials and experts acknowledge that the computer networks of many federal agencies remain highly vulnerable to sophisticated cybercriminals, who are often sponsored by other countries. Another breach like the one in June, which exposed information on 21 million people, remains a threat -- despite repeated alarms over the years that government computer systems were vulnerable to exactly that kind of attack. Asked in congressional testimony this month to grade the federal government's cybersecurity efforts on a scale of A to F, a senior government auditor gave the government a D.   Even senior White House officials acknowledge how much remains to be done. ''It's safe to say that federal agencies are not where we want them to be across the board,'' Michael Daniel, Mr. Obama's top cybersecurity adviser, said in an interview. He said the bureaucracy needed a ''mind-set shift'' that would put computer security at the top of a long list of priorities. ''We clearly need to be moving faster.''   Despite high-profile incidents, including the theft of secrets by the national security contractor Edward J. Snowden, many government agencies have demonstrated little commitment to making cybersecurity a priority.   After neglect that has been documented in dozens of audits for nearly two decades, the federal government is still far behind its adversaries. And it is still struggling to procure the latest technological defenses or attract the kind of digital security expertise necessary to secure its networks.   As recently as this year, officials showed little urgency in confronting dangers from the bits and bytes flying across their networks.   A January audit of the Federal Aviation Administration cited ''significant security control weaknesses'' in the agency's network, ''placing the safe and uninterrupted operation of the nation's air traffic control system at increased and unnecessary risk.'' But that agency had been warned for years that its computer networks were wide open to attack. In 2009, hackers stole personal information for 48,000 agency employees, prompting an investigation that found 763 high-risk vulnerabilities -- any one of which, auditors said, could give attackers access to the computers that run the air traffic control system.   This glacial pace of change, former Federal Aviation Administration officials said, was not for their lack of trying. Michael Brown, who served as the agency's chief information security officer for a decade, called the 2009 episode his ''scariest moment'' and said he had frequently been frustrated by the government's failure to address the obvious security holes in the most important networks.   ''You come up with binders full of documentation, and then at the end of the day, you don't have any money to go back and ameliorate,'' Mr. Brown said. ''The system could be hanging out there for a long time with a vulnerability.''   The story has been much the same at other agencies. At the Department of Energy, after other breaches there, a hacker spent a month stealing personnel records from an unencrypted database in the summer of 2013. By the time Robert F. Brese, the department's top cybersecurity official, was notified, the hacker had drained 104,000 names, addresses and Social Security numbers from its systems.   ''It was just this sickening feeling in my stomach,'' Mr. Brese, now a consultant, recalled.   In the days that followed, investigators found numerous holes in the Energy Department's network that contained sensitive information on nuclear propulsion and critical infrastructure. Government auditors slammed the department for lax security controls, lack of encryption and a failure to patch known vulnerabilities.   And while that could have served as an early warning, the breach was met with a shrug at other agencies. At the Internal Revenue Service, auditors identified 69 vulnerabilities in the agency's networks last year, but when officials there told Government Accountability Office auditors this year that they had fixed 24 of those problems, investigators found only 14 had been resolved.   ''That's been a recurring theme,'' said Gregory C. Wilshusen, the Government Accountability Office's top computer systems investigator. ''They believe they've taken corrective actions, but when one goes back to check, we find that they haven't. It just perpetuates the vulnerability and gives I.R.S. a false sense of security.'' In May, the agency was forced to concede that hackers had gained access to the tax returns of some 100,000 citizens.   The dangers are accelerating as hackers repeatedly target computer networks used to collect taxes, secure ports and airports, run air traffic control systems, process student loans, oversee the nation's nuclear stockpile, monitor the Federal Reserve and support the armed services. Last year, officials say, there were more than 67,000 computer-related incidents at federal agencies, up from about 5,000 in 2006.   Officials at all levels may finally be paying attention in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hacking. Lawmakers are considering legislation to require sharing of information about malicious hacks and to set cybersecurity standards for federal systems.   ''This is going to have to be an area of much greater focus,'' said Senator Mark R. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, a supporter of the legislation.   Tony Scott, the federal government's chief information officer, who arrived this year from Microsoft and VMware, vowed to make sure they did.   ''I'm not going to let up,'' he promised in an interview. ''We are going to bring every bit of pressure we can bring.''   Across the government, there is evidence of new anxiety. On the ''watch floor'' of the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, dozens of specialists monitor potential intrusions on government networks. Large screens flash yellow or red to warn of potential surges in network traffic or attempts to breach systems by known hackers.   But the most advanced defenses have yet to be fully installed. Major agencies will not have them for a year, and smaller ones could take longer, officials said. And legal, political and bureaucratic roadblocks still make it difficult for officials to cajole their colleagues to take action quickly.   Department of Homeland Security officials must continually trek to Capitol Hill for approval of the most mundane organizational shifts. ''I thought my head would blow off when I had to get approval from people who had no idea what we were doing,'' said Mark Weatherford, the former deputy under secretary for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security.   He noted that such bureaucratic obstacles made it difficult for the department to compete in the cutthroat war for talented security specialists. ''It takes far too long,'' said Mr. Weatherford, now a principal at the Chertoff Group, an advisory firm in Washington. ''I can't tell you how many good people we lost at D.H.S. because they couldn't wait four to six months for the hiring process.''   The agency has had a hard time competing with the likes of Google, start-ups and other agencies for top talent. The Office of Personnel Management runs a program that offers grants to students who specialize in cybersecurity in exchange for their help defending government networks. Between 2002 and 2014, 55 of the program's 1,500 graduates went to work for the Department of Homeland Security, compared with 407 who worked for the National Security Agency.   Eric Cornelius, an graduate of the program who served as Homeland Security's deputy director and chief technical analyst for its control systems security program, stayed only 18 months before leaving for Cylance, a security start-up. He said hiring was only half the problem. 'The other half of the problem is the need to address firing reform,'' Mr. Cornelius said. ''In my experience, complacency is the enemy of competency.''   But Mr. Scott said the sprint was just a prelude to a complete cultural overhaul. ''We need to dramatically change how we're thinking about this,'' he said. ''Just because there's a sprint doesn't mean this is the end.''    "
New York Attorney General Seeks Expanded Reporting Requirements on Data Breaches,"Across much of the United States, companies are not required to report a data breach if it is limited to the theft of email addresses and passwords, even though many companies do so of their own volition. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, intends on Thursday to propose a bill that would expand his state's definition of what constitutes the type of private information whose breach would mandate a disclosure to include email addresses and passwords. Companies would be required to keep this data secure and notify consumers and employees in the event of a cyberattack or other data breach involving that information. The proposal would be a significant change to the state's current definition, which mainly covers the unintended disclosure of a person's Social Security number, driver's license or credit card number. The proposal would update a consumer protection measure that Mr. Schneiderman sees as ""outdated and toothless,"" given a growing number of hackings at big companies.  ""It's long past time we updated our data security law and expanded protections for consumers,"" Mr. Schneiderman said. The attorney general, a Democrat, expects to attract both Democratic and Republican sponsors for the bill, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The attorney general, who cannot introduce a bill on his own, wants the proposal in New York to become a model for expanding the safeguarding of personal information in other states. Earlier this week, President Obama said that he intended to push for a federal law that would set a national standard for when companies must inform consumers of a breach that resulted in the disclosure or theft of personal information. The measure would require companies to notify consumers within 30 days of the discovery of an incident. The various proposals to stiffen company reporting requirements in the case of a data breach come after several prominent corporate hackings, including those at Target, Home Depot, Staples, JPMorgan Chase and Sony Pictures. Last summer, Mr. Schneiderman issued a report that said the number of data breaches reported to New York authorities had more than tripled from 2006 to 2013. In New York, the proposed expanded definition of private information would also include data about a consumer or employee's medical history, health insurance information or biometric data. The expanded definition would go beyond a standard adopted in California in 2013 that also requires companies to notify consumers if their email addresses or passwords are pilfered or hacked. Last summer, Florida stiffened its breach notification requirements as well. Biometric identification of consumers and employees is likely to grow in the coming years. Apple, for instance, is already using a fingerprint identification system - a type of biometric data - in its Apple Pay electronic payment system. For several years, some banks have used biometric identification systems to safeguard access to safe deposit boxes. The New York bill would reward businesses for taking steps to protect personal information and cooperating quickly with New York authorities in the event of a breach. It would provide them some protection from liability in civil lawsuits if they can demonstrate having taken adequate steps to protect private information from being hacked or inadvertently released. ""We are trying to find a way that businesses can pick up the phone and report an incident without feeling like law enforcement is breathing down their necks, while at the same time allowing us to do meaningful investigations and get to the root of why consumers weren't adequately protected,"" Mr. Schneiderman said of his proposal. The measure would include some guideposts about the kind of security measures large corporations and small businesses should be expected to enact to protect customer and employee personal information. New York's current law concerning the notification of security breaches has not been updated since 2005. Mr. Schneiderman is part of a group of about 15 state attorneys general who have been conducting an investigation into last summer's cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase that affected 83 million consumers and small businesses. The attorneys general want the bank, the nation's largest in terms of assets, to explain how it can be certain that no sensitive account information was compromised. The group, led by the state attorneys general from Illinois and Connecticut, sent a letter on Jan. 8 to JPMorgan and its outside lawyers seeking more details about the nature of the breach and what measures the bank is taking to prevent a similar incident. JPMorgan has said the breach, which went undetected at the bank for at least two months, resulted in the hackers' getting access to only customer phone numbers, addresses and email addresses. More sensitive information, like financial information, Social Security numbers, and email password and user identification combinations, remained safe, the bank said. JPMorgan began working with federal law enforcement officials in the investigation of the breach shortly after it was discovered in early August. The bank has noted that under existing federal and state laws it was not required to publicly disclose the breach to consumers since the data taken was largely contact information, yet it did so on its own accord. "
Traffic Hacking: Caution Light Is On,"A year ago, Cesar Cerrudo flew to Washington, strolled over to Capitol Hill and pulled out his laptop. Then he began to hack the city's traffic system. The traffic lights - like so many he had tested before in Manhattan and elsewhere - were wide open to attack. Mr. Cerrudo, an Argentine security researcher at IOActive Labs, an Internet security company, found he could turn red lights green and green lights red. He could have gridlocked the whole town with the touch of a few keys, or turned a busy thoroughfare into a fast-paced highway. He could have paralyzed emergency responders, or shut down all roads to the Capitol. Instead, Mr. Cerrudo approached the company that designs city traffic sensors, but does not encrypt the traffic running through them, in hopes executives would fix the security hole. When he was ignored, he blogged about the vulnerability in hopes that people would wake up to the issue and pressure cities to get it fixed. ""What I found is that cities are filled with security problems that could have a very direct and physical impact on our lives,"" Mr. Cerrudo said in a recent interview.  He is hacking into cities' traffic infrastructure as security flaws in municipal technology networks are becoming a growing problem. For the last three years, government officials - and security specialists long before them - have warned that malicious hackers could shut down so-called smart cities, where network sensors connect traffic, water, waste and air management systems and the electric grid online to increase efficiency. As it stands, no comprehensive system exists for vetting security and responding to cyberattacks at the municipal level. Spending on smart city technology is also soaring around the globe. In Saudi Arabia, $70 million has been poured into a project to build four smart cities. In South Africa, $7.4 billion has been funneled into a smart city project that is underway. By 2023, spending on smart cities will reach $27.5 billion, according to an estimate by Navigant Research. ""It's going to be a machine planet pretty soon,"" said David Jordan, the chief information security officer for Arlington County, Va. ""They're going to be telling us what to do if nobody starts paying attention."" Already, incidents involving computer bugs in traffic systems have caused havoc, with one such bug closing down San Francisco's public train system two years ago, trapping passengers underground. In 2006, during a labor strike, two Los Angeles traffic engineers were accused of hacking smart traffic light systems at only four major Los Angeles intersections. The ensuing gridlock lasted four days, clogging entries to Los Angeles International Airport and the on ramp to the Glendale Freeway, and turning major intersections in Studio City and downtown into parking lots. Yet the Obama administration, which has called cybersecurity a top priority, has failed to persuade regulators that the threat to the nation's critical infrastructure is real. Cybersecurity legislation stalled in the Senate after Republicans argued that mandating basic security for the private companies that oversee the nation's dams, water treatment facilities and the power grid would be too onerous. After a Republican filibuster, President Obama signed an executive order two years ago that set cybersecurity recommendations for companies that oversee the country's critical infrastructure like utilities, dams and bridges. Yet the order lacked teeth because, without legislation, the recommendations are voluntary. That is where hackers like Mr. Cerrudo have stepped in, hoping to illustrate the extent of the problem by breaking into the systems themselves. He has demonstrated how 200,000 control sensors for traffic flow in major cities like New York, San Francisco and Washington were open to attack. Because vendors did not encrypt the data running through their systems, Mr. Cerrudo could intercept and alter traffic sensors from 1,500 feet away, or even by drone. Mr. Cerrudo is also hacking away at public apathy about security issues by using another tack: He is starting a nonprofit initiative, Securing Smart Cities, that aims to bring together security researchers and officials in the public and private sectors to tackle the vulnerabilities in increasingly connected cities, before another 50 billion devices go online in the next five years. ""This is where everyone lives, including myself, and I am tired of pointing out the problem without offering a solution,"" Mr. Cerrudo said. He and his colleagues are aiming for defenses like encryption and passwords, and a proper process for patching holes like the ones discovered in traffic sensors. Ideally, cities will start tracking access to their systems, run regular tests to look for loopholes and set up emergency response teams that can solicit vulnerability reports from hackers, coordinate patches and share that information across cities. They also want to create manual overrides for all smart city systems, in the event attackers take control. Some municipalities are paying close attention to the issue. In Arlington County, Mr. Jordan said his proximity to the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation made his county's situation unique. He has put together a ""fusion"" team of computer forensics specialists at the county police department, network engineers, and his security vendors at Palo Alto Networks, Trend Micro and Symantec. He also has an alert system to notify 22 other jurisdictions if his county comes under a cyberattack. No law or requirement mandates that the nation's other 3,100 or so counties do the same. In Arlington County, while the law requires that a government official manage the county's records and archives, no digital equivalent requires one person to track and monitor for suspicious activity on the networks for traffic, sewerage or the power grid. ""I don't think the federal government, or the states know the status of cyber in all those counties,"" Mr. Jordan said. ""Cyber has yet to become a tenet of government, largely because nobody understands this, and they certainly don't like it because it's expensive."" Mr. Jordan is working with Mr. Cerrudo and others, including Alan Seow, former head of cybersecurity preparedness for Singapore, and top security specialists from Symantec, Kaspersky Labs and Bastille to raise awareness of the increasing vulnerabilities in cities and counties as more of their critical systems move online. ""There's been a huge disconnect between those in the security community, who do all the complaining, and those affected,"" said Patrick Nielsen, a security researcher at Kaspersky. ""The big goal of this project is to connect those in the security community with officials in cities to understand what the risks are, and how to neutralize them."" Security researchers have long been accused of fostering ""FUD,"" an acronym for fear, uncertainty and doubt, to sell their products. As a result, Mr. Cerrudo said he and others had purposely set up their initiative as a nonprofit project. ""We are not selling anything,"" he said. ""The technologies are broad, the problem is huge, and we didn't want to point out problems without offering solutions. The only way to solve this is going to be collaboration."" The potential for damage, he and others said, has already eclipsed the hypothetical. Last year, a Russian hacking group, known to researchers as Dragonfly and Energetic Bear, was found to be probing power networks in the United States and Europe. In 2013, the Homeland Security Department acknowledged that the energy industry became the most-targeted sector for hackers in the United States, accounting for 56 percent of the 257 attacks reported to the agency that year. And last year, the agency acknowledged in a report that ""a sophisticated threat actor"" had broken into a public utility's control system using a simple attack. The attacker just guessed the password to a system that never should have been plugged into the Internet in the first place, the agency said. Just how far Mr. Cerrudo can take his initiative is open to debate. A year after publishing his findings on traffic sensor research, Mr. Cerrudo tested San Francisco's traffic light system and found that the city had still not encrypted its traffic sensor data, leaving the city wide open to attack. ""Every day, cities incorporate a new 'smart' technology, without any testing,"" he said. ""What they don't realize is that they are putting citizens and businesses at risk. If that technology is not protected, people will suffer the consequences."" "
Facebook Wins a Round in Austrian Court Case,"A court in Vienna has rejected a class-action suit against Facebook that centered on how the social network collected and used data on its 1.4 billion users.  The case was led by Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, who had collected roughly 60,000 signatures from people around the world as part of the lawsuit - the largest privacy class-action case brought against Facebook. The lawsuit was one of a growing number of regulatory headaches for Facebook in Europe, as policy makers and regulators question the company's growing power over how individuals in the region access online services. Mr. Schrems, who said he planned to appeal the decision by mid-July, and who has filed several other legal challenges against the social network, had accused Facebook of violating European privacy rules, which provide greater protection for how personal data is used than do United States laws. ""You always run this risk with these complicated cases,'' he said, ""because they can take years to play out in the courts."" Facebook had strongly denied the accusations, and late Monday the Vienna Regional Court rejected the effort by Mr. Schrems, saying that his prominent public role in challenging Facebook's use of personal data meant that he could not pursue the civil litigation. The court also said that it did not have jurisdiction for many of the complainants, as they were not based in Austria. Facebook said in a statement that the litigation had been ""unnecessary"" but that it was pleased by the ruling. Facebook could have faced penalties of up to $14 million if it was found to have breached Europe's data protection rules. The company, led by its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is at the center of a growing debate in Europe about how online personal data should be collected and used. At least five European regulators - Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain - are investigating whether the social network's revamped privacy policy complies with their national data-protection laws. The new policy, which came into force worldwide in January, gives Facebook more power to use information in users' posts, messages and other online interactions for the company's main business goal: to sell more advertising. European regulators are examining whether such use of online data offers individuals sufficient control over how information about them is used. While many European regulators have pursued investigations of Facebook, the company says that because its international headquarters are in Dublin, it falls under - and complies with - rules from the Irish data protection authority. Yet in a recent interview, Helen Dixon, the Irish data protection chief, said her office was still investigating whether Facebook's new privacy policy met those standards. ""We're still examining the Facebook case,"" she said. ""We haven't yet come to a conclusion."" "
Researcher Discovers Superfish Spyware Installed on Lenovo PCs,"Lenovo, the Chinese tech giant, was shipping PCs with spyware that tracks its customers' every move online, and renders the computers vulnerable to hackers. Lenovo, the world's largest PC manufacturer, was installing Superfish, a particularly pernicious form of adware that siphons data from a user's machine via web browser. Banking and e-commerce sites, or any web page that purports to be secure with the image of a tiny padlock, are made vulnerable.  The adware discovery was made early last month by Peter Horne, a 25-year veteran of the financial services technology industry, after he bought a brand-new Lenovo Yoga 2 Notepad at a computer retailer in Sydney, Australia.  Even though the PC came with McAfee antivirus software, Mr. Horne said, he installed antivirus software made by Trend Micro. Neither virus scanner picked up any adware on the machine. But Mr. Horne noted that traffic from the PC was being redirected to a website called best-deals-products.com. When he dug further, he found that website's server was making calls to Superfish adware. Superfish's ""visual discovery"" adware, Mr. Horne and others now say, is far more intrusive than typical adware. It not only drops ads into a user's web browser sessions, it hijacks a secure browsing session and scoops up data as users enter it into secure websites.  Superfish does this so it can introduce ads into an otherwise encrypted web page, but the way it does so compromises the security of trusted websites and makes it easy for other hackers to intercept users' communications. Mr. Horne returned his PC, and went on to test Lenovo's demonstration machines at Best Buys in New York and Boston, and other retailers in Sydney and Perth. There, he found the adware on other Lenovo Yoga 2 models and the Lenovo Edge 15. ""The company had placed the adware a very low-level part of the operating system,"" Mr. Horne said in an interview. ""If they can do that, they can do anything."" In a statement issued Thursday, Lenovo said it had included Superfish in some consumer notebook products shipped between September and December ""to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping."" Citing bad user reviews, the company said it stopped including the adware in January, the same month Mr. Horne brought the issue to the company's attention. ""The problem is: what can we trust?"" Mr. Horne said. "
Obama to Announce Cybersecurity Plans in State of the Union Preview,"WASHINGTON -- President Obama will announce new initiatives next week designed to bolster online security and improve access to cyberspace, White House officials said Saturday. In a series of speeches, Mr. Obama will call for better safeguards against identity theft, improved privacy protection, enhanced cybersecurity for the government and private companies, and increased access to high-speed broadband connections across the country.     A White House official said in a statement to reporters that the president would ''lay out a series of legislative proposals and executive actions that will be in his State of the Union that will tackle identity theft and privacy issues, cybersecurity, and access to the Internet.''   The president's proposals are part of what the White House calls ''SOTU Spoilers,'' a series of announcements that preview Mr. Obama's State of the Union address, which he is scheduled to deliver to a joint session of Congress on Jan. 20.   Presidents typically keep State of the Union proposals secret until the last minute, hoping to maximize the political power of the speech. But the White House decided to reverse that strategy, rolling out proposals in the hope of building momentum for the address.   ''I wanted to give you a little preview,'' Mr. Obama told an audience on Friday in Knoxville, Tenn., where he unveiled a plan to make the first two years of community college free for all students. ''Don't tell anybody I said this. I'm giving you the inside scoop.''   In recent days, Mr. Obama also discussed the recovery of the auto industry in Detroit and announced housing proposals during a speech in Phoenix. Officials said he would unveil his high-tech proposals in remarks next week at the Federal Trade Commission and the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. Mr. Obama will also travel to Iowa, where he will discuss access to high-speed broadband.   Concern about cybersecurity and safety has increased after the recent hack on Sony Pictures, which the United States government says was the work of the North Korean government. Mr. Obama has tried for three years to persuade Congress to pass a cybersecurity bill, and administration officials hope that the severity of the Sony attack and the hacking of retailers like Home Depot and Target will change the political dynamic. But businesses are still wary of new federal requirements, and Mr. Obama now faces a Congress controlled by Republicans who are skeptical of his proposals.   Saturday's announcement by the White House also did not make clear whether the president intended to confront some of the toughest questions raised by the recent hacking: When should the federal government step in to fight hackers? And is America's own use of cyberweapons a complicating factor?   The White House also said Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would travel next week to Norfolk, Va., to announce new funding to help train people to work in the field of cybersecurity.    "
Obama Calls for New Cooperation to Wrangle the 'Wild West' Internet,"PALO ALTO, Calif. --  Declaring that the Internet has become the ''Wild Wild West'' with consumers and industries as top targets, President Obama on Friday called for a new era of cooperation between the government and the private sector to defeat a range of fast-evolving online threats. Mr. Obama signed an executive order urging companies to join information-sharing hubs to exchange data on online threats -- and, in some cases, to receive classified information from the government. But the order stopped short of exempting the companies from liability if the data they collected and shared led to legal action.     Only legislation, which Mr. Obama has tried and failed to get through Congress for three years, can exempt the companies from such liability. Many companies outside the financial industry have been reluctant to share data without such a law in place.   Mr. Obama deliberately chose Stanford University as the site of the first summit meeting on online security and consumer protection, saying that it was where much of the Internet was born and is also where the innovations to secure it must be developed.   ''The very technologies that can empower us to do great good can also be used to undermine us and do great harm,'' Mr. Obama said.   Mr. Obama also made clear that his six years of presidency had given him new appreciation of how the government will be called upon to protect citizens against the most severe attacks, and once again accused North Korea of hacking into Sony Pictures. ''The cyberworld is the Wild Wild West -- to some degree we're asked to be the sheriff,'' he said. ''When something like Sony happens, people want to know what the government can do about this.''   Mr. Obama arrived in the heart of Silicon Valley at a time of great tension with companies here, including Apple and Google, both represented at the event. Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was seated to Mr. Obama's left Friday afternoon at a closed-door lunch meeting with senior executives, only months after coming into direct conflict with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence agencies over the full encryption of its mobile devices.   Mr. Obama's intelligence and law enforcement aides would like to preserve access to all digital communication with a court order. The companies say that would create a breach that China and Russia, among others, would exploit.   Mr. Cook, who was invited to the meeting to discuss Apple's new payment system, Apple Pay, used the occasion to urge government and technology leaders to do everything they can to protect users' rights to privacy and security.   ''People have entrusted us with their most personal and precious information,'' Mr. Cook said. ''We owe them nothing less than the best protections that we can possibly provide.''   Failing to do so, Mr. Cook said, would ''risk our way of life.''   The private sector has largely been reluctant to share information about threats with the government, arguing that it would create onerous regulations and potentially compromise proprietary and customer data.   Joseph M. Demarest Jr., assistant director of the F.B.I.'s cyberdivision, said in an interview that given the sophistication of the hackers American companies are up against, information-sharing had proved critical to tracing attacks back to hackers and ridding them from systems.    ''We're fighting Ph.D.s on the other side of the world,'' Mr. Demarest said. ''Not only the F.B.I., but our colleagues from the intelligence community, can enable and assist not only with attribution but with kicking actors out and keeping them out.''    After the Sony attacks late last year, Mr. Demarest said the F.B.I.'s presence at Sony's headquarters was crucial in helping the government trace the attacks back to North Korea.    ''Companies are realizing there is a benefit to keeping us involved,'' he said.   But businesses reeling from the fallout of the revelations about online surveillance from the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden worry about the impression such sharing would create among customers. Foreign governments are worried that such arrangements will compromise their data.   Privacy activists say the approach is misguided. ''Key to security is to minimize data collection and adopt robust security measures,'' said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''If they can't protect it, they shouldn't collect it.''   But few of those tensions were on display on Friday, as Mr. Obama, government officials and a carefully curated list of executives from the technology, banking, energy and health care sectors took the stage to speak for the need for greater public-private partnership in combating online threats.   ''This work cannot be adversarial; we have enough adversaries out there,'' Anthony Earley Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Pacific Gas & Electric, said on stage Friday.   Many companies point out that they already share information with others in their industries through industry-specific instruments, notably the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a group that shares threats with members of the banking industry.   And companies have been particularly reluctant, after the Snowden revelations, to do anything to aggravate concerns abroad that they are sharing data on foreigners with intelligence agencies.   To assuage those concerns, Bernard Tyson, the chairman of Kaiser Permanente, tried to distinguish the kinds of data his corporation would share with the government.   ''I am not talking about sharing the actual content that I am here to protect,'' Mr. Tyson said. ''It is sharing what I am learning about people trying to get at that content. It's important for me to say that because that is the sensitivity I hear every day.''   Not mentioned at the event was the issue that has most roiled companies in Silicon Valley. Disclosures by Mr. Snowden showed that intelligence agencies were surreptitiously siphoning off customer data from companies like Google and Yahoo as it flowed internally between their data centers.   That information created an atmosphere of distrust that executives say will make information-sharing much more difficult.   ''The tricky thing with information-sharing is that it is about trust,'' Eric Grosse, Google's vice president of security, said in an interview earlier this week. ''Information-sharing becomes pretty hard to do once trust is lost.''    "
"U.S. Embedded Spyware, Report Says","SAN FRANCISCO --  The United States has found a way to permanently embed surveillance and sabotage tools in computers and networks it has targeted in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, China, Afghanistan and other countries closely watched by American intelligence agencies, according to a Russian cybersecurity firm. In a presentation of its findings at a conference in Mexico on Monday, Kaspersky Lab, the Russian firm, said that the implants had been placed by what it called the ''Equation Group,'' which appears to be a veiled reference to the National Security Agency and its military counterpart, United States Cyber Command.     It linked the techniques to those used in Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled about 1,000 centrifuges in Iran's nuclear enrichment program. It was later revealed that Stuxnet was part of a program code-named Olympic Games and run jointly by Israel and the United States.   Kaspersky's report said that Olympic Games had similarities to a much broader effort to infect computers well beyond those in Iran. It detected particularly high infection rates in computers in Iran, Pakistan and Russia, three countries whose nuclear programs the United States routinely monitors.   Some of the implants burrow so deep into the computer systems, Kaspersky said, that they infect the ''firmware,'' the embedded software that preps the computer's hardware before the operating system starts. It is beyond the reach of existing antivirus products and most security controls, Kaspersky reported, making it virtually impossible to wipe out.   In many cases, it also allows the American intelligence agencies to grab the encryption keys off a machine, unnoticed, and unlock scrambled contents. Moreover, many of the tools are designed to run on computers that are disconnected from the Internet, which was the case in the computers controlling Iran's nuclear enrichment plants.   Kaspersky noted that of the more than 60 attack groups it was tracking in cyberspace, the so-called Equation Group ''surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades.''   Kaspersky Lab was founded by Eugene Kaspersky, who studied cryptography at a high school co-sponsored by the K.G.B. and once worked for the Russian military. Its studies, including one describing a cyberattack of more than 100 banks and other financial institutions in 30 countries, are considered credible by Western experts.   The fact that security software made by Kaspersky Lab is not used by many American government agencies has made it more trusted by other governments, like those of Iran and Russia, whose systems are closely watched by United States intelligence agencies. That gives Kaspersky a front-row seat to America's digital espionage operations.   The firm's researchers say that what makes these attacks particularly remarkable is their way of attacking the actual firmware of the computers. Only in rare cases are cybercriminals able to get into the actual guts of a machine.   Recovering from a cyberattack typically involves wiping the computer's operating system and reinstalling software, or replacing a computer's hard drive. But if the firmware becomes infected, security experts say, it can turn even the most sophisticated computer into a useless piece of metal.   In the past, security experts have warned about ''the race to the bare metal'' of a machine. As security around software has increased, criminals have looked for ways to infect the actual hardware of the machine. Firmware is about the closest to the bare metal you can get -- a coveted position that allows the attacker not only to hide from antivirus products but also to reinfect a machine even if its hard drive is wiped.   ''If the malware gets into the firmware, it is able to resurrect itself forever,'' Costin Raiu, a Kaspersky threat researcher, said in the report. ''It means that we are practically blind and cannot detect hard drives that have been infected with this malware.''   The possibility of such an attack is one that math researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the Commerce Department, have long cautioned about but have very rarely seen. In an interview last year, Andrew Regenscheid, a math researcher at the institute, warned that such attacks were extremely powerful. If the firmware becomes corrupted, Mr. Regenscheid said, ''your computer won't boot up and you can't use it. You have to replace the computer to recover from that attack.''   That kind of attack also makes for a powerful encryption-cracking tool, Mr. Raiu noted, because it gives attackers the ability to capture a machine's encryption password, store it in ''an invisible area inside the computer's hard drive'' and unscramble a machine's contents.   Kaspersky's report also detailed the group's efforts to map out so-called air-gapped systems that are not connected to the Internet, including Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and infect them using a USB stick. To get those devices onto the machines, the report said, the attackers have in some cases intercepted them in transit.   Documents revealed by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden detailed the agency's plans to leap the ''air gaps'' that separate computers from the outside world, including efforts to install specialized hardware on computers being shipped to a target country. That hardware can then receive low-frequency radio waves broadcast from a suitcase-size device that the N.S.A. has deployed around the world. At other times the air gaps have been leapt by having a spy physically install a USB stick to infect the adversary's computer.   Basing its estimate on the time stamps in code, the Kaspersky presentation said the Equation Group had been infecting computers since 2001, but aggressively began ramping up their capabilities in 2008, the year that President Obama was elected, and began doubling down on digital tools to spy on adversaries of America.   While the United States has never acknowledged conducting any offensive cyberoperations, President Obama discussed the issue in general in an interview on Friday with Re/code, an online computer industry publication, describing offensive cyberweapons as being unlike traditional weapons.   ''This is more like basketball than football, in the sense that there's no clear line between offense and defense,'' said Mr. Obama, himself a basketball player. ''Things are going back and forth all the time.''    "
"Brokerage Firms Most Worried About Hackers and Rogue Employees, Finra Report Says","The destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment last fall that federal authorities linked to the North Korean government raised alarm bells about the hacking threat posed by foreign governments. But brokerage firms based in the United States remain most concerned about an attack carried out by a loose band of hackers or employees with a grudge. A report released on Tuesday by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industry's self-regulatory organization, said a survey of about 20 brokerage firms found the threat of an online attack by nation or a terrorist group ranked near the bottom of the industry's concerns.   Concerns about state-sponsored attacks were highest at big investment banks. But few of the largest firms surveyed by Finra put such attacks at the top of their list. All the firms said they had little concerned about a hack carried out by a competitor. The results of the survey were included in a Finra report that focused on best practices that brokerage firms should enact to prevent serious attacks that can compromise customer personal and financial information. The organization conducted the survey last year to gain a better understanding of what brokerage firms, both large and small, are doing to guard against a serious attack. In another sign of just how important the threat of an attack has become for the financial services industry, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its own report on Tuesday that examined how prepared Wall Street investment banks and brokerage firms are to repel hackers bent on accessing their digital networks. The S.E.C. examination of more than 100 registered firms found that the overwhelming majority of them ""have been the subject of cyber-related incident.""  The most common attacks involved hackers introducing malware into a firm's network or the use of fraudulent emails to seeking to persuade brokers to improperly transfer a client's money. The Finra report recommended that all brokerage firms assess their security as well as review the safeguards put in place by the vendors they employed. These reviews should focus on things like data encryption, the number of employees who have access to a network, the frequency of software patches and updates, the security of data storage facilities and measures taken to secure wireless and mobile systems. The report said about 80 percent of firms surveyed already conduct some form of periodic security self-assessment. But the regulatory agency said it was ""concerned that the remaining firms either had no program in place or were in the nascent stages of establishing a program."" The report does not identify the firms that Finra surveyed. From time to time, the group conducts so-called sweep investigations of surveys of a select group of brokerage firms that are supposed to represent a cross-section of the large and small firms the regulatory agency oversees. ""Firms must make responding to these threats a high priority,"" Susan F. Axelrod, Finra's executive vice president for regulatory operations, said in a prepared statement. Finra  also recommended that brokerage firms institute strict measures to restrict who at a firm can get access to sensitive ""systems and data."" The report also recommended that firm's put in place a plan for quickly terminating employees' and vendors' ability to access a particular system when it was no longer relevant to their particular job. Better safeguards about employee and vendor access to a firm's network is one way to prevent a hack being conducted by a company insider. The report also highlights the need for financial services firms to better coordinate their efforts and share information about potential threats and attacks. Finra is echoing a point increasingly made by federal authorities about the need for companies to work more closely with government authorities and each other to thwart increasingly sophisticated hacks. ""Finra believes that the security industry can be more effective in advancing cybersecurity for the community as a whole when it engage in collaborative self-defense,"" the report said. ""To that end, Finra urges firms to revisit their hesitancy to participate in information sharing bodies."" "
Ashley Madison Users Face Threats of Blackmail and Identity Theft,"First, members of the adultery website Ashley Madison had their personal information unveiled to the world by hackers. Now, a bigger threat looms. Scammers and extortionists have been combing for targets through the data on 30 million to 40 million Ashley Madison users, stolen by a group calling itself The Impact Team and dumped online earlier this month.     Police officials in Toronto said they had already seen several instances of such spinoff crimes, including extortion attempts.   Darius Fisher, the president of the reputation management firm Status Labs, said he had multiple clients who have received emails threatening to expose their use of the site if they do not send bitcoins to their blackmailers.   But Ashley Madison users are also being confronted with more subtle scams.   They are ''vulnerable to any offer to help them handle the situation in any way really,'' said Stephen Cobb, a digital security expert at the software company ESET.   Scammers could use data from the breach to trick victims into giving up more information, or even to hack into their computers to wreak further havoc. Such attacks are likely to continue for weeks and months, experts say.   ''It's important to understand that the attackers are clever,'' said Itay Glick, the chief executive of the cybersecurity company Votiro. ''They don't need to use the information today; they can use it two weeks from today or one month from today.''   The path to installing malicious software onto an unsuspecting target's computer can be simple. Using email addresses and information gleaned from the initial data dump, fraudsters can craft convincing so-called phishing emails that trick their recipients into revealing sensitive personal information.   Malware can also be delivered through websites offering to scrub Ashley Madison users' records from the web, a promise that Mr. Cobb said was impossible to deliver on.   Once a computer is infected, criminals can gain access to bank accounts, steal passwords and ''do anything you can do on the machine, basically,'' said Israel Levy, the chief executive of Bufferzone, a cybersecurity company.   It is not just Ashley Madison users who are vulnerable. People interested in the identity of the website's members are also falling prey to attacks.   Targeted messages and spurious websites that offer to reveal the identities of Ashley Madison users are being used as bait to lure suspicious spouses and human resources managers into clicking on malicious links.   The technology company Symantec said it had detected an ''upsurge'' in email activity of this sort, and had blocked multiple domain names including ashleymadisonaccounts.com and ashleymadisonlegalaction.com.   ''The bad guys are trying to take advantage of the fact that people are very curious, and as they say, curiosity kills the cat,'' Mr. Levy said.   Mr. Cobb said: ''Steer clear of anything to do with Ashley Madison is probably the most useful advice. Unless you really understand data and information security, responding to anything related to Ashley Madison could be problematic.''    "
2 Retailers Investigate Data Breach in Websites,"CVS and Walmart Canada said on Friday that a data breach at a Canadian information technology vendor may have leaked credit card information from their online photo processing websites, possibly compromising data on millions of users.  The two retailers have temporarily shut down their online photo processing services and related mobile services, and are investigating the scope of the possible breach, the companies said in separate statements. Both retailers urged customers to check their credit card records for any suspicious activity.    CVS and Walmart Canada said that a vendor based in Vancouver called PNI Digital Media hosts the photo sites, and collects customers' payment information. The vendor is owned by Staples, which suffered an online attack of its own last year.   Neither retailer disclosed how many users may have been affected by the possible breach, which was first reported by Krebs on Security, a news site that focuses on online crime and other Internet security topics.   According to PNI's investor relations page, the vendor also provides software to the online photo processing services of a third retailer, Costco. On Friday evening, the investor relations page appeared to be inaccessible.   Costco's photo site appeared to be functioning Friday afternoon. Officials at the warehouse retailer could not immediately be reached.   Adam Levin, founder of the security firm IDT911, said the breaches highlighted the importance of more rigorously vetting I.T. vendors at a time when companies outsource more and more of their technology operations. Vendors have often proved to be the weakest link, he said.   ''Breaches have become a certainty in life, and everybody's got to step up their game,'' he said. ''Even if the problem stems from a vendor, the retailer's reputation is harmed, and it ends up in the middle of lawsuits.''   Kirk Saville, a spokesman for Staples, confirmed that PNI was investigating a potential credit card data security issue.   ''If an issue is discovered, it is important to note that consumers are not responsible for any fraudulent activity on their credit cards that is reported on a timely basis,'' he said. ''We take the protection of information very seriously.''   Erin Pensa, a CVS spokeswoman, said that the pharmacy chain's main e-commerce site, as well as sites dedicated to contact lens sales and the chain's medical clinics, were managed separately and were unaffected.   The retailer is working closely with PNI and credit card companies to investigate the possible breach, she said in an email.   ''Nothing is more central to us than protecting the privacy and security of our customer information, including financial information,'' Ms. Pensa said.   Walmart Canada also had no reason to think that the retail giant's photo processing site in the United States, or Walmart's main e-commerce sites in Canada or the United States, were affected, according to Marilee McInnis, a company spokesman.    ''Our customers' privacy is of the utmost importance. We immediately launched an investigation and will be contacting customers who may be impacted,'' Ms. McInnis said. She said that Canadian authorities and regulators had been alerted to the attack.    "
Wickr Adds a New Chief Executive and a Nonprofit,"Wickr, the free messaging app, is scheduled to announce on Wednesday that it is splitting into two businesses. Mark Fields, a finance veteran, will take over as chief executive, freeing Nico Sell, co-founder of Wickr, to take the helm of Wickr's new nonprofit initiative, the Wickr Foundation, which will promote privacy and encourage teenagers, dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists to rethink the privacy of their communications. Ms. Sell, who helped organize DefCon, the annual hacker convention, and Asylum, a nonprofit organization dedicated to teaching children how to hack responsibly, helped found Wickr in 2011 to enable people to send self-destructing messages that it says are anonymous, private and secure. In the process, her team helped develop an encrypted messaging protocol that Mr. Fields plans to license to businesses like hospitals and banks that rely on secure communications.  Wickr would not disclose its pricing strategy or how many users it has, but to date over one billion messages - including text, voice, video, photos and files - have been sent by Wickr users in 190 countries. The start-up caught the eye of several big name venture capitalists. Jim Breyer, the first to commit money to Facebook from a venture capitalist fund, led a $30 million round of financing last year from his personal venture firm, Breyer Capital. Other investors have included Gilman Louie, the founder of In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the C.I.A.;  Thor Halvorssen, president of the Human Rights Foundation; Richard A. Clarke, a former United States counterterrorism official; and the Knight Foundation. As the free messaging app attracts more venture funding, it comes under pressure to generate real revenue from its anonymous customers. The start-up recently turned its focus to licensing its technology to businesses, where it can earn reliable revenue that does not depend on advertising. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Fields said he would focus on taking Wickr's core technology to more businesses. Banks, for instance, could use Wickr's technology to securely store communications for the seven years required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Messaging is much more than an app,"" said Ms. Sell. ""Our protocol secures communications of all formats - voice and video and payments. High value communications are what we're looking to secure of all sorts."" Some security and privacy experts have criticized the app since it was created four years ago for not making its protocols open source. Ms. Sell said that, eventually, Wickr plans to make its encryption protocols open source and has enlisted Whitfield Diffie, one of the inventors of public key cryptography, to help it get there. In the meantime, Ms. Sell noted that Wickr has leaned on her relationships with some of the world's top hackers for constant security audits, though critics note that none of these audits have been made public. Increasingly, Wickr faces new competitors like Cyber Dust, Mark Cuban's new disappearing messaging app, and Yovo, a photo messaging app that thwarts any effort by a recipient to copy the photo message. ""The biggest reasons why I trust us is that we've been used in the field for the past four years, in the most hostile areas in the world and no one has died,"" Ms. Sell said. Ms. Sell argues that Wickr is the only secure messaging app that has not had a ""zero day bug,"" a term for a previously unknown flaw that allows hackers to break into a system. In January, one such bug was found in Silent Text, a Wickr competitor, that gave hackers the ability to decrypt its messages, steal users' contacts and control critical functions on its BlackPhone, a device that was marketed as ultrasecure. Other competitors, like Snapchat, have had significant security problems. And Wickr has outperformed many of its competitors in rankings like the Electronic Frontier Foundation's ""Who's Got Your Back"" evaluation, which ranks consumer metrics based on various privacy metrics. ""There are a lot of ways you can build trust,"" Ms. Sell said. ""Open -source is just one of them. We're leading the way in so many other directions and we're always trying to be better."" "
Experts Oppose Government Key to Encoded Data,"SAN FRANCISCO -- An elite group of security technologists has concluded that the American and British governments cannot demand special access to encrypted communications without putting the world's most confidential data and critical infrastructure in danger. A new paper from the group, made up of 14 of the world's pre-eminent cryptographers and computer scientists, is a formidable salvo in a skirmish between intelligence and law enforcement leaders, and technologists and privacy advocates. After Edward J. Snowden's revelations -- with security breaches and awareness of nation-state surveillance at a record high and data moving online at breakneck speeds -- encryption has emerged as a major issue in the debate over privacy rights.    That has put Silicon Valley at the center of a tug of war. Technology companies including Apple, Microsoft and Google have been moving to encrypt more of their corporate and customer data after learning that the National Security Agency and its counterparts were siphoning off digital communications and hacking into corporate data centers.    Yet law enforcement and intelligence agency leaders argue that such efforts thwart their ability to monitor kidnappers, terrorists and other adversaries. In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to ban encrypted messages altogether. In the United States, Michael S. Rogers, the director of the N.S.A., proposed that technology companies be required to create a digital key to unlock encrypted data, but to divide the key into pieces and secure it so that no one person or government agency could use it alone.   The encryption debate has left both sides bitterly divided and in fighting mode. The group of cryptographers deliberately issued its report a day before James B. Comey Jr., the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Sally Quillian Yates, the deputy attorney general at the Justice Department, are scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the concerns that they and other government agencies have that encryption technologies will prevent them from effectively doing their jobs.   The new paper is the first in-depth technical analysis of government proposals by leading cryptographers and security thinkers, including Whitfield Diffie, a pioneer of public key cryptography, and Ronald L. Rivest, the ''R'' in the widely used RSA public cryptography algorithm. In the report, the group said any effort to give the government ''exceptional access'' to encrypted communications was technically unfeasible and would leave confidential data and critical infrastructure like banks and the power grid at risk.   Handing governments a key to encrypted communications would also require an extraordinary degree of trust. With government agency breaches now the norm -- most recently at the United States Office of Personnel Management, the State Department and the White House -- the security specialists said authorities could not be trusted to keep such keys safe from hackers and criminals. They added that if the United States and Britain mandated backdoor keys to communications, China and other governments in foreign markets would be spurred to do the same.   ''Such access will open doors through which criminals and malicious nation-states can attack the very individuals law enforcement seeks to defend,'' the report said. ''The costs would be substantial, the damage to innovation severe and the consequences to economic growth hard to predict. The costs to the developed countries' soft power and to our moral authority would also be considerable.''   A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment ahead of Mr. Comey's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Wednesday. Mr. Comey recently told CNN, ''Our job is to find needles in a nationwide haystack, needles that are increasingly invisible to us because of end-to-end encryption.''   A Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the hearing, said that the agency supported strong encryption, but that certain uses of the technology -- notably end-to-end encryption that forces law enforcement to go directly to the target rather than to technology companies for passwords and communications -- interfered with the government's wiretap authority and created public safety risks.   Paul Kocher, the president of the Rambus Cryptography Research Division, who did not write the paper, said it shifted the debate over encryption from how much power intelligence agencies should have to the technological underpinnings of gaining special access to encrypted communications.   The paper ''details multiple technological reasons why mandatory government back doors are technically unworkable, and how encryption regulations would be disastrous for computer security,'' Mr. Kocher said. ''This report ought to put to rest any technical questions about 'Would this work?' ''   The group behind the report has previously fought proposals for encryption access. In 1997, it analyzed the technical risks and shortcomings of a proposal in the Clinton administration called the Clipper chip. Clipper would have poked a hole in cryptographic systems by requiring technology manufacturers to include a small hardware chip in their products that would have ensured that the government would always be able to unlock scrambled communications.   The government abandoned the effort after an analysis by the group showed it would have been technically unworkable. The final blow was the discovery by Matt Blaze, then a 32-year-old computer scientist at AT&T Bell Laboratories and one of the authors of the new paper, of a flaw in the system that would have allowed anyone with technical expertise to encode Clipper-encrypted communications so that even the government could not crack it.   Now the group has convened again for the first time since 1997. ''The decisions for policy makers are going to shape the future of the global Internet and we want to make sure they get the technology analysis right,'' said Daniel J. Weitzner, head of the MIT Cybersecurity and Internet Policy Research Initiative and a former deputy chief technology officer at the White House, who coordinated the latest report.   In the paper, the authors emphasized that the stakes involved in encryption are much higher now than in their 1997 analysis. In the 1990s, the Internet era was just beginning -- the 1997 report is littered with references to ''electronic mail'' and ''facsimile communications,'' which are now quaint communications methods. Today, the government's plans could affect the technology used to lock data from financial and medical institutions, and poke a hole in mobile devices and countless other critical systems that are moving rapidly online, including pipelines, nuclear facilities and the power grid.   ''The problems now are much worse than they were in 1997,'' said Peter G. Neumann, a co-author of both the 1997 report and the new paper, who is a computer security pioneer at SRI International, the Silicon Valley research laboratory. ''There are more vulnerabilities than ever, more ways to exploit them than ever, and now the government wants to dumb everything down further.''   Other authors of the new paper include Steven M. Bellovin, a computer science professor at Columbia University; Harold Abelson, a computer science professor at MIT; Josh Benaloh, a leading cryptographer at Microsoft; Susan Landau, a professor of cybersecurity at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and formerly a senior privacy analyst at Google; and Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and a widely read security author.   ''The government's proposals for exceptional access are wrong in principle and unworkable in practice,'' said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge and the paper's sole author in Britain. ''That is the message we are going to be hammering home again and again over the next few months as we oppose these proposals in your country and in ours.''    "
Kazakhstan Moves to Tighten Control of Internet Traffic,"Government officials in Kazakhstan are borrowing a page from China, quietly devising their own version of China's so-called Great Firewall to unscramble encrypted web and mobile traffic as it flows in and out of Kazakh borders.  The move to intercept encrypted communications - which is scheduled to begin in January - will effectively allow Kazakh officials to monitor, or even block, vast swaths of digital content for Kazakh Internet and mobile users.  Kazakhstan's largest telecommunications company, Kazakhtelecom JSC, said in a news release that it and other operators were ""obliged"" by law to intercept encrypted web and mobile connections flowing into its borders, beginning Jan. 1. The company advertised the move as a way to ""secure protection of Kazakhstan users"" who have access to  encrypted content from ""foreign Internet resources. ""  But, in effect, it will do the opposite, exposing Kazakh users' private communications to snooping. After The New York Times sent repeated requests for clarification to officials at Kazakhstan's embassy in Washington on Wednesday evening, the announcement was removed from Kazakhtelecom JSC's website. Embassy officials did not return requests for comment.  Unlike with China, which filters data through an expensive and complex digital infrastructure known as the Great Firewall, security experts say Kazakhstan is trying to achieve the same effect at a lower cost.  The country is mandating that its citizens install a new ""national security certificate"" on their computers and smartphones that will intercept requests to and from foreign websites.  That gives officials the opportunity to read encrypted traffic between Kazakh users and foreign servers, in what security experts call a ""man in the middle attack."" As a result, Kazakh telecom operators, and government officials, will be privy to mobile and web traffic between Kazakh users and foreign servers, bypassing encryption protections known as S.S.L., or Secure Sockets Layer, and H.T.T.P.S., technology that encrypts browsing sessions and is familiar to users by the tiny padlock icon that appears in browsers. Corporations adopt similar systems to keep employees from visiting certain websites at work, to guard against information theft, or scan for malicious computer viruses. But analysts say that the Kazakhstan plan may be intended for government monitoring. According to Human Rights Watch, the Kazakhstan government has escalated a crackdown on news media since 2012, blocking websites, banning newspapers and broadcasters, and in one case, submitting a journalist to forced psychiatric observation. ""Given the style of government of Kazakhstan, I think we can assume that this is simply part of their censorship apparatus,"" said Steven M. Bellovin, a professor of computer science at Columbia University. ""It's a serious security risk for Kazakh users both technically and in their inability to send and receive private communications."" Mr. Bellovin also noted that Kazakhstan's system would be a tempting target for hackers or other governments. ""Anyone who hacked these boxes would also be able to monitor traffic,"" he said. In 2011, hackers inside Iran enacted a similar monitoring technique. Instead of compelling Iranian users to download a government-issued certificate, Iranian hackers compromised a publicly trusted Dutch certificate authority, DigiNotar, and issued fake certificates to spy on the communications of 300,000 Iranian Gmail users. After the attack was made public, Google, Microsoft, Adobe and other major technology companies blacklisted certificates issued by DigiNotar, which went bankrupt several months later. If Kazakhstan goes through with its state-issued ""national security certificate,"" companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft could choose to blacklist the Kazakh certificate authority, as they did with DigiNotar in 2011, and wide swaths of Internet content would be inaccessible to users inside Kazakhstan. Google uses a system known as ""public key pinning"" for its Chrome web browser, Chromebook PCs and Android phones, which restricts the set of certificate authorities allowed to vouch for a particular website. For certain websites, including Google, Facebook and the Tor Project, which provides anonymity software, Chrome trusts only a subset of certificate authorities. If Kazakh users download the new government-mandated certificate to their devices as a trusted authority, public key pinning would not stop users from being able to access listed websites, it would only warn users that their connection may be intercepted. It would be up to Google, Microsoft and other major web services to decide whether to blacklist the Kazakh certificate authority altogether.   Aaron Krolik contributed reporting.  "
"China's New National Security Law Dismays Tech Sector, Which Fears Intrusion","HONG KONG --  When a draft of China's new national security law was made public in May, critics argued that it was too broad and left much open to interpretation. In the final form of the law, which the government said Wednesday had been enacted, Beijing got more specific, but in a way that is sending ripples through the global technology industry.    New language in the rules calls for a ''national security review'' of the technology industry -- including networking and other products and services -- and foreign investment. The law also calls for technology that supports crucial sectors to be ''secure and controllable,'' a catchphrase that multinationals and industry groups say could be used to force companies to build so-called back doors -- which allow third-party access to systems -- provide encryption keys or even hand over source code.    As with many Chinese laws, the language is vague enough to make it unclear how the law will be enforced, but it suggests a new front in the wider clash between China and the United States over online security and technology policy.   The United States has accused China of state-sponsored hacking attacks against American companies to gain a commercial advantage, and of creating policies meant to force the transfer of intellectual property to Chinese companies.   In turn, China maintains that the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former United States National Security Agency contractor, about American online espionage give it plenty of reason to wean itself from foreign technology that may have been tampered with by United States intelligence agencies.   The most recent policy clash between the United States and China came in April, and it ended with Beijing's saying that it would withdraw a law that restricted which technology products could be sold by foreign companies to Chinese banks. Groups that represent companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft had pushed against that law.   At the time, the withdrawal was billed as a victory for foreign companies, but the recent additions to the Chinese national security law show that it might have been a brief reprieve. The changes to the law are also likely to increase lobbying pressure on the United States by multinationals aimed at a separate Chinese measure, a counterterrorism law that Beijing is expected to pass this year and that could include stronger restrictions on foreign technologies being sold into China.   ''I think it's a perfect storm: The cybersecurity concerns because of Snowden and the techno-nationalist perspective have really gained strength over the past few years,'' said Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ''China is not particularly swayed by or sympathetic to arguments that the foreign companies have made, and they're going to push forward on all these fronts.''   At a news conference on Wednesday in Beijing, Zheng Shuna, deputy director of the legislative affairs commission of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, underscored those concerns.   ''China's cybersovereignty shall be respected and maintained,'' she said, using the term Beijing has adopted to argue that countries should be allowed to enact whatever laws are necessary to manage the Internet and information technology within their borders.   ''Raising the idea of 'safeguarding national cybersovereignty' in the National Security Law is a response to the needs of the development of the Chinese Internet,'' Ms. Zheng added. ''It provides the legal basis for managing cyberactivity on China's soil and resisting activities which jeopardize China's cybersecurity.''   The concept of a governmental body's reviewing the national security concerns for issues like foreign investment in the technology industry is not reserved to the Chinese. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, for instance, oversees and occasionally bars investment in sensitive industries by countries like China.   Still, foreign companies argue that Beijing is likely to use such an oversight body to favor local companies and to push multinationals to do more to help Chinese companies develop more advanced capabilities.   Mr. Segal pointed to one phrase in the new Chinese law that could be particularly problematic: ''secure and controllable.''   ''Since no one knows how you implement that phrase,'' he said, ''foreign companies are worried about what that's going to mean. Does it mean they have to give access through back doors, or are they going to have to partner with Chinese firms?''   Mr. Segal added that one recourse would be to argue through the World Trade Organization that what China considers national security concerns are not valid.    "
Uber Driver Database Breached by Someone Outside Company,"Uber, the popular ride-hailing service, disclosed on Friday that one of its information databases had been tapped by an unknown third party, potentially revealing the names and drivers' license identification numbers of up to 50,000 of the company's drivers.   The breach, which occurred in May 2014, was a one-time event, according to Uber. When Uber discovered the breach in September of last year, the company said it updated its database security. To date, Uber has not been notified by drivers of any misuse of their information.  ""Uber takes seriously our responsibility to safeguard personal information, and we are sorry for any inconvenience this incident may cause,"" Katherine Tassi, Uber's managing counsel of data privacy, said in a company blog post. The breach comes at an unfortunate time for the San Francisco company, which is under close scrutiny from regulators, investors and consumers. The company has raised more than $5 billion from venture capitalists and institutional investment firms in the five years since it was founded. It is fighting against competitors like Lyft, a rival service, in the United States, while also trying to take on competitors in new markets such as the Asia Pacific region and Europe.  Institutions like Target, Home Depot, eBay and JPMorgan Chase have all been hit by hackers over the last year, affecting hundreds of millions of customer accounts.  In a blog post, Uber said the breach affected drivers across multiple states in the United States, which the company said was a ""small percentage"" of current and former Uber drivers.  The company has offered affected drivers one free year of an online identity protection service from Experian and has filed what is called a ""John Doe"" lawsuit to collect information in an attempt to discover the identity of the intruder.

"Firms Wary of Breaches by Hackers, Not Terrorists","The online attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in the fall that federal authorities linked to the North Korean government raised alarm bells about the hacking threat posed by foreign governments. But brokerage firms based in the United States remain most concerned about an attack carried out by a loose band of hackers or employees with a grudge. A report released on Tuesday  by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the industry's self-monitoring organization, said a study of about 20 brokerage firms found the threat of an online intrusion by a nation or a terrorist group ranked near the bottom of the industry's concerns.     Worries about state-sponsored breaches were highest at big investment banks. But few of the largest firms questioned by Finra put such attacks at the top of their list.   All the firms said they had little concern about a hacking carried out by a competitor.   The results of the study were included in a Finra report that focused on best practices that brokerage firms should enact to prevent serious attacks that can compromise a customer's personal and financial information. The organization conducted the survey last year to better understand what brokerage firms, both large and small, are doing to guard against a serious breach.   In another sign of just how important the threat of an intrusion has become for the financial services industry, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its own report on Tuesday that examined how prepared Wall Street investment banks and brokerage firms were to repel hackers bent on gaining access to their digital networks. That examination of more than 100 registered firms found that the overwhelming majority ''have been the subject of a cyber-related incident.''   The most common attacks involved hackers introducing malware into a firm's network or the use of fraudulent emails seeking to persuade brokers to improperly transfer a client's money.   The Finra report recommended that all brokerage firms assess their security as well as review the safeguards put in place by their vendors. These reviews should focus on things like data encryption, the number of employees who have access to a network, the frequency of software patches and updates, the security of data storage facilities, and measures taken to secure wireless and mobile systems.   The report said about 80 percent of firms questioned already conducted some form of periodic security self-assessment. But the regulatory agency said it was ''concerned that the remaining firms either had no program in place or were in the nascent stages of establishing a program.''   The report does not identify the firms that Finra examined. From time to time, the agency conducts so-called sweep investigations, or studies of a select group of brokerage firms that are supposed to represent a cross-section of the large and small firms that it oversees.   Finra also recommended that brokerage firms institute strict measures to restrict who at a firm can gain access to sensitive systems and data. The report also suggested that firms establish a plan for quickly terminating employees' and vendors' ability to gain access to a particular system when it was no longer relevant to their job.   Better safeguards about employee and vendor access to a firm's network are one way to prevent an attack by a company insider.   Morgan Stanley recently was the victim of an insider threat when it discovered in December that a broker had stolen account information on more than 300,000 of its wealth management customers and tried to sell the data on the Internet. The firm quickly fired the broker after learning of the matter, and federal authorities are now investigating.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Fiat Chrysler Issues Recall Over Hacking,"WASHINGTON --  When the call came to officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, they knew they had a problem they had never faced but had long feared. On the line was Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, with news that two technology researchers had hacked wirelessly into a Jeep Cherokee, through its dashboard connectivity system. They had managed to gain control of not just features like the radio and air-conditioning, but the actual functions of the car: the engine, the brakes and the steering.    That revelation set in motion a nine-day flurry of activity by the automaker and the safety agency that culminated Friday in a sweeping recall of 1.4 million vehicles.    ''Launching a recall is the right step to protect Fiat Chrysler's customers, and it sets an important precedent for how N.H.T.S.A. and the industry will respond to cybersecurity vulnerabilities,'' said Mark R. Rosekind, the agency's administrator.    In an age when the cars on the nation's highways are increasingly web-connected, it was the first safety recall issued for a hacking threat. And it brought immediate demands on Capitol Hill for action to root out and guard against flaws in other cars that could pose a similar danger.    The initial call from Fiat Chrysler to Washington on July 15 led to a long set of discussions between the automaker and regulators that extended through the weekend, according to a person briefed on the activities.    Staff specialists at the safety agency aimed to grasp the full scope of the breach, and were particularly alarmed that the hacking allowed someone to essentially crash a vehicle.   The researchers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, had given the automaker a heads up: The two men planned to make their findings public early this week. The vulnerability existed far beyond just the Jeep, they said. Other vehicles across Chrysler's lineup of cars and trucks used the same system, called Uconnect, that had let them in. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles could be affected.   Fiat Chrysler software specialists scrambled to make a patch available to plug the hole, and released one on the automaker's website on July 16, the day after the call to Washington. The company also planned to issue a technical service bulletin -- a notice mainly used by dealers, but not considered a recall.   Officials at the safety agency, however, wanted to know more about the exact functions that could be taken over by hackers. In N.H.T.S.A. parlance, if the result presented an ''unreasonable risk to safety,'' a recall would be required. And if drivers were vulnerable to an attack where they could lose control of their cars, that would certainly seem to qualify, even though a recall for a web security threat had never before taken place.   In the meantime, the researchers made their findings known on Tuesday in an article published by the news technology site Wired, telling how they had taken control of a cooperating driver's car from 10 miles away as it sped down a St. Louis highway. (It was the same day, coincidentally, that Mr. Rosekind was visiting Michigan for a speech in which he addressed the need for improved web security in vehicles.)   N.H.T.S.A. officials decided that the vulnerability was simply too dangerous not to require a formal recall. Additionally, without a recall, the automaker would not be required to file regular compliance reports on how many affected vehicles had been fixed.    After further conversations between Washington and the company's headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., Fiat Chrysler settled Thursday on a recall affecting 1.4 million vehicles. (A small percentage of that number, the company said, involves certain 2015 models getting a separate software patch unrelated to the remote Jeep hacking.)    Fiat Chrysler issued a public statement saying that security ''is a top priority,'' as is retaining consumer confidence in its vehicles. Fiat Chrysler will send affected owners a USB drive they can plug into their vehicles to install an update to block the hacking vulnerability. Owners can also download the update directly onto their own portable drive.    The recall affects certain vehicles equipped with 8.4-inch touch screens from the 2013 model year onward. That includes some Jeep Cherokees and Grand Cherokees, Dodge Durangos, Ram pickup trucks, Chrysler 200 and 300 sedans, Dodge Chargers and Vipers. (The company set up a VIN search tool to let consumers check if their vehicle is affected.)   The automaker also said it had ''applied network-level security measures'' on the Sprint cellular network that communicates with its vehicles as another step to block the vulnerability.   On Friday, Mr. Valasek, one of the two researchers, posted on social media that when he tried connecting again to his test Jeep, the pathway through Sprint's network had been blocked.   Precise aspects of what Fiat Chrysler knew about possible Uconnect problems before this month remain unclear. In documents filed with regulators on Friday, the company said that testing in January 2014 identified ''a potential security vulnerability'' with a communications port used with the system. A supplier began work on security improvements shortly thereafter, the company said, and those changes made it into later production vehicles. But the software patch for other potentially affected vehicles was not released until this month.   A Fiat Chrysler spokesman, Berj Alexanian, declined to comment on the precise timeline of when the patch was developed, but said that since its release the company has ''taken more steps to ensure the confidence and security of our customers,'' including deciding, ''in an abundance of caution, to continue the distribution under the auspices of a recall.''    ''This will maximize awareness of the software's availability and expedite its proliferation,'' he said.   One thing remains clear, however: The repercussions of the first hacking-related auto recall are only beginning.    ''This was a wake-up call for automakers,'' said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst with Autotrader.com. ''I will bet emergency meetings are being called at many auto companies.''    Web security specialists say that while intrusions into consumers' computers and phones result in financial damage, or possibly issues like identify theft, the danger posed by vehicles is unique in its potential to inflict physical harm.    ''The transformation you've seen is that hacking has moved into the safety realm,'' said Jon Allen, a security specialist with Booz Allen Hamilton. ''Autos take it to a new level.''    On Capitol Hill, lawmakers called for ensuring that other automakers do not face similar problems.   ''Both automakers and N.H.T.S.A. should be immediately taking steps to verify that other similar vulnerabilities do not exist in other models that are on the road,'' said Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.   Mr. Markey, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, recently drafted legislation to set federal standards for web security protection in vehicles.   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, and the panel's top Democrat, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, also issued a statement, saying that ''cars today are essentially computers on wheels, and the last thing drivers should have to worry about is some hacker along for the ride.''     "
A Vulnerable Industry,"The cyberattack on Anthem, one of the nation's largest health insurers, points to the vulnerability of health care companies, which security specialists say are behind other industries in protecting sensitive personal information. Experts said the information was vulnerable because Anthem did not take steps, like protecting the data in its computers though encryption, in the same way it protected medical information that was sent or shared outside of the database.    The hackers gained access to up to 80 million records that included Social Security numbers, birthdays, addresses, email and employment information and income data for customers and employees, including its own chief executive.   Anthem officials say they do not know who is behind the attack, but several security consultants have noted that in the past Chinese hackers have shown an interest in going after health care companies. A securities industry consultant who requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing said there were suspicions the hackers might have been working with the backing of a foreign government, or with people with ties to a foreign government.    The hackers are thought to have infiltrated Anthem's networks by using a sophisticated malicious software program that gave them access to the login credential of an Anthem employee.   ''This is one of the worst breaches I have ever seen,'' said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer education and advocacy group. ''These people knew what they were doing and recognized there was a treasure trove here, and I think they are going to use it to engage in very sophisticated kinds of identity theft.''   Anthem officials became aware of the breach when one of their senior administrators noticed someone was using his identity to request information from the database. The request -- or query -- by the hackers appears so far to have been for financial information only. Anthem officials say that medical information in insurance claims shared with doctors and hospitals -- like whether a customer was treated for substance abuse, for example -- does not appear to have been taken in the attack.   ''We're positive that the rogue query did not have medical data in it,'' said Thomas Miller, Anthem's chief information officer. The people who gained access to the database ''consciously selected what they selected.''   The insurer, along with federal investigators and security experts from FireEye's Mandiant division, is now trying to determine whether there were other requests that it did not detect, a process that could take several more weeks.   Mr. Miller said Anthem and other health care companies had become increasingly aware of the criminal value of the information they have, in light of the large cyberattacks against financial service companies like JPMorgan Chase or retailers like Target.   ''People have known for a long time financial information has its security needs,'' he said. Anthem, he said, had doubled its investment in this area over the last four years and was actively considering encrypting its internal database as well as taking other steps to improve its security.   Anthem operates health plans under numerous brands, including Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield.   While experts like Mr. Stephens said the hackers might not have been particularly interested in the medical information available in Anthem's database, the company's decision to make the breach public quickly means that it is early in the investigation into exactly what happened and what information may have been compromised. ''You can spend months doing the forensics,'' said Fred Cate, a law professor and cybersecurity expert at Indiana University.   While he praised Anthem for taking the ''unusual and quite laudable step in coming forward quite quickly,'' he cautioned that company officials might not know the scope of the attack at this point.   Still, Mr. Cate said the medical information was not likely to result in the public unveiling of sensitive medical information, unlike smaller attacks aimed at finding something embarrassing or derogatory about an executive or celebrity. ''As a general matter, huge breaches often result in less harm than targeted breaches,'' he said. ''The notion that someone's poring over this data is highly unlikely.''   The decision by Anthem to bring in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and go public with the breach is the kind of move that law enforcement officials have been encouraging for the last several months. F.B.I. officials have appeared at a number of industry conferences urging corporate executives to promptly report breaches and, when possible, share information about the breach with competitors.   But experts say health organizations like Anthem are likely to be vulnerable targets because they have been slower to adopt measures like keeping personal information in separate databases that can be closed off in an attack. They ''are generally less secure than financial service companies who have the same type of customer data,'' said Avivah Litan, an analyst for Gartner who specializes in cybersecurity.   Last summer's attack on JPMorgan Chase, for example, compromised the personal information of 83 million households and small businesses, but the breach was limited to nonfinancial information like addresses and phone numbers because the bank's more sensitive information was walled off in a way the hackers could not penetrate.   Anthem's fundamental mistake was to assume that information within its database was secure, said John Kindervag, an analyst with Forrester Research, and thus not apply the same protective standards the company uses when sending data to a doctor's office. ''All cybercrime is an inside job,'' he said, because the criminals are able to penetrate a database from the outside and act as an insider in gaining access to data, which is what occurred in the Anthem breach.    Current federal privacy regulations, and the industry standard, call for encrypting information that is being sent from the database. Health insurance companies frequently share information with doctors, hospitals and others. In fact, the sharing of medical records is encouraged by the federal government.   While the health industry has not previously experienced the large-scale breaches that have plagued retailers like Target and Home Depot, there have been smaller attacks. Statistics maintained by the federal government's Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Human Services say there have been 740 major health care breaches affecting 29 million people over the last five years.   Katherine Keefe, global focus group leader for breach response services at Beazley, which underwrites cyberliability policies, said health care companies were attractive targets to hackers because of the wealth of sensitive personal information they maintained in their networks. She said the information that health providers maintain about consumers tended to be more valuable on the black market than the credit card information that is often stolen from on a retailer.   She said the combination of Social Security information and medical histories was a valuable commodity to criminals. The combination is enough for some of Anthem's customers to become victims of identity theft or email phishing schemes in which criminals try to trick unsuspecting people into providing their credit card information.   Stolen medical information could also be used to make false insurance claims.    ''The value to a criminal of having a full set of medical information on a person can go for $40 to $50 on the street. By contrast, a credit card number is often worth $4 or $5,'' Ms. Keefe said.    "
F.T.C. Says Net Devices Pose Big Risks,"The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday confirmed some of the worst fears about Internet-connected devices, saying the technology presented serious data security and privacy risks, and urged companies to make data protection a top priority. While the agency noted the potential benefits for owners of smart devices like connected fitness bands, regulators also said the technology generated enormous amounts of personal data that could be misused or obtained by hackers.    ''Many of us are using these devices,'' Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the F.T.C., said in a telephone interview. But, she said, ''if consumers feel that their information isn't being protected, they won't have the confidence level to embrace them.''    In a staff report, the agency urged companies to institute basic data security measures when they develop such devices and sensors, rather than as an afterthought. It also encouraged companies to develop new ways to communicate their data collection and handling practices -- even if they market sensors that are too small to contain digital information displays for consumers.   ''We are still at a time when we can have an impact on how the Internet of Things evolves,'' Ms. Ramirez said in the interview, referring to an array of connected devices. ''These important privacy principles still have a place in today's world.''   Although the report highlights the issues that the agency intends to monitor and underlines the best practices regulators hope companies will adopt, it does not carry the weight of enforceable regulations. The agency has urged Congress to enact a baseline federal consumer privacy law. But such legislation is unlikely to pass with Congress controlled by Republicans.   Still, data security and privacy experts predicted that at least larger, well-known technology companies would take the agency's data security recommendations into account -- if only to reduce the business risk of federal investigations.   ''I think everyone can agree that industry needs to do a better job, writ large, on addressing Internet of Things security issues,'' said Justin Brookman, the director of the consumer privacy project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit group in Washington. But, he said, ''smaller companies may not notice the report.'' His group has received financing from companies including Apple, Qualcomm, Verizon and Palantir.   Around 4.9 billion connected items for consumers, enterprises, manufacturing and utilities will be in use this year, according to estimates from Gartner, an information technology research firm. That number is expected to rise to 25 billion by 2020, the company said.   One concern that comes with all these devices, the F.T.C. report noted, is that hackers could potentially hijack and misuse intimate information recorded by the technology, perhaps even creating physical safety risks for consumers.   Last year, for instance, an electronics company that marketed what it said were ''secure'' Internet-connected cameras, allowing parents to remotely monitor young children at home, settled a complaint by the F.T.C. that lax security practices had exposed its customers to privacy invasions. A security flaw allowed anyone with the cameras' Internet addresses to view, and in some cases hear, what was happening in customers' homes, the agency said.   The F.T.C. report recommended that companies consider putting limits on the volume of information their devices collect from consumers and on the amount of time they retain those records.   But companies may be reluctant to adopt those practices because data storage costs are decreasing and the ability to quickly analyze huge data sets is increasing.   ''There are some forces that work against data minimization,'' said Adam Towvim, the chief executive of TrustLayers, a start-up in Boston that helps companies institute systems for real-time monitoring of their data use.   If a company collected 300 to 400 facts about millions of individual consumers, he said, it would be costly and cumbersome to figure out which details to delete and which were important to retain. Mr. Towvim added: ''And you might keep the information in multiple places or you may have derivative uses where you haven't completely aggregated or anonymized it.''   Even so, regulators said they would be keeping watch to see that makers of connected devices limit the potential security and privacy risks of their products for consumers.   ''For companies, it will be to their detriment if they don't heed the issues we flag in the report,'' Ms. Ramirez said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Private Sector Pay Lures F.B.I.'s Hacking Experts,"As attacks on networks and thefts of data grow, federal agents with just a few years of investigations into Internet crime under their belts need not look too hard for work in the private sector. In the last three months, at least a half-dozen agents on the online security squad of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigations have left the federal government for more lucrative jobs in the private sector. The flurry of departures is beginning to concern top law officials at the F.B.I., who are struggling to figure out ways to recruit younger agents and retain veteran investigators.    The most recent F.B.I. agent to announce his departure is Leo Taddeo, who oversees much of the online crime operation for the agency in New York. Mr. Taddeo announced his planned August departure in an email sent on Monday to dozens of government employees and private security consultants. Mr. Taddeo, who did not respond to a request for comment, said in the blast email that he would be taking a job as chief security officer for a security software company, which he did not name.    Several recipients of Mr. Taddeo's email responded by congratulating him and noting that his departure would not only be a loss for the government but also for the financial sector, which is a prime target of hackers.   Mr. Taddeo's departure was not a big surprise given that he has more than 20 years of service with the F.B.I., the threshold at which most agents can retire with full benefits. But Mr. Taddeo was promoted to his position less than two years ago, and the timing is an indication of how quickly private companies are looking to snap up any agent with experience in digital investigations.   The issue of private industry, including corporations and consulting firms, hiring away veteran investigators is a concern for James B. Comey, the F.B.I.'s director, who has met with several top agents from around the country to discuss their reasons for leaving the bureau, said several people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   In those conversations, the now-departed agents told Mr. Comey that it was not just a big increase in salary that attracted them to the private sector, but also the prospect of quicker professional advancement. The people briefed on the matter said one problem with the structure of the F.B.I. is that promotions are often based on tenure rather than merit.   ''Director Comey has called attracting and retaining good cybertalent a 'continual challenge,' one that both the private and public sectors are dealing with,'' John Boles, the acting executive assistant director of the F.B.I. branch that oversees online security response and services, said in a statement. ''In addition to technical capabilities, we are also trying to attract people with character, competence and commitment and we are looking for incentives that will encourage candidates to choose F.B.I. service. While private sector jobs have many attractions, there is simply no career in the private sector as rewarding as working for the F.B.I. and knowing that each day you are helping protect America from threats in cyberspace.''   One private firm that has been particularly aggressive in hiring away agents from the F.B.I. in New York is K2 Intelligence, a corporate investigations firm co-founded by Jules Kroll and his son Jeremy. The Kroll family, which has a history of performing corporate investigations, recently received a major investment from the insurance giant American International Group and is looking to strengthen its work in consulting on digital breaches and data thefts.   In April, K2 announced it was hiring Austin P. Berglas from the New York office of the F.B.I. Mr. Berglas was one of the agents overseeing the investigation into last summer's security breach at JPMorgan Chase that compromised some contact information for 83 million households and small businesses. Following Mr. Berglas to K2 were two other agents, Joseph M. Lawlor and Milan Patel.   On Tuesday, federal prosecutors announced a series of arrests in Israel and Florida involving a number of pump-and-dump stock schemes. People briefed on the matter said some of the men arrested also had some involvement in the JPMorgan Chase security breach, although the men were not charged in that crime.   Other companies that have been hiring F.B.I. agents with digital investigation expertise over the last year are FTI Consulting, a business advisory firm, and Tanium, which markets a platform that enables companies to monitor its systems for attacks.   The exodus from the F.B.I.'s office in New York began in earnest a little over a year ago when Christopher Tarbell, one of the lead agents on the investigation into the Silk Road online marketplace for illegal drugs and hacked credit card numbers, took a job at FTI. Mr. Tarbell came to FTI in March 20014 with Thomas G. A. Brown, former chief of the computer and intellectual property crime unit of the United States attorney's office in Manhattan. Since then, FTI, which has employees in 27 countries, has hired two other experienced digital investigators, Ilhwan Yum and Thomas Kiernan, from of the F.B.I. in New York.   Former agents said the talent drain from the F.B.I. is likely to continue for the near future as corporations pay more attention to the threat posed by hackers and the federal government finds it hard to compete with the salaries private employers can pay.

Teenager in Northern Ireland Is Arrested in TalkTalk Hacking Case,"The British police have arrested a 15-year-old boy in Northern Ireland in connection with a recent hacking attack on the telecommunications operator TalkTalk. The company, which provides fixed-line and broadband services to roughly four million customers in Britain, said last week that it had been the victim of a significant data breach, and that hackers who claimed responsibility had demanded ransom.     The teenager was taken into custody Monday afternoon, and the police were searching his residence as part of a criminal investigation, according to a statement from the Metropolitan Police. On Tuesday, the police said the boy had been released on bail.   TalkTalk  said on Friday that a substantial number of its customers could have been affected by the data breach, the third cyberattack on the company in 12 months. It became aware of the breach late on Wednesday.   Dido Harding, TalkTalk's chief executive, confirmed on Friday that the company had received a ransom demand from a group purporting to be behind the attack, though other groups have also claimed responsibility.   On Saturday, the broadband provider said on its website that the stolen customer data had been less sensitive than initially thought and did not include complete credit card numbers or customers' passwords, for instance.   On Monday, after the teenager's arrest, TalkTalk said it would ''continue to assist in the ongoing investigation,'' which is being conducted by cybercrime agents for the Metropolitan Police of London, the Northern Ireland police and the National Crime Agency of Britain.   TalkTalk's efforts to play down the impact of the data breach have not stopped British authorities from criticizing the company and the failure of its online security systems.   British lawmakers said on Monday that they would open an investigation into the data breach, and the country's data protection authority said it would begin a separate inquiry.   Shares of TalkTalk are down 8 percent since the hacking attack was confirmed on Friday.    "
Q&A: Guarding Personal Data From Abuse by Insiders,"Courtney Bowman is a member of the privacy and civil liberties group at Palantir Technologies. Palantir, a privately held tech company in Palo Alto, Calif., first became known through its work for many military, police and intelligence services in the United States and overseas. Today, more than half of Palantir's business is with private sector companies, which use it for activities as diverse as improving the efficiency of oil exploration and figuring out where to put the gum at a checkout stand. It also works with disaster relief agencies.  The software comes with an auditing capability, so it is possible to see who looked at what. It is not clear that this capability is always used, particularly by companies, but Palantir says that it is trying to figure out ways of preserving individual civil liberties in an age when computers are tracking everything. Mr. Bowman, who has degrees in physics and philosophy from Stanford, is one of the authors of a book on designing computer systems to ensure privacy, and he spoke recently with Times reference.The New York Times. The conversation has been condensed and edited.  Q.  What is the relationship between security and privacy?  A.  Information security is a key component of privacy. Information must be held securely. It's not going to get you all the way, but there is a lot of continuity.  Q.  And hackers are often looking for personal information?  A.  Privacy and security use many of the same technologies. Things like encryption, auditing databases, logging what was used or controls on who can have access to information, and alerts if there is a breach. For privacy, the main worry may not be hackers as much as bad actions by authorized users. A useful concept in information system architecture is accountability oversight. Flagging people who misuse things. Revealing private things only by degree. Having access controls.  Q.  That sounds like a pretty basic system of rules put on the data.  A.  On the surface, it's straightforward, but it can be complex. Data usage and what you can learn from it can be contingent on the context. It doesn't take much to find personal information that has supposedly been made anonymous.  Q.  Can you retrofit new rules on older computer systems?  A.  People build systems, then deal with data protection. They think measures like content access restriction, user auditing and data retention practices can be configured after a system is built. It hurts the ability to put in good safeguards. Good privacy systems work on anticipating and fighting risks like hacking, or private information leakage, but they need to be built from the ground up with privacy considerations in mind. They are seamless extensions of core operating functionality. It's better to build something flexible from the start. Figure out the key risks to sensitive information and try to account for all the related vulnerabilities. Decide how to overcome any single point of failure and anticipate security failures, so you can limit damage.  Q.  As more types of data come online, do you worry about people combining several types of available data to figure out private information?  A.  It's a huge challenge. But there are ways of dealing with it. Giving approved people proportional access to data gives some protection about how the data is going to get used. You can have rules to temporarily encrypt aspects of data. You can make a risk profile in what you are disclosing - sometimes that's possible, too, but it's not easy. You can also constrain where data will go. The problem is, if you fully de-identify personal data, you also lose its utility.  Q.  Should people worry more about companies or about governments?  A.  Government entities have a lot of regulation. A lot of these were written in the 1980s, and they need to be adapted. People are working on this. You hear a lot about a need to know - what under some circumstance you could see - versus the right to know.  Q.  Is there a danger governments will circumvent their own rules by hiring private sector mercenaries who work offshore, where the rules are different?  A.  Data analysis arbitrage? We're already in that world. You'll see third parties doing work for governments that are prohibited, then vending the results. You hope people deal in the spirit as well as the letter of the law.  Q.  What about the private sector?  A.  There isn't a lot that says what companies should and shouldn't do. They are iterating the technology faster than the policies. The decisions around how we build a system have a significant effect on privacy mores. For example, there are no shortages of issues around privacy and how Facebook is designed. The existing framework for personalization is permissions. You agree to it. But the traditional method is a notice and consent form that's 50 pages long, and nobody reads it.  Q.  Which should scare me more: a big Chinese hacking or companies constantly trying to look at me and figure out my online behavior?  A.  When a data breach is exposed, it's a discrete event. You know what will happen, for the most part. Marketing is directed at a lifestyle. The private sphere is where we develop character. There is a risk of compounding pressures, brought on by a barrage of tailored advertisements and ""personalizations,"" eroding the private sphere. Over the long run, that's more insidious than a hack.  Q.  And we're probably going to get looked at even more. Is that another kind of security concern?  A.  The concern is predictive data analytics, capabilities that run the risk of turning back years of civil rights, by influencing economic outcomes and targeting people for specific reasons. The risk is subtle, but these algorithms have compounding influences. They may list certain job opportunities for you, and not others, or you may not see an interest rate offer on a loan, because of how they profiled you. It won't just shift our behaviors. It will shift outcomes.  Q.  How does this sort of work affect you?  A.  I don't engage in social media. I limit my online presence. My co-authors and I are the kind of people who read the 50 pages of the terms of service before we sign up for something. I'm continually turning off tracking features on my devices. "
"When a Company Is Put Up for Sale, in Many Cases, Your Personal Data Is, Too","The privacy policy for Hulu, a video-streaming service with about nine million subscribers, opens with a declaration that the company ''respects your privacy.'' That respect could lapse, however, if the company is ever sold or goes bankrupt. At that point, according to a clause several screens deep in the policy, the host of details that Hulu can gather about subscribers -- names, birth dates, email addresses, videos watched, device locations and more -- could be transferred to ''one or more third parties as part of the transaction.'' The policy does not promise to contact users if their data changes hands.    Provisions like that act as a sort of data fire sale clause. They are becoming standard among the most popular sites, according to a recent analysis by The New York Times of the top 100 websites in the United States as ranked by Alexa, an Internet analytics firm.   Of the 99 sites with English-language terms of service or privacy policies, 85 said they might transfer users' information if a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, asset sale or other transaction occurred, The Times's analysis found. The sites with these provisions include prominent consumer technology companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn, in addition to Hulu.    ''It's 'we are never going to sell your data, except if we need to or sell the company,' '' Hal F. Morris, the assistant attorney general of Texas, said about industry practices.   Hulu declined to comment.   Sites, apps, data brokers and marketing analytics firms are gathering more and more details about people's personal lives -- from their social connections and health concerns to the ways they toggle between their devices. The intelligence is often used to help tailor online experiences or marketing pitches. Such data can also potentially be used to make inferences about people's financial status, addictions, medical conditions, fitness, politics or religion in ways they may not want or like.   When sites and apps get acquired or go bankrupt, the consumer data they have amassed may be among the companies' most valuable assets. And that has created an incentive for some online services to collect vast databases on people without giving them the power to decide which companies, or industries, may end up with their information.   ''In effect, there's a race to the bottom as companies make representations that are weak and provide little actual privacy protection to consumers,'' said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research center in Washington.   The potential ramifications of the fire sale provisions became clear two years ago when True.com, a dating site based in Plano, Tex., that was going through a bankruptcy proceeding, tried to sell its customer database on 43 million members to a dating site based in Canada. The profiles included consumers' names, birth dates, sexual orientation, race, religion, criminal convictions, photos, videos, contact information and more.   Because the site's privacy policy had promised never to sell or share members' personal details without their permission, Texas was able to intervene to stop the sale of customer data, including intimate details on about two million Texans.   ''That is the type of information that people were entitled not to have trafficked and sold to the highest bidder,'' said Mr. Morris, the Texas assistant attorney general. ''I think it's an important safety issue for consumers.''   If privacy policies contain unrestricted data-transfer provisions, however, consumers and government authorities have little recourse.   Among the top 100 sites in the Times analysis, at least 17 said they would alert consumers -- by, for example, posting a notice on their site -- if users' personal details changed hands. But only Etsy, the crafts e-retailer, Weather.com and a few other sites promised to allow people to opt out of having their data handed over to a third party in certain circumstances.   Jordan Breslow, Etsy's general counsel, said that enabling the site's members to control their personal information tallied with the company's values of respect for consumer trust.   (The privacy policy of The New York Times says that, in the event of a business transaction, consumers' information may be included among transferred assets. It does not promise to notify users if such a situation were ever to occur.)    After one data-driven service buys another, it can leave consumers questioning how their details will be used. Unless the company has made a previous promise to inform them or the data is specifically regulated by a law like the federal Video Privacy Protection Act, sites and apps generally do not need to be notified about transfers of their information.   Last year, for instance, Facebook bought WhatsApp, the stand-alone messaging service, for nearly $22 billion. Subsequently, some people who regularly used both services, like Neil Kirkpatrick, a digital project manager in Berkhamsted, England, began to notice some odd coincidences.   ''Added someone to my iPhone contacts to chat on @WhatsApp and now Facebook is recommending them as a friend,'' Mr. Kirkpatrick wrote on Twitter recently.   In a phone interview, Mr. Kirkpatrick said he had not permitted Facebook access to his contact list and had set his Facebook profile to prevent people outside his network from using his phone number to locate him. So he did not understand how Facebook could have connected him to new contacts on WhatsApp.   ''They could do a lot more to be upfront and honest about what information they have on you and where they are getting it,'' Mr. Kirkpatrick said. ''It doesn't feel like you are in control of your own data.''   Jonathan Thaw, a Facebook spokesman, said Facebook did not use contact information from WhatsApp. He added that Facebook used a variety of factors -- such as mutual friends, work and education information -- to suggest friends.   WhatsApp did not respond to emails seeking comment.   Some sites first adopted fire sale clauses after the Federal Trade Commission in 2000 sued Toysmart.com, a bankrupt online toy retailer, for deceptive practices regarding data gleaned from its site visitors. Toysmart was seeking to sell customer details -- including their children's names and birth dates -- even though the company's privacy policy had promised never to share that information with third parties.   In an effort to avoid similar complaints, other sites began claiming the right to sell or share user data as part of business transactions.   It's a trend that is likely to widen as companies introduce new Internet-enabled products, like connected cars and video cameras, which can collect and transmit a constant stream of data to the cloud.   Rather than wade through companies' data-use policies before registering with websites, however, many people simply click the agree button.   ''I think society views it as what you have to do to get to the next page of the website,'' said Elise S. Frejka, a lawyer who served as the consumer privacy ombudsman in the recent RadioShack bankruptcy case.    But reading through a site's data-sharing policies can be a confounding experience.   One example is Nest, an Internet-connected thermostat company that enables people to control their home energy use via their mobile devices. Acquired by Google for $3.2 billion last year, Nest has different online privacy pages with seemingly conflicting statements.   One page, in colloquial English, says that the company values trust: ''It's why we work hard to protect your data. And why your info is not for sale. To anyone.''   Another page, containing Nest's official privacy policy, however, says: ''Upon the sale or transfer of the company and/or all or part of its assets, your personal information may be among the items sold or transferred.''   In an email, Alexandra Zoz Cuccias, a Nest spokeswoman, said the two statements were ''not contradictory.''   The information on the first page, she wrote, ''is meant to be very clear and explain how we think about privacy, in part by helping users understand how our business does and does not work.'' For instance, she said, Nest does not sell its customer lists to third parties.   In the actual privacy policy that indicates that customer data may be included as part of a company asset sale, she said, ''we provide a necessarily more detailed discussion to users about the specific ways Nest uses and processes data.''

"Digital Privacy, in the U.S. and Europe","To the Editor: Re ''Mass Surveillance on Two Continents'' (editorial, Oct. 9), about a court ruling invalidating an agreement between the European Union and the United States on the storage of personal data:     Judicial decisions rarely solve complex legal problems. That is the work of the lawmakers. However, it is absolutely vital that courts protect fundamental rights. And that is what happened in this case. The European Court of Justice concluded that Safe Harbor did not provide an adequate legal basis to transfer the data of Europeans to the United States.   You are also correct that work needs to be done on both sides of the Atlantic. Europe does not have a monopoly on the best solutions. Many of the privacy laws adopted in other nations have their origins in the United States.   But you also must recognize that concerns about privacy are driven by the National Security Agency programs of mass surveillance and the failure to establish meaningful regulation of Internet companies, almost all based in the United States.   These are the main privacy problems today. Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, interested in moving forward after the recent court decision, would be wise to maintain their focus.   MARC ROTENBERG   Washington   The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and teaches the law of information privacy at Georgetown University.   To the Editor:   You are right to point out that intelligence agencies are having a field day in Europe, too. At least individuals can use their fundamental rights to protest, vote and use the courts to counter indiscriminate surveillance. And we do, and the courts are beginning to take note. There is no distinction on the basis of nationality; United States citizens have equal rights in the European Union.   But there is no redress for European citizens against National Security Agency surveillance; your laws discriminate against foreigners. Privacy International is campaigning to ensure that anyone, anywhere, could file to have a complaint heard.   Two wrongs don't make a right. We need strong protections on both sides of the Atlantic, and this court ruling has shown that the United States cannot provide consumers and citizens with equivalent protection that the E.U., and many other countries, are providing. American consumers deserve strong protections too; comprehensive data protection legislation in the United States is long overdue and would be a welcome first step for all.     ANNA FIELDER   London   The writer is chairwoman of Privacy International.   To the Editor:   The decision by the European Court of Justice striking down the Safe Harbor agreement illustrates how the European Union's embrace of privacy as a fundamental right gives it tools to address ever-growing governmental and commercial surveillance.   The Times is correct to decry E.U. hypocrisy. Europe criticizes how American Internet giants collect vast amounts of information, but its own companies mimic the online business model we've pioneered. However, the court's ruling is a significant advance in protecting the public from what is a powerful and pervasive apparatus.   Our country urgently requires a law that enables individuals to control how their data is gathered and used. Until one is enacted, those living in the E.U. are in a better position to defend their fundamental right to privacy in the digital era.   JEFF CHESTER   Washington   The writer directs the Center for Digital Democracy, an online consumer rights group.     "
"Jonathan Mayer, Well-Known Online Security Expert, Joins F.C.C.","Among privacy groups in the United States, Jonathan Mayer is known as a vocal advocate who has defended the right of consumers to turn off online tracking of their browsing activities.  Among digital security experts, Mr. Mayer is known, among other things, as the Stanford computer scientist who reported in 2012 that Google was bypassing privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser by placing bits of code in digital ads that tracked the sites users visited. Google subsequently agreed to pay a $22.5 million fine to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that the company had misrepresented its privacy practices. Now Mr. Mayer, 28, has a new handle: federal regulator.  On Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission said it had hired Mr. Mayer as chief technologist in the agency's enforcement bureau. Mr. Mayer joins the agency as it is developing new privacy rules for online providers, like AT&T and Verizon, that could limit their tracking of consumers' web activities. His hiring is an indication that the F.C.C. is bolstering the enforcement team that investigates data breaches and other consumer protection cases.  This year, for instance, the F.C.C. announced a $100 million fine against AT&T Mobility, which the agency said had misled customers who signed up for unlimited data plans. The agency charged that AT&T had failed to notify consumers adequately that the company could reduce their data transmissions to speeds that were much slower than the company had advertised. ""That's not overly aggressive; that's basic consumer protection,"" Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C., said of the enforcement bureau's work last week at a congressional hearing. ""Whether it's preventing cramming, improving Wi-Fi access in hotels, or protecting consumer data, the commission will not hesitate to act to protect consumers' interests."" Mr. Mayer has previously investigated similar issues as an independent researcher and lawyer. In his personal blog in January, Mr. Mayer said Verizon Wireless used unique online customer identification codes that could make consumers vulnerable to covert tracking and profiling by third parties. Verizon subsequently announced that it would allow mobile customers to opt out of being tracked using those identifiers. In August, Mr. Mayer reported that AT&T was injecting extra ads onto websites when consumers used its Wi-Fi hot spots at Dulles International Airport outside Washington - without, he said, adequately notifying consumers of the practice, a story covered by Ars Technica. A spokesman for AT&T subsequently told the publication that the company had ended a trial ad injection program at two airports. The F.C.C. declined to comment on whether its enforcement bureau had opened investigations into reports by Mr. Mayer before he was hired by the agency. "
Role for State in Internet Policy Shows China's Influence at U.N.,"Over the last six months, United Nations diplomats have negotiated over the text of a document set to define the policies and frameworks of how the Internet is governed in the future, and who has a role in the process. The final version presented on Wednesday at the General Assembly contains a word that civil society groups, businesses and many Western governments oppose: multilateral.    Multilateral is code for states making the rules. The inclusion of the word was largely spearheaded by China, which worked to enshrine state control over the Internet in the document, said negotiators who were involved in the process. During the discussions, representatives from China demanded repeatedly that the word be included, according to participants and draft versions of the document that laid out which countries made each submission.   ''China has been very active in the negotiations at pushing for more state control over how people get online and who has access to data,'' said Peter Micek, global policy and legal counsel for Access Now, a digital-rights organization based in New York that was involved in the negotiation efforts.    The outcome document, presented at a United Nations meeting known as the Ten-Year Review of the World Summit on the Information Society, is an indication of how China is trying to assert its influence over how the Internet will be governed. Although the document is nonbinding for member states, it outlines policies and grants authority to United Nations bodies like the International Telecommunication Union and others in which China exerts significant influence. The document also provides an international precedent that governments can claim legitimizes their own agendas.   China failed to get many of its proposed insertions and deletions of language into the text. At points, Chinese officials tried to remove phrases like ''freedom of expression'' and ''democratic,'' which other nations wanted to include to safeguard human rights and privacy online. The final version of the document still has those phrases.   The final document almost completely rejects the multilateral model, which is mentioned once. Instead it repeatedly endorses the more inclusive ''multistakeholder'' approach to Internet governance proposed by the United States, the European Union and developing nations like Brazil and India. This model promotes a management system based on the consensus of civil society, businesses, academic institutions, engineers and governments.   ''To their credit, negotiators fought off the worst proposals, and recognized that our human rights to privacy and expression, and access to information and digital security tools, remain under threat,'' Mr. Micek said.   Still, China appears satisfied that the document recognized ''a leading role'' for governments in cybersecurity matters relating to national security -- one of China's top objectives -- and that it refers to the United Nations Charter, which enshrines principles of state sovereignty and nonintervention by the United Nations in domestic affairs.   ''We think those principles apply to Internet communication technologies,'' said one of the Chinese negotiators, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''We found that the outcome document is in China's interest.''   The document was formally adopted as China holds its World Internet Conference, which started Wednesday. The conference is part of a global lobbying effort by China aimed at promoting a concept, ''Internet sovereignty,'' which maintains that each nation should have the unfettered right to regulate cyberinfrastructure and activities in its territory, including the ability to censor and restrict information within and across its borders.   The three-day meeting, held in the eastern province of Zhejiang, was used last year by officials to urge participants to sign a pledge accepting China's claims to Internet sovereignty. Concerns that a new document could be circulated have led to less Western corporate and diplomatic participation this year, according to several people familiar with the attendees, who asked not to be named to avoid retaliation by Chinese authorities.   China has long tried to gain a broader say in how the Internet and technology more generally are regulated worldwide. Beijing has prevailed on state-run telecom operators to spend heavily to gain more influence in cellular standards, while Chinese officials have worked their way up the hierarchies in global regulatory bodies, like the International Telecommunication Union, whose secretary general is Chinese. The agency has increasingly taken on cybersecurity management, a prime Chinese objective, as a result of the first World Summit on the Information Society outcome document, adopted in 2005.   The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, endorsed Internet sovereignty in his keynote address at the Chinese Internet conference on Wednesday. Lu Wei, China's Internet czar, whose handle on the popular social messaging app WeChat translates to ''I'm Watching You,'' has raised his international profile with trips abroad to lobby for acceptance of China's view of how the Internet should be managed. That includes a major Chinese-American technology forum held in Seattle in September with top executives from Silicon Valley companies like Apple and Facebook.   In China's view, Internet sovereignty justifies the tangle of controls used to monitor its more than 640 million Internet users and restrict what they see and say online with a system known as the Great Firewall that blocks thousands of foreign websites.   The first World Summit on the Information Society produced a document that set agendas and processes largely focused on issues like bridging the digital divide between developed and developing nations. But the rise of social media and hacking over the last decade spurred some countries, including China, to demand last year a renegotiation of previous Internet governance agreements that excluded all nongovernment stakeholders.   Even after that was rejected, negotiations over the current outcome document, which began this summer and involved all United Nations member states, quickly turned into a furious battle over language about security and the rights of governments to control the Internet within their digital borders, participants said.   China tried to increase its sway throughout the negotiations, frequently aligning with Russia, Cuba and a group of developing countries known as the Group of 77, which actually consists of 134 nations, participants said.   China and its allies tried last month to add language that would have made authority for Internet-related public policy issues the ''sovereign right of states,'' a phrase that the United States, Canada and other countries said would end negotiations if it were included. The Western bloc negotiated for two days before the other side withdrew the proposal, participants said.   While Internet sovereignty does not appear in the final document, many diplomats and civil society groups say they remain wary of China's ''multilateral'' intentions.   ''The Chinese are terrific negotiators,'' said David A. Gross, a former State Department coordinator for international communications and information policy. Mr. Gross led the American delegation to the first World Summit on the Information Society and is representing the Internet Governance Coalition, an American telecommunications and media industry group, at this year's General Assembly meeting.   ''They set things up over time in order to advance their interests and they don't feel the need to win everything off the bat,'' he said.    "
Still Waiting for Strong Privacy Laws,"President Obama this week proposed privacy laws that could give Americans greater control over their personal information. But Republicans in Congress will likely undermine or ignore many of the measures.  Some of Mr. Obama's ideas should have bipartisan appeal. For example, he wants to forbid companies from using data about students that they collect when they sell software and services to primary and secondary schools for marketing purposes. That measure is based on a law that California adopted last year with Democratic and Republican votes in the State Legislature. Most members of Congress would have a hard time justifying voting against a bill that sought to protect the privacy of minors. But another proposal in Mr. Obama's package could result in less protection for consumers. It would require retailers, banks and other companies who have been hacked to notify customers whose data had been stolen within 30 days after officials learned of the breach. The problem is that such a law could invalidate existing state laws and prevent states from enacting new privacy laws. Most states and the District of Columbia already have disclosure laws. Alabama, New Mexico and South Dakota do not. Some states have laws that are stronger than what Mr. Obama proposed. For example, California, Connecticut and New Jersey generally require notification of a data breach as soon as possible. Many states allow consumers to ''freeze'' credit reports so that hackers cannot sign up for credit cards and loans in their names. Other states allow residents to sue businesses for not protecting their data. Privacy law experts say Congress could use a data breach laws to pre-empt these state requirements. Mr. Obama and lawmakers in Congress say a federal law would establish a national standard for businesses to follow. As a practical matter, privacy advocates say, companies are not hamstrung by having to follow different state policies because they usually do whatever is required by the strongest state law in all states. Another problem with the president's proposal is that it does not require businesses to improve the security of their computer systems so data are not stolen in the first place. There is no doubt that federal law does not adequately protect the privacy of Americans. Numerous reports produced by Congress, the Federal Trade Commission and newspapers including The Times have documented the widespread collection of data like Internet browsing histories, retail store purchases and health information. Some companies known as data brokers organize and analyze vast sums of such data into dossiers on individuals and families that can be used to target people based on their medical conditions, economic desperation and their willingness to spend money. In 2012, Mr. Obama wisely called for a ''privacy bill of rights'' that would give individuals more control over how their information is collected and used. The president now says his administration will produce such a bill of rights in the next 45 days. But nobody realistically expects the current Republican-led Congress to adopt a strong law that truly empowers consumers. State lawmakers in California, Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere have been willing to pass privacy laws. Those efforts are insufficient, but at least those lawmakers are trying, unlike members of Congress who have taken little interest in a privacy bill of rights because Internet companies and advertisers have heavily lobbied against it. That is why Mr. Obama must be careful not to give Congress an opportunity to undermine state laws. "
Shortcomings of Cybersecurity Bills,"A series of brazen hacking attacks against companies like Sony Pictures, Target and Anthem have spurred lawmakers in Congress to propose cybersecurity legislation. These bills could help make American networks somewhat less vulnerable to hackers, but they would do so at a cost to the privacy of individuals.  Last month, the House passed two bills that aim to foster greater sharing of information about cybersecurity threats between businesses and the government. The Senate could vote on a similar measure before its Memorial Day recess. And the Obama administration has indicated support for such legislation, which suggests that some variation on the three bills could become law this year.    Legislators say their hope is to persuade companies and government agencies to exchange detailed information about how hackers are trying to steal secrets from their computer servers. This, they argue, could help businesses secure their systems while helping government identify the attackers. Under all three bills, in exchange for sharing information voluntarily, companies would receive immunity from lawsuits. The bills would also authorize businesses to take defensive steps to protect themselves from hackers.   But many public interest groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Democracy and Technology are concerned that these bills could become a way for government agencies to increase surveillance on individuals. The bills would allow businesses to share data that include some personal information about customers, employees and Internet users. They would also allow government agencies like the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use that information in investigations that are not related to cybersecurity without having to obtain a search warrant as they are normally required to do.   In addition, the bills would allow businesses to defend themselves against hackers through software that could remotely disable or disrupt the computers or networks suspected of being behind the attack. But this kind of license could create big problems. The Obama administration, which supports other security efforts, has warned that authorizing companies to engage in such defensive measures could lead to more harm if the retaliation disables the wrong computers. This would certainly create tensions with foreign governments if their computers are mistakenly targeted by American businesses.    A broader failing of these bills is that they will not push corporations to make their computer systems more secure from hackers, something that is clearly needed given recent high-profile attacks. For one thing, giving companies immunity from lawsuits even when they fail to respond to credible threats reduces their incentive to invest in more secure systems.    A 2012 bill sponsored by former Senator Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, tried to address this problem by giving immunity only to companies that agreed to adopt new standards to reduce their digital vulnerabilities. Their bill did not pass because of opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which argued that the proposal would be too burdensome for corporations.   When cybersecurity legislation comes to the Senate floor, lawmakers should fix the shortcomings of these bills.    "
Data Breach at Anthem May Augur a Trend,"After an online attack on Anthem, by far the largest breach in the industry, security experts warned on Friday that more attacks on health care organizations were likely because of the high value of the data on the black market. Anthem, one of the country's largest health insurers, said the hackers did not appear to have stolen information about its customers' medical claims. But medical identification numbers were taken, along with Social Security numbers, addresses and email addresses, which could be used for medical fraud.    According to a federal database, many much smaller attacks across the country have included both medical records and financial information.   Medical identity theft has become a booming business, according to security experts, who warn that other health care companies are likely to be targeted as a result of the hackers' success in penetrating Anthem's computer systems. Hackers often try one company to test their methods before moving on to others, and criminals are becoming increasingly creative in their use of medical information, experts say.    ''The industry has become, over the last three years, a much bigger target,'' said Daniel Nutkis, the chief executive of the Health Information Trust Alliance, an industry group that works with health care organizations to improve their data security.   The publicity surrounding the breach, which exposed information on about 80 million people, is already generating phishing email scams, in which criminals posing as legitimate businesses try to persuade people to sign up for bogus credit protection services and provide personal information about themselves.   On Friday, Anthem sent out an alert to its customers warning them of the scam, which the company described as an ''opportunistic'' attempt to take advantage of news of the breach, but the company emphasized it had no evidence that the scam artists were the hackers.   The company, which operates under a series of Blue Cross plans in states like California, Connecticut and New York, is working with federal investigators to determine the source of the attack. Some signs continued to point to China, which has previously been thought to target health care companies, although the investigation is still in its early stages.    If Chinese hackers are responsible, it raises an immediate and hard-to-answer question: Are they acting on behalf of the government? Or are they independent actors, seeking to sell the information they have obtained?   The difference is a big one. The United States has already indicted five members of a People's Liberation Army unit that is thought to be responsible for stealing intellectual property, usually designs from American and European companies. But the group is not known for stealing large amounts of personal information.   The key is the hackers' motive. While they could be preparing to sell the information on the black market, they may also be searching for intelligence on government officials or senior executives who mask their personal information, but tend to provide real names and real numbers when dealing with health-related matters.   ''The question is whether this is about espionage or theft,'' said one government official who was briefed on the investigation.    As a rich source of personal information, health care organizations -- like hospitals, doctors' offices and insurers -- are increasingly going to be vulnerable to attacks, according to security experts. ''Anthem is not the last of these organizations,'' said Cameron Camp, a researcher for ESET, which specializes in data security. ''We're going to see that style of attack again.''   Medical identify theft is on the rise, experts say, because it pays. In black-market auctions, complete patient medical records tend to fetch higher prices than credit card numbers. One security expert said that at one auction a patient medical record sold for $251, while credit card records were selling for 33 cents.   After the large data breaches at major retailers like Target and Home Depot, the black market for credit cards has been flooded. And after the bank becomes aware of the theft, those cards are usually canceled quickly.   In contrast, patient medical records typically include information not easily destroyed, including date of birth, Social Security numbers and even physical characteristics that make them more useful for things like identity theft, creation of visas or insurance fraud by falsely billing for expensive medical or dental procedures that were either never done or performed on someone else. Some criminals have also tried a form of so-called ransom ware in which they threaten to reveal medical information unless they are paid.    ''The whole thing is evolving,'' said Barbara Filkins, an analyst with the SANS Institute, which has studied the risk to the health care sector.   Hospital systems, for example, are increasingly asking for photo IDs and driver's licenses in an effort to block patients who have stolen someone else's medical identity, said John Barlament, a lawyer at Quarles & Brady in Milwaukee. The use of medical identity fraud is growing, he said. ''It's a one-way trend here,'' he said.   The push to digitize patient health records in hospitals and doctors' offices has also made medical records increasingly vulnerable, according to security experts. Moving medical records from paper to electronic form allows both patients and providers better access, but it has also made patient records susceptible to breaches, whether unintentionally or through a criminal attack.   About 90 percent of health care organizations reported they have had at least one data breach over the last two years, according to a survey of health care providers published last year by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy and data protection research firm. The founder, Larry Ponemon, a security expert, says most were because of employee negligence or system flaws, but a growing number are malicious or criminal.    Last year, 18 health care providers reported data breaches because of some form of hacking. Information at Centura Health was compromised last year after a phishing scheme obtained access to employee email accounts. The data included, in some instances, Social Security numbers, Medicare beneficiary numbers and clinical information for 12,000 patients of the facility, based in Englewood, Colo. In another case, a keystroke logger virus that infected three computers for a few weeks early last year at the student health center at the University of California, Irvine, may have captured patient's health and dental insurance numbers and diagnoses.   Health care providers have sharply increased their spending on data security in the last year, but they remain technologically far behind other industries, say experts.   ''When we go to a health care show and you look at the screens of different systems, it's like we're looking at Windows XP,'' said Bob Janacek, a co-founder and chief technology officer of DataMotion, an email encryption and health information service provider. ''But you go to a banking show and they're talking about how to slice a billionth of a second off a transaction to get a competitive edge, it's just totally different.''   In the new electronic records world, security experts say the risks of a data breach are found on many fronts. For instance, there are systems and protocols that allow for patient medical records to be encrypted and emailed from one provider to another, but some doctors are sending clinical records through personal email accounts using their own smartphones or tablets.   The Anthem breach has become the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny. Several state attorneys general are also conducting their own investigations or considering doing so, including George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general.    The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of state insurance regulators, said it planned a multistate examination of the insurer. ''We are in agreement that an immediate and comprehensive review of the company's security must be a priority to ensure protection of consumers who are covered by Anthem,'' said Monica Lindeen, the association president and the Montana insurance regulator, in a statement.    "
An Obama Plan to Stop Foreign Hackers Has Mixed Results,"Two years ago, the Obama administration announced a new strategy to curb online espionage. The five-point strategy came after a 2013 article in The New York Times about how the newspaper had been breached by Chinese hackers. The Times, working with a security company, also concluded that thousands of other American companies had been hacked by a Chinese military unit in Shanghai. The White House said it would increase public awareness of the threat, encourage the private sector to increase its defenses, focus diplomacy on protecting trade secrets overseas, improve trade secret theft legislation and make investigations and prosecutions of corporate and state-sponsored trade secret theft a top priority.  Since then, public awareness is up and so is spending. But the hacking continues. The private sector spent $665 million on data loss prevention last year, according to the technology research firm Gartner, with a 15 percent increase expected this year. On the legislative front, Congress strengthened penalties for those convicted under the Economic Espionage Act, raising the maximum fine for individuals convicted to $5 million from $500,000. And in terms of law enforcement, the F.B.I. lists digital crime, including intrusions that result in trade secret theft, as its third priority, just behind terrorism and counterintelligence. The agency reported a 60 percent increase in trade secret investigations from 2009 through 2013. But diplomatic efforts to engage China on the topic have largely failed. China's response has simply been that it, too, is a victim of online attacks. And online espionage shows little sign of abating. Last year, 18 percent of the 1,598 confirmed breaches analyzed by Verizon were used for online espionage, compared with 22 percent of 1,367 attacks in 2013. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last year that 1 to 3 percent of United States gross domestic product was still lost, every year, through trade secret theft. ""There hasn't been any change,"" said James A. Lewis, a digital security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""There's a lot more we can do. But we haven't reached our pain point for taking more drastic steps on cyberespionage, and the Chinese haven't reached their pain point for stopping it."" The Justice Department is under significant pressure to bring more trade secret cases under the Economic Espionage Act. But it is incredibly difficult to bring cases against sophisticated hackers, who are not only smart enough to cover their tracks but also smart enough to live outside the United States. It is equally difficult to serve court summonses to the Chinese corporations that investigators say they believe are benefiting from stolen trade secrets. In 2013, the Justice Department brought several indictments that charged Chinese nationals with stealing trade secrets for the benefit of corporations in China, but none of the cases involved trade secrets obtained through online attacks. All the indictments involved either employees or former employees accused of passing their employer's trade secrets to a company in China, or people who paid an employee to do so. The story was similar in 2014. During the first nine months of the year, the Justice Department reported 20 new prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act - a 33 percent increase from 2013 - and several convictions, but only two of the indictments involved trade secrets theft via digital intrusions. One, the landmark indictment filed last year against five members of the People's Liberation Army for hacking United States companies, was largely symbolic given that the United States has no jurisdiction in China. In another, in August, a federal grand jury in California indicted a Chinese businessman on charges of conspiring to steal military secrets by hacking into Boeing and other United States companies. The defendant, Su Bin, is awaiting extradition in Canada. The Justice Department's biggest success last year was when prosecutors obtained the first-ever federal jury conviction for economic espionage charges against two Americans and a corporation accused of selling DuPont trade secrets to a state-owned company in China. But that was not a hacking case. The two were charged with stealing trade secrets the old-fashioned way, by poaching former DuPont employees. And in that case too, the Justice Department's efforts to bring charges against two Chinese citizens who played a central role in the theft, and the Chinese state-owned companies that benefited from them, have stalled. A look at two cases the Justice Department did bring against one Chinese-American and another Chinese citizen living in the United States suggests that the agency has found it difficult to constructively respond to online espionage. Those two cases suggest the pressure to bring such cases may be doing more harm than good. In Ohio, the Justice Department pursued a Chinese-American hydrologist for potential violations of the Economic Espionage Act, court documents show, but failed to find evidence and still tried to prosecute her for lesser charges that could have added up to 25 years in prison. After a review of her case revealed she was hardly a Chinese spy, the government dropped charges just before it was set to go to trial in March. And in Philadelphia, a Chinese citizen who has permanent residency status in the United States has been held in a federal detention center since September 2012, after he was accused of damaging a corporate server computer to cover up trade secret theft. There, too, the government did not find violations of the Economic Espionage Act, but has aggressively pursued lesser charges, including intentionally causing harm to a protected computer system. His trial is scheduled for November. Trying another tack, President Obama signed a new executive order in April that established the first sanctions aimed at curbing foreign cyberespionage. The order authorized financial and travel sanctions against anyone participating in online attacks that posed a threat to the ""national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States."" Until those sanctions are exercised, experts say the only option for curbing digital espionage may be patient diplomacy. ""They don't live here, so we can't arrest them, and we're not going to go to war over this,"" Mr. Lewis said. ""So the key is consistent persuasion and pressure. It may be slow and it may not work. But there is no other alternative."" "
Wall St. Is Told to Tighten Digital Security of Partners,"Wall Street's oversight of cybersecurity measures at outside firms it does business with remains a work in progress, according to a review by New York State's top financial regulator. A survey of 40 banks found that only about a third require their outside vendors to notify them of any breach to their own networks, which could in turn compromise confidential information of the bank and its customers.    Fewer than half the banks surveyed said they conducted regular on-site inspections to make sure the vendors they hire -- like data providers, check-processing firms, accounting firms, law firms and even janitorial companies -- are using adequate security measures. About half require vendors to provide a warranty that their products and data streams are secure and virus-free.    Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services, whose office began surveying banks on digital security in October, said the responses showed financial institutions need to do more to keep tabs on the outside firms that have access to their networks. But Mr. Lawsky added that he was willing to give financial institutions time to improve their oversight of vendors even as they bolster their own systems.   ''I don't cast aspersions on any institutions because the cyberthreat has evolved so quickly,'' Mr. Lawsky said in an interview discussing the survey results. ''Things are in a great state of flux in terms of the institutions and for regulators, too, but all of these things need to be tightened up in a very serious way.''   Mr. Lawsky's office is working on proposals and guidelines for banks and other financial institutions, in particular the security of outside vendors. One recommendation could be that financial firms, as part of the contracting process, obtain guarantees from vendors about the quality of their security.   Over the last year, financial regulators nationwide have increasingly focused on steps taken by banks and financial firms to not only safeguard their own networks, but to ensure the outside firms they use are adequately protected as well. The concern about the security of outside vendors comes in the wake of big intrusions at Target and Home Depot that took place in part because the hackers used logon credentials that were apparently stolen from an outside vendor.   One particular area of concern on Wall Street is the security of large law firms, which not only do regulatory work for banks but also advise on corporate transactions. This year, a cybersecurity team at Citigroup issued an internal report that said law firms were a logical target for hackers because they are rich repositories for confidential data. The report also cautioned bank employees that digital security at many law firms, despite improvements, generally remains below the standards of other industries.   For some time now, Mr. Lawsky has called on banks and other financial institutions to improve their security measures. He said Wall Street and other financial services firms did appear to be paying more heed to the threat posed by hackers, especially after a breach last summer at JPMorgan Chase that resulted in hackers gaining access to email addresses and phone numbers of 83 million households and small businesses. Mr. Lawsky said the apparent theft of customer information at the health insurer Anthem in February had similarly heightened awareness of the importance of data security in the insurance industry.   Mr. Lawsky's office recently sent a survey on vendor oversight to insurance companies.   The survey of banks also found that financial firms in the United States lag their counterparts in Europe when it comes to adding protections to safeguard information that is shared with third-party firms. Mr. Lawsky's office said European banks were better at requiring vendors and other outside parties to use ''multifactor authentication,'' a process that requires something more than just a user name and password.   Security consultants argue multifactor authentication should be the norm across a wide range of industries because it makes it more difficult for hackers to break into a network by simply getting their hands on an employee's stolen login credentials.   In the JPMorgan breach, hackers penetrated the bank's vast network by finding a server that had not been upgraded with so-called two-factor authentication, which requires a second, one-time password to gain access. The hackers also breached a website for a charitable racing competition that is managed by an outside vendor. But the bank has said that that intrusion did not provide a gateway to JPMorgan's own network.   ''The fight against cyberterrorism and cybercrime is one that is not going away,'' Mr. Lawsky said. ''We need to start that fight with certain basic hygiene tests and that involves tightening your security with vendors and tightening your security with multifactor authentication.''     "
A Hacking Grounds Flights of Poland's National Airline,"Dozens of flights of Poland's national airline, LOT Airlines, were grounded for several hours on Sunday, stranding thousands of passengers at Chopin Airport in Warsaw, after what the airline described as a computer attack by unidentified outsiders.  The airline said the attack lasted about five hours and disrupted the system that LOT uses to establish its flight plans. The airline said it canceled 10 domestic and international flights and delayed about a dozen others until it fixed the problem. Flights headed to Warsaw landed safely. Operations returned to normal on Monday.    LOT did not provide a detailed explanation of how outsiders might have penetrated its computer systems. A company spokesman said the attack might have been a denial of service attack, which typically floods a system with requests, causing its overload and failure. If confirmed, the attack would be one of the first instances in which flights were canceled or delayed because of a malicious hacking.   It is not clear, however, how such an attack might have compromised LOT's flight operations system. Denial of service attacks typically take place over open communication networks like email, while flight operations are generally built as private networks.   During a news conference on Monday, however, the airline's chief executive said that other airlines needed to think about such risks in the future.   ''This is an industry problem on a much wider scale, and for sure we have to give it more attention,'' said Sebastian Mikosz, the chief executive, according to Reuters. ''I expect it can happen to anyone anytime.''   The possibility of hacking is causing greater concern in the industry as digital systems increasingly replace traditional ones. Airlines are increasingly connecting their planes, dispatch operations, airports and other systems. This interconnection makes airlines more efficient and allows a better flow of passenger and flight information. But it might potentially make the airlines more vulnerable if not properly secured.   A report by the Government Accountability Office in April found that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States should devote more resources to cybersecurity as it moved the air traffic control network away from radar to satellite-based systems.   The report noted that airplanes were increasingly connected to the Internet and cautioned that this connection could ''potentially provide unauthorized remote access to aircraft avionics systems.''   Computer problems are nothing new. This month, United Airlines grounded about 150 flights because an unidentified computer problem prevented pilots from getting their digital flight plans. And in April, American Airlines said that dozens of its flights were delayed because a bug in its company iPad software meant that pilots did not have accurate airport maps.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Britain to Give China Big Stake in Nuclear Industry as Investor and Contractor,"LONDON -- In an important breakthrough for Chinese industry and global influence, the British and Chinese governments agreed on Wednesday to give China a substantial stake in the British nuclear industry, both as an investor and as a contractor. The deal was the commercial highlight of President Xi Jinping's pageant-filled, four-day state visit to Britain, which is eager to get more Chinese investment and to export more British products to China.    In a short news conference after signing the deal, the British prime minister, David Cameron, called the agreement historic and said it would produce thousands of British jobs. ''The stronger the relationship between our countries, the more we'll be able to have a serious dialogue'' on areas of disagreement, like human rights, Mr. Cameron said.   He said the two countries had signed agreements worth nearly 40 billion pounds, or about $62 billion.    Mr. Xi also hailed the nuclear deal. He said that China respected the rule of law and ''attaches great importance to human rights,'' but on ''a path suited to China's conditions.''   Critics have raised security concerns about Chinese involvement in Britain's nuclear power network -- particularly the potential for Chinese theft of industrial secrets from Britain and from Électricité de France, the French company that is one of Europe's major nuclear contractors. The company, known as EDF, holds the contract to build Britain's first new nuclear power plant in years.   Modern nuclear plants and the electric utility grid make extensive use of computer networks. The ability of hackers to penetrate even well-protected data systems, analysts say, has increased the overall vulnerability of the nuclear industry, which has in the past largely relied on physical barriers for protection.   ''China would gain access to information that would give it more insight into the vulnerabilities in the U.K.'s critical infrastructure,'' said Caroline Baylon, a specialist on online security at Chatham House, a research institute in London.   ''As much as possible, your critical infrastructure should be national,'' Ms. Baylon said.   A recent Chatham House report described the various ways that hackers might be able to worm their way into the operating system of a nuclear plant -- and potentially cause widespread power outages.   But British officials said that such concerns were highly exaggerated, that the Chinese would hold only a minority stake and that Britain would continue to tightly regulate the nuclear industry.   Initially, the Chinese companies will be minority investors and suppliers to EDF. But the deal announced on Wednesday opens the way for China to invest in future British nuclear projects and possibly to play a larger role in building the plants, giving more credibility to the Chinese nuclear industry and perhaps helping it to sell more nuclear plants abroad.   The deal involves plans for a nuclear power station called Hinkley Point C and would result in the first nuclear plant begun in Western Europe since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan made many countries rethink their nuclear energy strategies. France has long been a global leader in nuclear power, but it has stumbled lately in trying to introduce a new generation of technology -- the type of reactors that will be used in Britain.   Hinkley Point C, on a headland overlooking the Bristol Channel in southwestern England, is already years behind schedule and well over its original cost estimates. The cost is now projected at £18 billion, and the plant is not expected to open before 2025. The site already has an operating nuclear power plant and two older reactors that are being decommissioned.   A state-controlled Chinese company, China General Nuclear Power Corporation, has agreed to invest £6 billion and take a 33.5 percent stake in the Hinkley Point project.   China General expects to help EDF build two more reactors planned for Sizewell, in eastern England. The French company has agreed to help China General win a license to build a Chinese-designed nuclear reactor in Britain at a site in Bradwell, east of London, which would be a first for China.   Although Britain receives nearly 20 percent of its electricity from its fleet of aging nuclear reactors, the country ceded much of its commercial nuclear industry to France in 2009. That is when EDF bought nearly all of Britain's reactors.   As in many nations, Britain's electric utilities have neither the financial strength nor the inclination to take the risks involved in building new nuclear power stations. Centrica, a British utility that is a minority partner with EDF on the existing nuclear plants, walked away from a 20 percent stake in the new one, citing delays and rising costs.   Ewan Lawson, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London research organization, said he was not concerned about the early stages of Chinese involvement in Britain's nuclear program. ''Essentially, they are funding a French'' project, he said.   ''In a perfect world, you would have all your infrastructure engineered by your own nationals, over whom you have some degree of surveillance,'' Mr. Lawson said. ''That is not the world the U.K. lives in.''   Having not built a new power station since 1995, Britain has little choice but to look to outside suppliers and financing.   The French industry's reputation has been damaged by major delays and cost overruns at projects at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France. The French government is revamping the industry, giving EDF a more dominant role over Areva, the company that has played a major role in designing and constructing the reactors that are experiencing problems. Areva has been forced to cut thousands of jobs.   As Britain's North Sea oil reserves are gradually drawn down, the government sees nuclear power as an important way to diversify the country's energy supply in a carbon-free way that will also help meet its long-term climate goals.   The Hinkley Point C plant, though not expected to go into operation before 2025, is intended to meet around 7 percent of Britain's current electricity needs and run relatively cheaply for at least 60 years.   For the Chinese nuclear industry, the chance to invest in Britain represents a major opportunity. China has by far the most ambitious nuclear building program in the world with 68 commercial reactors under construction or in the planning stages, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group. China has received help from the French and the big Japanese company Toshiba but has gradually developed its own local designs and built up a large chain of domestic suppliers.   Industry executives say this building boom means that Chinese nuclear contractors have gained considerable knowledge and experience, which they hope to apply outside China.   ''They have a very clear strategy to build their nuclear capacity and capability,'' said Colin Elcoate, vice president for business development at SPX Flow, a North Carolina company that supplies pumps and other equipment to Chinese and other nuclear power companies.   Mr. Elcoate says the Chinese ultimately want to move into nuclear exports. But the Chinese nuclear contractors have had little international success so far, with one nuclear station under construction in Pakistan and a few others planned in countries like Argentina and Romania.   Analysts say that building a plant in Britain, which has one of the more rigorous approval processes, would give China the credibility it needs. If Chinese technology is ''licensed in the U.K., it is licensable anywhere,'' said Glenn George, a Washington-based consultant on nuclear issues at NERA Economic Consulting.   Mr. George and other analysts think that the market in the coming decades will be substantial. Although Germany plans to phase out nuclear power, at least some other European countries -- including the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain -- intend to keep atomic power.   And there is substantial interest in nuclear power among emerging-market countries like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia that seek a cleaner alternative to coal and other fossil fuels. Arab countries like Saudi Arabia, which is short of gas to fire its power plants, and Abu Dhabi, which is already building nuclear stations, could also become major markets.   Mr. Lawson, of the Royal United Services Institute, said that if Chinese contractors eventually designed and built plants, he would expect the British government to take a similar approach to China's nuclear companies as it does in its treatment of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker.   The United States government has not allowed Huawei to supply equipment to the American telecommunications network because of security concerns, but the company has been accepted as a supplier to British networks. To guard against espionage, the British government has set up a center near Oxford, England, where security experts test Huawei's gear.    "
Gap in Views on Threat of ISIS' Digital Powers,"George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a speech last month that Islamic State militants were trying to develop the ability to carry out digital attacks on critical systems, like hospitals, air traffic controls and power plants. In the United States, Clifton Triplett, the new cybersecurity adviser hired by the Office of Personnel Management to help get the agency back on track after a series of hackings traced to China, said this month that he expected the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, might ultimately breach the agency's systems, too.     But private security researchers who track the Islamic State's online efforts say the group's capabilities are in fact not much better than those of tech-savvy teenagers who deface websites for thrills. That view illustrates a growing perception gap between officials' fears and what security experts consider a believable threat.   Indeed, two men considered the Islamic State's most sophisticated hackers have been sidelined. One is dead; the other, in jail.   ''To date, the attacks attributed or believed to be conducted by ISIS have been embarrassing, but not necessarily complex or sophisticated,'' said Christopher Ahlberg, the chief executive and co-founder of Recorded Future, a company based in Somerville, Mass., that analyzes online threats.   Mr. Ahlberg cautioned that the Islamic State is trying to recruit replacements for the hackers it lost. But, for now, its hacking capabilities appear rudimentary.   In April, an attack knocked a   French television station, TV5Monde, off the air for nearly an entire day. At first, the hacking was attributed to the Islamic State. But security experts later tied it to a Russian group engaged in what appeared to be an aggressive counterintelligence operation -- aimed at gleaning more information about ISIS.   Indeed, the online focus of Islamic State members and sympathizers has been recruitment, not computer attacks.   A search of password-protected, online ISIS forums by Recorded Future yields mild discussion of digital attacks elsewhere on the web, for instance, those launched by the activist hacker group known as the Lizard Squad. But little emerges on politically motivated hacking planning or substance.   Mr. Ahlberg said his company, which pulls intelligence from open and closed web forums, ISIS propaganda forums, social media and an array of other information tools, has yet to see any public pronouncement from the Islamic State that would indicate it has acquired hacking capabilities.   Hacking attacks are barely mentioned in Dabiq, the Islamic State's online magazine, and other instructional documents, according to an analysis by Recorded Future. The words ''cyber,'' ''cyber attack'' and ''hacking'' do not appear in any of the 740 recent ISIS propaganda and instructional materials that Mr. Ahlberg's company looked at. Nor do any ISIS materials focus on such attacks as a core ambition.   Of the two Islamic State sympathizers believed to have the most sophisticated hacking skills, one, Ardit Ferizi, a 20-year-old citizen of Kosovo, has been imprisoned in Malaysia. He is awaiting extradition to the United States where he faces up to 35 years in prison, according to a Justice Department indictment.    The other, Junaid Hussain, a 21-year-old British-born Pakistani who is credited with breaking into the United States Central Command's Twitter and YouTube accounts in January, was killed in a drone strike in Syria in August.    Still, officials worry that even with their ranks of talented hackers depleted, the Islamic State could one day recruit more sophisticated hackers. The group has already shown itself to be adept at using social media to draw in new members, said Rita Katz, the executive director and co-founder of the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors ISIS's online activity.   Online discussions among ISIS members used to take place almost exclusively in password-protected forums, Ms. Katz said. But Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr offer a far bigger audience, as well as a means of communicating with other fighters and prospective recruits.   It was on Twitter that Mr. Hussain and Mr. Ferizi, both well-known hackers, re-emerged as ISIS fighters. On Twitter, Mr. Hussain publicly instigated online attacks, posted information on American military forces and officers, and cheered on other fighters in the group, according to Ms. Katz.   ''Junaid Hussain and Ardit Ferizi are exactly the type of people ISIS is trying to recruit,'' Mr. Ahlberg said.   Both were young, alienated from society and proficient with computers. Mr. Hussain was born in Birmingham, England, and began hacking as a teenager with a pro-Palestinian group called Team Poison, which has hit a range of targets, including Mark Zuckerberg's personal Facebook page and NATO's website.   After a six-month stint in a British prison for hacking into the address book of Tony Blair, Mr. Hussain resurfaced with a new identity: In his new Twitter photo, a scarf masks the lower half of his face, he is pointing a weapon at the viewer, and he had acquired a nom de guerre: Abu Hussain al-Britani.   Mr. Ferizi was born in Kosovo one year after Mr. Hussain and started hacking as a teenager for a group called Kosova Hacker's Security.    Last summer, while studying in Malaysia he began passing information stolen in a K.H.S. breach to Mr. Hussain, including the personal data of more than 1,000 American service members and federal employees, according to his indictment.   The two linked up on Twitter. And that, Ms. Katz said, is where she believes the government battle against the Islamic State is falling short.   A study by the Brookings Institution published in March estimated that in the last quarter of 2014, ISIS supporters used at least 46,000 Twitter accounts, each with an average of about 1,000 followers. Whenever Twitter suspended one account, others popped up almost instantaneously.   ''Twitter is going to continue to be the main problem we face right now because it takes no time for ISIS to find lone wolves to pull off its plots and attacks,'' Ms. Katz said.    "
Security Researchers Start Effort to Protect 'Smart' Cities,"It's a brave new world when hackers step in to protect citizens because regulators are not getting the job done. Two years after President Obama signed an executive order setting voluntary guidelines that companies could follow to prevent cyberattacks - especially on critical infrastructure like dams and water treatment facilities - security experts have found that American critical infrastructure is still wide open to attack.  The order was a weakened alternative to cybersecurity legislation that the White House tried and failed to push through Congress after Senate Republicans argued the minimum standards would be too onerous on the private sector. Last year, Cesar Cerrudo, an Argentine security researcher, began pointing out critical vulnerabilities in America's so-called smart cities, where wireless sensors control a growing portion of city infrastructure from traffic lights to water and waste management systems. One year later, Mr. Cerrudo discovered that little had been done to patch those basic vulnerabilities, even as cities around the world poured billions of dollars into bringing more of their basic infrastructure online. Without renewed focus on security, he and other researchers warn, those cities are just creating larger and larger targets for nation states and cyberterrorists. ""What I found is that there are a lot of security problems - the situation is really bad - but I didn't want to just point out problems without offering solutions,"" Mr. Cerrudo said. In response, on Tuesday, he and others from IOActive Labs; Kaspersky Lab, the Russian cybersecurity company; and a growing list of security experts will announce a new Securing Smart Cities initiative. Their goal is to bring private security researchers and public administrators together to set up basic cybersecurity checklists for smart cities, including properly installed encryption, passwords and systems that can be easily patched for security holes. They are also seeking to set up better security requirements and approval procedures for the vendors who install, monitor and oversee crucial systems. They want to track access to smart city systems; run regular tests to look for loopholes; and set up emergency response teams that can funnel reports of vulnerabilities from security researchers, coordinate patches and share that information with other cities. They also want to create manual overrides for all smart city systems, in the event they are compromised. Surprisingly, as it stands, there is no such comprehensive system for vetting security and responding to cyberattacks at the city level. This, even as spending on smart city technology balloons. In Saudi Arabia, $70 million has been poured into a project to build four smart cities. In South Africa, $7.4 billion has been funneled into a smart city project now underway. By 2020, the market for smart cities is expected to reach $1 trillion, according to Frost & Sullivan, a consulting firm. ""Every day cities are incorporating new technologies really fast without any testing and they are putting citizens and businesses at risk,"" Mr. Cerrudo said in an interview. ""Every day we depend more and more on technology. If that technology is not secure and protected, it will get attacked, and people and businesses will suffer the consequences."" "
"Caroline Kennedy Used Personal Email for State Department Business, Report Finds","Caroline Kennedy, the United States ambassador to Japan, and several other senior American diplomats there have used personal email accounts to conduct State Department business, the inspector general for the department said in a report released Tuesday.  The inspector general, Steve A. Linick, identified instances in which ''sensitive but unclassified'' information was sent and received on personal email accounts, the report said.    The criticism of Ms. Kennedy and the other diplomats came as Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has faced questions about her exclusive use of a personal email account when she was secretary of state. That account was run through a private server that Mrs. Clinton kept at her New York home.   The report on the embassy in Japan said the inspector general's office ''has previously reported on the risks associated with using commercial email for official government business.'' It added that ''such risks include data loss, hacking, phishing and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information.''   The State Department's policy, the report said, ''is that employees generally should not use private email accounts (for example, Gmail, AOL, Yahoo and so forth) for official business.'' It added that ''employees are also expected to use approved, secure methods to transmit sensitive but unclassified information when available and practical.''   On her personal account, Mrs. Clinton had messages with ''sensitive but unclassified'' information, according to the inspector general for the intelligence agencies. She also received emails with information that the inspector general said should have been marked as ''top secret.'' The F.B.I. is investigating how classified information was handled in connection with her account.   Mrs. Clinton and her campaign aides have defended her use of the personal account, saying that it was permitted at the time under State Department rules and that there were no classified markings on the materials.   The Japan report was also critical of other aspects of the embassy and of its management by Ms. Kennedy, who was appointed to her post in 2013. It said that the State Department had not addressed some security vulnerabilities at the embassy and that communication between senior embassy leaders and the rank and file needed to be improved.   ''Embassy staff members lack the guidance they need to make day-to-day decisions on optimal allocation of limited U.S. government resources,'' the report said.   The State Department's spokesman, John Kirby, defended Ms. Kennedy during a news briefing on Tuesday in Washington. He said there was no indication that her email practices had violated department policy, which, he added, discourages the use of personal email accounts but says they can be used infrequently.   ''She did only use it infrequently,'' he said.   Mr. Kirby said the department was carrying out all the recommendations in the report.    "
"In Push for Change, Finra Is Opposed by the Wall St. Firms It Regulates","Wall Street has pulled out all the stops in opposing a plan by its own self-regulator to require brokers to share extensive information about their clients' accounts. The proposal by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, is ""a troubling and serious threat to investors' civil liberties and constitutional rights,"" Carrie L. Chelko, chief counsel of the Philadelphia financial firm Lincoln Financial Network, wrote in one of hundreds of letters to the agency criticizing the plan. Finra argues that regular, monthly reports from brokers detailing purchases, sales, margin calls and risk profiles will give it a chance to stop abusive practices before further harm is done. Finra is in the process of considering the feedback on its plan, called the Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System, or Cards, and making changes in advance of seeking approval from its board of governors and forwarding a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Finra's chief executive, Richard G. Ketchum, said in a telephone interview.  Finra has often been dismissed as an apologist for the Wall Street firms that finance it, but it has made some efforts since the financial crisis to play a tougher role. It fought the discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Company in 2012 after the firm tried to force customers to waive their rights to bring class-action lawsuits, winning its case last April. It also strengthened its standards for brokers who are making investment recommendations, advising them that a product must be consistent with a customer's best interest. Several powerful investor advocacy groups, including AARP and the Consumer Federation of America, have applauded Finra's plan, noting that it would allow agency regulators to match the 21st-century data capabilities of the Wall Street firms it regulates. But the brokerage firms that pay Finra to be their regulator say that keeping so much investor information in one place is a paradigm of regulatory overreach and an invasion of customers' privacy. ""Not a week goes by without some data breach being reported in the press,"" Ira D. Hammerman, general counsel of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group known as Sifma, said in an email response to questions about Finra's plan. ""And if Cards is built, the question is when, not if, there will be a data breach."" In December, the American Civil Liberties Union wrote to Finra to express its ""very serious security and privacy concerns"" about Cards. Mr. Hammerman and other critics have said that Finra's plan would invade investors' privacy, put personal information at risk, take supervisory authority away from brokerage firms and put small brokers out of business. After Sony disclosed in December that its email had been hacked, Mr. Hammerman even took the opportunity during a media interview to liken Sony's predicament to the risks that Cards would pose. Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said Wall Street was ""using every tool in their toolbox."" She added, ""Their reaction is so over the top that the only thing I can see is that they just don't want their regulator to be able to keep an eye on them."" Given Finra's reputation among some critics, Ms. Roper said, the aggressive Cards proposal has taken some Wall Streeters by surprise. ""The industry sees this as evidence of Finra becoming less of a lap dog,"" she said. Mr. Ketchum said that the proposal would make it possible for Finra to spot patterns that suggest bad behavior by a brokerage firm, a branch office or an individual broker. Dishonest brokers do not usually take advantage of only one client, Mr. Ketchum said. Instead, ""they fall in love with a product or they fall in love with a strategy and they put tons of people in it."" Thus, a comprehensive database that displays all of the activity at a firm or branch can help Finra zero in on abuse, he said. Ms. Roper said the program would let Finra jump on problems more quickly. ""It creates a real deterrent,"" she said. "" Who's going to churn an account if it immediately sends off a warning siren at Finra?"" In objecting to Cards, the securities industry has been most vocal about the potential for a vast repository of investor information to be hacked. After perusing the data security objections raised in a first round of comment letters in early 2014, Finra revised its proposal and said that customers' names, addresses and tax identification numbers would not be included. That still leaves open the danger of someone uncovering an investor's identity through reverse engineering after penetrating the Cards database, according to a white paper by IBM that was commissioned by Sifma. Mr. Ketchum said that Sifma had ""raised some fair points"" about the risks of reverse engineering and that Finra was closely examining the issue. After reviewing the sections pertaining to security in Finra's most recent proposal and the objections related to security in Sifma's most recent comment letter, Fred H. Cate, a senior fellow at the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University in Bloomington, said that Sifma had raised some valid concerns about data security. ""But it felt to me like an industry that doesn't want to comply with the rules, sort of dragging out every argument it could think of, as opposed to focusing on what practical steps could be included to be sure information is secure,"" he said. Ms. Roper said that some of the industry's arguments were disingenuous. Brokerage firms regularly rely on Big Data in their own businesses, even making account access easily available on mobile devices, she said. ""They don't say, 'Stop, don't do it,' when it's a matter of their profits,"" she said. ""But they seem to think Big Data represents some unacceptable risk if the purpose is to enhance investor protection."" Indeed, Lincoln Financial, which wrote a comment letter to Finra opposing Cards and citing its customers' constitutional rights, was fined by Finra in 2011 for failing to protect its customers' confidential information. Finra said that for a seven-year period at the brokerage firm Lincoln Financial Services, ""certain current and former employees were able to access customer account records through any Internet browser using shared login credentials."" A spokesman for Lincoln, Michael Arcaro, said in an email statement, ""We have long since remedied those failures."" Some of the parties who weighed in on the Cards plan argued that it did not go far enough. Finra initially proposed that firms include data about variable annuities, private placements, nontraded real estate investment trusts and other illiquid investments, but backed off after complaints about the costs to its members of supplying that information. In a letter to Finra on Dec. 1, Ms. Roper said the list of excluded investments ""includes some of the very investment products most commonly associated with fraudulent and abusive sales practices."" If Cards should exclude those investments, she wrote, unscrupulous brokers ""are likely to tailor their conduct accordingly."" Some of Finra's critics noted in their comment letters that Finra was not properly using the tools it already had. One writer cited a Wall Street Journal investigation in which reporters used data that was available to Finra to map the regions in the United States where rogue brokers were congregating - something Finra had not addressed. Mr. Ketchum conceded that he had learned lessons from the investigation. ""I wish we'd done better,"" he said. ""But I do know one thing, which is that we do better when we have more information than when we have less."" If Finra cannot get to the point where it can take advantage of the same Big Data methodology its brokerage firm members and other businesses do, he said, ""we will have really failed investors in a serious way.""

"The Ashley Madison Data Dump, Explained","The release of stolen data from Ashley Madison, a dating website marketed at would-be adulterers, promises to roil the marital lives of its members. It has also underscored the troubling limitations of Internet privacy.    On Tuesday, hackers appeared to make good on a threat to release what they said was 9.7 gigabytes of account and credit card information from 37 million users of the site.   What information was released?    The data includes members' names, user names, addresses, phone numbers and birth dates as well as details of credit card transactions. Member passwords are encrypted, but specific users could be easily targeted for decryption, according to Quartz.   Profiles filled out by users could also contain embarrassing information about their sexual preferences.   The breach also included users of Established Men, a separate site aimed at women looking to date rich men. Both sites are owned by Avid Life Media.   Is the information verified?   Cybersecurity experts are indicating that the data appears to be genuine, but that doesn't mean all of the information is reliable.   Brian Krebs, a security researcher, said in a blog post that he spoke with three people who found their information and the last four digits of their credit card numbers in the database, suggesting they were indeed stolen from the company.   ''I'm sure there are millions of AshleyMadison users who wish it weren't so, but there is every indication this dump is the real deal,'' Mr. Krebs wrote.   Even if the information was taken from Ashley Madison, it's likely some of it was falsified. The site doesn't verify the information it gathers. A reporter at The Intercept -- an unmarried woman in New York City -- said a man in South Africa had used her email address to create an account.   Who released the information, and why?    A group of hackers calling themselves Impact Team posted a small portion of the data in July, and they threatened to release the rest unless the site was shut down.   The hackers said they were upset about Ashley Madison's policy for deleting user data when requested. The company has long offered members the ability to scrub their profiles and information from the site for $19, a feature that BuzzFeed News said generated nearly $2 million in 2014. But, as the breach showed, the data remained.   ''We have explained the fraud, deceit, and stupidity of A.L.M. and their members,'' Impact Team wrote, referring to Avid Life Media. ''Now everyone gets to see their data.''   How could I check who had an account?   A reminder: The information found in the data has not been verified.   But two different search tools have surfaced that claim to show whether an email address was used.   More than 15,000 email addresses in the breach were hosted on United States government and military servers, The Hill reported.   How has Avid Life Media responded?   The company is cooperating with law enforcement agencies in Canada and the United States to find the hackers. With a business that relies on the trust of its members now in turmoil, Ashley Madison has sharply denounced the hackers' talk of principles.   ''This event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality,'' it said in a statement. ''It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any freethinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities. The criminal, or criminals, involved in this act have appointed themselves as the moral judge, juror, and executioner, seeing fit to impose a personal notion of virtue on all of society.''   After the initial breach, the company said it had adjusted its policy for deleting user data and was taking steps to delete the stolen data.    "
New York Regulator Seeks Proposals to Improve Cybersecurity,"New York's financial industry regulator is seeking suggestions from other regulators on proposed regulations to shore up digital security defenses in the industry. In a memo to various national and state regulators on Tuesday, including the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Anthony Albanese, New York's acting superintendent of financial services, said that despite efforts to bolster security in recent years, ''Companies will continue to be challenged by the speed of technological change and the increasingly sophisticated nature of threats.''     The proposals would require companies to have written policies on security procedures, especially the protection of customer data held by third-party service providers, as well as multifactor authentication and data encryption.   Third-party vendors are considered a weak link in the security chain. ''A company may have the most sophisticated cybersecurity protections in the industry, but if its third-party service providers have weak systems or controls, those protections will be ineffective,'' Mr. Albanese said in the memo.   He wants input from fellow regulators to fine-tune proposals that could cover a broad portion of the financial industry.   ''There is a demonstrated need for robust regulatory action in the cybersecurity space,'' he said.   In addition, companies -- the Department of Financial Services in New York covers small and large banks and insurance companies -- would be required to name a chief information security officer who would be responsible for the cybersecurity program, and do annual testing and vulnerability assessments.   The proposals also would require companies to notify the regulator of any incidents that have a ''reasonable likelihood'' of materially affecting normal operations.    "
"Hacking for Security, and Getting Paid for It","SAN FRANCISCO - It should come as no surprise that the Internet is riddled with holes. For as long as people have been writing code, they have been making mistakes. And just about as long as they have been making mistakes, criminals, governments, so-called hacktivists and people who wreck things for kicks have been taking advantage. But if 2014 was the year that hackings of everything from federal government computer networks to the computers of Sony Pictures became routine news, 2015 may be the year that companies tried to do something about it. Though not without some rough nudging. Technology companies including Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Microsoft, Yahoo, PayPal and even the electric-car maker Tesla now offer hackers bounties for reporting the flaws they find in the companies' wares.  It is a significant shift from the tech industry's standard way of responding - or not responding - to hackers who find vulnerabilities. Twenty years ago, reporting a bug to a big company might fetch a well-intentioned programmer a T-shirt, credit on a website or a small bounty. But more often than not, such people were ignored or even threatened with criminal prosecution. It should not be that shocking, then, that a healthy black market for so-called zero day bugs - flaws that have yet to be discovered or patched and can be easily exploited without setting off an alarm - has emerged over the years. Online criminals and governments have been paying for word of such flaws and stockpiling them for future hackings, according to foreign policy experts who have been tracking claims by government officials who have publicly disclosed their online weaponry or whose online attack programs have been leaked. An additional 40 countries are also buying so-called spyware tools from a growing list of companies in the United States and Europe that sell to governments. ""As the global water level of threats naturally increases, what you see are these lower-tier groups, criminal actors and hacktivists begin to acquire capabilities that used to only be available to nation-states,"" said Michael V. Hayden, former director of the National Security Agency. ""Even the less capable actors can now develop and/or acquire tools and weapons that we thought in the past were so high-end that only a few nation-states could acquire and use them."" ""This,"" Mr. Hayden added, ""is an absolutely predictable development."" There is little question that new thinking is needed around the seemingly insurmountable problem of online security. In 60 percent of 2,122 data breaches last year analyzed by Verizon, attackers were able to compromise their victims' data within minutes. And even when vulnerabilities were discovered and a patch was devised, companies weren't applying the patch. Verizon found that 99.9 percent of known vulnerabilities remained in place more than a year after the vendor provided a patch. Now Facebook and Microsoft sponsor an Internet Bug Bounty program, run by volunteers from the security sector, that pays hackers to report bugs. After one particularly serious, overlooked bug - named Heartbleed - was discovered last year in a security protocol that is used in millions of Internet-connected devices, the nonprofit Linux Foundation and more than a dozen major tech companies started an initiative to pay for security audits in widely used open-source software. By far, the most aggressive effort to batten down the Internet has been that of Google, which in addition to paying hackers to report bugs, tapped its top security analysts last year to join a new effort called Project Zero. The program has enlisted an elite group of hackers to work on uncovering holes not just in Google's systems, but across the web as well. Project Zero recently discovered serious holes in Adobe Flash; TrueCrypt, the encryption software once used by the N.S.A. whistle-blower Edward J. Snowden; Avast, the popular antivirus software; and multiple flaws in security software sold by Kaspersky Lab. This, all in the span of just two weeks in September. Project Zero's goal is to make those stockpiles of zero day bugs useless. ""You should be able to use the web without fear that a criminal or state-sponsored actor is exploiting software bugs to infect your computer, steal secrets or monitor your communications,"" Chris Evans, then Project Zero's lead and now chief of security at Tesla, wrote in a blog post. ""Yet in sophisticated attacks, we see the use of 'zero day' vulnerabilities to target, for example, human rights activists or conduct industrial espionage. This needs to stop."" It's nearly impossible to know if Project Zero is making a dent in countries' attack tools. In the United States and other countries, vulnerability exploitation programs are often classified, making data hard to come by. So far, Google's team of 10 full-time hackers has fixed more than 400 critical flaws in widely used programs, many of which would have been easy to exploit for espionage or destruction. But their efforts are not without controversy, particularly with competitors whose software is being audited by Google's hackers. At Apple, which still does not pay hackers bounties for turning over bugs, Project Zero has discovered more than 60 bugs in crucial Apple applications, like the Safari browser and mobile developer kits. And last year, after Google detected and disclosed security flaws in Windows, Microsoft did not exactly write a thank-you note. Microsoft's security executives criticized Google's researchers for not giving them more time to fix the flaws before disclosing them to the wider web. ""We don't believe it would be right to have our security researchers find vulnerabilities in competitors' products, apply pressure that a fix should take place in a certain time frame, and then publicly disclose information that could be used to exploit the vulnerability and attack customers before a fix is created,"" Chris Betz, a senior director of the Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Group, wrote in a blog post. Google has a 90-day rule for disclosing bugs that vendors have not patched, but after the Microsoft controversy, it added a 14-day extension for companies that say they are working on a patch. But not all bug bounty programs are being run by the tech industry's giants. Newer start-ups like HackerOne and BugCrowd team up with companies in industries like tech and energy to solicit hackers to test their applications for vulnerabilities and, in many cases, pay them for their finds. Both services help companies, like Twitter, Yahoo and Snapchat, set up bounty programs, and then recruit hackers to test their clients' products and applications. In cases where companies are willing to offer a financial reward, HackerOne and BugCrowd manage the payment process.   Like HackerOne and BugCrowd, other start-ups like Synack and Bug Bounty HQ hire teams of hackers to do private vulnerability-finding missions. The idea is simple: Companies will never find all the vulnerabilities on their own and would rather invest in researchers to find the flaws now than suffer the consequences when criminals find them later. For all the holes discovered in Microsoft's code, the security industry still largely sees Microsoft - criticized for years for the holes in its software - as a security success story. Many in the industry point to a 2002 memo from Bill Gates  as a turning point. In his memo, Mr. Gates said that for Microsoft to succeed, it would have to make security, privacy and resiliency its top priorities. His memo was prescient: ""Computing is already an important part of many people's lives,"" Mr. Gates wrote. ""Within 10 years, it will be an integral and indispensable part of almost everything we do. Microsoft and the computer industry will only succeed in that world if C.I.O.s, consumers and everyone else sees that Microsoft has created a platform for Trustworthy Computing."" Initially mocked by those in the security industry as a publicity stunt, the memo compelled Microsoft's developers to start incorporating more secure coding techniques. And the company's once sour relationship with the security research community began to improve. The company now routinely works, for example, with law enforcement to disrupt criminal botnet networks, which are networks of computers that have been infected by online criminals.  And while there have been setbacks and plenty of holes are still being discovered in Microsoft code, fears about the security of Microsoft's applications have slowly subsided. Adobe and the Java programming platform have become more frequent targets for hackers. ""There is a lot to be learned from that,"" said Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation. ""The problem is that Bill Gates can't write a memo to the whole world. What we need is a new culture of norms."" Security experts say bug bounty programs are useful but inherently reactive. They say the only way to get ahead in the cat-and-mouse game with hackers is to encourage developers to incorporate secure coding practices into the design. ""That is the real struggle,"" Mr. Zemlin said. ""Bug bounties are great at fixing potholes where they are today. But long term, we need to make a better investment in the overall health of the Internet."" Mr. Zemlin and others point to new training programs organized by the Linux Foundation and others that encourage developers to bone up on their secure coding skills, to eliminate the potential for bugs in code in the first place. ""There's no quick fix, but if you have bug bounty programs, do threat modeling and train developers how to write secure code, you're going to have a healthier Internet,"" Mr. Zemlin said. ""Nation-states will always have offensive tools, but if you raise the bar on coding, at least those tools won't get into the hands of as many rogue actors as quickly as they are today."" The effort to stamp out bugs is not the only thing security experts are trying as a way to improve the security of computer networks and the broader Internet. The United States government and technology companies are pushing websites to strengthen their security by using HTTPS encryption that protects information as it moves across the Internet. HTTPS creates a private connection between a web browser and a website so would-be snoopers can't peek at what a person is doing. A small lock appearing in the address bar of a browser is usually a good indication that a site is using it. Banks have deployed HTTPS for years, but more recently it has been adopted by e-commerce and technology sites like  Google, Facebook and Yahoo. The Obama administration ordered all websites run by the executive branch of the federal government to adopt HTTPS by the end of 2016. Here too, Google is lending its muscle to the effort. Last year, the search giant began raising the search rankings of websites that use HTTPS and lowering the rankings of those that do not. In the European Union, countries are considering ways to couple that sort of aggressiveness with legal clout. Under current proposals, any company that collects and manages data about the region's 500 million or so citizens must report a data breach within 72 hours and notify customers as soon as possible. If companies fail to do that, regulators could fine them up to 2 percent of their global revenue, or a maximum of $1.1 million. The rules are still being negotiated and could apply by 2018. Are those rules an overreaction? Not if you consider the potential for security flaws in technologies that are just starting to be adopted, like Internet-connected home heating systems and cars. This year, a pair of hackers found a way to remotely hack a car's computer system, forcing a major repair effort at Fiat Chrysler. The two hackers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, found a way to exploit a relatively new Internet-connected feature in Fiat Chrysler vehicles to turn the windshield wipers on and off, adjust the radio volume and speed up and slow down the car, all from a remote computer.  The automobile attacks were just the beginning, security experts say, of a new wave of attacks on the so-called Internet of Things. Critical infrastructure - water systems, power lines, pipelines and stock exchanges - is going online, in part so that engineers can monitor, diagnose and fix problems remotely, without sending someone to attend to problems on-site. But with that convenience comes the risk of hacking.  General Electric, for example, acquired a security company called Wurldtech last year to help it protect industrial sites like refineries and power plants from attacks. That is the reality of today's online security. Companies are indeed treating security with more seriousness. But technology is an endless series of advances, and with those come mistakes. And there is nothing better for a hacker than a mistake. "
Is Your Data Safe at Healthcare.gov?,"If you're concerned about online privacy, you've likely read a lot about what happens to the information you enter into sites like Facebook or Google. But now another website is generating privacy worries: Healthcare.gov. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Jack Gillum of The Associated Press report that the health insurance site has been sharing user data - possibly including characteristics like users' age and income, as well as whether they're pregnant - with companies like Google, Twitter and Facebook. They write that ""there is no evidence that personal information has been misused,"" and that the administration says it has prohibited companies ""from using the data to further their own business interests."" Still, they note, many find the practice troubling.  ""Sending such personal information raises significant privacy concerns,"" writes Cooper Quintin at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A company that receives the information, he adds, ""could match up the personal data provided by Healthcare.gov with an already extensive trove of information about what you read online and what your buying preferences are to create an extremely detailed profile of exactly who you are and what your interests are"" - it could then ""start showing you smoking ads or infer your risk of cancer based on where you live, how old you are and your status as a smoker."" Moreover, he writes, a company could connect Healthcare.gov data with users' real identities: ""Google, thanks to real name policies, certainly has information uniquely identifying someone using Google services. If a real identity is linked to the information received from Healthcare.gov it would be a massive violation of privacy for users of the site."" ""I think people should be concerned, because there's a lot of sensitive data flowing back and forth"" on Healthcare.gov, said Frank Pasquale, a law professor and the author of ""The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information."" Even if the data provided to private companies is anonymized, he added, we shouldn't necessarily be reassured: ""There's a big literature out there on broken promises of anonymization, of efforts where users were assured that the information was anonymized, but it wasn't really anonymized well."" One area of privacy concern right now is ""the spillage of data from one context into others,"" and he fears that once in the hands of private companies, the data might be used in ways consumers aren't aware of. ""There's high demand for health data out there,"" he said. Life insurance companies, for instance, ""want to use everything on you to calculate what your life insurance premium should be."" Woodrow N. Hartzog, a law professor who studies privacy, said that without knowing more about how private companies use the Healthcare.gov data, it's hard to tell how worried users of the site should be. ""Are third-party recipients of this information allowed to share with other people?"" he asked. ""Are they under an obligation to keep from trying to re-identify that information"" (that is, from trying to link data to people's real identities)? ""Without transparency,"" he said, ""it's really difficult to know actually how concerned we should be about this."" Not all data collection raises privacy issues, he added: If we know that, for instance, 30 percent of residents of your city have a certain health condition, while it's true that ""that pool contains information about you, we don't have a lot of privacy concerns."" And such information can be useful: ""We might trust research institutions to take that data and glean insights from it,"" perhaps about factors that might put people at risk of health problems. But as the likelihood of users actually being identified based on their data rises, he said, ""the question then becomes, at what point do you ask for consent."" Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in an email that ""unlike many retail sites similar to HealthCare.gov, we do not and will not sell a visitor's information. We will remain vigilant and will continue to focus on what more we can do to keep consumers' personal information secure."" ""Private sector tools,"" he added, ""play a critical role in the operation of a consumer focused website. Without these tools, HealthCare.gov would be unable to effectively respond to system errors, issues that result in a poor or slow web experience, or provide metrics to the public on site visits and/or mobile usage. In addition, consumers would have to continuously resubmit information throughout the process making signing up for insurance more difficult."" And, he noted, ""the use of these private sector tools is extremely common."" Dr. Hartzog, too, noted that ""what the government is engaging in here, if indeed they're sharing anonymized data according to certain kinds of industry standards,"" is in fact ""common practice for lots of different websites, if not most websites."" But consumers may see government websites differently from others: ""Anytime you've got the government involved, you have higher expectations of transparency simply because of the people's right to demand transparency and accountability from their government."" Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information systems and public policy who studies privacy, made a similar distinction in an email: ""Consumers have come to expect and anticipate that privately owned entities will collect, share and trade their data. They may not have similar expectations with regard to a government site dealing with such sensitive data."" And, he said, ""if my expectations about what a website does with my data differ from the actual data policies of that site, that's a privacy problem - because I may be making decisions based on incomplete or incorrect knowledge of what will happen to my data."" And Dr. Pasquale argued that the revelations about Healthcare.gov were especially disturbing because of the Affordable Care Act's mandate that most Americans carry health insurance. ""What we now have is government effectively rolling into its mandate that you buy insurance that you also have this pervasive data tracking by what I consider to be very unreliable entities, pursuant to terms that we don't know,"" he said. Data-sharing by Healthcare.gov may present unique issues, but for Dr. Hartzog, it's also part of a broader problem: ""Consumers should be concerned not just because it's happening at Healthcare.gov but because it's happening everywhere."" And to protect ordinary users, simply asking for our consent may not be enough. ""Consumers have very limited ability to protect themselves, and they also have very limited ability to even understand the risk of personal disclosure online, and all the different ways that one individual disclosure can be used against you or come back to haunt you when it's collected, aggregated, shared with others,"" said Dr. Hartzog. ""It's incumbent upon policy makers to establish good privacy policy to protect consumers so that we don't overburden them."" Such a policy would ""make sure that companies protected the personal info they were entrusted with,"" and ""that they respect the trust that they were given by limiting who they share the information with and how long they keep information."" It would also require that they ""try to protect information as it moves downstream,"" by holding anyone they share it with to the same restrictions they abide by. Ultimately, he said, we need a system under which ""consumers can be confident that the trust they place in companies and governments when they disclose information will be respected."" "
New Tension on Tech Rules From China,"HONG KONG -- The Chinese government has adopted new regulations requiring companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over secret source code, submit to invasive audits and build so-called back doors into hardware and software, according to a copy of the rules obtained by foreign technology companies that do billions of dollars' worth of business in China. The new rules, laid out in a 22-page document approved at the end of last year, are the first in a series of policies expected to be unveiled in the coming months that Beijing says are intended to strengthen cybersecurity in critical Chinese industries. As copies have spread in the past month, the regulations have heightened concern among foreign companies that the authorities are trying to force them out of one of the largest and fastest-growing markets.    In a letter sent Wednesday to a top-level Communist Party committee on cybersecurity, led by President Xi Jinping, foreign business groups objected to the new policies and complained that they amounted to protectionism.    The groups, which include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called for ''urgent discussion and dialogue'' about what they said was a ''growing trend'' toward policies that cite cybersecurity in requiring companies to use only technology products and services that are developed and controlled by Chinese companies.   The letter is the latest salvo in an intensifying tit-for-tat between China and the United States over online security and technology policy. While the United States has accused Chinese military personnel of hacking and stealing from American companies, China has pointed to recent disclosures of United States snooping in foreign countries as a reason to get rid of American technology as quickly as possible.   Although it is unclear to what extent the new rules result from security concerns, and to what extent they are cover for building up the Chinese tech industry, the Chinese regulations go far beyond measures taken by most other countries, lending some credibility to industry claims that they are protectionist. Beijing also has long used the Internet to keep tabs on its citizens and ensure the Communist Party's hold on power.   Chinese companies must also follow the new regulations, though they will find it easier since for most, their core customers are in China.   China's Internet filters have increasingly created a world with two Internets, a Chinese one and a global one. The new policies could further split the tech world, forcing hardware and software makers to sell either to China or the United States, or to create significantly different products for the two countries.   While the Obama administration will almost certainly complain that the new rules are protectionist in nature, the Chinese will be able to make a case that they differ only in degree from Washington's own requirements.   The United States has made it virtually impossible for Huawei, a major Chinese maker of computer servers and cellphones, to sell its products in the United States, arguing that its equipment could have ''back doors'' for the Chinese government.   The documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, revealed a major effort by the agency to enter Huawei's systems, both to figure out who controls the company and to create back doors that the United States could exploit.   Recent calls by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James B. Comey, to assure that the United States has a key to decrypt information stored on iPhones and other devices will doubtless be used by the Chinese to argue that all governments need access to sensitive computer systems.   For multinationals, the Chinese market is simply too big to ignore. China is expected to spend $465 billion in 2015 on information and communications technology, according to the research firm IDC, which says the expansion of China's tech market will account for 43 percent of worldwide tech sector growth.   Analysts said new Chinese policies like the bank rules and an antiterrorism law that is still in draft form would make doing business increasingly difficult in China for foreign hardware and software companies.   ''I think they're obviously targeting foreign vendors that are operating in China,'' said Matthew Cheung, a researcher at the analytics firm Gartner. ''They are promoting the local technologies so that local providers who have the capabilities to provide systems to these enterprises can get more market share.''   For instance, the bank rules say 75 percent of technology products used by Chinese institutions must be classified as ''secure and controllable'' by 2019.   Though analysts say ''secure and controllable'' -- a phrase that peppers several new Chinese technology policies -- may be open to interpretation, a chart attached to the banking regulations shows the troubles foreign companies could have in winning that classification for their products.   For most computing and networking equipment, the chart says, source code must be turned over to Chinese officials. But many foreign companies would be unwilling to disclose code because of concerns about intellectual property, security and, in some cases, United States export law.   The chart also calls for companies that want to sell to banks to set up research and development centers in China, obtain permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build ''ports'' to allow Chinese officials to manage and monitor data processed by their hardware.   The draft antiterrorism law pushes even further, calling for companies to store all data related to Chinese users on servers in China, create methods for monitoring content for terror threats and provide keys to encryption to public security authorities.   ''Banking is the first industry where we are aware a black-and-white regulatory document was issued,'' said Jeffrey Yao, a vice president for enterprise research at IDC. ''In some other industries, if you talk to the customers, many of them get the pressure to adopt the local brands, but in most of the cases they are via internal communications from the top officers.''   Some of America's largest tech companies could be hurt by the rules, including Apple, which is making a big push into the country. Apple has used new encryption methods in the iPhone 6 that are based on a complicated mathematical algorithm tied to a code unique to each phone. Apple says it has no access to the codes, but under the proposed antiterrorism law, it would be required to provide a key so that the Chinese government could decrypt data stored on iPhones.   A growing number of American technology executives have complained about new barriers to access to the Chinese market. John T. Chambers, the chief executive of the network equipment maker Cisco Systems, has raised the issue, as have executives at the chip maker Qualcomm. This week, Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, said his company was working through ''geopolitical issues'' regarding China.   In the letter, the Western companies voiced concerns about a broader ''cybersecurity review regime'' under which the Chinese government would assess the ''security and controllability'' of hardware, software and technology services sold in China, through audits and other checks. More details about the checks will be sent in February to the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs, the committee led by the Chinese president, according to a recent report by Xinhua, the state-run news agency.   The committee, which was created after the disclosures by Mr. Snowden, is leading the charge in consolidating and streamlining online security efforts in China. Analysts said it had most likely presided over or given tacit support to the new policies.   The leadership committee is said to be also trying to wean the country from its reliance on foreign technology, a longstanding goal that has gained urgency after Mr. Snowden's revelations.   Zuo Xiaodong, vice president of the China Information Security Research Institute, said the new policies and the broader push for indigenous innovation were not intended to eliminate foreign companies from the market.   ''We're under the yoke of others. If the others stop services, what do we do?'' he said, noting that many Chinese companies and local governments had to scramble when Microsoft discontinued its support of Windows XP. ''From a security perspective, that simply wasn't acceptable. We're breaking away from these types of circumstances.""   Even if Beijing wants it to, the banking industry cannot immediately do away with all foreign hardware makers, Mr. Yao of IDC said. Banks purchase billions of dollars' worth of hardware and software to manage transactions, and Chinese companies cannot yet produce some of the higher-end servers and mainframes they rely on.   Mr. Yao said 90 percent of high-end servers and mainframes in China were still produced by multinationals. Still, Chinese companies are catching up at the lower end.   ''For all enterprise hardware, local brands represented 21.3 percent revenue share in 2010 in P.R.C. market and we expect in 2014 that number will reach 43.1 percent,'' he said, using the abbreviation for the People's Republic of China. ''That's a huge jump.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Trade Groups Urge U.S. to Push Against Chinese Regulations,"HONG KONG - United States trade groups gave the Chinese government an earful last week about new policies that could hamper the ability of major technology multinationals to do business in China. Now, the other shoe has dropped. In a letter addressed to key United States officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, 17 trade groups headlined by the United States Chamber of Commerce urged the government to push back against the Chinese policies, according to a copy of the letter viewed Thursday by The New York Times. The letter called for the United States government to take ""immediate action to work with Chinese officials to reverse an alarming number of troubling, new Chinese government policies impacting the information and communications technology (ICT) sector.""  The frustration felt by American companies shows how they find themselves in the middle of a deepening conflict between China and the United States over online security and technology policy. China cites disclosures from the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden as proof of a need to push back against United States technology. Meanwhile, the American government has accused Chinese military personnel of cyberattacks designed to aid domestic companies. The trade groups repeated their concerns in a separate letter sent last week to a top-level Chinese Communist Party committee on cybersecurity, and called for an end to Chinese regulations that encourage the use of domestic hardware and software in Chinese companies and government agencies. Arguing that the Chinese rules ""will have a significant negative impact on U.S. ICT companies' market opportunities in China,"" the letter also said that the policies ""raise serious questions regarding China's international trade commitments and its bilateral commitments to the United States."" It added that loss of revenue from being cut off from China would in the long term damage American companies' ability to spend on critical research and development and could ultimately bleed into other industries. Of particular concern to American companies are new rules that would force tech companies looking to sell into China's banking industry to submit products to invasive security tests, provide sensitive source code and use local Chinese encryption algorithms. Other potential new rules mandate the storage of data produced by Chinese companies within China and the disclosure of encryption keys to the Chinese government. Since the letter sent last week to Chinese officials, it has been unclear how the United States government will respond to obvious discontent from trade groups that represent its largest high-tech champions. One clue came at the bottom of the letter seen by The Times on Thursday. Noted as receiving copies were J. Michael Daniel, the cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security Council; Robert Holleyman, the deputy United States trade representative; and Alex Niejelow, the chief of staff to the United States intellectual property enforcement coordinator. The three officials co-wrote a piece published Wednesday on the news website Politico that branded the new Chinese regulations ""anticompetitive trade barriers."" Listing a series of points of contention between China and the United States on tech policy, the article urges China to reconsider the new rules and to cease cyberattacks. Going even further, it challenges the Chinese-endorsed model of online governance - known as Internet sovereignty - under which countries may censor, monitor and control the Internet within their borders. ""The United States will remain steadfast in our defense of Internet freedom and a multi-stakeholder-driven Internet governance model, as well as continue our support for norms of state behavior in cyberspace that facilitate international trade and commerce,"" the authors wrote. Though the article ultimately calls for cooperation between the United States and China, the numerous disagreements it brings up show how difficult it could be to reach an agreement. That raises the question of whether what is now a war of words could broaden into a war of the trade variety if the two sides cannot reach consensus over governance of the tech industry and the Internet more broadly.

"Jolted by Sony Hacking, Hollywood Is Embracing Digital Security","SAN FRANCISCO --  For years, Lulu Zezza has played one of the toughest roles in Hollywood. Ms. Zezza, who has managed physical production on movies like ''The Reader'' and ''Nine,'' also oversees the digital security of everything that goes into the making of a film on set, including budgets, casting, shooting schedules and scripts.    Not all that long ago, keeping tabs on Hollywood secrets was pretty simple. Executives like Ms. Zezza could confiscate a crew member's company-issued computer or cellphone once shooting ended.   But personal smartphones that receive company emails, and apps that store data on cloud computers? That is not so easy to manage if your co-workers aren't willing to play along.    Enter North Korea, stage left. After hackers believed to be from North Korea revealed embarrassing emails and other personal details at Sony Pictures late last year, Hollywood studios -- like so many businesses in other industries before them -- realized they had better find a better way to protect their most sensitive files.   And people like Ms. Zezza, who were once considered paranoid because they worried about mundane security measures like passwords and encryption, suddenly looked prescient.   ''Post-Sony, getting people to cooperate with me has been a completely different experience,'' Ms. Zezza said. ''Everyone gets that life has to change.''   Hollywood has turned to a new class of technology companies, with names like WatchDox, IntraLinks and Varonis, that for the last few years have been offering ways to manage the data slipping into employees' personal smartphones and Internet storage services. They wrap individual files with encryption, passwords and monitoring systems that can track who is doing what with sensitive files.    ''Hollywood is finally asking itself, 'What's our modern strategy for managing our information?' '' said Aaron Levie, chief executive at Box, an online file storage provider that works with several major Hollywood studios.   Venture capitalists have taken notice of the interest. In 2014, eight companies that help manage the security of documents raised $136 million in financing, more than five times the $25 million raised in 2013, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. They are aiming for a slice of the $665 million that American businesses spent on data-loss prevention last year. Gartner, the research company, expects that figure to surpass $1 billion by 2017.   Movie studios, of course, have always been a little paranoid.   The most sensitive Hollywood scripts were -- and, in many cases, still are -- etched with watermarks, or printed on colored and even mirrored paper to thwart photocopying.   Letter spacing and minor character names were switched from script to script to pinpoint leakers. Plot endings were left out entirely. The most-coveted scripts are still locked in briefcases and accompanied by bodyguards whose sole job is to ensure they don't end up in the wrong hands.   But over the last decade, such measures have begun to feel quaint. Watermarks can be lifted. Color copiers don't care what color a script is. Even scripts with bodyguards linger on a computer server somewhere.   And once crew members started using their personal smartphones on set, ''people started leaving with everything they had created for us,'' Ms. Zezza said. ''We had the movie in our possession, but none of the documents or drawings from the creative process.''   Years before the attack on Sony, Ms. Zezza had a memorable encounter with hackers after the studio she was working with announced a deal with Ubisoft, the video game maker, to adapt ''Assassin's Creed'' for the big screen. The production company was soon besieged by hacking attempts.   ''We were no longer worried about an assistant at an agency photocopying our script; we were dealing with sophisticated computer hackers who were extremely serious about finding out how we were turning their favorite game into a script,'' recalled Ms. Zezza.   It was a call to action. As Ms. Zezza searched for ways to protect sensitive data, she settled on WatchDox. The service gives file creators the ability to manage who can view, edit, share, scan and print a file, and for how long. If hackers steal the file off someone's computer, all they will see is a bunch of encrypted characters.   Her biggest challenge, however, wasn't hackers. It was co-workers. ''Nobody wanted to use it,'' Ms. Zezza said. ''The first year was unbelievably painful. I was teased mercilessly.''   That was, of course, before the hacking at Sony. Now some Hollywood studios are removing their movie editing software from the Internet so hackers cannot get to it, said Ray Rothrock, the chief executive of RedSeal, a security start-up.   For years, oil companies have been doing something similar with their pipelines -- a process known as ''air-gapping''-- so that if hackers breach their internal network, they can't use that access to blow up a pipeline. Now, Mr. Rothrock said, Hollywood is doing the same to combat theft.   At WatchDox, demand from Hollywood studios has surged over the last three months, said Adi Ruppin, the chief technology officer. The company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., has for some time been working with people like Oren Peli, the producer and screenwriter behind the ''Paranormal Activity'' film franchise.   ''Beyond a certain level, nothing is 100 percent foolproof, but now we know there are measures that make it 99 percent,'' Mr. Peli said. ''I'm a little paranoid, but it's justified.''   In 2009, a 43-page outline of Mr. Peli's coming film, ''Area 51,'' leaked online. Mr. Peli had relied on traditional techniques, like watermarking, or would even change words or names of minor characters in each version of a script to thwart leakers.   But when Mr. Peli started preparing for his next project, the ''Chernobyl Diaries,'' a 2012 horror film about tourists stranded at the site of the nuclear power plant disaster, he began searching for digital ways to protect the project. He started using WatchDox.   ''If I decide I actually don't want someone to read something, I can revoke their access later, or decide after the fact to allow them to print it,'' Mr. Peli said.   As a bonus, ''If I tell someone the script will expire in three days, they are more incentivized to read it.''   Some studios are demanding new features to suit their needs.   Mr. Levie said Box, which already stores vast amounts of data for businesses, has been investing in new tools that allow owners to control who can view their data and on what devices. It also manages who can edit material and even how long they can do it. Mr. Levie said the company would start adding invisible watermarking to files this spring.   One of the quirkier features WatchDox has added is a spotlight view that mimics holding a bright flashlight over a document in the dark. Everything beyond the moving circular spotlight is unreadable. The feature makes it difficult for anyone peering over your shoulder -- or a hacker pulling screen shots of your web browser -- to read the whole document.   Mr. Peli said the feature was a little too paranoid for his taste.   Mr. Ruppin said he recently received a complaint from a WatchDox customer with a decidedly different concern.    ''The customer thought the spotlight radius should be smaller,'' he said.    "
"At RSA Conference, Computer Security Done Right and Wrong","SAN FRANCISCO - The annual RSA security conference here is one of the largest gatherings of computer security professionals and companies in the world. It is also an opportunity for complaining and perhaps just a bit of navel gazing.  Where is the accountability? If 2013 was the ""Year of the Breach"" and 2014 was the ""Year of the Mega-Breach,"" 2015 may be the year that we run out of adjectives and start demanding real accountability from security vendors. ""The largest enterprises with the most sophisticated, 'next-generation' security tools were not able to stop miscreants from making off with millions of dollars, personal information, and sensitive secrets and damaging reputations,"" Amit Yoran, the president of RSA, said in his keynote speech Tuesday.  In the cyber security industry, accountability has been in short supply, but there are hints of change. Several months ago, WhiteHat Security, the web security company, said it would start offering clients $250,000 in the event their website was breached using an attack technique the WhiteHat missed. Recently, Jeremiah Grossman, WhiteHat's founder, said they had bumped up their guarantee to $500,000. This marked the first time a security company has done anything of the sort.  Mr. Grossman said he hoped others would follow suit, and foresaw a world in which insurance premiums would correlate with the security vendors that companies use, and one in which underwriters would start suing security vendors to recoup losses from a breach. ""How else are cyber insurers going to recoup their losses?"" said Howard Schmidt, the Obama administration's former cyber security coordinator. ""There needs to be accountability in the industry.""  The National Security Agency can forget about that encryption ""front door."" In a talk earlier this month at Princeton University, Admiral Michael S. Rogers, director of the N.S.A., suggested that the intelligence community and Silicon Valley might reach some sort of technical compromise on the question of whether intelligence agencies and law enforcement would still have access to the data that Facebook, Apple, Google and others recently resolved to encrypt. Adm. Rogers said he was not looking for a ""back door"" but a ""front door"" with ""multiple locks - big locks."" Government officials are toying with the idea of  key escrow, in which the government might hold onto part of an encryption key, and a company could hold onto the other. But security experts at the RSA conference say that, in reality, no such secure mechanism exists. ""Technically speaking, there's a serious misunderstanding about key escrow,"" Ron Rivest, one of the inventors of the RSA encryption algorithm said during a cryptography panel at the conference on Tuesday. ""The head of the N.S.A. is misusing this idea.""  Others agreed. ""There is no sane argument for weakening encryption,"" Mr. Yoran said in an interview. ""Period.""  Should threat intelligence be free? The latest darlings of the security space are companies like Norse and iSight Partners that provide threat intelligence to companies about people behind the attacks. But this year, there were grumblings that such intelligence should be offered for free.  One chief information security officer said that he paid a subscription fee to a threat intelligence company, only to find out that some of the data he paid for had been recycled off his own network. Another big problem, security practitioners said, is that - not unlike antivirus products - threat intelligence is inherently reactive. It takes time for security researchers to find an attack, learn about the bad guys' methods, and package that information into something useful. By then, it's often too late for a juicy target, like a bank, to do anything about it.  Nobody argues that threat intelligence is worthless. Some point to the United Parcel Service, which discovered malware on some of its in-store cash registers after a government advisory advised companies to check their systems for point-of-sale malware. The problem, critics say, is that such intelligence should be dispersed as widely, and as cheaply, as possible.  Should Homeland Security be welcomed in Silicon Valley? In a speech Tuesday, Jeh Johnson, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said his agency would be opening up an office in Silicon Valley. The goal, Secretary Johnson said, is threat sharing. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, CloudFlare and Akamai see as many, if not more, cyber threats traveling through their networks than government agencies.  The government wants access to that data, but the companies aren't so sure they want to give the government anything they don't need to, even if the data is just about hackers methods and malware, even if its anonymized.  Three information sharing bills are currently under consideration on Capitol Hill, but technologists and some legislators say each bill goes too far. But in his keynote Tuesday, Secretary Johnson said it was time companies started sharing threat data with the government and vice verse. ""Government doesn't have all the answers and we definitely don't have all the talent,"" he said. ""It has to be a partnership.""  Who is minding the gap? The biggest buzzword in cybersecurity these days is ""defense in depth,"" a multilayered approach to security that relies on various security products from various companies. The problem with this approach, however, is that hackers are busy exploiting the gaps in these systems to break into corporate networks. As security vendors battle it out for a slice of the $665 million that companies spent on data loss prevention last year, security practitioners say, they should also be fighting less, and talking more.  Is tweeting about hacking planes a bad idea? Chris Roberts, the hacker and founder of One World Labs, was detained for four hours of questioning at Syracuse Airport last Wednesday after tweeting about hacking into the flight Wi-Fi systems to get oxygen masks to deploy. When he tried to board another United Airlines flight to the RSA Conference on Saturday, he learned the airline had banned him from its flights. "
Privacy Pitfalls as Education Apps Spread Haphazardly,"At school districts across the country, the chief technology officers responsible for safeguarding student data are tearing their hair out. Scores of education technology start-ups, their pockets full from a rush of venture capital, are marketing new digital learning tools directly to teachers -- many are even offering them free to get a foothold in schools. That has enabled educators nationwide to experiment with a host of novel ''adaptive learning'' products, like math and foreign language apps that record and analyze students' online activities to personalize their lessons.    But the new digital tools have also left school district technology directors scrambling to keep track of which companies are collecting students' information -- and how they are using it.    ''A teacher can sign up for anything, without the knowledge of anyone else in the district,'' said Steve Young, the chief technology officer of the Judson Independent School District, a school system with some 23,500 students in San Antonio.     Already, some districts have experienced data breaches with software they purchased from vendors; in a few cases, student records have been publicly posted on the Internet. And online security researchers have discovered weaknesses in a couple of dozen popular digital learning services.    Some legal scholars contend that the practice of signing up teachers directly -- rather than their school districts -- skirts federal privacy laws. Administrators like Mr. Young say they want teachers to have free access to the best learning apps. Yet guarding against the potential pitfalls -- data breaches, identity theft, unauthorized student profiling -- is a herculean endeavor.   ''It's a huge challenge for big districts,'' Mr. Young said, ''and an even bigger challenge for smaller districts.''   These concerns are likely to widen as education technology proliferates. Last year, the market for educational software aimed at prekindergarten through 12th-grade students amounted to nearly $8.4 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2010, according to the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group.    Yet, for now at least, each school district, of which there are more than 14,000 in the United States, is confronting these challenges and devising solutions on its own.   In the Fairfax County, Va., school district, technology experts have conducted their own security reviews of several hundred digital learning products, and failed a few of the most popular ones. In Houston, one of the largest districts in the country, administrators are testing their own rating system for digital learning products and developing a set of district-approved apps for teachers.   And in Raytown, Mo., Melissa Tebbenkamp, the school district's director of instructional technology, vets every app that teachers want to try before allowing it to be used with students. Among other things, she checks to make sure those services do not exploit students' email addresses to push products on them or share students' details with third parties.   ''We have a problem with sites targeting our teachers and not being responsible with our data,'' Ms. Tebbenkamp said. For school technology directors around the country, she added, ''it is a can of worms.''   The new tools are being pushed by a rapidly expanding education technology industry. Some educators, entrepreneurs and philanthropists are particularly enthusiastic about adaptive learning products because they aim to tailor lessons to the individual abilities of each student.   ''If Suzy is good at long division but has trouble with division by zero, the software will show her more problems about division by zero,'' said Umang Gupta, an entrepreneur who has invested in Front Row Education, an adaptive math start-up, and other educational technology ventures.   To get such products into classrooms quickly, many start-ups offer their basic products free to individual teachers, but charge for extra features or districtwide use -- a ''freemium'' business model.   ''This is an industry driven by the freemium model, and that's a good thing,'' said Betsy Corcoran, the chief executive of EdSurge, an industry news service and research firm. ''It is giving teachers more of a voice in the tools that they use.''   The model makes it easy for teachers to try new products, but it also troubles many school technology directors. By enticing teachers to adopt nascent technologies on their own, they say, companies can bypass established district procedures for reviewing the effectiveness and data security of educational software.   Teachers, these experts say, are typically not equipped to vet the data-handling practices of free educational apps that may collect details as diverse as students' names, birth dates, profile photos, voice recordings, homework assignments, quiz scores or grades.   ''When it comes to privacy and security, it's a little unfair to put the burden on the teacher,'' said Bob Moore, a former school district technology director who now runs his own educational technology consulting firm. Teachers, he added, may also not know whether the apps have been rigorously studied to establish their effectiveness.   ''If you have a math app that focuses on dividing and multiplying fractions,'' Mr. Moore said, ''you should have some evidence that shows how it actually improves student learning around that particular objective.''   In addition, some education privacy law scholars say that the direct-to-teacher marketing model circumvents federal privacy laws.   One federal law, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, requires school districts to maintain the confidentiality of student records and to keep control of those records even if administrators outsource certain school functions to vendors.    Another federal law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, allows schools to act in place of parents in allowing online providers to collect personal details from children. But the Federal Trade Commission recommends that schools not delegate that decision to individual teachers.   ''Companies are soliciting teachers to breach the obligations of schools,'' said Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in Manhattan.   To help school administrators evaluate digital education services, the Department of Education recently issued best-practice recommendations for contracts. Last year, the Consortium for School Networking, an association for district technology professionals, introduced a free tool kit with data security questions for schools to ask their online service providers. And on Tuesday, a coalition of several dozen educational groups issued a set of principles for responsible use of student data.   But Lenny J. Schad, the chief technology information officer of the Houston Independent School District, said that teachers were using so many different apps, sometimes trying them for no more than a week or even a day, that it was impractical, if not impossible, for districts to track their use.   ''The teachers have the ability to reach out on a much bigger scale than anything that we could manage,'' Mr. Schad said.   Mr. Moore, the education technology consultant, said district officials and technology companies might eventually need to develop national standards for the classroom adoption of learning apps.   ''There needs to be a better system,'' Mr. Moore said, ''than each school district doing their own vetting.''    "
Stopping the iPhone Step Counter,"Stopping  The Step Counter    Q. My new iPhone 6 is tracking my steps. I never turned on this pedometer and don't wish my movements to be recorded. Can I turn off this function?   A. Motion tracking is typically turned on by default and counts your steps in the background, whether or not you use any of the iOS 8 Health apps. While its settings are not readily visible, you can disable this pedometer feature.   In the latest version of the system (iOS 8.4), open the Settings icon on the iPhone's Home screen. On the Settings screen, scroll down and tap Privacy. Look for Motion & Fitness down the list of Privacy controls and select it, and then tap the button next to Fitness Tracking to turn it off.    Defending    A Compromised PC   Q. How can I help if someone I know is deceived by one of those Windows telephone-support scams where the person tries to gain control of the computer and its files?   A. If someone you know has given passwords or personal information to a stranger on the phone -- or ceded control of the computer to someone remotely -- assume the worst. If possible, the victim should immediately go to a different computer or device and change all the passwords and PINs for online bank and credit card accounts, as well as the passwords for email and other online services.   Financial institutions have improved in notifying customers of suspicious activity, but if the caller got a debit or credit card number, ask the bank or card issuer for a new one. Keep an eye on monthly statements for unauthorized charges. If the caller has the person's Social Security number, there is a risk for identity theft and fraudulent tax returns; the Social Security Administration has links to resources on its website.   Change the computer's password and update its antivirus and security software, then scan the computer for malware. Microsoft's site has advice, a free Online Safety Scanner and other tools at microsoft.com/security. If the computer supports the Remote Desktop feature, make sure it is disabled in the Windows System properties box. Computer repair services can also scan, clean and strengthen security on a PC.   Once the PC has been scanned and any malware (like keystroke loggers) removed, change the computer's password again, as well as the password for the home network and network router. Stay on guard against suspicious activity both online and off -- there will always be other scammers out there.

Underground Cyberthreats,"Kate Murphy is a journalist in Houston who writes frequently for The New York Times. WITHIN the last year there have been 16 so-called fiber cuts in the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the F.B.I., someone or some group has been going through manholes to sever fiber optic cables that supply telecommunications to large sections of the region, which is home to technology companies, academic institutions and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, overseer of the nation's nuclear weapons. Following each incident (usually occurring late at night and involving two or three separate fiber cuts) residents couldn't make land or mobile calls, not even to 911, or send texts or emails. Hospital records in some instances were inaccessible. Credit cards and A.T.M.s didn't work. And forget about Googling, watching Netflix or remotely turning on a coffee maker. (For security reasons, Lawrence Livermore declined to say how the cuts affected its operations.)    When we talk about the Internet, we talk about clouds and ether. But the Internet is not amorphous. You may access it wirelessly, but ultimately you're relying on a bunch of physical cables that are vulnerable to attack. It's something that's been largely forgotten in the lather over cybersecurity. The threat is not only malicious code flowing through the pipes but also, and perhaps more critically, the pipes themselves.    Most worrisome are the throughways and junctures that handle enormous amounts of Internet traffic. It would be as if a major interstate highway or crucial interchange were closed and all the traffic was forced onto side streets. There would be gridlock, and some of those side streets might collapse under the weight. Data transfer would slow significantly or come to a halt, as has happened in Northern California.   Surprisingly, there isn't even a good map of the Internet's highways and byways to clearly show locations that, if taken out, would severely hamper the system. ''Everybody assumes somebody knows, but after a while you find out nobody actually knows,'' said Paul Barford, a professor of computer science at the University of Wisconsin who has made it his mission to find out where the vulnerabilities are.   He recently completed a map of the United States' long-haul Internet infrastructure -- stretches that span at least 30 miles and connect population centers of at least 100,000 people. It took him four years of cajoling information from commercial broadband providers and collecting public records to come up with a reasonably reliable map. Notably, his research was partly funded by the Department of Homeland Security and can be accessed only by D.H.S.-approved researchers.   ''What we're trying to avoid is giving bad guys a map to do bad things,'' Professor Barford said. ''Now that we can see the possible pinch points in the U.S., we are looking at ways to mitigate them.''   Security experts and networking engineers said they were most concerned about where major networks converge. These are called Internet exchange points, or I.X.P.s, where networks come together like highway interchanges to trade traffic, which is known as peering.   There are about 80 I.X.P.s in the United States but only a handful, including ones in New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Seattle and outside Washington, are vital interchanges for domestic as well as international traffic coming from undersea cables from abroad (which are also vulnerable to cuts by mislaid anchors or submarine sabotage).   Plugging into these major hubs are hundreds of Internet and mobile service providers, as well as content delivery networks such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. If taken out by natural disaster (earthquake, hurricane) or a strategic attack, much of the United States, if not much of the world, would have hindered Internet access or none at all, depending on the severity and sophistication of the strikes.   ''It's crazy to see these unprotected buildings containing all this physical cabling that's interconnecting continents as well as all of North America,'' said John Savageau, an information and communications technology consultant who formerly managed I.X.P.s owned by the CoreSite Realty Corporation, a major player in the industry. ''If one of these major nodes goes down, you're going to have pain because customer performance will be seriously degraded, but if you have a coordinated attack on multiple locations, that's a nightmare scenario.''   Indeed, many I.X.P.s are in old, unprotected buildings, some former telegraph offices. Often it's possible to lease adjacent office space in the buildings. Sometimes there aren't even security guards in the lobby. And the manholes around the buildings are also unprotected.   ''I guess it's a hide-in-plain-sight strategy,'' said Jim Poole, vice president for global providers for Equinix, another company that owns I.X.P.s (some more protected than others). ''I would hazard a guess that if an I.X.P. is not very secure, they are probably so obscure no one would know they were there.''   But there are websites that list most of them, as well as which networks -- telecoms, content providers, municipal governments and academic institutions -- traffic data through them.   Unlike data centers, there are no recognized standards for building or maintaining I.X.P.s. The Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for critical infrastructure, has no requirements for the physical protection of I.X.P.s nor does it have any rules against ownership by companies affiliated with a hostile foreign state -- despite the possibility of a purposeful choke or listening in on traffic running through an exchange.   ''The snooping issue is why you don't necessarily want a government agency monitoring I.X.P.s,'' said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute, a research organization that focuses on cybersecurity. ''It's a big problem because I.X.P.s are crucial to the efficient operation of the Internet but most of them are privately held with very few controls.''   For Bill Woodcock, executive director of Packet Clearing House, a nonprofit research institute dedicated to supporting Internet traffic exchange technology, the solution is not to create regulations that would make it more expensive to build I.X.P.s, but to build more of them so none are critical.   ''If you create redundancy, it doesn't matter if it's in a mop closet,'' he said, referring to one heavily trafficked I.X.P. in a former janitor's closet on an upper floor of an old building. He added that the situation was far worse in Europe, where some countries rely primarily on a single I.X.P. -- albeit one more fortified than a mop closet.   Mr. Barford at the University of Wisconsin agrees that abundant routes and exchanges are crucial to the Internet's resilience. But he said the Federal Communications Commission's recent net neutrality decision might paradoxically make that less likely, if it's interpreted to mean networks must share infrastructure as well as offer equal access to bandwidth. This would result in the cost-saving practice of threading new fiber optic cable through the same conduits and running them up the same poles as existing lines. Google has argued for that right in communications with the F.C.C.   The trouble is that cables running in a single licorice-like twist are easier to disable in one quick cut. It's a reason businesses are turning to companies like Zayo, Allied Fiber and Integra that build alternative dark fiber networks that customers can ''light'' (i.e. shoot data through them using laser pulses akin to Morse code) to diversify their routing. Think of dark fiber networks as private access toll roads you can jump onto avoid traffic jams.   ''The only way to solve this problem is to create a more robust network so you don't have these single points of failure,'' said Hunter Newby, founder and chief executive of Allied Fiber. He added that nothing is foolproof, however, no matter how many redundancies there are: ''I always remind people that planet Earth is a single point of failure. Just ask the dinosaurs.''    "
F.C.C. Fines AT&T $25 Million for Privacy Breach,"The Federal Communications Commission announced on Wednesday a $25 million fine against AT&T for failing to protect the personal information, including the Social Security numbers, of its customers.  Employees at AT&T call centers were found to have stolen the names and Social Security numbers of about 300,000 of the wireless carrier's customers in the United States. Those customer service workers at call centers in Mexico, Colombia and the Philippines sold the information to third parties. In Mexico, the information was gathered from November 2013 to April 2014, and sold to a third party who went by the alias El Pelón, referring to a bald man in Spanish. The employees sought out the names and details corresponding to specific phone numbers that El Pelón had provided. According to an F.C.C. senior official, AT&T terminated its contract with the Mexican call center in September. F.C.C. officials said the parties who bought the data appeared to have been trafficking stolen cellphones they sought to activate. They added that the personal information that employees had accessed without authorization was used to submit 290,803 handset unlock requests for mobile phones through AT&T's website. The F.C.C. began investigating the breach in May, and the fine is the largest for data security and privacy violations that the agency has ever issued. The agency said it first learned of the privacy violations after AT&T reported the activity in Mexico to the California attorney general last year. The additional breaches in Colombia and the Philippines were not uncovered until later, when AT&T reported them to the F.C.C. this year. Those investigations continue, the agency said. It declined to say whether other wireless carriers had relationships with the call centers in question. ""The commission cannot - and will not - stand idly by when a carrier's lax data security practices expose the personal information of hundreds of thousands,"" Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a statement on Wednesday. In addition to the fine, the settlement requires that AT&T notify all affected customers and provide credit-monitoring services. ""Customers trust that their phone company will zealously guard access to sensitive personal information in customer records,"" said Travis LeBlanc, chief of the agency's enforcement bureau. ""We hope that all companies will look to this agreement as guidance."" "
State Attorneys General Press JPMorgan for More Details on Hacking,"A group of state attorneys general who are investigating a computer systems breach last summer at JPMorgan Chase, which potentially exposed the accounts of 83 million consumers and small businesses, wants the bank to explain how it can be certain no sensitive information was compromised.  The group, which includes more than 15 attorneys general and is led by those from Illinois and Connecticut, sent a letter last Thursday to JPMorgan and its outside lawyers seeking more details about the nature of the breach and what measures the bank was taking to prevent a similar incident. JPMorgan has said the breach, which went undetected for several months, only allowed the hackers to gain access to customer phone numbers, addresses and email addresses. More sensitive information - like financial data, Social Security numbers, email passwords and user identification combinations - remained safe, the bank said. But the group said much about the breach remained a mystery. ""Critical facts about the intrusion remain unclear, including details concerning the cause of the breach and the nature of any procedures adopted or contemplated to prevent future breaches,"" said the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The letter was sent to Zoe Strickland, JPMorgan's global chief privacy officer, and outside lawyers working for the bank at WilmerHale and Hunton & Williams.  The group of attorneys general also requested information about the number of consumers in each state affected by the breach, a ""complete timeline of events leading up to the discovery the breach"" and copies of any internal or third-party investigative reports compiled after the breach's discovery. JPMorgan, which has said it spends about $250 million a year on cybersecurity, was given until Jan. 23 to comply with the request for information. The bank was directed to send its response to lawyers working in the privacy groups at the offices of Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, and George Jepsen, her counterpart in Connecticut. A bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter. Thebreach at JPMorgan took place after the still unidentified hackers stole the login credentials for a JPMorgan employee and then managed to gain access to a server the bank apparently neglected to upgrade with a so-called two-factor authentication process. Double authentication schemes are commonly used in the banking industry and usually require a second one-time password to gain access to a protected system. Once inside JPMorgan's system, the hackers managed to gain high-level access to more than 90 servers. But the bank has said the hackers were stopped before they could retrieve private customer financial information. "
Two Loan Firms Accused of Fraud in Online Scheme,"Thousands of cash-strapped Americans who filled out applications for payday loans on sites with names like paymeloans.com instead found their financial details had been used to make unauthorized debits or credit card charges, according to an investigation by federal regulators.  The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday morning said it had charged two information resale companies with illegally selling the payday loan applications of more than 500,000 consumers. The third parties that bought the information subsequently ''raided'' consumers' bank accounts for at least $7.1 million, regulators said.    Some consumers subsequently had to close their accounts or were charged fees for insufficient funds, the agency said.   In a complaint filed last week, the agency said that Sequoia One, a data broker whose principal place of business is in Tampa, Fla., and Gen X Marketing Group, a data broker in Clearwater, Fla., collected payday loan applications containing sensitive financial details, including consumers' names, addresses, employer names and Social Security, phone, bank account and bank routing numbers.   Sequoia One and Gen X Marketing Group could not be immediately reached for comment.   But instead of selling the applications to legitimate payday lenders, the complaint said, the companies sold the loan applications to non-lender companies ''that used consumers' sensitive information to commit fraud by debiting consumers' bank accounts for purported financial products that the consumers never purchased.''   The complaint also charged four executives with selling personal information without consumers' knowledge or consent and said these managers were aware of a ''high probability'' of fraud. Three of the defendants have agreed to settle the F.T.C.'s charges.   The case comes at a time when federal agencies, legislators and trade groups are debating whether to restrict the trade in potentially sensitive information about consumers. Although there are narrow federal laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA that place some restrictions on how an individual's credit or health records can be shared, there is little restriction on the sharing or sale of other financial and health information about consumers for marketing purposes.   ''There is a debate about whether invasions of privacy harm consumers,'' Jessica Rich, the director of the the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a phone interview. ''This is a clear-cut example where the sale of sensitive data caused considerable harm to consumers.''   The case is part of a F.T.C. crackdown on predatory practices among specialized information resellers known as lead generators. These are companies that create websites with tools like mortgage calculators or loan application forms to collect information from people in the market for loans, insurance, cars, real estate or other products. Lead generators then sell the data they have amassed, known as leads, to companies seeking customers.   Legitimate payday lenders, for instance, generally pay lead generators $10 to $100 per loan application, regulators said, and the lenders use the information to evaluate loan applications as well as transfer money to people whose loans have been approved.   But the agency complaint said the data brokers used sites with names like paydayloanpreapprovalnow.com and directfundingservice.com to lure consumers and then sold their financial details to nonlenders for about 50 cents each.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
NSS Labs' Testing Service Will Hold Security Vendors Accountable,"SAN FRANCISCO - Make no mistake: It's a shot across the bow of the online security industry. Starting Monday, corporate security officers will be able to measure the effectiveness of major security products - a tool the industry has been sorely lacking. NSS Labs, an independent security testing company, has developed a testing service that will allow corporations to see how vendors stack up, including which real threats their products are blocking, and which they are not.  That kind of basic benchmarking is long overdue in an industry crowded with security firms that love to claim their products catch all the threats their competitors do not. In truth, if corporations could sue security software manufacturers for failing to catch data breaches the way patients can sue medical practitioners for malpractice, the security industry would have gone bankrupt long ago. NSS Labs pulls in real threats it collects in ""honey pots"" - alluring traps they set up on the Internet that allow researchers to study intruders' tactics while attackers break into what they believe is a real system. The company then tests those threats against security defenses from some of the biggest names in the business, including Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, McAfee and Symantec. The offering is sure to put security vendors on notice. The end goal, said Vikram Phatak, chief executive of NSS Labs, is to offer real-time information to chief security officers in much the same way that Bloomberg terminals offer real-time financial information to analysts. Until now, NSS Labs and others tested security products and released one-time reports. But those tests, often performed by the security vendors themselves, were often biased or unreliable because they were using canned threats. The new offering from NSS Labs allows security officers to test products in real time through a service that does not sell security products. This kind of benchmarking is sure to shake up an industry that is loathe to admit it doesn't catch everything. NSS Labs got a taste of that kind of backlash last year, after it released a test of various breach-detection systems, which found that FireEye, then the darling of the breach detection space, underperformed similar offerings from Cisco, General Dynamics and Trend Micro. NSS Labs actually issued a grade of ""caution"" to customers who used FireEye's web and email malware protection systems. That set off an unusual tit-for-tat between the testing service and FireEye after Manish Gupta, a FireEye executive, criticized NSS Labs' testing service in a blog post. (NSS Labs researchers responded in their own blog post, ""Don't Shoot the Messenger."") But the episode had a real impact on FireEye. The company's stock price, which had been trading at $65 before NSS Labs released its study, tumbled to $40 and has hovered there ever since. "
"In a Secret Step, N.S.A. Expanded Internet Spying","WASHINGTON --  Without public notice or debate, the Obama administration has expanded the National Security Agency's warrantless surveillance of Americans' international Internet traffic to search for evidence of malicious computer hacking, according to classified N.S.A. documents. In mid-2012, Justice Department lawyers wrote two secret memos permitting the spy agency to begin hunting on Internet cables, without a warrant and on American soil, for data linked to computer intrusions originating abroad -- including traffic that flows to suspicious Internet addresses or contains malware, the documents show.    The Justice Department allowed the agency to monitor only addresses and ''cybersignatures'' -- patterns associated with computer intrusions -- that it could tie to foreign governments. But the documents also note that the N.S.A. sought permission to target hackers even when it could not establish any links to foreign powers.   The disclosures, based on documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, and shared with The New York Times and ProPublica, come at a time of unprecedented cyberattacks on American financial institutions, businesses and government agencies, but also of greater scrutiny of secret legal justifications for broader government surveillance.    While the Senate passed legislation this week limiting some of the N.S.A.'s authority, the measure involved provisions in the U.S.A. Patriot Act and did not apply to the warrantless wiretapping program.   Government officials defended the N.S.A.'s monitoring of suspected hackers as necessary to shield Americans from the increasingly aggressive activities of foreign governments. But critics say it raises difficult trade-offs that should be subject to public debate.   The N.S.A.'s activities run ''smack into law enforcement land,'' said Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity scholar at Stanford Law School who has researched privacy issues and who reviewed several of the documents. ''That's a major policy decision about how to structure cybersecurity in the U.S. and not a conversation that has been had in public.''   It is not clear what standards the agency is using to select targets. It can be hard to know for sure who is behind a particular intrusion -- a foreign government or a criminal gang -- and the N.S.A. is supposed to focus on foreign intelligence, not law enforcement.   The government can also gather significant volumes of Americans' information -- anything from private emails to trade secrets and business dealings -- through Internet surveillance because monitoring the data flowing to a hacker involves copying that information as the hacker steals it.   One internal N.S.A. document notes that agency surveillance activities through ''hacker signatures pull in a lot.''   Brian Hale, the spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said, ''It should come as no surprise that the U.S. government gathers intelligence on foreign powers that attempt to penetrate U.S. networks and steal the private information of U.S. citizens and companies.'' He added that ''targeting overseas individuals engaging in hostile cyberactivities on behalf of a foreign power is a lawful foreign intelligence purpose.''   The effort is the latest known expansion of the N.S.A.'s warrantless surveillance program, which allows the government to intercept Americans' cross-border communications if the target is a foreigner abroad. While the N.S.A. has long searched for specific email addresses and phone numbers of foreign intelligence targets, the Obama administration three years ago started allowing the agency to search its communications streams for less-identifying Internet protocol addresses or strings of harmful computer code.   The surveillance activity traces to changes that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The government tore down a wall that prevented intelligence and criminal investigators from sharing information about suspected spies and terrorists. The barrier had been erected to protect Americans' rights because intelligence investigations use lower legal standards than criminal inquiries, but policy makers decided it was too much of an obstacle to terrorism investigations.   The N.S.A. also started the warrantless wiretapping program, which caused an outcry when it was disclosed in 2005. In 2008, under the FISA Amendments Act, Congress legalized the surveillance program so long as the agency targeted only noncitizens abroad. A year later, the new Obama administration began crafting a new cybersecurity policy. That effort included weighing whether the Internet had made the distinction between a spy and a criminal obsolete.   ''Reliance on legal authorities that make theoretical distinctions between armed attacks, terrorism and criminal activity may prove impractical,'' the White House National Security Council wrote in a classified annex to a policy report in May 2009, which was included in the N.S.A.'s internal files.   About that time, the documents show, the N.S.A. -- whose mission includes protecting military and intelligence networks against intruders -- proposed using the warrantless surveillance program for cybersecurity purposes. The agency received ''guidance on targeting using the signatures'' from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, according to an internal newsletter.   In May and July 2012, according to an internal timeline, the Justice Department granted its secret approval for the searches of cybersignatures and Internet addresses. The Justice Department tied that authority to a pre-existing approval by the secret surveillance court permitting the government to use the program to monitor foreign governments.   That limit meant the N.S.A. had to have some evidence for believing that the hackers were working for a specific foreign power. That rule, the N.S.A. soon complained, left a ''huge collection gap against cyberthreats to the nation'' because it is often hard to know exactly who is behind an intrusion, according to an agency newsletter. Different computer intruders can use the same piece of malware, take steps to hide their location or pretend to be someone else.   So the N.S.A., in 2012, began pressing to go back to the surveillance court and seek permission to use the program explicitly for cybersecurity purposes. That way, it could monitor international communications for any ''malicious cyberactivity,'' even if it did not yet know who was behind the attack.   The newsletter described the further expansion as one of the ''highest priorities'' of the N.S.A. director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander. However, a former senior intelligence official said that the government never asked the court to grant that authority.   Meanwhile, the F.B.I. in 2011 had obtained a new kind of wiretap order from the secret surveillance court for cybersecurity investigations, permitting it to target Internet data flowing to or from specific Internet addresses linked to certain governments.   To carry out the orders, the F.B.I. negotiated in 2012 to use the N.S.A.'s system for monitoring Internet traffic crossing ''chokepoints operated by U.S. providers through which international communications enter and leave the United States,'' according to a 2012 N.S.A. document. The N.S.A. would send the intercepted traffic to the bureau's ''cyberdata repository'' in Quantico, Va.   The disclosure that the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. have expanded their cybersurveillance adds a dimension to a recurring debate over the post-Sept. 11 expansion of government spying powers: Information about Americans sometimes gets swept up incidentally when foreigners are targeted, and prosecutors can use that information in criminal cases.   Citing the potential for a copy of data ''exfiltrated'' by a hacker to contain ''so much'' information about Americans, one N.S.A. lawyer suggested keeping the stolen data out of the agency's regular repository for information collected by surveillance so that analysts working on unrelated issues could not query it, a 2010 training document showed. But it is not clear whether the agency or the F.B.I. has imposed any additional limits on the data of hacking victims.   In a response to questions for this article, the F.B.I. pointed to its existing procedures for protecting victims' data acquired during investigations, but also said it continually reviewed its policies ''to adapt to these changing threats while protecting civil liberties and the interests of victims of cybercrimes.''   None of these actions or proposals had been disclosed to the public. As recently as February, when President Obama spoke about cybersecurity at an event at Stanford University, he lauded the importance of transparency but did not mention this change.   ''The technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it,'' Mr. Obama said.

Need Some Espionage Done? Hackers Are for Hire Online,"A man in Sweden says he will pay up to $2,000 to anyone who can break into his landlord's website. A woman in California says she will pay $500 for someone to hack into her boyfriend's Facebook and Gmail accounts to see if he is cheating on her. The business of hacking is no longer just the domain of intelligence agencies, international criminal gangs, shadowy political operatives and disgruntled ""hacktivists"" taking aim at big targets. Rather, it is an increasingly personal enterprise. At a time when huge stealth attacks on companies like Sony Pictures, JPMorgan Chase and Home Depot attract attention, less noticed is a growing cottage industry of ordinary people hiring hackers for much smaller acts of espionage.  A new website, called Hacker's List, seeks to match hackers with people looking to gain access to email accounts, take down unflattering photos from a website or gain access to a company's database. In less than three months of operation, over 500 hacking jobs have been put out to bid on the site, with hackers vying for the right to do the dirty work. It is done anonymously, with the website's operator collecting a fee on each completed assignment. The site offers to hold a customer's payment in escrow until the task is completed. In just the last few days, offers to hire hackers at prices ranging from $100 to $5,000 have come in from around the globe on Hacker's List, which opened for business in early November. For instance, a bidder who claimed to be living in Australia would be willing to pay up to $2,000 to get a list of clients from a competitor's database, according to a recent post by the bidder. ""I want the client lists from a competitors database. I want to know who their customers are, and how much they are charging them,"" the bidder wrote. Others posting job offers on the website were looking for hackers to scrub the Internet of embarrassing photos and stories, retrieve a lost password or change a school grade. The rather matter-of-fact nature of the job postings on Hacker's List shows just how commonplace low-profile hacking has become and the challenge such activity presents for law enforcement at a time when federal and state authorities are concerned about data security. Hacking into individual email or social media accounts occurs on a fairly regular basis, according to computer security experts and law enforcement officials. In September, the Internet was abuzz when hackers posted nude photos of female celebrities online. It is not clear just how successful Hacker's List will prove to be. A review of job postings found many that had yet to receive a bid from a hacker. Roughly 40 hackers have registered with the website, and there are 844 registered job posters. From the postings, it is hard to tell how many of the job offers are legitimate. The site did get a favorable review recently on hackerforhirereview.com, which specializes in assessing the legitimacy of such services. The reviewer and owner of that site, who would identify himself only as ""Eric"" in emails, said he gave his top rating to Hacker's List because it's a ""really cool concept"" that limits the ability of customers and hackers to take advantage of one another. In light of the novelty of the site, it's hard to say whether it violates any laws. Arguably some of the jobs being sought on Hacker's List - breaking into another person's email account - are not legal. The founders of Hacker's List, however, contend that they are insulated from any legal liability because they neither endorse nor condone illegal activities. The website includes a 10-page terms and conditions section to which all users must agree. It specifically forbids using ""the service for any illegal purposes."" Some experts say it is not clear whether Hacker's List is doing anything wrong in serving as a meeting ground for hackers and those seeking to employ them. Yalkin Demirkaya, president of the private investigation company Cyber Diligence, and a former commanding officer of the New York Police Department's computer crimes group, said a crackdown would depend on whether law enforcement officials saw it as a priority. He said Hacker's List may skate by because many of the ""people posting the ads are probably overseas."" But Thomas G. A. Brown, a senior managing director with FTI Consulting and a former deputy chief of the computer and intellectual property crime unit of the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, said hacker-for-hire websites posed problems. ""Hackers for hire can permit nontechnical individuals to launch cyberattacks with a degree of deniability, lowering the barriers to entry for online crime,"" Mr. Brown said. The website, which is registered in New Zealand, is modeled after several online businesses in which companies seeking freelancers can put projects out to bid. Some have compared the service to a hacker's version of the classified advertising website Craigslist. Hacker's List even has a Twitter account (@hackerslist), where it announces the posting of new hacking assignments. Still, the three founders of Hacker's List are not willing to go public with their own identities - at least not yet. After registering with the website and beginning an email conversation, a reporter contacted one of the founders. Over a period of weeks, the founder, who identified himself only as ""Jack,"" said in a series of emails that he and two friends had founded Hacker's List and that it was based in Colorado. Jack described himself as a longtime hacker and said that his partners included a person with master's degree in business administration and a lawyer. He said that the three were advised by legal counsel on how to structure the website to avoid liability for any wrongdoing by people either seeking to hire a hacker, or by hackers agreeing to do a job. The company, he said, tries to do a small background check on the hackers bidding on jobs to make sure they are legitimate, and not swindlers. ""We all have been friends for a while,"" Jack said in an email, adding that Hacker's List ""was kind of a fluke occurrence over drinks one night."" ""We talked about a niche and I built it right there,"" he said. ""It kind of exploded on us, which was never expected."" Hacker's List began its website several months after federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents in Los Angeles completed a two-year crackdown on the hacker-for-hire industry. The investigation, called Operation Firehacker by the F.B.I., led to the filing of criminal charges against more than a dozen people across the country involved in either breaking into a person's email account or soliciting a hacker for the job. In New York, information uncovered during the investigation in Los Angeles led to the arrest in 2013 of Edwin Vargas, a New York Police Department detective at the time, who was charged with paying $4,000 for the hacking of the email accounts of 43 people, including current and former New York police officers. Mr. Vargas, who pleaded guilty in November 2013 and was sentenced to four months in prison, said he had been motivated by jealousy and wanted to see whether any of his colleagues were dating an ex-girlfriend who is the mother of his son. The F.B.I. investigation also involved the cooperation of the authorities in China, India and Romania, because a number of the websites where the hackers advertised their expertise were based overseas. Still, the market for hackers, many of whom comply with the law and act more like online investigators, shows no signs of slowing. Many companies are hiring so-called ethical hackers to look for weaknesses in their networks. David Larwson, a director of operations with NeighborhoodHacker.com, which is incorporated in Colorado, said he had seen increased demand from companies looking to make sure their employees are not obtaining sensitive information through hacking. He said in an email that companies were increasingly focused on an ""insider threat"" leading to a breach or unauthorized release of information. On its website, NeighborhoodHacker describes itself as a company of ""certified ethical hackers"" that works with customers to ""secure your data, passwords and children's safety."" "
"A.I.G. Invests Again in Kroll Family, With a Focus on Online Threats","In 1993, the Kroll family, one of the most prominent practitioners of corporate intelligence, reached out to the American International Group, the insurance giant, about investing in its firm. Nearly a quarter-century later, the Krolls and A.I.G. are doing it again.    A.I.G. plans to announce on Thursday that it has made an investment in K2 Intelligence, the investigations firm that Jules B. Kroll and his son Jeremy founded about five years ago, renewing what both sides say is a relationship that has stayed strong for decades.    While terms of the investment were not disclosed, A.I.G. will gain ties to a provider of investigations and analytics that can benefit its clients, a relationship similar to the one forged decades ago. But this time around, the ties between the two are underpinned by a threat that hovers over the modern world: online crime.   While in the past corporate investigators had worried about problems like performing simple due diligence or finding and preventing espionage, both firms think that a huge concern now is computer and data security.   ''One of the biggest shifts that has taken place is from a world where guns, guards and dogs surrounded the perimeter,'' Jeremy Kroll said in an interview. ''Today, these walls are permeable. Companies are working in a borderless world.''   Though many companies have arisen after security breaches and billions of dollars of theft and damage to offer protection services, K2 is seeking to provide more than a technological solution for its clients, Mr. Kroll said. Just as important as preventing such attacks is determining who was behind the hacking and why, he said.   ''The first order for me as an executive always was, 'Who's trying to penetrate our company, why are they trying to penetrate us, and is there anything I can do if I got early warning?''' said Tom Glocer, the former Thomson Reuters chief executive who serves on K2's board and is chairman of its online security practice.   The Krolls' new company, formed after the family sold its firm to Marsh & McLennan for $1.9 billion in 2004, has grown to include 300 employees in offices from New York to London to Tel Aviv. Beyond online defense, it has built practices on traditional investigations, regulatory compliance and data analytics.   But that growth, Mr. Kroll said, would be aided immeasurably by additional capital. So around October, the Krolls called A.I.G.'s chief executive, Peter Hancock, and its head of commercial insurance, John Doyle, for advice.   ''It wasn't like a blind date,'' Mr. Kroll said. ''It was more like families reconnecting.''   As the four sat in A.I.G.'s offices in Lower Manhattan, looking out over South Street Seaport, the two discussed the directions that each of their firms were headed. A common theme emerged as Mr. Hancock and Mr. Doyle discussed how their business was placing more emphasis on data analytics and insurance against online attacks.   For A.I.G., Mr. Doyle said, such insurance has become an increasingly important offering. The business has expanded beyond simply assuming the risks of an attack for clients to include helping customers build better defenses and helping them after a breach.   ''The cyberinsurance market is very undeveloped, and some of our customers have struggled to get significant capacity,'' Mr. Doyle said in an interview, referring to coverage amounts. ''This will help them manage those risks in a better way.''    "
Chief Says I.R.S. Struggles to Protect Online Data,"WASHINGTON --  John Koskinen, the head of the Internal Revenue Service, on Tuesday attributed a recent online attack that exposed the information of more than 100,000 taxpayers to the agency's inability to keep up with increasingly sophisticated threats. Appearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Koskinen said the agency faced the same pressure as those in the private sector to stay ahead of nimble, international criminals intent on stealing people's identities.     ''What worked yesterday, what worked a year ago may not be working anymore today, so you continually have to attack that problem,'' he said.   The I.R.S. revealed last week that an attack had exposed tax returns of thousands of people through Get Transcript, an application on the agency's website. Mr. Koskinen said the agency had contacted those whose information had been compromised and offered them free credit monitoring.   Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the committee's chairman, was critical of the I.R.S..   ''Put simply, your agency has failed these taxpayers,'' he said.   J. Russell George, a Treasury Department inspector general who oversees tax administration, said his office identified protecting personal data as the agency's greatest challenge in 2011, offering recommendations for how the I.R.S. could improve its practices. He declined to say whether following those suggestions could have prevented the recent breach.   ''I can say it would have been much more difficult had they implemented all of the recommendations that we made,'' he said.   Mr. George acknowledged the difficulties facing the agency and other entities in today's ''ever-changing and rapidly evolving hacker world.''   ''It's a true challenge for the I.R.S. to make a balance between ease of access and security,'' he said.   Mr. George said reports that the attack had come from Russia alone were inaccurate, though he would not specify where else the hackers may have been based. Mr. Koskinen said it appeared to be the work of a global criminal operation.   ''Our experience looking at syndicates around the world is they cooperate when it's in their interest, and they cross boundaries,'' Mr. Koskinen said.   Mr. Hatch said discussions about the agency's funding should be delayed until the cause of the breach could be determined. But Democrats said that Congress -- which has cut the I.R.S. budget by 18 percent since 2010, adjusted for inflation -- should do more to help.   Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said the best way to defend against such attacks was to ensure that the agency had the funding to hire skilled employees and keep its software updated.   ''If you have I.T. from the dark ages, you are not going to be able to stay on top of these problems,'' Mr. Wyden said.   Mr. Koskinen said they were hamstrung by ''an antiquated system,'' adding that sometimes upgrades were not available for their software because the software's creator no longer offered updates. He asked lawmakers to fully fund President Obama's latest budget request, including about $101 million to protect taxpayers' information.   But emphasizing the scope of the problem in a culture where one leak can compromise security for governments and companies all over the globe, Mr. Koskinen pointed out that the hackers were able to complete a multistep authentication process using personal information about taxpayers that they had collected elsewhere.   ''This particular problem was not a question of resources,'' he said.    "
"Protecting Smartphone Data, With Some Fortifications","Smartphones have a million practical uses, which means they are jammed with credit card numbers, website passwords and other personal information that can tempt thieves or hackers. While phones have built-in protection, you can always add a little more in the form of security apps. There is a bonanza of such apps, especially for phones based on Google's Android software. Because of Android's open nature, phones based on that operating system can be vulnerable to viruses and malware attacks.     Avast Mobile Security is a free app that provides virus scanning tools to check apps on your phone and files on your phone's memory card. It can remove threats it finds and can also detect and try to foil potential hackings that happen over Wi-Fi. If you lose your phone or it gets stolen, Avast has web tools to let you track your phone's whereabouts, and you can make the device emit a siren sound.   It has a straightforward, if rather boring, interface, but it does require some time to set up and maintain. Avast also offers a paid $15-a-year version that includes geofencing -- your phone will emit an alarm if it is carried outside a certain area -- plus other extras like cloud backups of your data.   Lookout Security and Antivirus is free for Android devices, and its more modern user interface may make using it feel less of a chore. Lookout has many of the same features as Avast, including tools to find a lost or stolen phone, plus virus scanning.   The free version includes cloud-based backups of all your contact information. The paid version can wipe data from your lost device remotely, and can even take a photo of someone who tries to use your phone. Such extras cost $30 a year, which is expensive for an app that's not quite as sophisticated as its rivals. Lookout also has an iOS app, but most of its features are already offered free in iOS.   IPhones and iPads are thought to be less vulnerable to viruses than Android devices, but they are equally full of personal information. If you use a free app like 1Password, much of your data can be put behind another security wall to keep it safe.   1Password acts as a secure vault for data you have on your phone, including website user names and passwords and credit card information. It can also store secure text notes that can be read only inside the app. Then you need to remember only one password -- the master password for 1Password itself -- instead of having to remember all your myriad login details.   1Password encrypts all the information so that if your phone falls into the wrong hands, it would prove difficult for someone to maliciously exploit your information. Extras include a password generator that can create passwords more secure than those you might create yourself, and it can sync all your passwords and information across your devices. 1Password also has an Apple Watch extension, which can show you password and payment data on your wrist.   The 1Password user interface can be confusing, and for the most secure website browsing, you have to use the special browser built into the app. To get the full range of features, including the ability to store driver's license details, you have to upgrade to the Pro version for $5. The version available for Android devices is almost the same as the iOS edition, but it lacks some design finesse and features like support for Android Wear smartwatches.   LastPass is an equivalent password manager app that's free for iOS. It's my favorite for its modern design and ease of navigation. It can securely store and enter your passwords and website logins, credit card information, secure notes and more, and is protected with encryption and a master password. The app also has an Apple Watch version. Your LastPass account makes it easy to access all your data across different devices. A family sharing option allows you to give someone you trust access to some of your data.   But the family sharing and other features are available only if you buy the Pro upgrade for $12, and the app has been criticized by some app store reviewers for not having as many features as the desktop edition of LastPass. The Android edition of LastPass is broadly similar.   Apart from apps like these, you can also use official security apps like Apple's FindMyiPhone and Google's Android Device Manager. And always set a passcode for your phone.   Quick Call   Retype is a fresh iOS app that adds a new twist to an old trick: Adding text to photos in your phone before you share them on social media. Retype's specialty is adding text and decorations that look like classic poster typography, including 3-D, shadow and multicolored layer effects. It's an elegant way to personalize photos and costs $3.    "
F.B.I. Is Tracking Path of Classified Email From the State Dept. to Clinton,"WASHINGTON --  F.B.I. agents investigating Hillary Rodham Clinton's private email server are seeking to determine who at the State Department passed highly classified information from secure networks to Mrs. Clinton's personal account, according to law enforcement and diplomatic officials and others briefed on the investigation. To track how the information flowed, agents will try to gain access to the email accounts of many State Department officials who worked there while Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state, the officials said. State Department employees apparently circulated the emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011, and some were ultimately forwarded to Mrs. Clinton.    They were not marked as classified, the State Department has said, and it is unclear whether its employees knew the origin of the information.    The F.B.I. is also trying to determine whether foreign powers, especially China or Russia, gained access to Mrs. Clinton's private server, although at this point, any security breaches are speculation.   Law enforcement officials have said that Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president, is not a target of the investigation, and she has said there is no evidence that her account was hacked. There has also been no evidence that she broke the law, and many specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in her account was probably of marginal consequence.   A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said in a statement on Friday that she ''took the handling of classified information very seriously.''   ''She always received classified materials in secure settings, either by phone, videoconference, on paper or in person,'' said the spokesman, Nick Merrill. ''If, however, some material unknowingly ended up somewhere on the State Department's unclassified email system, we want to continue to be as helpful as possible in getting to the bottom of that.''   He added: ''Beyond that, we'll let the State Department and other agencies speak to the specifics.''   This week, the inspector general of the nation's intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III, informed members of Congress that Mrs. Clinton had ''top secret'' information, the highest classification of government intelligence, in her account.   Some of that information, according to a memorandum the inspector general sent to the heads of the Senate and House intelligence and judiciary committees, may have come from a program called Talent Keyhole, which relies on satellite intercepts of conversations or imagery data. The program involves some of the most secure information in the intelligence agencies' computer systems.   Specifically, the inspector general told members of Congress that two emails should have been classified as top secret, with one of them designated ''TOP SECRET//SI//TK/NOFORN.'' Officials familiar with the nomenclature said that ''SI'' stood for ''special intelligence,'' usually indicating an intercepted communication, and that ''TK'' was routinely used as an abbreviation for Talent Keyhole, showing that the communication or an image was obtained from a satellite.   Attached to the memo -- which was publicly released by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- were copies of two of Mrs. Clinton's emails that Mr. McCullough said contained classified information. Those emails were not released publicly.   The State Department has questioned whether the determination by Mr. McCullough is correct. Nevertheless, the findings are consistent with the view of some federal officials that the State Department is not rigorous enough in handling classified national security information.   In an unusual move, the F.B.I.'s inquiry is being led out of its headquarters in Washington, blocks from the White House. Nearly all investigations are assigned to one of the bureau's 56 field offices. But given this inquiry's importance, senior F.B.I. officials have opted to keep it closely held in Washington in the agency's counterintelligence section, which investigates how national security secrets are handled.   The investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails has its roots in her decision to use only a private email account for her official business when she was secretary of state, an unorthodox decision that gave her some control over what was made public. She faced criticism when her use of the account became known this year, and after deleting what she said were more than 31,000 personal emails, she turned over more than 30,000 work-related emails for the State Department to make public.   Mrs. Clinton has said that her emails contained no classified information -- having classified information outside a secure government account is illegal -- and that she is fully cooperating with the investigation. But in reviewing a sampling of the emails for potential security breaches, Mr. McCullough said he found four out of 40 that contained classified information, though perhaps stripped of any indication that it was of classified origin.   According to current and former State Department officials who worked with Mrs. Clinton, most classified information was routed to classified government servers in her office, where it was printed out for her review. Her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, often operated the same way.   Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement Thursday in response to what she said were ''allegations about Mrs. Clinton's emails'' that ''none of the emails alleged to contain classified information were written by Secretary Clinton'' and that ''none of the emails alleged to contain classified information include any markings that indicate classified content.''   In a letter made public on Wednesday, David Kendall, Mrs. Clinton's lawyer, said he had handed over to the Justice Department a thumb drive containing the 30,000 emails that had been given to the State Department. He also said the company that had handled Mrs. Clinton's personal account had given the Justice Department the server Mrs. Clinton used to operate it. The company, Platte River Networks, had been in possession of the server since 2013.   Computer experts said it was likely that F.B.I. technicians would be able to recover from the server at least some of Mrs. Clinton's deleted personal emails.   In addition, specially trained cybersecurity investigators will seek to determine whether Russian, Chinese or other hackers breached the account or tried to transfer any of Mrs. Clinton's emails, including those containing the classified information, several officials said.   Mrs. Clinton's successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, told CBS News this week that ''it is very likely'' that Russian or Chinese hackers read his emails, although he did not specify whether he was talking about his classified or unclassified accounts. ''I certainly write things with that awareness,'' he said.

The Student Who Stood Up for Privacy,"On Tuesday, when Max Schrems won a landmark privacy case in the European Court of Justice, Edward J. Snowden told him on Twitter that he had ''changed the world for the better.'' Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, had a different opinion, saying the decision ''puts at risk the thriving trans-Atlantic digital economy.'' The brouhaha, however, had little evident effect on the apparently imperturbable Mr. Schrems. ''I expected this,'' said Mr. Schrems, a 28-year-old graduate student in law at the University of Vienna who, for the formal reading of the decision, wore jeans and an untucked button-down shirt. ''Under the law they couldn't say anything else.''    For all of Mr. Schrems's certainty, few privacy lawyers expected such a sweeping decision. The case concerned the transfer of the personal data between Europe and the United States, a complex, previously obscure issue that nonetheless has significant consequences for most companies that send personal information -- via activities like searches, social media postings and online purchases -- across the Atlantic.    The decision invalidated the so-called safe harbor agreement under which more than 4,000 American companies, including Google and Facebook, were handling the personal data of European consumers. Those companies can find other ways to transfer this information legally, but the court's decision seems to empower the national regulators in each of the 28 European Union countries to investigate whether data transferred to the United States is protected adequately. And some of those regulators have a dim view of Silicon Valley's attitude toward privacy.   Mr. Schrems's legal campaign against Facebook began when he was a 24-year-old student studying at the Santa Clara University School of Law in California. Over the course of the semester, a couple of lawyers from Silicon Valley technology companies came to speak to his privacy class, and Mr. Schrems was taken aback to hear them say they didn't take Europe's strict privacy laws very seriously, since companies rarely faced significant penalties for breaking them.   At the time, Mr. Schrems was looking for a topic for a paper. ''I had to write about something,'' he said recently. So he decided to look at how Facebook deals with European data protection laws. Those laws limit how companies collect personal information, prohibit them from using it for unauthorized purposes without permission and restrict how they handle it.   Mr. Schrems sent Facebook a formal request to see all of the data the company had collected about him, which he has the right to do under European law. After a couple of weeks and about a dozen emails, he received a CD by mail with more than 1,200 pages of information -- every ''poke,'' friend request and invitation (and response) he had sent since setting up an account in 2008. Most of it was no surprise, but he was shocked to see that Facebook had retained information he had deleted -- and was no longer visible online -- including the complete text of a private chat with a friend who had been hospitalized for psychological problems. (Facebook has said an individual can delete only his side of a correspondence.) ''Her health history is in these messages,'' Mr. Schrems said, ''and I deleted them, but they were still there.''   Mr. Schrems doesn't object to Facebook, and he still uses his account. ''We should be able to use all of these services,'' he said, ''but there has to be a line.'' So he filed 22 complaints about data retention and some of the company's other privacy practices with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which regulates Facebook, because its European operations are based in Ireland. Two years later, after Mr. Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency could gain access to the personal information of Europeans held by American technology companies through the Prism program, Mr. Schrems filed another complaint, asserting that Facebook couldn't transfer his personal information to the United States, since it wasn't adequately protected there. The regulator rejected this petition.   This eventually became the European Court of Justice case decided last week. The court ruled that national regulators can investigate whether data transfers comply with European law, but also, crucially, that the safe harbor agreement was itself invalid. (Facebook issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the case was about United States surveillance and that ''Facebook has done nothing wrong.'') The ruling is also expected to complicate negotiations for a new trans-Atlantic data-transfer agreement, as well as new European data-protection legislation.   American technology firms are especially worried because they routinely transfer so much information across the Atlantic. ''International data transfers are the lifeblood of the digital economy,'' said Townsend Feehan, chief executive of IAB Europe, which represents online advertising companies including Google as well as small start-ups. The ruling ''brings with it significant uncertainty as to the future possibility for such transfers.''   As Mr. Schrems sees it, however, what is at stake is a deeper conflict between the European legal view of privacy as a right equivalent to free speech and that of the United States, where consumers are asked to read and agree to a company's terms of service and decide what's best for themselves. ''We only do this in the privacy field -- dump all the responsibility on the user,'' Mr. Schrems said. He pointed out that consumers are not expected to make decisions about other complex issues, like food or building safety. ''In a civilized society,'' he said, ''you expect that if you walk into a building it's not going to collapse on your head.''   Beyond Big Brother   ''I'm not a big privacy person,'' Mr. Schrems told me in May over brunch at the Naschmarkt, a hip outdoor market in Vienna. That's fortunate, since his activism has had the paradoxical effect of making him a public figure in Germany and Austria -- he's even appeared on the cover of the German tabloid Bild-Zeitung. Analytical by nature, Mr. Schrems is more interested in privacy in principle than in practice; he says he's not hiding anything but that he wants to be able to decide what he shares with whom. He doesn't tell most journalists he is gay, information he volunteered in an interview, for example, ''because then people think you only want to keep things private because you're gay.''   However much people want to hold on to their privacy, they nonetheless inadvertently reveal all sorts of things when they go online, including habits, sexual orientation and political beliefs. Data gathered online is sometimes sold, shared or combined with information from mobile phones or offline sources. All of this information is a vital raw material for a digital advertising business expected to be worth more than $80 billion worldwide by 2018.   ''Surveillance,'' wrote Bruce Schneier, a leading computer security analyst, ''is the business model of the Internet.'' Big Brother is no longer the only threat to privacy, and Europe has struggled to regulate the gossipy circle of consumer-data-collecting companies. Facebook currently faces challenges from five European regulators, including a Dutch-led investigation into how the company uses data from services like Instagram and WhatsApp and a Belgian effort to stop it from tracking consumers who have not joined the service.   Mr. Schrems, lawmakers and various regulators are essentially asking why consumers don't have more control over the information gathered by their computers and phones -- and perhaps soon by their smartwatches and self-driving cars. ''This is something we see as a fundamental value,'' Mr. Schrems said. To drive home the analogy for an American, he put it this way: ''You can't say, 'Oh, I don't feel like applying the First Amendment.' ''   Mr. Schrems first became interested in privacy when he spent a year as an exchange student in Avon Park, a town in central Florida. It was quite a shock for a 16-year-old from cosmopolitan Salzburg, Austria's fourth-largest city. ''Everyone was deeply religious, everyone was Republican,'' Mr. Schrems said. He remembers being surprised at the level of security in his high school, which had video cameras mounted in the hallway.   Like many young, well-educated Europeans, Mr. Schrems likes the United States, but he objects to the tendency of Silicon Valley companies to beg forgiveness rather than ask permission. ''The approach of the big companies is saying we're above the law,'' he said. Not for nothing does he call his organization -- which consists mostly of him and some university friends -- Europe-v-Facebook.   One reason European countries take privacy so seriously is that it's technically considered two rights. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the right to ''respect for private and family life'' and also, separately, that ''everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.'' It also says that data protection laws must be overseen by independent regulators, which is why national data protection authorities in Europe have so much power.   ''Data protection is a right to determine how -- rather than whether -- one participates in sharing information,'' says Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a professor at the Oxford Internet Institute who writes on these issues. That distinction is important: Data protection doesn't just protect information individuals don't want to share; it also gives them some control over information that companies have already gathered. Like every right, it has limits. But ''it's intended to give individuals control over every phase and stage of the use of their personal information,'' he said.   The concept of data protection as distinct from privacy only dates back to the late 1960s, when computers and databases became more sophisticated. With memories of World War II-era fascism still relatively fresh, European countries began passing data-protection laws in the 1970s. In 1983, the German Federal Constitutional Court recognized an individual's right to control information about himself as ''informationelle selbstbestimmung,'' or ''informational self-determination,'' a phrase that sounds very German even after translating it into English.   To American lawyers, ''informational self-determination'' can sound more like literary theory than law. And even some Europeans see data protection laws as based on confusing logic and overseen by old-fashioned bureaucracies that can complicate everyday tasks without offering an effective way to stop truly bad actors.   But Continental European law recognizes a concept of personal dignity, which includes privacy and reputation, that needs to be respected. That's why the European Court of Justice last year recognized the so-called right to be forgotten, which lets individuals seek removal of search engine links to information about them that's ''inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant.''   To Mr. Schrems, the debate in the United States that arose out of the Snowden leaks was centered on the question of security -- keeping information out of the hands of others. In technology circles, that discussion often revolves around encryption and other technical solutions that put the onus on individuals to protect themselves, a popular idea in libertarian-leaning Silicon Valley that doesn't play as well in Europe.   ''Encryption is based to some extent on the idea that the law won't protect your rights, so you have to protect yourself,'' says Karl-Nikolaus Peifer, director of the Institute for Media Law and Communications Law of the University of Cologne. ''The European tradition is that the law will protect you.''   A Clash of Values   Two days after I met Mr. Schrems in Vienna, I watched him give a short speech at an International Bar Association conference at the Savoy Hotel in London.   He looked distinctly out of place amid all the lawyers in suits. But they listened intently as he discussed Facebook's terms of service and showed charts illustrating how much data Facebook collects. He even got laughs -- and a few gasps -- when delivering his punch line: A slide with a picture of a Centra minimart in the Irish countryside. ''This is the Irish Data Protection Commissioner who is in charge of Facebook, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Google -- all the big names,'' he says. ''It's in a cool place called Portarlington with about 5,000 people.'' The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has its office -- pause -- ''there,'' Schrems said, pointing to the floor above the market. (The organization moved some of its operations to Dublin this year.) Imagine if the Federal Trade Commission had its headquarters above a 7-Eleven in a Virginia exurb and you'll get the idea.   The Irish Data Protection Commissioner never responded to Mr. Schrems's original 22 complaints to his satisfaction, so in 2014 he filed a class-action-style case in Austria that was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons. Mr. Schrems appealed. Perhaps most important, however, Mr. Schrems's original complaints helped inspire the forthcoming European Union data protection legislation. ''He was actually the trigger for me to understand that we couldn't continue the way the law was applied,'' said Viviane Reding, the former European Union justice commissioner who proposed the law and is now a member of the European Parliament.   The current version of the legislation calls for a ''one-stop-shop'' system in which American companies would be regulated primarily by the data protection authority of the country in which their European headquarters were in. But the court's decision could make that untenable.   Silicon Valley companies have said they are continuing to transfer data by other legal means, and negotiations on a new safe harbor agreement are continuing. But the court's decision will make that difficult, and it seems to open the door for national regulators to investigate any of those transfers, which could cause significant headaches for technology companies. Final decisions, made by the European Court of Justice, would be based on corporate behavior, including, potentially, whether companies were cooperating with the N.S.A. American technology companies could also move some operations to Europe, thus avoiding the need to transfer data across the Atlantic.   ''There's a massive tension between the libertarian values of Silicon Valley, which is focused on innovation, and the 28 national regulators focused on the rules and regulations of privacy as a human right,'' said J. Trevor Hughes, chief executive of the International Association of Privacy Professionals, which has taken no position on the case. ''We'll be watching for what the regulators do.''    "
British Announce Sweeping Plan to Update Their Surveillance Laws,"LONDON --  Stirring a fraught debate about the balance between security and privacy, the British government on Wednesday proposed tougher scrutiny over snooping by spy agencies, but also said it wanted technology companies to store data about every Briton's Internet use for a year. The far-reaching set of proposals, made by the home secretary, Theresa May, is devised to streamline and clarify the law, bringing up to date a patchwork of different legislation drafted while the digital era was in its infancy.     Speaking in Parliament, Ms. May told lawmakers that she wanted to apply ''new standards for openness, transparency and oversight'' to a body of law widely criticized as incoherent and incomprehensible, and promised ''world-leading oversight arrangements'' for intelligence agencies.   But human rights campaigners argued that the proposed bill posed new threats to privacy, and Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil liberties group Liberty, described it as a ''breathtaking attack on the Internet security of every man, woman and child in our country.''   Although public support for the spy agencies is stronger in Britain than in some other European nations, the information leaked by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, about wholesale surveillance has prompted concerns about the extent of electronic spying and surveillance.   British law is widely regarded as opaque, and David Anderson, a senior lawyer who is Britain's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, warned this year that changes were needed. If things remain as they are, he said, the public could ''become disenchanted with the whole business of intelligence gathering'' and intelligence agencies would ''lose the public confidence that they actually need.''   Mr. Anderson submitted one of three reports that Ms. May took into consideration before drafting her proposals. One of his main requests was to change the way in which interception warrants for British spy agencies are granted by a senior government minister, usually by the home secretary or the foreign secretary.   Under the government's proposal presented on Wednesday, such interception warrants would first be authorized by a senior minister, but would then be approved by a serving or retired judge.   In urgent cases, the intervention might proceed with only ministerial approval, but judicial authorization would have to follow within five days or the operation would have to cease. By retaining a central role for cabinet ministers, Ms. May said that her proposed ''double lock'' system would retain democratic legitimacy because politicians were accountable for their decisions in Parliament.   More controversial are the plans to require British technology companies to store details about the websites and applications that people use, expanding significantly the stock of data that law enforcement and other agencies may be able to mine.   The information would be available to the police and other government agencies, and although approval for access would be required from senior officers, there would be no need to obtain a judicial warrant in most cases.   Government officials say that this would not constitute a complete browsing history; one example given was that companies would have to record that a user had logged into a Hotmail account, but not whether they had then sent an email from it.   There would be some additional procedures for those applying to gain access to records from members of some professions in which confidentiality is often necessary, including doctors, lawyers and lawmakers. Applications made to identify or confirm a journalist's source would need the authorization of a current or former judge.   Aware of concerns that such powers might be abused, Ms. May said that they would only be used when ''necessary and proportionate,'' and that local government officials would not be allowed access to such data under her plan.   Still, that element of the draft bill was questioned, not just by privacy campaigners, but also by Mr. Anderson, who said in a cautiously worded statement that it ''needs to be asked whether there is sufficient independence in procedures for access to communications data.''   The government says that after consultations over the draft bill it will introduce a revised version early next year. It would then need to be approved by both houses of Parliament.   Bulk interception of communications, which officials say is currently legal, would also be given a clear basis in law, although warrants would be required and only security and intelligence agencies would be able to apply for them.   Cian Murphy, a legal expert at King's College, London, said that there were ''positive developments,'' in the proposals.   ''The move toward a judicial role in the authorization of surveillance is welcome,'' Mr. Murphy said, ''but the mechanism requires study.''    "
"'Smart' Objects, Dumb Risks","Zeynep Tufekci is an assistant professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina and a contributing opinion writer. A FRIDGE that puts milk on your shopping list when you run low. A safe that tallies the cash that is placed in it. A sniper rifle equipped with advanced computer technology for improved accuracy. A car that lets you stream music from the Internet. All of these innovations sound great, until you learn the risks that this type of connectivity carries. Recently, two security researchers, sitting on a couch and armed only with laptops, remotely took over a Chrysler Jeep Cherokee  speeding along the highway, shutting down its engine as an 18-wheeler truck rushed toward it. They did this all while a Wired reporter was driving the car. Their expertise would allow them to hack any Jeep as long as they knew the car's I.P. address, its network address on the Internet. They turned the Jeep's entertainment dashboard into a gateway to the car's steering, brakes and transmission.     A hacked car is a high-profile example of what can go wrong with the coming Internet of Things -- objects equipped with software and connected to digital networks. The selling point for these well-connected objects is added convenience and better safety. In reality, it is a fast-motion train wreck in privacy and security.   The early Internet was intended to connect people who already trusted one another, like academic researchers or military networks. It never had the robust security that today's global network needs. As the Internet went from a few thousand users to more than three billion, attempts to strengthen security were stymied because of cost, shortsightedness and competing interests. Connecting everyday objects to this shaky, insecure base will create the Internet of Hacked Things. This is irresponsible and potentially catastrophic.   That smart safe? Hackers can empty it with a single USB stick while erasing all logs of its activity -- the evidence of deposits and withdrawals -- and of their crime. That high-tech rifle? Researchers managed to remotely manipulate its target selection without the shooter's knowing.   Home builders and car manufacturers have shifted to a new business: the risky world of information technology. Most seem utterly out of their depth.   Although Chrysler quickly recalled 1.4 million Jeeps to patch this particular vulnerability, it took the company more than a year after the issue was first noted, and the recall occurred only after that spectacular publicity stunt on the highway and after it was requested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In announcing the software fix, the company said that no defect had been found. If two guys sitting on their couch turning off a speeding car's engine from miles away doesn't qualify, I'm not sure what counts as a defect in Chrysler's world. And Chrysler is far from the only company compromised: from BMW to Tesla to General Motors, many automotive brands have been hacked, with surely more to come.   Dramatic hacks attract the most attention, but the software errors that allow them to occur are ubiquitous. While complex breaches can take real effort -- the Jeep hacker duo spent two years researching -- simple errors in the code can also cause significant failure. Adding software with millions of lines of code to objects greatly increases their potential for harm.   The Internet of Things is also a privacy nightmare. Databases that already have too much information about us will now be bursting with data on the places we've driven, the food we've purchased and more. Last week, at Def Con, the annual information security conference, researchers set up an Internet of Things village to show how they could hack everyday objects like baby monitors, thermostats and security cameras.   Connecting everyday objects introduces new risks if done at mass scale. Take that smart refrigerator. If a single fridge malfunctions, it's a hassle. However, if the fridge's computer is connected to its motor, a software bug or hack could ''brick'' millions of them all at once -- turning them into plastic pantries with heavy doors.   Cars -- two-ton metal objects designed to hurtle down highways -- are already bracingly dangerous. The modern automobile is run by dozens of computers that most manufacturers connect using a system that is old and known to be insecure. Yet automakers often use that flimsy system to connect all of the car's parts. That means once a hacker is in, she's in everywhere -- engine, steering, transmission and brakes, not just the entertainment system.   For years, security researchers have been warning about the dangers of coupling so many systems in cars. Alarmed researchers have published academic papers, hacked cars as demonstrations, and begged the industry to step up. So far, the industry response has been to nod politely and fix exposed flaws without fundamentally changing the way they operate.   In 1965, Ralph Nader published ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' documenting car manufacturers' resistance to spending money on safety features like seatbelts. After public debate and finally some legislation, manufacturers were forced to incorporate safety technologies.   No company wants to be the first to bear the costs of updating the insecure computer systems that run most cars. We need federal safety regulations to push automakers to move, as a whole industry. Last month, a bill with privacy and cybersecurity standards for cars was introduced in the Senate. That's good, but it's only a start. We need a new understanding of car safety, and of the safety of any object running software or connecting to the Internet.   It may be hard to fix security on the digital Internet, but the Internet of Things should not be built on this faulty foundation. Responding to digital threats by patching only exposed vulnerabilities is giving just aspirin to a very ill patient.   It isn't hopeless. We can make programs more reliable and databases more secure. Critical functions on Internet-connected objects should be isolated and external audits mandated to catch problems early. But this will require an initial investment to forestall future problems -- the exact opposite of the current corporate impulse. It also may be that not everything needs to be networked, and that the trade-off in vulnerability isn't worth it. Maybe cars are unsafe at any I.P.

Double Talk on Doing Business in China,"At the start of his visit to the United States, President Xi Jinping of China sought to reassure American companies that his government was committed to protecting the interests of foreign companies and fighting cybercrime.  ''The Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone,'' he said Tuesday at a dinner  in Seattle with executives from companies like Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. ''Both commercial cybertheft and hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties.''    Those words sound encouraging, but there's plenty of reason for skepticism.   China has a long way to go in protecting the rights of foreign businesses, and Mr. Xi seemed dismissive of the legitimate complaints about unfair, coercive treatment of foreign companies. The government has used its power to favor state-owned and domestic private firms. There is little transparency in how it makes decisions and few rights of appeal. And of immediate concern is the continuous threat posed by hackers based in China.   Chinese officials are believed to be behind some of the many cyberattacks against American companies and government agencies. Some of these hackers clearly work for the government and are stealing corporate secrets to help Chinese companies, American officials and cybersecurity experts say. Mr. Xi's government denies that it is involved in the attacks, despite evidence collected by the United States that a unit of the People's Liberation Army has stolen corporate secrets.   Aside from cybersecurity issues, the Xi government has also proposed regulations that could make it impossible for American technology companies to operate there. They would be forced to store data about Chinese customers in China and provide the Chinese government backdoor access to their systems and encrypted communications, making those services even more vulnerable to hacking.   At the end of last year, Chinese officials proposed that tech companies selling computer equipment to Chinese banks be required to disclose the source code of their products to government agencies. Officials put that policy on hold after protests by foreign companies and the Obama administration. They ought to drop that measure completely.   Foreign individuals and businesses trying to operate in China also face harassment and arrest with little explanation. Recently, the Chinese government arrested an American consultant from Houston named Phan Phan-Gillis on spying charges after detaining her for months. Officials have not provided her family or the United States government any information about the accusations against her.   As the world's second-biggest economy, China's fast-growing market is very attractive to foreign companies. But doing business in China means agreeing to onerous conditions imposed by Beijing -- like operating through joint ventures with Chinese partners and transferring technology to those local partners.   Mr. Xi and his officials need to realize that trade and investment has to be a two-way street. Many Chinese firms are trying to expand by acquiring companies, real estate and other assets in the United States and elsewhere. With few exceptions, Western leaders have not tried to limit the growth of Chinese companies. In fact, American and Chinese officials are negotiating a bilateral treaty to encourage more cross-border investment.   But if the Xi government continues to put up roadblocks to foreign companies, China cannot expect the rest of the world to open its doors to more investment without reciprocity.    "
House Passes Cybersecurity Bill After Companies Fall Victim to Data Breaches,"WASHINGTON --  Responding to a series of computer security breaches in government and the private sector, the House passed an expansive measure Wednesday that would push companies to share access to their computer networks and records with federal investigators. The bill, which came after years of false starts and bitter disappointment for the Obama administration, is similar to a measure approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee and headed for that chamber's floor this spring. The House measure, already largely embraced by the White House, passed, 307 to 116.     Should the House and Senate come together on final legislation, it would be the federal government's most aggressive response yet to a spate of computer attacks that helped sink a major motion picture release by Sony Pictures Entertainment, exposed the credit card numbers of tens of thousands of customers of Target stores and compromised the personal records of millions of people who did business with the health insurer Anthem.   ''The gravity of the emergency we have in cyberspace is setting in with lawmakers,'' said Paul Kurtz, who worked on the issue under in the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, and is chief executive of TruStar, which aids companies in information sharing. ''They now understand that companies can no longer fight the bad guys individually.''   The House bill would provide legal liability protections for companies that share cyberthreat information with each other or with the government. But negotiators also added what they see as critical privacy protections.   If a company shares information with the government, it would receive liability protection only if its data undergoes two rounds of washing out personal information -- once by the company before it gives the data to the government and another round by the government agency that receives the data, which many experts believe is critical in getting companies to comply.   ''Liability protection is something needed to help companies share,'' said Sarah Beth Groshart, director of government affairs at the Information Technology Industry Council. ''And only Congress can provide that.''   Policing the nation's computer networks has been complicated over the last decade by concerns from Republicans, who expressed concern for burdens placed on the private sector, and from those arguing for more stringent privacy protection in both parties.   The 2013 exposure of the government's extensive surveillance programs into American lives through the leak of classified documents by Edward Snowden further muddied an agenda that many national security experts insisted was critical to preventing large scale cyberattacks on American infrastructure and businesses. Further, jurisdiction for cybersecurity snaked over an array of congressional committees, making unified legislation at times difficult.   Lawmakers have been grappling with cybersecurity legislation since 2012, when a bipartisan Senate effort twice failed over business concerns that the legislation was putting too onerous a burden on the private sector.   Leon E. Panetta, who was defense secretary at the time, and intelligence leaders implored lawmakers to shrug off the furious opposition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but lawmakers were not persuaded.   A House effort in the last Congress mustered strong opposition from the White House, which was concerned about jeopardizing the privacy rights of consumers.   But since then, a series of cyberattacks has changed the political equation. The attack on Sony Pictures -- Mr. Obama blamed North Korea for the attack -- thwarted the wide release of a comedy portraying the assassination of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.   Early this year, Anthem reported a major breach that exposed the records of nearly 80 million people. Just last week, Target agreed to reimburse MasterCard $19 million for losses associated with the theft of 40 million credit and debit card numbers from its computer network in December 2013.   ''We are under attack as I speak,'' said Representative Dutch Ruppersberger, Democrat of Maryland. ''To do nothing is not an option.''   Privacy advocates continued to express anger legislation Wednesday on the House floor, creating unlikely alliances between some conservatives and left-leaning members.   ''We've seen before that the federal government has a poor track record of safeguarding our information when entrusted with it,'' said Representative Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, on the House floor. ''The last thing we should be doing,'' is empowering them with more information access, he said. His comments were echoed by Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. ''Since 9/11 the government has begun to know more and more about what we are doing, where are, where we sleep, who we love,'' he said, while consumers, ''have known less and less.''   At the same time, some feel the bill does not go far enough on national security. ''I do believe we will see a cybersecurity bill enacted and signed into law,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine who has worked on the issue for years. ''But it won't be as strong as it should be to protect critical infrastructure.''   However security experts said that the government would benefit from the information sharing as well. ''The net effect of this legislation will be positive on national security side and economic security side,'' said Mr. Kurtz.   The White House issued a statement on Tuesday that commended the effort in the House but did raise concerns about the liability protections offered to private companies in the House bill, raising fears that they would be so sweeping that they might backfire and prevent companies from reporting cyberthreats.   Privacy changes in the bill won over Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California and ranking member on the House Intelligence committee, who opposed it last year, and both parties expect the president to come along as well.   The timing for passage of the Senate version of the bill may be impeded by time-consuming amendments. That chamber is already snarled over a bill that would give Congress more say in a nuclear deal with Iran and a major trade measure. The Highway Trust Fund is nearly broke and requires legislative action before the end of the month, and a national security program at issue also requires renewal.   Indeed there is some concern among some Republicans that the bill could become a vehicle for a debate about the broader national security and privacy matters. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California who is the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee said Wednesday she was confident that a bill would be passed and conferenced successfully with the House.

Privacy Group Files F.T.C. Complaint Against Samsung's Voice-Operated TVs,"The Electronic Privacy Information Center has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Samsung over what it says is the recording of private conversations in homes through the company's television sets.   The privacy rights group filed a complaint with the commission on Tuesday accusing Samsung of violating federal laws with a technology that allows viewers to operate the company's Internet-connected smart TVs with voice commands. In the past, EPIC has also complained to the commission about the privacy practices of Google and Facebook. The companies ended up settling their cases with the F.T.C.   The complaint underscores the privacy minefield that technology companies are wading into as they cook up new methods of operating devices with voice commands and other techniques. Samsung's sets allow people to change channels, increase volume and search for recommended programs to watch by using their voices, rather than by pushing buttons on a remote control.  Samsung ignited the debate over its privacy practices this month when it modified the privacy policy for its television sets, adding a sentence that suggested the sets were spying on their users in uncomfortable ways.  ""Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of voice recognition,"" the sentence read.  After an outcry, Samsung said in a blog post that that sentence had ""led to confusion"" and sought to clarify that its voice recognition technology works only after a user pushes an activation button on a television remote control or screen and speaks into a microphone on the remote. Curiously, Samsung has not yet removed the original sentence from its privacy policy.  Adam Yates, a Samsung spokesman, did not respond to requests for comment.  In its complaint, EPIC accused Samsung of violating several laws intended to protect consumer privacy, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which prohibits the interception and disclosure of electronic communications, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which regulates collection of personal information from minors. The group asked the F.T.C. to investigate Samsung, halt its practice of transmitting voice recordings to third parties and examine other companies involved in similar practices.  Many electronics devices, including Apple's iPhone, Amazon's Echo home speaker system and Microsoft's Xbox One, have voice recognition capabilities. Even though Samsung argues that a user must activate voice recognition with a push of a button, that did little to diminish the privacy concerns of Marc Rotenberg, the president and executive director of EPIC. ""Consumers will have no idea what the practical consequence will be of the activating voice recognition,"" Mr. Rotenberg said in an email exchange. ""The key point is that Samsung is not just recording voice commands to operate the TV, as many would expect. The company is capturing all voice communications, including conversations between people in the room."" "
Outdated Encryption Keys Leave Phones Vulnerable,"SAN FRANCISCO --  A government policy that forbade the export of products with strong encryption in the 1990s has years later left users of devices like Android and Apple phones vulnerable to hackers when they visit one-third of all websites, including whitehouse.gov and nsa.gov. Researchers last month discovered millions of devices and websites were using an outdated encryption key to secure their communications. The weak key resulted from a Clinton administration mandate that software and hardware makers use weak cryptography in products exported outside the United States.     Once those restrictions were relaxed in the late 1990s, many technology makers abandoned the weak cryptography. But researchers said this week that the old keys were included in the code that is still being used in a variety of modern devices and websites.   The discovery of the old vulnerability comes as officials in the United States and Britain press the technology industry to create so-called back doors for law enforcement agencies into the new and hard-to-crack encryption used by its products. Those back doors, industry officials argue, can just as well be used by hackers to intercept communications and pose an unnecessary risk to customers.   ''When computer scientists say you can't build a crypto back door without weak encryption for everyone, this is exactly what we're worried about,'' said J. Alex Halderman, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan.   The debate over encryption -- touched off by Edward J. Snowden's disclosures of the nation's efforts to crack and circumvent such protections -- has intensified over the last year as technology companies added stronger security that would lock out government agencies.   The National Security Agency and the F.B.I. have urged tech companies to keep a back door open through their security technology for law enforcement agencies. And David Cameron, the British prime minister, has threatened to outlaw encrypted apps like Facebook's WhatsApp messaging service.   But many tech companies have repeatedly said they have no intentions of changing what they're doing, as Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, signaled in a speech last month at Stanford.   ''If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money -- we risk our way of life,'' Mr. Cook told an audience of White House officials, executives and cybersecurity experts. ''Fortunately, technology gives us the tools to avoid these risks, and it's my sincere hope that by using them and by working together, we will.''   There is no indication that hackers have exploited the newly discovered flaw, and technology companies say they are working to fix the problem.   Apple said on Wednesday it would patch the vulnerability through software updates for its mobile operating system, iOS, and its Macintosh operating system, OS X, next week. Google said it had developed a patch to protect Android connections to websites and provided the patch to Android manufacturers. BlackBerry and Amazon, whose products are also affected by the flaw, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   Researchers are updating a list of vulnerable websites and services on their website, Freakattack.com, and pushing site administrators, device manufacturers and users to upgrade their software. More than a third of the 14 million websites scanned by researchers at the University of Michigan are still vulnerable.   Security researchers are calling the vulnerability Freak -- short for factoring attack on RSA export keys -- because it can be used to crack a 512-bit encryption key in seven hours, using Amazon's readily available cloud computer service, at a nominal cost of $100 per website. A 512-bit key was the strongest allowed for export at the time. Today, that is considered inadequate.   After researchers from Microsoft and Inria, the French computer science lab, discovered the vulnerability last month, Matthew D. Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, warned the researchers that it could be more widespread or dangerous than they had thought.   Soon after, the researchers discovered that roughly 36 percent of online servers were vulnerable. Mr. Green alerted the affected technology companies.   Mr. Green said the vulnerability demonstrated the risk inherent in weakening encryption in order to allow law enforcement agencies access to secured communications.   The flaw is the fourth major -- and old -- security issue to be discovered hidden in a variety of tech products. Critics say that part of the problem is that there are not enough people paid to test and monitor the security of widely used Internet systems. Also, the Internet consists of a lot of moving parts with different people responsible for software, servers, bugs and more -- and they often do not communicate.   ''Nobody was kind of looking down to see how all these different issues fit together,'' Mr. Green said.    "
"In Report on Data Collection Practices, WhatsApp and AT&T Fail the Test","In the post-Snowden era, tech companies are increasingly being rated not only for the quality of their gadgets and services, but also for how they handle government requests for customer data. In the Electronic Frontier Foundation's annual report on data collection practices, tech companies like Yahoo, Apple and Adobe earned top marks, while WhatsApp and AT&T came in last.  The report this week from the E.F.F., a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights, evaluated companies based on factors including their transparency to consumers about data requests and data retention, as well as their public positions on so-called back doors that grant government agencies access to customer data. Apple, Adobe, Yahoo, Dropbox and Sonic.net were among those that scored highly. AT&T and WhatsApp, which earned the lowest marks, with one out of five stars, did not immediately have comments. Verizon Communications, which earned two stars in the report (down from four stars last year when the report had slightly different criteria) declined to comment. The wide-ranging nature of government surveillance programs, many of which have been revealed by documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden,  the former National Security Agency contractor, put pressure on tech companies to be more proactive about sharing their data collection and disclosure practices. Most tech companies have published so-called transparency reports detailing the number of requests they receive from government agencies, while also describing the types of data they collect and share. A number of big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, have urged President Obama to reject policies aiming to weaken encryption technologies that protect Internet communications. The broad conclusion from the E.F.F.'s report is that the tech sector's data practices are broadly improving. When the nonprofit group began publishing the report, called ""Who has your back?"" in 2011, virtually every company on the list had a low score. "
Malware on Clinton Server Prompts Look at Suspected Russian Hacking,"WASHINGTON --  It turns out that Hillary Rodham Clinton's private email account, like seemingly everyone else's in America, was hit by spam sent to try to lure her into clicking on a malicious link -- one that could have compromised the security of her communications when she was secretary of state. But did that put her more at risk than if she had relied solely on the State Department's internal systems? Almost certainly not. After all, in 2014 the unclassified email systems at the State Department and the White House were shut down, often for days at a time, as government security experts tried to erase the damage done by the hackers, suspected to be Russians, probably linked to the government.  It seems virtually certain, investigators say, that the offenders in that case siphoned vast numbers of emails out of both systems.     Still, the evidence that Mrs. Clinton's personal account had been on the receiving end of a ''spear phishing'' attempt, revealed in a batch of her emails released by the State Department on Wednesday, raises the same question the F.B.I. is trying to answer as it combs through the forensic evidence from the server that was once in Mrs. Clinton's basement.   And that is whether the attackers who successfully got into the unclassified systems at the State Department and the White House also got into Mrs. Clinton's. She would have been a natural target for a state-sponsored cyberattack by adversaries who have made clear their determination to learn as much as they can about the inner workings of the United States government. And the possible vulnerability of her home-based system remains a central mystery in the investigations.   ''It would stand to reason,'' one person involved in the investigation said recently, ''that anyone who had planted malware in the State Department system would have seen a very high-level official talking to other high-level officials, and followed the trail.'' But, the person added, ''we don't know that happened.''    The person spoke on the condition of anonymity so as to not be identified discussing a continuing investigation.   Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said there was no evidence that the system had ever been breached. ''All these emails show is that, like millions of other Americans, she received spam,'' he said.   There is also no evidence that the spammers who targeted her knew that it was the secretary of state at the other end of the attack. The fact that it was sent four times to her account over a period of hours suggests it was sent by an automated system.   Some experts disagree. Justin Harvey, the chief security officer of Fidelis Cybersecurity, said in an interview that ''the chances are still quite high that it was humanly targeted.'' In such an attack, the spam probably would have been sent first to her aides, in hopes of getting to her account.   But if Mrs. Clinton's system was successfully pierced -- perhaps in some other attack -- Mrs. Clinton might well not have known it, either. Other email accounts, including one for her husband, Bill, the former president, resided on the same server in their basement of their home in Chappaqua, N.Y. No one has yet explained what kind of monitoring systems were on that server, if any.   Eric H. Holder Jr., the previous attorney general, often said, ''There are two kinds of companies in America: those who know they have been the subject of cyberattacks, and those who don't know they have been the subject of cyberattacks.'' That dictum seems to apply to the State Department as well.   It took officials there weeks or months to catch on to the attack, officials said this year. That is a pretty good record compared with the Office of Personnel Management, who did not know for more than a year that security dossiers on roughly 22 million Americans, and millions of fingerprints, had been secretly transmitted to servers in China.   If Mrs. Clinton felt safer on her own system than on the State Department's, she was hardly alone. One of Mrs. Clinton's top policy aides, Anne-Marie Slaughter, noted in another email released Wednesday that ''State's technology is so antiquated that NO ONE uses a State-issued laptop, and even high officials routinely end up using their home email accounts to be able to get their work done quickly and effectively.''   What was true in 2011 remains true today. The State Department on Thursday confirmed a report in The Boston Globe that Secretary of State John Kerry had occasionally received work related emails on a personal account.   ''This is an acknowledgment of the reality that Secretary Kerry has decades-old friendships, and those friends have emailed him on a personal account for years,'' said John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department. Mr. Kerry has taken several steps to ensure that he complied with federal record-keeping rules, the State Department said, adding that it has a process in place to review Mr. Kerry's personal emails to make sure they are forwarded to his work account and backed up on a federal record-keeping system.   The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Thursday that he was certain the bureau would be able to complete the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's personal email account in a timely manner and that he would make sure politics did not interfere with it.   ''I am following this very closely, and I get briefed on it regularly,'' Mr. Comey told reporters at F.B.I. headquarters.   The F.B.I. opened its investigation into how classified materials were handled in connection with Mrs. Clinton's account in response to a referral from the inspector general for the intelligence community after sensitive national security information was found on the account. It is illegal to have classified information on an unsecure network.   Mr. Comey declined to discuss the specifics of the inquiry, but said that one of the reasons he has a 10-year term as director was ''to make sure this organization stays outside of politics.''

Why a Back Door to the Internet Is a Bad Idea,"In recent months top American and British political leaders have been arguing that there should be no encrypted communication system that they cannot unlock whenever they deem it necessary to do so. Officials like the director of the National Security Agency, Michael Rogers, and Prime Minister David Cameron have said that unless technology companies grant them the technical equivalent of a back door to snoop on encrypted communications, the world's bad guys will ""go dark"" and become untraceable.  Now, 13 prominent encryption and information security experts have responded with an important report that explains in plain English why what Mr. Rogers and Mr. Cameron are asking for would be terrible for the Internet. To start, giving governments back-door access to encrypted technologies like email servers, video chats, online banking services and so on would make those systems much more vulnerable to hacking. Furthermore, giving encryption keys to governments would increase the risk of those keys being stolen by criminals and spies from other countries. There is yet another big problem: How should technology companies decide which governments they should give back-door access to? If the United States and Britain have access to, say, all of Google's encrypted servers, the governments of China, Russia and many other nations will surely demand similar privileges. Or should Western tech companies simply stop doing business in some foreign countries? This is hardly a new debate. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration proposed requiring the tech industry to use the Clipper chip, a device that would help the government decrypt communications. Businesses, technical experts and civil liberties groups defeated that effort by showing that hackers and criminals could easily exploit that system. Not having such an invasive back door into Internet-based communications systems has hardly hurt the government's ability to conduct surveillance. In fact, Edward Snowden revealed that American and British agencies have had extensive access to our communications for years. If anybody has been kept in the dark, it is ordinary citizens. "
LastPass Password Manager Acknowledges Breach,"LastPass, the online password manager, announced Monday in a blog post that its network was breached and that hackers made off with user email addresses, password reminders and encrypted master passwords.  Within the security community, password managers have long been controversial. Some say online password managers help everyday users become more secure than they would otherwise, because it makes it easier to set up complex different passwords for different accounts without having to remember them all. Others have been wary of password managers like LastPass because if the password manager gets breached, hackers can potentially unlock all the accounts managed through the service.  Joe Siegrist, the LastPass chief executive, said the company discovered the breach on Friday after detecting suspicious activity on its network. The company said that it found no evidence that LastPass user accounts were compromised, or that hackers were able to get users' master passwords, or passwords encrypted with that user password. But the data hackers did access - including email addresses and password reminders - is still troubling, security experts note, in that often all hackers need to unlock an email account is an email as a username plus a password reminder. Tod Beardsley, a security engineering manager at Rapid7, said that the attack gave hackers a list of LastPass user email addresses that they could target in so-called phishing attacks, in which they send victims emails with links that try to trick users into revealing more data, like a fake ""Update your LastPass master password"" email, that can be used to crack their accounts. LastPass said it would be resetting users master passwords, and advised users to turn on multifactor authentication, an added security measure which requires a second one-time password, often sent to users via text message, anytime they log in to their accounts from an unrecognized machine. The company said it was confident that its encryption measures would be enough to protect the vast majority of its users. LastPass strengthens the keys needed to unlock master passwords by forcing them to go through a large number of complicated iterations. The company appends random digits to the key, then encrypts it more than 100,000 times, which makes it difficult to break stolen hashes with password cracking tools. The attack was the second breach notification from LastPass. The first incident happened four years ago. The latest attempt to access the company's passwords was discovered on Friday, but a picture posted to Imgur, the image sharing site, of a Google security warning suggests that hackers may have found a way inside the service as long as three weeks ago.

Network Security Start-Up Illumio Raises $100 Million,"SAN FRANCISCO -- In its quest to create a platform for networking security, the start-up Illumio has drawn a number of prominent backers. The company said on Tuesday that it had raised $100 million in new financing, its third round in two years. The investment included both BlackRock and Accel Partners as new investors, joining three existing investors, Formation 8, Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst.     Individual investors in the round included John W. Thompson, the chairman of Microsoft; Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com; and Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo.   The new financing -- more than double what Illumio had raised in its previous rounds -- brings the company's fund-raising total to $142.5 million. It's a fast beginning for the start-up, which focuses on providing a particular kind of security: protection for data centers and cloud services.   The company's approach is what it calls an adaptive security platform, regulating individual workloads or applications rather than relying on a system like a firewall that only serves as a general defense against outside threats.   ''We wanted to try to build the security platform that solves for the problems of today's world,'' Andrew Rubin, a co-founder and the company's chief executive, told DealBook in an interview.   Alan S. Cohen, Illumio's chief commercial officer, added that the company's software also provided clients with a picture of what's going on within their data center or cloud service, comparing the service to an M.R.I. machine.   ''It's not about writing a security policy or enforcing traffic rules,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''It's using that M.R.I. machine to draw a picture of your infrastructure. We can build that picture for you and put it up on the screen.''   And, the two said, the company's products require far less setup and monitoring time, running in the background.   ''One thing we've heard consistently from customers is, 'We want our security software to get out of the way,''' Mr. Rubin said.   Also on Tuesday, Illumio is announcing a partnership with F5 Networks, a big networking company.   Illumio emerged from stealth mode only last fall, with a number of prominent clients like Morgan Stanley and the talent agency Creative Artists Agency. Since then, its executives said, it has grown in popularity as word has spread about its services.   Mr. Rubin said that with the success that the company has seen, it seemed the right time late last year to raise money to embark on a more ambitious growth campaign, even if it didn't quite need additional money. He declined to offer specific financial performance statistics.   With the new money, Illumio plans to spend more on research and development, marketing and raising awareness of its brand -- especially at the RSA security conference that begins next week -- and expanding its worldwide presence, particularly in Europe and Asia.

Hotspot Shield Creator Is on a Mission to Outflank the Censors,"Growing up in Moscow, David Gorodyansky listened to his grandfather tell stories about fighting the Nazis during World War II. His grandfather was an aerial photographer who flew sorties to take pictures of enemy targets, then returned to bomb them. To Mr. Gorodyansky, he was a hero. ""I grew up thinking, what am I going to do to save the world or impact a billion people, like he did?"" said Mr. Gorodyansky, chief executive of AnchorFree, an online security company in Menlo Park, Calif.  Mr. Gorodyansky may now be getting closer to that goal with Hotspot Shield, one of AnchorFree's technologies. Hotspot Shield, an app that creates a virtual private network, allows users to hide their Internet protocol addresses, adding another layer of privacy and security to web browsing. That makes it more difficult for censors to block access to specific websites, including Facebook and Twitter. It also gives users more anonymity and security, reducing the amount of data that censors and hackers can easily collect. Hotspot Shield has been used to protect online communications against repressive regimes, including during times of major political upheaval like the Arab Spring. Today, AnchorFree's products are on 350 million devices, and the company has 30 million monthly active users. Users are also being drawn to the service for more than political reasons. The app is being adopted in corporate environments to improve security. Business travelers and expatriates, for instance, are using it to gain access to sites like Netflix when they are overseas. Efe Oztekin, an industrial engineer living in Colorado, looks to Hotspot Shield to provide security when he is using public Wi-Fi networks . Mr. Oztekin, who is from Turkey, said he also used the app when he recently went to visit his family. Even though he normally would not be able to log into his Netflix account in Turkey, he was able to watch episodes of ""Orange Is the New Black"" using Hotspot Shield. Mr. Gorodyansky, 33, took a circuitous route to creating Hotspot Shield. When he was 9, his parents moved the family from Russia to Silicon Valley, where they worked as computer engineers. He went to the local high school, and then to San Jose State University, but did not show any affinity for programming.  Instead, he found a way to make a quick buck off the bursting dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. With his friend Eugene Malobrodsky, Mr. Gorodyansky founded Intelligent Buying, a company that bought computer equipment from tech companies that were shutting down and resold it to start-ups looking for deals. But while Intelligent Buying was humming along, bringing in more than $1 million in revenue its first year, Mr. Gorodyansky was not fulfilled. In 2004, his girlfriend at the time took Mr. Gorodyansky to hear Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning micro­finance pioneer, speak in Berkeley, Calif. Inspired, Mr. Gorodyansky once again began dreaming big. ""The next thing we're going to do, the promise has to be helping one billion people,"" he said he told himself. Believing that access to the Internet could improve lives, Mr. Gorodyansky and Mr. Malobrodsky created AnchorFree, a company that would offer free Wi-Fi hot spots. They blanketed downtown Palo Alto, Calif., and had five neighborhoods in San Francisco covered. The company raised more than $6 million from investors including Bert C. Roberts Jr., a former media executive, and Esther Dyson, a prolific investor. But in 2005, the free Wi-Fi hot spot idea was not lucrative. Revenue from advertising hosted on the service was modest. And Mr. Gorodyansky was still living at his parents' house. At the same time, AnchorFree introduced Hotspot Shield. By 2008, AnchorFree had made a classic Silicon Valley pivot. The main product - free Wi-Fi - had become a commodity. But that other feature, Hotspot Shield, was becoming a hit. As political unrest began to spread through the Middle East in 2010, Mr. Gorodyansky and his colleagues began to notice an increase in traffic from countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Soon it became clear that Internet users were using Hotspot Shield to evade censors. ""It allows the world that had been closed to open up,"" said Ms. Dyson, who remains an adviser to AnchorFree. ""And it's transformed from something about how we could make money into something with more of a social conscience."" The company soon bought a banner ad on a popular forum being used by pro-democracy activists in the region. In a matter of days, Hotspot Shield had several hundred thousand more downloads. ""Without knowing it, we were sitting on the billion-person idea,"" Mr. Gorodyansky said. Emboldened by success overseas, AnchorFree raised an additional $5 million in 2008. Hotspot Shield, which is free to download but charges for enhanced services, soon helped the company become profitable. In 2012, Goldman Sachs invested $52 million in AnchorFree. After Egypt began restricting access to social media in 2011, Egyptians downloaded Hotspot Shield one million times in a single day. Today, AnchorFree said, Hotspot Shield is installed on a quarter of all computers and smartphones in the Middle East, and it is growing in other regions. Yet AnchorFree has treaded carefully in certain places. It has not made a big push into China. ""We try not to kick the bear,"" Mr. Gorodyansky said. Still, as governments crack down, new markets open up. Last year, Turkey blocked access to Twitter. Within 24 hours, Hotspot Shield was the most popular app in the country, and within 72 hours, it had two million users there.

8 Indicted in ID Thefts of Patients at Hospital,"A Montefiore Medical Center employee and seven others were indicted on Friday on charges of stealing the personal information of as many as 12,000 hospital patients and using it to make purchases at luxury stores, the Manhattan district attorney said.  Officials said Monique Walker, 32, an assistant clerk at the hospital, allegedly stole personal information, including names, birth dates and Social Security numbers, from thousands of patients. She printed patients' records on a near daily basis between 2012 and 2013, the authorities said, and then sold them to one of her co-defendants for as little as $3 each.    ''In case after case, we've seen how theft by a single company insider, who is often working with identity thieves on the outside, can rapidly victimize a business and thousands of its customers,'' the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement. ''Motivated by greed, profit and a complete disregard for their victims, identity thieves often feed stolen information to larger criminal operations, which then go on to defraud additional businesses and victims.''   The authorities said that Ms. Walker's co-defendants used stolen information she provided to go on shopping sprees in Manhattan, making purchases at stores that included Barneys New York, Macy's, Victoria's Secret, Bergdorf Goodman and Lord & Taylor. The purchases were worth at least $50,000, prosecutors said, and were made with store credit and gift cards.   Ms. Walker and the others were indicted on charges that included grand larceny, identity theft and criminal possession of a forged instrument.   According to the indictment, Fernando Salazar, 28, was the ring leader of the identity theft operation, buying the information from Ms. Walker and supplying it to the others.   Susan Green-Lorenzen, a senior vice president at Montefiore, said the hospital was cooperating fully with law enforcement and that it would ''not tolerate any violation of our patients' privacy.''   ''At Montefiore all employees are thoroughly screened for criminal backgrounds, provided extensive training to protect patient privacy, and must adhere to a strict code of conduct,'' Ms. Green-Lorenzen added. ''The employee who was arrested in connection to this violation egregiously and criminally chose to violate established hospital policies, the trust of our patients and the law.''   Lisa McKenzie, a spokeswoman for Montefiore, said the hospital had identified all 12,000 patients whose personal information had been compromised and was notifying them of the breach by mail on Friday.    No Montefiore employees were affected by the breach, she said.   The hospital will also provide affected patients with various identity protection measures, Ms. McKenzie said, including one year of credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance policy and identity recovery services if their identity was compromised.

Database of Personal Information From Voter Records Appears Online,"First and last names. Recent addresses and phone numbers. Party affiliation. Voting history and demographics. A database of this information from 191 million voter records was posted online over the last week, the latest example of voter data becoming freely available, alarming privacy experts who say the information can be used for phishing attacks, identity theft and extortion. The information is no longer publicly accessible.     It is not known who built the database, where all the data came from, and whether its disclosure resulted from an inadvertent release or from hacks. The disclosure was discovered by an information technology specialist, Chris Vickery, and the findings were published on databreaches.net. The federal authorities were alerted to possible concerns about security and the legality of what was done.    NationBuilder, a nonpartisan political data firm, has said it may have been the source of some of the data, although the actual database that was released was not the company's.    ''The reality is there's a tremendous amount of data that's freely available,'' said Craig Spiezle, the executive director of the Online Trust Alliance. ''For candidates, it's what doors to knock on. For cybercriminals, it's identifying a higher network of targets.''   Indeed, nearly all of the data that was released was already publicly available. But having it compiled in one place makes it particularly valuable.   As a result of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, state governments are each required to maintain a single, ''interactive computerized'' voter registration list with ''name and registration information.'' It leaves what that ''registration information'' consists of to the discretion of the states. But as big data increasingly plays a large role in politics and business, the presence of the publicly available information raises questions of privacy and security. Some ask whether states have gone too far in making such data available.   Big data advocates argue that what is in most voter files is nothing more than the White Pages of a phone book augmented with party affiliation and voting history (not which candidate people voted for, but whether they voted.) But for privacy experts, that alone, especially when compiled in one place, is cause for concern.   ''Simply by digitizing the data, collecting it in one place, making it freely available in one place -- it's a Christmas gift for thieves,'' said Neal O'Farrell, the executive director of the Identity Theft Council. ''I interviewed an identity thief, and he said credit card numbers are for chumps. It's much easier to get caught. The cybercriminals really want to know who you are. And voter information and any kind of information that fills in all the blanks makes it easier for phishing, for social engineering, and for extortion.''   Access to data is, of course, a necessity for modern campaigns. Voter databases vary from state to state -- there is no federal agency overseeing voter data or registration -- making it a messy field to navigate. It is this discombobulated system that makes companies like NationBuilder and NGP VAN, a software company that manages such data for Democrats, invaluable to campaigns.   ''From our perspective, it is extremely important for campaigns to be able to know who can vote for them, and be able to do legitimate outreach and engagement,'' said Jim Gilliam, the founder and chief executive of NationBuilder. ''That's the point of the democratic process: that you can talk to voters.''   But even without the streamlined databases of NationBuilder, such voter data is publicly available on a state-by-state basis.   For example, in Pennsylvania, it costs $20 to download the whole voter file -- which includes names, addresses, birth dates, gender and party -- in a spreadsheet format. North Carolina offers free access to an online database of voters. Wisconsin makes its voter file available online, with privacy restrictions that leave out such information as dates of birth and Social Security numbers, and it charges $25, and $5 per 1,000 voter records.   Each state also has a varying set of rules and verification requirements to try to ensure the data is used solely for a political purpose. Anyone can search North Carolina's free online voter database, for example, but in New Hampshire, people have to verify they are with a political party or committee before purchasing the voter file from the secretary of state. Many states and jurisdictions, from Alaska to the District of Columbia to Florida, allow for ''unrestricted'' use of the data, according to a database kept by NationBuilder.   Such wide availability has many security experts concerned. ''It's not the individual pixels, but the mosaic,'' Mr. Spiezle said.   The digitization of many of these voter files in recent years has opened the door for more data breaches. Just in the past year, there have been some major disclosures of information.   More than six million voters in Georgia had their voting information and Social Security numbers exposed in a breach back in October. And in Florida, personal voter information about an undisclosed number of ''high-risk professionals'' such as judges and law enforcement officials was mistakenly released in April.   Those disclosures were just the results of human error. But many campaigns, especially at the presidential level, have been the target of hacking attacks. In 2008, Barack Obama's campaign and Senator John McCain's campaign were reported to have been hacked by the Chinese government. In 2012, the Obama and Mitt Romney campaigns were subjected to repeated hacking attempts, sometimes as often as four to five times a week.   Because of this threat, some campaigns have been taking steps to make sure their data and infrastructure are secure. Hillary Clinton's campaign has a team of engineers and others continually monitoring for potential attacks, and Gov. Scott Walker's now-defunct campaign hired people to monitor and prevent threats.   Even with aggressive efforts to secure proprietary data, accidental breaches can happen, as evidenced by the recent flare-up after a member of the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders viewed and saved information from the Clinton campaign's confidential voter file that was held by the Democratic National Committee.   That data may have been of real use only to the Sanders campaign; had it fallen into the hands of a hacker or activist group, it would have essentially the same worth as the publicly available data. But many security experts cite it as yet another example, along with the publication of the 191 million voter records, that states are not taking the security of voter data seriously enough.   ''No one wants to go through a phone book trying to build up profiles of individuals,'' Mr. O'Farrell said. ''These collections of massive amounts of user-specific and very personal data just make it easier. And the easier the crime, the more profitable it becomes.''

Parents Challenge President to Dig Deeper on Ed Tech,"Education technology companies that have pledged not to exploit student data they collect for marketing purposes welcomed President Obama's endorsement on Monday of the industry's effort to limit its use of classroom data. But the president's comments did nothing to alleviate the unease of some parents concerned about potential civil rights issues raised by the increasing use of ed tech in schools, including the possibility that some programs and products might automatically channel or categorize studentsin ways that could ultimately be discriminatory or detrimental to their education. In a speech on Monday afternoon at the Federal Trade Commission, the president announced new student digital privacy legislation. The proposed bill would be modeled on a student data privacy law passed by California last summer. The California statute prohibits companies that work with schools from using the information they collect about kindergartners through 12th graders for marketing or advertising purposes.   It is unclear whether the proposed legislation would make it through Congress. So in addition to pushing for a new law, Mr. Obama has urged ed tech companies to sign on to a voluntary industry pledge on student privacy in which the signers agree not to sell personal details they have collected about students; not to profile students for noneducational purposes; and not to use students' details collected through educational services to tailor ads to them.  ""We're very excited that President Obama is endorsing the pledge and calling for other companies to sign it,"" said Jules Polonetsky, the executive director ofthe Future of Privacy Forum, an industry-financed research group in Washington that helped draft the industry pledge. Mr. Polonetsky's group has received financing from dozens of companies including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.  Introduced last October, the pledge has now been adopted by 75 companies including original signers like Microsoft and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the educational publisher.  Apple signed last weekend on the eve of the president's speech.  Although Google has its own privacy policy, the company, whose Google Apps for Education software is used in schools nationwide, has not joined the industry initiative. Mr. Obama's focus on student digital privacy comes at a time when schools across the country are increasingly adopting data-driven learning products - from homework portals to math apps - that can quantify and analyze everything from the time it takes students to complete an assignment to the number of times they incorrectly answer long division problems to the length of comments they post in online classroom discussion forums. The idea behind these ed tech products is to use data analysis to tailor lessons to the needs of each child. But some parents, educators, technologists and education privacy law scholars say there is little evidence to back up the marketing hype over personalized learning technology. While welcoming efforts to curb the use of educational data for advertising purposes, they contend that neither the industry pledge nor the California law that President Obama invoked as a model for federal student digital privacy legislation places any meaningful requirements on companies regarding the accuracy, efficacy or fairness of their novel digital learning products. ""We may be serving some kids well, but we may be disserving other kids in a significant way,"" said Joel Reidenberg, a professor at Fordham University School of Law in Manhattan who is an expert in education privacy law.  Parents concerned about these kinds of fairness issues said they would like to see Mr. Obama push for legislation requiring companies to directly provide parents with comprehensive lists of the details they are collecting about students; to disclose how they use those details to categorize or rank students; and to describe the different treatment students might receive based on those rankings or categorizations. (Companies that sign on to the industry pledge agree to include information in their contracts or privacy policies about the kinds of personal data they collect about students and the purposes for which they use that data.) ""Even if the law is passed, parents would still not know which vendors have their kids' data and what they are doing with it,"" said Rachael Stickland, a mother of two in Littleton, Colo., who is a co-chairwoman of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy. ""There's this veil of secrecy. Parents would really appreciate that opportunity to know what is going on."" "
Venmo Was Ordered in July by California Regulators to Address Security Issues,"Venmo, the popular mobile payments app, is one of eBay's secret weapons. The app, which allows users to quickly send cash directly to friends' bank accounts, is popular with young audiences, a demographic eBay desperately wishes to court.  But critics have said that Venmo has long taken a lackadaisical approach to users' security, and that it seems to have made little effort to improve it. An article in Slate on Thursday explained weaknesses in the company's basic security features and an inability to notify users if an account had been compromised. Back in July, though, Venmo was ordered by California regulators to establish companywide best practices and programs around user privacy, security, customer service and fraud loss management. The order, issued by Jan Lynn Owen, commissioner of the California Department of Business Oversight, required that Venmo respond to more than 20 ""unsafe practices,"" including what Ms. Owen cited as a lack of a ""formal consumer assistance policy"" and a complete absence of a ""compliance system for active suspicious activity monitoring."" The order, dated July 17, 2014, also requested that Venmo ""establish vital company policies"" around such areas as ""consumer privacy (including California Information Privacy Act), information technology, operations, internal controls and ACH and fraud loss management,"" the document said. Mrs. Owen requested that Venmo respond within 60 days of the order's issuance. [#x200b]A Venmo spokeswoman said all of the items in the order had been ""remediated."" The California Department of Business Oversight, however, characterized the compliance process as continuing. ""We're continuing to work with Venmo to obtain full compliance with the order,"" said Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for the department. A post aimed at the company's users by Michael Vaughan, Venmo's general manager, on the company's blog on Friday detailed ""the things we do to help keep you secure,"" adding that ""I want to assure you we are continuously improving product and security measures."" The security issues are a black eye for the otherwise successful young arm of eBay's powerful payments division. The company, which started as a online auctions company, is in the middle of a major restructuring. PayPal - the huge payments arm of eBay that owns Venmo and Braintree, another payments technology company - will be spun off from the online auctions giant later in 2015. Though Venmo does not bring in revenue, the company has been described as eBay's powerful connection to young customers. ""If you go to any college campus across America, they talk about Venmo-ing money to each other,"" John Donahoe, chief executive of eBay, said on the company's recent earnings call. Criticisms regarding security are a particularly important area for Venmo, which encourages users to connect the app directly to their bank accounts. Security is also a sore spot for eBay, which in May disclosed it was the victim of a security breach that exposed the personal data of 145 million of its customers. "
Franchising a Student Digital Privacy Law,"As a reporter who covers tech industry data-mining practices, I've received my fair share of there-oughta-be-a-law-against-that calls and emails from outraged readers. So naturally I was skeptical when James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a children's advocacy and media ratings group in San Francisco, called me in the fall of 2013 to announce that he was going to have a law passed in California to restrict how education technology companies use student data. At the time, I had just written an article on inBloom, a student data repository  that wanted to streamline how schools collected and used students' information. The nonprofit corporation had received $100 million in seed money from prominent backers: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation along with the Carnegie Corporation of New York.   But some parents vehemently objected, contending that inBloom could potentially enable third-party developers to profit from their children's records or exploit students' personal details to market to them. That was when Mr. Steyer called. He was not just worried about possible commercial exploitation of student data, he said. He also foresaw that parents' mounting privacy concerns could scuttle the adoption of education technology in schools - a cause he and his group have championed. ""I said, 'Holy Toledo, this is a mess waiting to happen,' "" Mr. Steyer recalled last week during a conversation in Washington. ""I said, 'There's a huge issue around student data and student privacy. We'll draft a law.' "" And so it came to pass.  Last September, Gov. Jerry Brown signedthe bill - titled the Student Online Personal Information Protection Act - that Mr. Steyer originally envisioned. Now, as I wrote in a profile of Mr. Steyer published Monday, Common Sense Media is planning a more ambitious national effort that  includes promulgating student privacy laws this year in about a dozen states, among them New Hampshire. The strategy his group used in California provides a window into its coming campaign. Mr. Steyer is a prolific networker who travels in social circles that include high-level legislators, government regulators and executives. He is directly connected to the chief executives of major telecommunications and media companies, as many of those companies pay licensing fees to distribute Common Sense Media's reviews of children's movies, videos and games. In addition, Mr. Steyer's brother, Thomas F. Steyer, is a hedge-fund billionaire, environmental philanthropist and major donor to Democratic campaigns.  So Mr. Steyer took his case for a student privacy bill directly to Darrell Steinberg, at the time the president pro tempore of the California Senate.  ""I knew he was the second most powerful guy in California,"" Mr. Steyer said, explaining his thinking at the time. Besides, the two had already worked together on a law in California that requires websites to allow minors to delete content they posted online.  Now Mr. Steinberg worked on enlisting his fellow legislators on the student privacy bill while Mr. Steyer met with tech and telecommunications industry executives. ""He was Mr. Outside and I was Mr. Inside,"" Mr. Steinberg said in a recent phone interview.  Their message was simple, Mr. Steinberg said: ""Education technology has remarkable potential to help all kids, but they should not have to worry that their personal information is being used for purposes unrelated to their schooling."" The California law that resulted from their efforts restricts how ed tech companies can use information about students from kindergarten through 12th grade. But it did not go far enough to satisfy some parents.  When it takes effect in January 2016, the law will prohibit online services that contract with schools from using students' personal information for marketing, from compiling student profiles or from using students' details for other nonschool purposes.  But some parents complained that the law did not prohibit companies from using the information they collected from students' data to improve their own educational products; nor did it give parents and students the right to sue if companies improperly exploited or failed to safeguard students' information, causing harm. This week, Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican, are expected to introduce a federal student digital privacy bill, modeled in part on the California statute. "
Legislators Introduce Student Digital Privacy Bill,"Months after President Obama proposed to strengthen digital privacy protection for students, two legislators on Wednesday introduced a comprehensive bill in Congress intended to accomplish that goal. Titled the Student Digital Privacy and Parental Rights Act of 2015, the bill would prohibit operators of websites, apps and other online services for kindergartners through 12th graders from knowingly selling students' personal information to third parties; from using or disclosing students' personal information to tailor advertising to them; and from creating personal profiles of students unless it is for a school-related purpose.   The bill would give parents access to information held about their children and allow them to correct it; to delete information about their children that schools do not need to retain; and to download any material their children have created. It would allow operators of services to use and disclose aggregated student information without personal identifiers to improve their own educational products or market their effectiveness.  And it would allow companies to sell or disclose student information as part of a merger or acquisition, provided the successor company continued to be subject to the restrictions under which the data was originally collected. The bill, modeled in part on a new student online privacy law in California, was introduced by Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican.  In a telephone conference with reporters Wednesday morning, Mr. Polis said the bill provided a framework to address the privacy concerns of parents and educators ""while at the same time allowing for the promise of education technology to transform our schools."" Despite the bipartisan sponsorship, the bill may be unlikely to pass in a Republican-dominated Congress. The student digital privacy bill comes at a time of widespread government and industry enthusiasm for education technology - along with mounting concerns that many school districts may be ill-prepared to evaluate and adopt digital learning products.  The Department of Education, for instance, this month issued a primer for ed tech start-ups in part because many developers have been rolling out their educational apps in classrooms without conducting rigorous studies beforehand to find out whether the products are effective.  The chief technology officers of some leading school districts also recently pointed out the challenges they face in managing hundreds of different learning apps that teachers want to use in their classrooms.  Officials at the Los Angeles Unified School District are reportedly seeking a refund of millions of dollars from Apple and other companies after an ambitious project to provide students there with iPads, which came preloaded with educational software, went awry, according to an article last week in The Los Angeles Times. The student privacy bill is not intended to address these deeper concerns arising from the proliferation of educational technologies in schools. But if enacted, it would moot some concerns about the potential commercial exploitation of students' information. Supporters of the bill include the American Federation of Teachers; the National PTA; the School Superintendents Association; and the State Educational Technology Directors Association. So far, the only tech industry company officially supporting the bill is Microsoft. "
European Cloud Companies Play Up Privacy Credentials,"LONDON - James Kinsella is an unlikely champion for European technology.  The 55-year-old American is a former Microsoft executive who previously ran MSNBC.com, the news website. Yet Mr. Kinsella, who has spent the last 15 years in Europe, is now backing Europe's efforts to enforce its tough data privacy rules across the region - and potentially further afield. On Wednesday, Mr. Kinsella and his American co-founder, Robert McNeal, will unveil their latest start-up called Zettabox, a cloud computing service that will take on the likes of Google, Dropbox and Microsoft to offer people and companies the ability to access documents, video files and photos from anywhere in the world.  To compete with much larger American rivals, the start-up, with 25 employees divided between London and Prague, is playing up its European roots and people's growing appetite for greater online privacy. The company says that it will only store people's data within Europe, where privacy laws are more stringent than those in the United States. It also will allow individuals and companies to retain information in data centers in specific European countries, so that they can comply with tough domestic rules that often restrict what type of data can be stored internationally. ""Europe needs a European service,"" Mr. Kinsella said. ""Europeans have no say over where their data is held by American companies. We're offering an alternative to that."" Zettabox, which has received less than $10 million in private financing from Mr. Kinsella and Mr. McNeal, is one of a growing number of European cloud computing providers trying to take on American competitors by playing up their privacy credentials. Across the continent, start-ups, telecom operators and other tech companies are promoting their own cloud computing services by highlighting how they comply with Europe's tough data protection rules compared to United States counterparts.  [#x2028]Those differences are only expected to grow when the European Union completes long-awaited privacy reforms by the end of the year. Under the new legislation, international companies with European customers - even if they do not have offices in the region - will have to comply with the region's tough data controls or face fines of up to 5 percent of their global revenue, or $112 million, whichever is greater, if they flaunt the new rules. The privacy reforms, which are currently being negotiated between European policy makers, also will give the region's 500 million residents a much more vocal say of what type of data companies collect on them, how that information is stored, and for how long companies can hold onto that data. And the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is promoting a European cloud computing program as part of its recently-released digital single market reforms to boost the region's fledgling industry that has so far failed to compete with the United States. ""There are growing concerns about data privacy for our European clients,"" said Phillipp Strube, a co-founder of CloudControl, a cloud computing provider in Berlin, which generates almost three-quarters of its revenue from the 28-member bloc. ""Being based in Germany is an advantage for us."" Despite European companies' ambitions, they face an uphill battle to compete with the deep pockets and tech savvy of the likes of Amazon and Google. As Europe's policy makers push for greater privacy rules, many of these American companies have opened new data centers in Europe in a bid to placate local customers' fears over how they data is handled. That includes Amazon, whose cloud computing unit last year opened a facility near Frankfurt, Germany, where local rules demand that citizens' personal data must be stored locally. But in a sign that American companies may yet struggle to comply with Europe's tough data protection rules, Microsoft is facing a bitter legal battle with the U.S. government over data held in one of the company's data centers in Ireland. American judges have ordered Microsoft to comply with a domestic search warrant that demanded the company hand over data stored at its Irish facility.  In response, Microsoft has argued federal prosecutors cannot seize the data in Ireland because United States law does not apply there, even though Microsoft controls everything in its data center there. A ruling in the case is expected potentially by late summer.  Other American tech companies, including Apple, Amazon and Verizon, are following the case closely. Many fear that if the United States government successfully uses a domestic search warrant to access data held overseas, companies' international clients - which now represent the lion's share of their customers - will start looking for non-American services that offer higher levels of data protection. "
Irish Regulator Says Country Will Stay at Center of Online Privacy Debate,"For many American tech companies, Ireland has often been the first port of call when expanding overseas. The country's corporate tax rate - one of the lowest in the European Union - has led the likes of Facebook, Twitter and Apple to establish their international headquarters in a country smaller than Indiana. Ireland's oversize role in the tech world also has extended to the growing debate about how companies use the reams of online data that they regularly collect on individuals' online habits and activities.  As home to many tech companies' non-American headquarters, Ireland and its data protection watchdog are responsible for overseeing how the data from the combined hundreds of millions of users of Facebook and Twitter is protected. That role has become increasingly contentious after a number of other European regulators opened their own privacy investigations into some of the data practices of American tech companies. Many of those authorities have been eager to take a tough line on what type of information tech companies can collect on their users. And some have criticized the Irish regulator for taking a somewhat lax approach to policing the companies that fall under its jurisdiction. Yet Helen Dixon, Ireland's privacy chief, says the country's central role in Europe's tough data protection rules is unlikely to change. ""Ireland will be the leading regulator when dealing with U.S. tech companies,"" Ms. Dixon said. ""We want to work actively with other regulators. But we will be the lead."" Her comments come as the Irish data protection regulator published its annual report on Tuesday outlining the watchdog's activities for 2014. As people's interest increases over how their online data is collected and used, the authority's annual budget has almost doubled this year, to $4.1 million, and its staff expanded 70 percent, to 49 regulators. Still, the Irish regulator's financial resources pale in comparison with those of its American counterparts, which have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal to ensure that tech companies comply with domestic legislation. To ensure that American tech companies play by Europe's privacy rules, the Irish regulator is expected to conduct data protection audits of Adobe, Yahoo and Apple, among others, this year. The investigations, which do not imply any wrongdoing by the companies, are part of the regulator's efforts to enforce Europe's data rules. ""We are responsible for millions of users,"" Ms. Dixon said. ""The companies accept pushback from us. They want to be compliant."" These regular audits come as the region finalizes a series of reforms that will give Europeans greater control over how their online information is used. They also may lead to fines of $1.1 million or 2 percent of global revenue, whichever is greater, according to the latest proposals. Still, some policy makers remain unconvinced that a country that relies heavily on tax receipts from tech companies can properly curtail their use of people's online information. A lawsuit has been filed with Europe's top court because an Austrian law student was not satisfied with how the Irish authorities dealt with his concerns about Facebook. And others have questioned why a company like Facebook would choose to put itself under Ireland's supervision when the majority of its international users are elsewhere. ""Of course Facebook would go to a country with the lowest levels of data protection,"" said Peter Schaar, a former federal data protection commissioner in Germany. ""It's natural they would choose Ireland."" "
Protecting Yourself From the Consequences of Anthem's Data Breach,"Given the steady beat of security breaches, consumers may assume that a cybercriminal already has at least some of their personal information. But in the latest intrusion, at the health insurer Anthem, hackers got their hands on an especially valuable collection of sensitive information on millions of people. Anthem, which offers several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country, said the database that was breached included names, Social Security numbers, birthdays, addresses, email and employment information for as many as 80 million people, including some of its own employees.     That is what you call the ''keys to the kingdom,'' security experts said.   ''All of the information stolen is enough to open new accounts or take over someone's accounts,'' said Julie Fergerson, chairwoman of the Identity Theft Resource Center.   STEPS TO TAKE So what should consumers do right now? Anthem created a website, www.AnthemFacts.com, and a toll-free number, 1-877-263-7995, to respond to questions. The company said it would provide free identity repair services and credit monitoring for up to a year.   But individuals can also employ some strategies now, all of which involve greater vigilance and at least some degree of inconvenience. Even if you do not expect to be affected by the latest breach, most consumers should think about how to protect themselves from the next intrusion.   EXISTING ACCOUNTS What's worrisome about the Anthem breach is that criminals have enough information to try to gain access to your financial or consumer accounts by posing as you over the phone, security experts said. Using your address and other identifying information, they could try banks near you or check with various service providers or retail outfits.   ''They could call in and pretend to be you and would probably be able to answer the security questions based on the information available here,'' said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer group. Take it one step further, and a thief could say he had lost the password, then create a new one, potentially locking you out of your own account.   To avoid this, ask your financial institution (or any other account provider) to attach a secret word or code to your accounts, Mr. Stephens suggested.   Some companies are also beginning to offer something called two-factor authentication, which helps provide protection for online accounts. The system typically combines something you know -- like a password -- with something you have (a special token, for instance, or a numeric code sent to your smartphone). ''It would make it extremely difficult to accomplish an account takeover,'' Ms. Fergerson said.   You can keep tabs on your credit-related accounts by obtaining a copy of each of their three credit reports free at least once a year through AnnualCreditReport.com. By pulling a report every four months, you create your own monitoring service, though it won't stop a thief from opening an account in your name.   NEW ACCOUNTS There is a more extreme option, known as a ''security freeze.'' This is one of the strongest tools against theft because it prevents someone from trying to open a new account in a consumer's name. When you freeze your reports, the three big credit bureaus generally will not release your credit reports to any company that does not already have a relationship with you. Financial providers and other companies typically request such reports before issuing a new account.   Consumers need to approach each of the three credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- and may need to pay a small fee, depending on where they live. The process can be involved because the freeze has to be ''thawed,'' or lifted, to apply for a new credit card, for instance, or for a mortgage and even some types of insurance. (But the extra effort may be less burdensome than cleaning up after an identity thief.)   SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS That Social Security numbers were stolen is particularly unwelcome since, unlike credit card or debit card numbers, they are hard to change. The Social Security Administration wants some evidence that you have tried everything possible to protect your number before it agrees to  assign a new one.   But ''even if you try to change it, oftentimes you get linked back to the old one,'' Ms. Fergerson said. ''Social Security numbers are not just a financial issue. You use that for Medicaid, Medicare, unemployment compensation, child support. You have to think of the entire picture and keep your eye on everything.''   OTHER VULNERABILITIES These types of breaches leave consumers vulnerable to spear phishing -- a type of attack in which thieves send sophisticated emails (or voice or text messages) to specific individuals to try to extract more information, like user names or passwords.   And since this latest breach yielded income information, the criminals could use that to further tailor their appeals. As with all cyberattacks, it is hard to know whether or when stolen information may be used, which means more vigilance and monitoring should become routine.   ''It is extremely advisable for consumers to monitor all of their accounts,'' Mr. Stephens said. ''And it goes well beyond your credit. If you have a 401(k), a stock brokerage account, savings accounts, they are all going to be vulnerable as a result of this breach.''    "
Cybersecurity Bill Is Latest to Be Delayed in Senate,"WASHINGTON --  The Senate headed into its August recess on Wednesday without voting on a cybersecurity bill, adding it to a contentious to-do list for September that includes a push to disapprove the Iran nuclear deal and a spending fight mired in abortion politics. The delay of the cybersecurity bill followed a pattern that has marked the Senate since the Republicans took control this year. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has struggled to accelerate the legislative track while still permitting members of both parties to amend bills on the floor, as he has repeatedly promised to do.      In addition, Republicans' return to the thorny abortion debate -- this time by inserting a bill to defund Planned Parenthood into the calendar ahead of the cybersecurity measure -- left too little time to finish the computer security legislation. Presidential politics has also frequently played a part, with four Republican senators set to participate in primary debates on Thursday.    Mr. McConnell tried this summer to attach the cybersecurity measure to a broader defense bill as a way to mousetrap Democrats into voting for it, but that effort failed. Mr. McConnell then went on to other legislative matters, including a major trade package. When the Senate finally turned to the cybersecurity bill, Mr. McConnell could not get an easy agreement on amendments, which further delayed the action, as did objections from some privacy advocates.    Negotiating amendment deals may have slowed legislation far more than Mr. McConnell anticipated when he took the Senate's reins, even though he repeatedly used filibuster tactics based on amendment disagreements to block legislation when he was in the minority. He promised to deliver a different culture while in the majority, but getting consent among 100 senators is no easier for him than it was for his predecessor, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.    This has sometimes produced dire results for Congress. A fight over changes to the Patriot Act -- led by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who wanted a long list of amendments -- led to a short-term expiration of the law.   Few senators wanted to stick around beyond Wednesday, noting that the House was long gone. But senators in both parties said they feared that another cyberattack could hit the government or the private sector while they were home for the monthlong break. ''There should be concern about that,'' said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. Should there be a major attack in August, he said, voters could wonder ''why government didn't try to do something to prevent it.''   In April, the House passed a measure that would push companies to share access to their computer networks and records with federal investigators. Neither the House legislation nor the bill to be considered by the Senate would have prevented attacks such as the recent theft of the personal information of more than 20 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management.    But the House measure was the legislative branch's most aggressive response yet to a spate of private-sector computer attacks, including a major breach at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the exposure of credit card numbers of tens of thousands of Target customers, and the compromising of personal records of millions of people who did business with the health insurer Anthem.   ''Our nation has unparalleled strength,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has been working for years to get a cybersecurity bill out of the Senate. ''But cyberspace allows much weaker adversaries to target our people, our economy and our military.'' She added, ''We already know many of the steps necessary to reduce the likelihood of a cyber 9/11, yet many of these actions have not yet been taken in either the government or in the private sector.''   Republican control of Congress has not led to uniform policy prescriptions, and Republican infighting has often produced the biggest legislative headaches for Mr. McConnell. That was demonstrated last week when the House and the Senate could not agree on a long-term bill to pay for repairs to the nation's crumbling roads and bridges, and punted for well over the 30th time with a three-month extension of financing for the program.    While Congress achieved many major accomplishments this year, including the final broad revisions to the Patriot Act, a new formula for paying doctors under Medicare, and two bills that may be reconciled to fix the No Child Left Behind law, other legislation continues to be hard-fought.    On the horizon is a budget battle that some Republicans said could lead to a government shutdown if Congress does not move to take away money from Planned Parenthood. Congressional leaders hope to at least pass a temporary funding measure before an address by Pope Francis to a joint meeting of Congress on Sept. 24.   ''It takes a long time to do things in the Senate,'' Mr. McConnell said to reporters last week.     "
Tech Companies Tangle With U.S. Over Data Access,"WASHINGTON --  In an investigation involving guns and drugs, the Justice Department obtained a court order this summer demanding that Apple turn over, in real time, text messages between suspects using iPhones. Apple's response: Its iMessage system was encrypted and the company could not comply.    Government officials had warned for months that this type of standoff was inevitable as technology companies like Apple and Google embraced tougher encryption. The case, coming after several others in which similar requests were rebuffed, prompted some senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials to advocate taking Apple to court, several current and former law enforcement officials said.   While that prospect has been shelved for now, the Justice Department is engaged in a court dispute with another tech company, Microsoft. The case, which goes before a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday and is being closely watched by industry officials and civil liberties advocates, began when the company refused to comply with a warrant in December 2013 for emails from a drug trafficking suspect. Microsoft said federal officials would have to get an order from an Irish court, because the emails were stored on servers in Dublin.   The conflicts with Apple and Microsoft reflect heightened corporate resistance, in the post-Edward J. Snowden era, by American technology companies intent on demonstrating that they are trying to protect customer information.    ''It's become all wrapped up in Snowden and privacy issues,'' said George J. Terwilliger III, a lawyer who represents technology companies and as a Justice Department official two decades ago faced the challenge of how to wiretap phone networks that were becoming more digital.   President Obama has charged White House, Homeland Security and cybersecurity officials, along with those at the Justice Department, the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, with proposing solutions to the technology access issue. They are still hashing out their differences, according to law enforcement and administration officials.   Some Justice and F.B.I. officials have been frustrated that the White House has not moved more quickly or been more outspoken in the public relations fight that the tech companies appear to be winning, the law enforcement officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private conversations.   The White House, after months of study, has yet to articulate a public response to the argument that a victory in the Microsoft case would provide authoritarian governments, particularly those of China and Russia, with a way to get access into computer servers located in the United States.   ''Clearly, if the U.S. government wins, the door is open for other governments to reach into data centers in the U.S.,'' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in a recent interview. Companies and civil liberties groups have been sending in briefs of their own, largely opposing the government's surveillance powers.   Tensions between American technology leaders and the government over access are hardly new: The Clinton administration was forced to abandon plans to require technology manufacturers to build a small ''clipper chip'' into their hardware systems to allow the government to unlock encrypted communications.   Still, the nation's phone companies ultimately supported legislation requiring them to build access points into their digital networks so they could comply with legal wiretap orders. (Tech companies like Apple and Google are not telecommunications firms and not covered by the wiretap law.)   The politics today are far different. Stung by Mr. Snowden's revelations about how the National Security Agency had secretly breached company networks -- often without the companies' knowledge -- Apple, Google and Microsoft are working to reassure customers around the world that they are fighting efforts to give the United States government access to their communications.   The businesses say they are seeing greater demand than ever for built-in encryption -- including the new operating system Apple introduced last year for the iPhone, which James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and other government officials have denounced as endangering efforts to thwart criminals and terrorists.   ''It's important that we do not let these technological innovations undermine our ability to protect the community from significant national security and public safety challenges,'' Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, told Congress this summer.   At issue are two types of encoding. The first is end-to-end encryption, which Apple uses in its iMessage system and FaceTime, the video conversation system. Companies like Open Whisper Systems, the maker of Signal, and WhatsApp have adopted such encryption for stand-alone apps, which are of particular concern to counterterrorism investigators.   With Apple, the encryption and decryption are done by the phones at either end of the conversation; Apple does not keep copies of the message unless one of the users loads it into iCloud, where it is not encrypted. (In the drug and gun investigation this summer, Apple eventually turned over some stored iCloud messages. While they were not the real-time texts the government most wanted, officials said they saw it as a sign of cooperation.)   The second type of encoding involves sophisticated encryption software on Apple and Android phones, which makes it all but impossible for anyone except the user of the phone to open stored content -- pictures, contacts, saved text messages and more -- without an access code. The F.B.I. and local authorities oppose the technology, saying it put them at risk of ''going dark'' on communications between terrorists and about criminal activity on city streets. The American military is more divided on the issue, depending on the mission.   The Justice Department wants Apple and other companies that use end-to-end encryption to comply with the same kind of wiretap orders as phone companies. Justice and some former law enforcement officials argue that consumers want investigators to have the ability to get wiretaps in the mobile, digital world if it means solving crimes.   ''If you ask about wiretap functionality in the broad privacy context, you get one answer,'' Mr. Terwilliger said. ''If you ask it in the context of a guy with a loose nuke, or some kind of device, you get a different answer.''   Officials say a court fight with Apple is still an option, though they acknowledge it would be a long shot. Some object that a legal battle would make it harder for the companies to compromise, the law enforcement officials said. They added that Apple and other companies had privately expressed willingness to find common ground.   Apple declined to comment on the case for this article. But company officials have argued publicly that the access the government wants could be exploited by hackers and endanger privacy.   ''There's another attack on our civil liberties that we see heating up every day -- it's the battle over encryption,'' Timothy D. Cook, the company's chief executive, told a conference on electronic privacy this year. ''We think this is incredibly dangerous.''   Echoing the arguments of industry experts, he added, ''If you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it, too.'' If criminals or countries ''know there's a key hidden somewhere, they won't stop until they find it,'' he concluded.   The Microsoft case centers on whether the fact that data is stored around the world relieves American firms of turning it over. The government, which won in Federal District Court, has argued in its brief to the appeals court that where the data is stored is irrelevant because the company still has control of email records. The White House declined to comment because the case is in litigation.   ''People want to know what law will be applied to their data,'' Mr. Smith of Microsoft said. ''French want their rights under French law, and Brazilians under Brazilian law. What is the U.S. government going to do when other governments reach into the U.S. data centers, without notifying the U.S. government?''   Chinese firms already have plans to build facilities on American soil that would store electronic communications, so the question may be more than hypothetical. In its brief, Microsoft argues that Congress will ultimately have to weigh in on the issue, since it is as much a political matter as a legal one: ''Only Congress has the institutional competence and constitutional authority to balance law enforcement needs against our nation's sovereignty, the privacy of its citizens and the competitiveness of its industry.''    "
Apple Pushes Against Talk of Softening Encryption,"WASHINGTON -- With governments threatening crackdowns on encrypted communications after the jihadist-inspired attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and Paris, Apple on Monday pushed back hard, arguing that lawmakers who talk about gaining court-ordered access to iPhone communications do not understand the technology. ''The best minds in the world cannot rewrite the laws of mathematics,'' the company told the British Parliament, submitting formal comments on a proposed law that would require the company to supply a way to break into the iMessage and FaceTime conversations of iPhone users.     ''We believe it would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat,'' Apple wrote.   Apple's statement came as questions about encryption -- considered an arcane component of cybersecurity just a few months ago -- has become a central issue in the American presidential campaign.   Twice in the past three weeks, Hillary Clinton, the leading contender for the Democratic nomination, according to polls, has urged Silicon Valley companies to work with Washington to find a way out of their standoff over encrypted communications.   Republican candidates have almost all called for giving intelligence and law enforcement agencies the kind of access to text messages and data stored on cellphones that they have long enjoyed with telecommunications providers, like AT&T and Verizon. Congress is calling for hearings, and there is talk of legislation, though it seems unlikely to include the kind of demands for access that Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, advocates.   The arguments made by Apple are not new, but the political context is. In the aftermath of the two most recent terrorist attacks, the political pendulum has swung away from protecting privacy -- the direction Europe was moving after Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, leaked classified documents on government surveillance -- and more toward law enforcement.   The technology companies argue that although the political winds may be changing, the technological challenge has not: To create an opening for government investigators is to also create a vulnerability that Chinese, Iranian, Russian or North Korean hackers could exploit.   Mrs. Clinton rejected that argument recently, arguing that if the companies wanted to put their best minds to the problem, they would solve it.   But in the British filing, and in an interview on ''60 Minutes'' on Sunday, Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, argued that politicians calling for such access do not understand the damage they would cause.   So far, Mr. Cook still has a partial ally in President Obama. The White House determined in October that, despite a recommendation from the F.B.I. to put forward legislation requiring access to encrypted communications, it would not seek legal changes. That rankled the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who has long warned about the ''going dark'' problem, and offered up evidence a week ago that an attack in Texas this year had been plotted over encrypted text messages, which he said investigators still could not crack.   Apple pushed back on Mr. Comey's arguments in its submission to the British government. ''Some would portray this as an all-or-nothing proposition for law enforcement,'' it wrote. ''Nothing could be further from the truth. Law enforcement today has access to more data -- data which they can use to prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes and help bring perpetrators to justice -- than ever before in the history of our world.''   That data, many experts say, includes phone ''metadata'' about who is calling whom, GPS coordinates for individuals, and access to unencrypted data stored on so-called cloud services. But the arguments in Britain and the United States have focused largely on systems designed by Apple and its competitors, including Google and Microsoft, that automatically encrypt data exchanges, and put the keys to those communications into the hands of the users, not the companies.   Apple contended that if Britain went ahead with its legal changes, the company, and its competitors, may find themselves violating American laws to comply with British law -- or vice versa. ''This would immobilize substantial portions of the tech sector and spark serious international conflicts,'' it argued.

Obama Administration Plans to Open Center to Fight Cyberattacks,"President Obama's homeland security adviser said Tuesday that the administration was planning to open a new center that would quickly assess and deter cyberattacks on the United States. The adviser, Lisa Monaco, who provides threat assessments to Mr. Obama every morning, said the world was at a ''transformational moment'' regarding cyberthreats.    ''Annual reports of data breaches have increased roughly fivefold since 2009,'' Ms. Monaco said. That was the year that Mr. Obama first began to publicly press for greater cybersecurity initiatives -- while secretly authorizing the largest state-sponsored use of a cyberweapon against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities.     A cyberthreat office has long been discussed, but planning became more urgent after the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November, which Mr. Obama and the F.B.I. later said was the work of North Korea. The attack exposed weaknesses in the government's ability to come up with a consensus on an attack's origin and how to respond to it.    Presidential aides had expressed similar frustrations during the lengthy investigations into attacks on JPMorgan Chase -- no single culprit has been reliably identified -- and in a number of other hacking cases, including some on the unclassified White House and State Department email systems.   The new center would essentially put greater control of assessments into the hands of the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. While there are a number of federal cybercenters in operation, the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary responsibility for the defense of American domestic networks, has often been at odds with the National Security Agency, the military's United States Cyber Command and other branches of the government responsible for assessing or reacting to cyberattacks.   Mr. Obama is also attempting to press companies and the government to cooperate more fully in sharing information on cyberattacks. He is scheduled to travel to Stanford University on Friday to sign an executive order easing the way for American companies to share data with the government.    His executive powers, however, do not allow him to address the liability issues that companies face if they turn over information on customers or other private data. That can o be done only by legislation, and Mr. Obama will urge the new Congress to pass a comprehensive cybersecurity bill, which has failed in Congress for three years.   Ms. Monaco, in a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, painted a picture of an administration struggling to keep up with the increasing number of cyberattacks, which are growing more destructive.   She named four adversaries who regularly attack networks in the United States: China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.   While espionage and the theft of intellectual property motivate many of the attacks, she said, ''politically motivated attacks are a growing reality, as we saw with North Korea's attacks on South Korean banks and media outlets last year.''   Those breaches were followed by the Sony attack, which began in September but which American intelligence agencies -- and Sony itself -- did not understand until half to two-thirds of the company's computers and servers had been damaged or destroyed.    ''It was a game changer because it wasn't about profit,'' she said. ''It was about a dictator trying to impose censorship and prevent the exercise of free expression.'' At the time of the attack, Sony was preparing to release ''The Interview,'' a comedy about a C.I.A. effort to kill Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.   ''I worry that malicious attacks like the one on Sony Pictures will increasingly become the norm unless we adapt quickly,'' she said.     "
University in Xi'an Opens School of Cyberengineering,"Xidian University, with more than 30,000 students on two campuses in the ancient city of Xi'an, has a storied history. The original academy was personally established by Mao Zedong in 1931, when the Communist Party and Red Army were leading an insurgent movement to overthrow the Kuomintang government. Based in Jiangxi Province, where the Communists had their headquarters for a period, the school's mission was to train radio operators for the military.  Mao had set it up in his role as head of the party's Central Military Commission. One specialty then was cryptography, and the university's website boasts that the institution has the finest cryptography program in the nation. The website lists 16 schools or departments, most of them in engineering sciences.  On Monday, the website of People's Daily, the main party newspaper, published an article saying that the university was opening what will be its 17th school - one specializing in network and information security and cyberengineering. The announcement was a sign that cybersecurity had become an increasingly important academic discipline for the Chinese government and military. The article was originally published by Science and Technology Daily, a newspaper managed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The article caught the attention of scholars overseas who study China's Internet capabilities in the areas of defense, espionage and warfare. Amy Chang, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security in Washington who last month published a paper on the subject, posted a link on Twitter to the People's Daily page. ""As cybersecurity threats pose new and significant challenges to countries, the establishment of the School of Cyber Engineering and Innovation Center is an attempt by the university and the central government to foster greater thought leadership and innovation on an issue that has traditionally been understudied and overlooked in China,"" Ms. Chang wrote in an email interview. She said the programs at Xidian, whose full name translates to the University of Electronic Technology and Science at Xi'an, was at least partly funded by a 2011 central government plan to promote innovation at universities. The cyberengineering school appears to have support from the Communist Party's Central Committee and the State Council, China's cabinet. ""Xidian's close connection with the People's Liberation Army may indicate a potential linkage between civilian and military research on cybersecurity,"" she said. For two years, cyberespionage has been a central point of tension in the relationship between the United States and China. The Obama administration has accused units in the People's Liberation Army of being responsible for large-scale theft of corporate secrets via the Internet. Last May, the United States Justice Department indicted five Chinese men on charges of hacking into the computers of American companies to steal commercial secrets. The indictment said the men were members of an army hacking unit. Last month, following the hacking attack against Sony Pictures, American officials said that North Korean hackers were operating on Chinese soil or using Chinese network infrastructure. Chinese officials have denied the accusations and say that China is itself often the victim of hacking attacks. They have pointed to the leaks from Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contract employee, as evidence that the United States is a major player in cyberespionage. A person answering the telephone at Xidian University on Tuesday said the school had no immediate comment on the new programs. The university has websites in Chinese and English that give general background information. The university has more than 1,900 full-time teachers. One page on the website says the university ""has established the ideas of 'people-oriented' and 'teachers being the core competitive ability of a university,' and forged a well-structured contingent of teachers with an innovative spirit."" The English-language website has two slogans at the top of the homepage: ""Great Virtue Truth-seeking"" and ""Endeavor to Study Honesty in Behavior."" At least one other university in the city, Xi'an Jiaotong University, provides training in network security and other computer specialties. There is little public information about the training, and it is unclear how those programs differ from the ones at the new school at Xidian University. ""While the school and innovation center both underscore innovation as a major objective, a challenge China may eventually face, however, is that its leadership will have a difficult time forcing strategic thinking in a culture that is relatively limited in intellectual freedom and in access to information,"" Ms. Chang said. ""Funds can only cultivate so much innovation. Whether the programs will truly foster new, original solutions to managing cybersecurity is to be seen.""  Mia Li contributed research.  "
Time to Change the Password on the Refrigerator,"Email: molly.wood@nytimes.com; Twitter: @mollywood LAS VEGAS -- THE Internet of Things arrived in force at this year's International CES, the huge trade show here. But while manufacturers at the event painted a rosy picture of connected grills, coffee makers, refrigerators and door locks, security experts and regulators warned that the Internet of Things could be a threat to both security and privacy. Hackers have already breached Internet-connected camera systems, smart TVs and even baby monitors. In one case, someone hacked a networked camera setup and used it to scream obscenities into a baby nursery. Connected-home security threats, at least so far, have not usually been about a hacker trying to break into your home or using your data. Criminals aim mostly at giant databases of personal information or credit cards that they can sell on the black market.  Even so, the more connected our technology becomes, the more data our devices and appliances can gather about us. That data can be shared in ways we don't anticipate or can be revealed as part of larger breaches. In a speech at International CES, Edith Ramirez, chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the trend toward having so many things constantly connected to the Internet presented serious risks that start-ups and big companies needed to take seriously. ''Any device that is connected to the Internet is at risk of being hijacked,'' she said in her prepared remarks. ''Moreover, the risks that unauthorized access create intensify as we adopt more and more devices linked to our physical safety, such as our cars, medical care and homes.'' The concerns, Ms. Ramirez and security experts say, include widespread collection of personal information with or without consumers' knowledge, misuse of that information and actual stealing of the data. And perhaps because connected devices are relatively new, there are few security features built into many of them or the apps and services that power them. Even fewer products exist to lock down your smart home. One noteworthy product, though -- perhaps the sort of device we will see more of soon -- was introduced at International CES. It comes from Bitdefender, which makes antivirus and anti-malware software for computers, and is called the Bitdefender Box. The box is a physical device that plugs into your Internet router and constantly scans your network and the websites you visit for potentially harmful software or viruses. ''The whole idea is not to let it inside your network,'' said Bogdan Botezatu, the company's senior threat analyst ''When you're opening a malicious page, before the page is downloaded, it is intercepted in the box, flags are sensed in the cloud and it doesn't show up in the first place,'' he said. One common security problem, for example, is that a person visits a website that has malicious code embedded in it. You don't have to click anything for the code to run, and after it does it can deliver a virus that can co-opt your computer and put it to work as part of a botnet. A botnet is a giant network of computers linked together to break codes or passwords or initiate distributed denial-of-service attacks that can take down entire sites. When less traditional devices like smart TVs or refrigerators are connected, they can become part of botnets as well, Mr. Botezatu said. ''It doesn't quite matter to the hacker how much processing power or what task those smart devices can accomplish,'' he said. If they can reach a website -- and most can, because they connect to their own websites -- they can be used. ''Getting something knocked off the Internet is still worth a lot of money, and the Internet of Things is a powerful tool for doing that,'' he said. The Bitdefender Box is expected to be released this month for $199 and will include a year of service. After the first year, the service is $99 a year. The box includes other features that can help its users control devices on their home networks. It can give extra Internet bandwidth to certain computers for Skype calls, for example. And if you have one installed, you can connect to it when you're not at home over a secure, private network. But as with most antivirus and anti-malware products, the box can scan for and detect only code that has already been identified as a threat. Something new could still sneak through. And the box can't do anything about the personal data harvested by all the various apps that control smart devices in the home or outside of it. For example, at International CES this week, Ford announced plans to collect information about driving habits of company volunteers in Dearborn, Mich., and of volunteer drivers in London. The London project aims to create personalized driving information that can be used to calculate personalized insurance rates. As usual with data collection, there may be benefits in the long run, but we will have to trust a new set of companies with our information. Ford's new chief executive, Mark Fields, said at International CES that Ford understood the responsibility. ''We believe customers own their data and we are simply stewards of that data,'' he said. ''And we commit to being trusted stewards of that data.'' But many companies have failed to safeguard customer data over the last year, so companies like Ford may have to do a lot more than commit. They will have to be transparent about how they protect our information, and make sure customers know what they are opting into when it comes to sharing information. Customers seem wary. Accenture, the research firm, released a study this week that said consumers around the world doubted whether their personal data was secure online. With companies of all stripes suddenly interested in collecting reams of information about their customers, both on the Internet and elsewhere, those concerns are likely to continue. And as Chris Babel, chief executive of the data privacy management company TrustE, noted, we are still in the very early stages of the Internet of Things. ''Everything is still very siloed and it's not very connected,'' he said. ''But there's massive amounts of value when it gets connected -- both from the users' perspective and from the hackers' perspective.'' Mr. Babel echoed the advice of the Ms. Ramirez of the F.T.C., who said companies needed to ''prioritize security and build security into their devices from the outset.'' She recommended privacy and risk assessments in the design phase of new products, forcing users to set new passwords instead of using default passwords on sensitive devices like Internet routers and using encryption wherever possible. So if you are creating a smart home for yourself, keep security in mind. Think twice about what you connect to your network. And hopefully security will evolve in lock step with the connected world we are entering. "
Preparing for Warfare in Cyberspace,"The Pentagon's new 33-page cybersecurity strategy is an important evolution in how America proposes to address a top national security threat. It is intended to warn adversaries -- especially China, Russia, Iran and North Korea -- that the United States is prepared to retaliate, if necessary, against cyberattacks and is developing the weapons to do so. As The Times recently reported, Russian hackers swept up some of President Obama's email correspondence last year. Although the breach apparently affected only the White House's unclassified computers, it was more intrusive and worrisome than publicly acknowledged and is a chilling example of how determined adversaries can penetrate the government system.     The United States' cybersecurity efforts have typically focused on defending computer networks against hackers, criminals and foreign governments. Playing defense is still important, and the Obama administration has started to push Silicon Valley's software companies to join in that fight. But the focus has shifted to developing the malware and other technologies that would give the United States offensive weapons should circumstances require disrupting an adversary's network.   The strategy document provides some overdue transparency about a military program that is expected to increase to 6,200 workers in a few years and costs billions of dollars annually. Officials apparently hope talking more openly about America's plans will deter adversaries who view cyberattacks as a cheap way to gather intelligence from more destructive operations.    The cyberthreat is ''increasing in severity and sophistication,'' Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said last week. Recent attacks -- Russian intrusions against the Pentagon, State Department and White House as well as North Korea's 2014 attack on Sony Pictures -- have driven home that point. One worry is that investing in offensive tools and planning could militarize cyberspace and create a new front for conflict. More than a dozen other countries are making similar investments.    The new strategy, though overly broad in some of its language, begins to lay out the conditions under which the United States would use cyberweapons. Detecting and fending off routine attacks on American assets, like theft of intellectual property, would be the responsibility of private companies, which control 90 percent of the cybernetworks. In complex cases, the Department of Homeland Security would be responsible for detecting attacks and helping the private sector defend against them.   The government would have a ''limited and specific role'' in defending against the most serious attacks (estimated at about 2 percent of all attacks), described as involving ''loss of life, significant damage to property, serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences or serious economic impact on the United States.''   At first, the government would use network defenses, and law enforcement agencies like the F.B.I. would respond. Then, if ordered by the president, the military could conduct operations to counter ''an imminent or ongoing attack against the U.S. homeland or U.S. interests in cyberspace.''   It is essential that the laws of armed conflict that govern conventional warfare, which call for proportional response and reducing harm to civilians, are followed in any offensive cyberoperations. With so many government agencies involved in cybersecurity -- the National Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, the F.B.I. and the Pentagon -- the potential for turf fights and duplication is high.   The new strategy is the latest evidence that President Obama, having given up on Congress, is putting together his own response to the challenge.

Researchers Track Tricky Payment Theft Scheme,"Cybersecurity experts are on the hunt for a sophisticated payment theft scheme unlike any that has been used before. The scheme targets point-of-sale systems but relies on malware that goes deep into the machine, to the ""kernel level,"" where antivirus software often does not look, according to iSight Partners, a cyberthreat intelligence company in Dallas. The criminals have also gone to great lengths to encrypt their tools, so that even when their activity is picked up, it is unclear whether it is malicious.  ""Not only would you not know what you're looking for, but you wouldn't know what you are looking at,"" said John Miller, the head of cybercrime analysis at iSight. Retailers and hospitality companies as well as credit card companies and payment processors are determined to eradicate the malware before Black Friday and avoid a significant holiday season hack, like the one that hit Target two years ago. Much has happened in the two years since Target was hit. For one, the rules have changed. Visa, MasterCard, American Express and other major card networks have shifted the burden for fraudulent charges onto the retailers. From now on, merchants that have yet to update their payment systems from traditional swiping technology to a newer chip-card technology widely deployed in Europe and Canada will bear the financial burden for any fraudulent charges.  For another, attackers have been pouring more money and effort into their tools, making their methods nearly impossible to detect, according to new research published early Tuesday by iSight. For the past year, iSight has tracked this cybercrime attack, originating in Eastern Europe. They say is more sophisticated than anything they have seen in their eight years of operation. The hackers were careful to tailor their attack tool to each victim, making it difficult for investigators to work backwards from one attack to find other infected victims.  ""This is right up there in the top tier in terms of its sophistication and obfuscation,"" Mr. Miller. In September, Mr. Miller's team had a breakthrough. They were able to get their hands on a new sample of the malware and spent the better part of three and a half weeks cracking the encryption on it. By comparison, they were able to reverse engineer other kinds of point-of-sale targeting malware in less than 20 minutes. What they found was an entire suite of tools, not just for scraping data off in-store cash registers, but for moving through a victim's network and capturing other data that might be valuable. In the past, similar point-of-sale attack tools might have two or three functions. What iSight's team found could perform up to 600 functions. ""The level of complexity of coding is two orders of magnitude greater than what we would see with a lot of malware,"" said Mr. Miller. For the past six weeks, Mr. Miller's team at iSight has been briefing as many of its clients in the retail, hospitality, credit card and payment processing industries as possible. iSight sent its clients a list of indicators that suggest their systems may have been compromised and clients across the retail and payment industries have been digging through their systems for the greater part of six weeks.   ""The way this has been developed is sophisticated enough that we believe that the infections we have confirmed are only a small subset of what the attackers have accomplished,"" Mr. Miller said. ""We're confident there are infections out there that no one is aware of at all."" The best prepared are those who already switched to the new E.M.V. technology - which stands for Europay-MasterCard-Visa, the technology's first backers - which makes it much more difficult for criminals to use any stolen payment data for fraudulent transactions.

"China, Technology and Suspicion","Jane Perlez reported from Beijing and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong. BEIJING --  At an elegant guesthouse here recently, China's top Internet regulator entertained ambassadors and diplomats with platters of tempura and roast on a spit, unusual lavishness in an era of official austerity in China, to celebrate the Chinese New Year. But the graciousness came with a warning: Foreign companies had to behave if they wanted to stay in China's $450 billion technology market.    In Washington on the same day, more than two dozen American tech industry executives and trade association officials gathered at an emergency meeting at the pre-Civil War building of the Office of the United States Trade Representative. They told the deputy trade representative it was time for the United States to get tough with Beijing.   The stern words at the dueling gatherings underscored how a routine trade disagreement had quickly escalated into a complex political fight. On Friday, the battle lines became even clearer when a top United States official criticized China for the new regulations on American tech companies.    The conflict has escalated sharply for months. Now, it pits a confident Chinese leadership, alarmed by evidence of online espionage by the United States, against an awkward alliance between the Obama administration and Silicon Valley -- which itself is wary of Washington but is also salivating over the huge Chinese market.   What makes this trade dispute different from others is that traditional concerns of market share and protectionism have become intertwined with the thornier issues of national security and espionage.   ''We are at a bad point in a triangular drama,'' said Peter F. Cowhey, dean of the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California, San Diego. ''The Chinese government is suspicious of American spying, and it wants to advance Chinese leadership in digital markets,'' said Mr. Cowhey, who is a former director of the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation and a former counselor for the United States trade representative. ''Washington suspects the worst of Chinese commercial policy and is equally suspicious of Chinese digital espionage.''   The latest chapter in the dispute began when China said American tech companies had to submit to invasive audits and create back doors into hardware and software. The Chinese say the rules are a matter of national security, necessary to protect state and business secrets.   The rules, which will go into effect in coming weeks, apply only to banking technology for now but are expected to spread to other sectors. Other proposed regulations in China, like an antiterror law still in draft form, go even further and could force tech companies to hand over encryption keys -- the passcodes that help protect data from prying eyes -- to the Chinese government.   The tech companies say the new rules and the proposals are untenable. But their hands are somewhat tied.   The companies have called on the Obama administration for help, a move made with hesitation. Silicon Valley companies are also leery of the Obama administration's using their technology for espionage, particularly after the spying revelations made public by Edward J. Snowden, the former American intelligence contractor.   Those same revelations may also be limiting the administration's options -- hobbling its ability to tell China to stop taking the same liberties with technology that the United States has taken.   The companies, and some in the American government, argue that China's moves are not primarily about national security. Instead, executives and trade groups say, China is mostly trying to strengthen its domestic tech industry by blocking competitors.   The Obama administration has used that argument to pressure Beijing. This month, four cabinet officials, including Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Secretary of State John Kerry, sent a letter to their counterparts in Beijing, requesting the immediate suspension of the banking measures, according to an official who has seen the letter but would speak only on the condition of anonymity.   Michael Froman, the United States trade representative and also a signatory of the letter, said on Friday that the new rules violated China's trade commitments.   ''The rules aren't about security -- they are about protectionism and favoring Chinese companies,'' he wrote in a statement. ''The administration is aggressively working to have China walk back from these troubling regulations.''   Still, in many ways, China seems to hold all the cards. China has twice as many Internet users as the United States, a market expected to account for half of all information technology spending globally in 2015. Its industrial policy gives the government strong control over the economy. And its own tech companies are growing in size and capability.   American companies -- eager to do business in the expanding market -- are divided on how to deal with the Chinese, a weakness China has cannily exploited over the last decade.   Just a few years ago, the companies had a tacit agreement not to give in to demands that they store data in China. In 2012, Microsoft capitulated, cooperating with a local company to store data in China and help its customers meet local legal requirements. Soon after, IBM, Amazon and Apple followed suit.   A similar pattern played out in other areas, too. In each case one foreign firm accedes to a new, stricter regulation -- at times providing technical expertise to Chinese partners. Soon, foreign rivals, worried about missing out, do the same. And in the long term, the local Chinese companies become competitors to their former foreign partners.   ''The Chinese go to each company and say, 'Look, don't oppose this and we'll give you special treatment,' '' said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   Uncertain when a rival might cave to China's demands, most American tech companies have engaged in a delicate high-wire act, working hard to stay in Beijing's favor while pushing the United States government to voice their grievances.   During a November visit to China, Obama raised concerns about an antimonopoly investigation into Qualcomm, the large semiconductor company. But when Qualcomm was fined nearly a billion dollars by Beijing under the antimonopoly law this month, the company's president practically thanked China, saying ''we appreciate'' the Chinese regulator's ''acknowledgment of the value and importance of Qualcomm's technology and many contributions to China.''   In previous disputes, China has tempered policies after the tech industry made enough noise. But analysts say this time is different. President Xi Jinping is tougher than his predecessors, they say, and he has taken a personal interest in the country's tech security.   ''People have to realize there is a new sheriff,'' said Christopher Johnson, senior China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.   The documents released by Mr. Snowden, including some indicating that the American government planted surveillance code in some telecommunications exports, have also emboldened Chinese leaders. An American tech industry official said China's top Internet regulator, Lu Wei, has often claimed the moral high ground in feisty encounters with Americans.   Mr. Lu perhaps gained more ammunition this month, when a Russian security firm reported that the United States had found a way to permanently embed surveillance and sabotage tools in the computers and networks it targets.   China also argues that the United States has engaged in restrictions similar to those pursued by the Chinese. The American tech official said that Mr. Lu cites the instructions by Gary Locke, then secretary of commerce, to Sprint Nextel in 2010 to not buy equipment from Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, because of security concerns.   One potential option to help defuse the situation, said Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former American ambassador to China, is trying to tie the technology trade issues to broader trade talks between the countries. The Obama administration is in the middle of negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China that covers industries like financial services and energy but not technology.   ''There needs to be a pathway to develop rules of the road,'' Mr. Huntsman said. ''These are complicated issues.''    "
Web Tools for Privacy are Hacked in China,"SAN FRANCISCO --  Chinese hackers have found a way around widely used privacy technology to target the creators and readers of web content that state censors have deemed hostile, according to new research. The hackers were able to circumvent two of the most trusted privacy tools on the Internet: virtual private networks, or VPNs, and Tor, the anonymity software that masks a computer's true whereabouts by routing its Internet connection through various points around the globe, according to findings by Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault, a Silicon Valley security company.    Both tools are used by Chinese businesses and by millions of citizens to bypass China's censorship technology, often called the Great Firewall, and to make their web activities unreadable to state snoopers.    The attackers compromised websites frequented by Chinese journalists as well as China's Muslim Uighur ethnic minority, Mr. Blasco discovered last week.   As long as visitors to those websites were also logged into one of 15 Chinese Internet portals -- including those run by Baidu, Alibaba and RenRen -- the hackers were able to steal names, addresses, sex, birth dates, email addresses, phone numbers and even the so-called Internet cookies that track other websites viewed by a user.   To get around the Tor and VPN technology, the attackers relied on a server software vulnerability that China's top companies apparently didn't patch, Mr. Blasco said.   While Mr. Blasco and others have not been able to pinpoint the identity of the hackers, the list of targets and the sophistication of the attacks suggest they may have been directed by the Chinese government.   ''Who else could be potentially interested in this information and go to such lengths? Who else would want to know who was visiting Uighur websites and reporters' websites inside China?'' Mr. Blasco said in interview. ''There's no financial gain from targeting these sites.''   Since taking power in late 2012, President Xi Jinping has shown a personal interest in how the Internet is managed, by creating and leading a committee responsible for Internet governance.   He has also given broad powers to the newly formed Cyberspace Administration of China, which has in turn targeted Internet celebrities who influence online opinion, increased blocks on foreign websites and sought to project China's influence over the Internet internationally.   In the last few months, the Chinese government has blocked sales and disabled the protocols of VPNs. It also hijacked Internet traffic flowing to Baidu, China's biggest Internet company, using it to overwhelm and knock down websites like GitHub that carry content China's sensors deem hostile, including content from The New York Times.   Activists and security experts advised Chinese Internet users to protect themselves from state-sponsored surveillance by using Tor and VPNs, and foreigners inside China have long done so. But Mr. Blasco's discovery suggests that Beijing's Internet censors have found a way to render those tools useless.   ''There's a growing sense within China that widely used VPN services that were once considered untouchable are now being touched,'' said Nathan Freitas, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard and technical adviser to the Tibet Action Institute.   The Cyberspace Administration of China did not return requests for comment.   Mr. Blasco said the Uighur and press-related sites had been compromised with a ''watering hole attack'' in which attackers find a way to hide malicious code in websites frequented by their targets and then wait for their victims to come to them. Once people visit those sites, that code gets injected into their web browsers.   The technique has been used by governments and hackers for surveillance and to steal passwords.   What made the attacks particularly serious, Mr. Blasco said, was that as long as the victims were logged into China's 15 top web services -- including major portals like Baidu, Taobao, QQ, Sina, Sohu, Ctrip and RenRen -- the attackers could identify them and siphon off their personal digital information, even if their victims were logged into Tor or a VPN.   They did this with the aid of a particularly serious vulnerability that 15 web services in China apparently never patched.   The vulnerability, known as JSONP, is not new. It was publicized in a Chinese security and web forum around 2013, about the same time that forensic evidence suggests that attackers used it to target Muslim Uighur websites and nongovernmental organizations' sites, Mr. Blasco said.   By not patching this hole, Mr. Blasco said, major web portals like Baidu and Taobao, a subsidiary of Alibaba, effectively neutered the only privacy protections available to web users inside China.   ''The equivalent would be if law enforcement was able to exploit a serious vulnerability in Facebook to deanonymize users of Tor and VPNs in the United States,'' Mr. Blasco said. ''You would assume Facebook would fix that pretty fast.''   It is not clear, given the severity of the vulnerability and its discovery some two years ago, why so many of China's top web portals did not fix it.   A Baidu spokesman said the company did try to deal with the problem.   ''To the best of our knowledge, our earlier efforts were successful in preventing any serious leak of personal use data. But in light of this further information, we have decided to implement a more aggressive and thorough fix across Baidu for the JSONP vulnerability,'' the spokesman said.   A spokesman for Alibaba also said the company was now moving to deal with the problem. ''Alibaba Group takes data security seriously and we do everything possible to protect our users,'' said Robert Christie, vice president of international media at Alibaba.    ''Many companies in our space have faced this issue, and once we discovered this issue, we moved swiftly to address it. We have found no evidence that any user information has been compromised,'' he said.   Researchers say the complexity of the attack and the lack of digital fingerprints indicate that someone with significant influence had to have been directing it. Otherwise, ''there must be a cybercriminal out there with pretty significant access to China's Internet infrastructure,'' said Mr. Freitas.    "
"Who's the Watchdog? In Europe, the Answer Is Complicated","LONDON - Who has the right to regulate Facebook? That question lies at the heart of a growing fight here after many of Europe's privacy watchdogs opened investigations into how the social network obtains and uses individuals' online data. The investigations are concerned with changes in Facebook's privacy settings, which were updated this year and simplified the often hard-to-understand rules into concise and comprehensible language.  For some of Europe's regulators, which oversee stricter data protection rules than those in the United States, the changes raised concerns that the social network did not give people enough say over how their online data was used. The watchdogs also questioned how Facebook collected information on people who visited websites other than Facebook that had embedded ""like"" buttons connected to the social network. At least five European regulators - France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium - are investigating Facebook's new privacy settings. They are expected to meet this month to discuss the continuing investigations, which could lead either to fines or to demands that Facebook alter its use of online information ""This is just the beginning of our investigation,"" said Mathias Moulin, deputy director of enforcement at the French data protection regulator, who is overseeing the review of the company's activities. ""This is a global issue with a global company."" The social network, however, says it complies with Europe's strict data protection rules. Facebook says it has been in contact with Ireland's privacy regulator about the policy, because the company's non-American activities are regulated from Dublin, the site of its international headquarters. The company contends that Europe's other regulators do not have the jurisdiction to demand changes to how it uses people's data. ""The primary regulation should come from where a company's headquarters is located,"" said Richard Allan, who runs Facebook's policy team in Europe. ""It doesn't make sense that 28 regulators should make different interpretations of the same law."" Ireland's data protection authority says it has been in contact with its European counterparts about their investigations. The standoff over how Europe's complex privacy rules should be interpreted highlights the growing headache for American tech companies operating across the 28-member bloc. The debate is whether individuals' privacy should be protected primarily by their domestic regulators or by the watchdog in the country where a company has its European headquarters. Reforms aimed at answering this question are expected by the end of the year, though domestic privacy regulators are eager to hold on to the power to police activities in their own countries. Some countries, particularly France and Germany, have taken tough lines on protecting individuals' online data, fining companies like Google after the search giant breached local privacy rules. But others, like Britain, are perceived to have less stringent polices that are welcomed by tech companies. That is particularly true for Ireland, which has attracted companies like Apple, Dropbox and LinkedIn through one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the region. ""Of course Facebook would go to a country with the lowest levels of data protection,"" said Peter Schaar, a former federal data protection commissioner in Germany. ""It's natural they would choose Ireland."" The battle to regulate Facebook in Europe is only a sign of things to come. Last Monday, Ireland's data protection authority assumed control of policing how Twitter collects and uses the data of its roughly 240 million non-American users. The company's European headquarters are in Dublin. Yet as Twitter looks for new ways to crunch users' data to increase its revenue from digital advertising and other activities, analysts say that Twitter - along with other tech companies - may also start to face tough questions from Europe's many, and often conflicting, privacy regulators. "
European Regulators Turn Aim to Facebook,"LONDON --  One arm of the European Union is looking into whether Facebook and other tech companies unfairly favor their own services over those of rivals. At least five data protection watchdogs across the region are questioning Facebook's privacy settings. And in a case that could have broad implications for many tech companies, the region's top court will issue a preliminary decision next month on whether Facebook can continue transferring user data between Europe and the United States.    Move over, Google. Facebook is the latest American tech giant that Europeans love to hate.   For decades, European policy makers have taken aim at America's giant tech businesses, trying to force them to play by European rules. In the past, Microsoft and Intel were found guilty of abusing their dominant positions to shut out rivals. Google has most recently been under the microscope, and it now faces accusations that it unfairly promoted some of its search products over those of competitors.    In recent months, though, regulators' gazes have turned to Facebook, raising questions about whether the social network has learned from the past mistakes of companies like Intel, Microsoft and Google when dealing with Europe's policy makers and its legal system. And as Facebook runs into an increasing number of regulatory hurdles here, the scrutiny could potentially distract the company from its ambitions of becoming a one-stop shop for Internet messaging, online publishing and digital advertising.   ''Platforms like Facebook have grown quickly to become global forces,'' said Serafino Abate, a director at the Center on Regulation in Europe, a research organization in Brussels. ''But with that size comes responsibility.''   The scrutiny is mounting as the company's messaging and digital advertising services spread globally. More than 1.4 billion people now use Facebook, and hundreds of millions of people also rely on the company's mobile messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and its photo-sharing service, Instagram.   Facebook's core business, its social networking service, is especially popular in Europe. The company has almost doubled its number of European users to the service, to around 260 million, since 2010. Facebook also has more users in Europe than in the United States, according to eMarketer, a research company.   Regulators in Europe, however, are especially focused on how the company collects and handles those users' data. The region has some of the world's toughest data protection rules, and policy makers from France, Germany and Belgium are investigating whether Facebook broke Europe's laws after the company announced a new privacy policy this year.   If found to have breached the privacy rules, Facebook may face fines or demands that it change how the company handles people's data, though the company says it complies with the region's data protection laws.   ''Obviously, there are privacy issues,'' said Mathias Moulin, deputy director of enforcement at the French data protection regulator, who is overseeing the watchdog's review of the company's activities and who will meet other regulators at the end of May to discuss the investigations. ''This is a global company. Facebook affects millions of people across Europe.''   Taking a page from the playbooks of other American tech companies, Facebook has not stood idle as regulators steadily lined up against it.   The company has hired a number of prominent former lawmakers and regulators, including Erika Mann, a former German member of the European Parliament. This month, the company also chose Kevin Martin, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to champion its cause in Washington, Brussels and beyond.   Facebook increased spending on lobbying 25 percent, to roughly $570,000, in 2013 compared to the previous year, according the latest figures available from the European Union's voluntary database of lobbying interests, which may not include all of Facebook's activities in the region.   ''We expect scrutiny. We're not afraid of it,'' said Richard Allan, a former member of Parliament in Britain who has run Facebook's policy team in Europe for the last six years. ''If you are the new kid on the block, there's always a reaction to that.''   To get a sense of the European backlash against Facebook, you do not have to look much further than the experiences of Max Schrems, an Austrian law student who has led a vocal opposition to how the company collects and uses people's data from around the world.   Mr. Schrems, 27, recently said his concern about online data traces back at least to 2011 and a college class in California. In the class, he said, employees of several West Coast tech companies expressed open disdain for Europe's tough data protection rules, which enshrine a person's right to privacy as a fundamental human right.   After returning to Europe, he began a lengthy campaign against the type of data that Facebook collected on its users, including information on their physical locations.   To rein in the company's efforts, Mr. Schrems filed multiple complaints with the Irish data protection watchdog, which is responsible for policing Facebook's activities in its international headquarters in Dublin. That led to a three-month audit of how Facebook collected data, and changes to the way the company obtained and used people's online information.   Unhappy with how Ireland's regulator managed his case, Mr. Schrems intensified his campaign.   He appealed to the country's highest court, which referred the case to the European Court of Justice, the region's top court. A preliminary decision is expected by the end of June on whether Facebook and other companies can continue transferring data between Europe and the United States.   Many American tech giants rely on moving online information between the regions to feed their business models, like personalized digital advertising. If the European court rules in favor of Mr. Schrems, those practices could be drastically curtailed.   Mr. Schrems also filed a separate Austrian class-action lawsuit against Facebook after collecting more than 75,000 online signatures. He said that the company had violated Europe's privacy rules -- accusations Facebook strongly denies -- and that his side could receive up to $14 million if he wins the case. A decision is not expected until at least early 2016.   ''This is about limiting what Facebook can do with Europeans' data,'' said Mr. Schrems, who remains active on the service despite his legal disputes. ''How much should they be allowed to dig into the souls of their users? That's what we're fighting for.''   Big European companies are also pushing for stronger oversight of Facebook, including the region's well-connected telecom industry.   After Facebook bought WhatsApp, the Internet messaging service, last year for $19 billion, many of Europe's cellphone carriers lobbied hard for the region's antitrust regulators to review the deal. Carriers say that by combining WhatsApp with Facebook's own messaging service, the company has a virtual monopoly over how people send messages on their smartphones.   Europe's antitrust authorities, however, eventually approved the takeover, and Facebook contends there are other Internet messaging services that compete with its offerings.   Yet lawmakers are now looking into whether Facebook's messaging services should be regulated like those offered by traditional carriers. And industry executives say that as the social network starts to offer other services like phone calls through the company's many smartphone applications, Facebook should play by the same rules that now apply to traditional mobile operators.   ''We can't forever be living in a world where we compete with one arm tied behind our backs and they don't,'' Pierre Louette, deputy chief executive at Orange, the former French telecom monopoly, said in reference to Facebook. ''Our two worlds are colliding. Now that the worlds have met, we're all competing for people's attention.''    "
U.S.-Europe Data Transfer Agreement Is Ruled Invalid,"Europe's highest court on Tuesday struck down an international agreement that allowed companies to move digital information like people's web search histories and social media updates between the European Union and the United States. The decision left the international operations of companies like Google and Facebook in a sort of legal limbo even as their services continued working as usual. The ruling, by the European Court of Justice, said the so-called safe harbor agreement was flawed because it allowed American government authorities to gain routine access to Europeans' online information. The court said leaks from Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, made it clear that American intelligence agencies had almost unfettered access to the data, infringing on Europeans' rights to privacy.    The court said data protection regulators in each of the European Union's 28 countries should have oversight over how companies collect and use online information of their countries' citizens. European countries have widely varying stances toward privacy.    Data protection advocates hailed the ruling. Industry executives and trade groups, though, said the decision left a huge amount of uncertainty for big companies, many of which rely on the easy flow of data for lucrative businesses like online advertising. They called on the European Commission to complete a new safe harbor agreement with the United States, a deal that has been negotiated for more than two years and could limit the fallout from the court's decision.   Some European officials and many of the big technology companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, tried to play down the impact of the ruling. The companies kept their services running, saying that other agreements with the European Union should provide an adequate legal foundation.   But those other agreements are now expected to be examined and questioned by some of Europe's national privacy watchdogs. The potential inquiries could make it hard for companies to transfer Europeans' information overseas under the current data arrangements. And the ruling appeared to leave smaller companies with fewer legal resources vulnerable to potential privacy violations.   ''We can't assume that anything is now safe,'' Brian Hengesbaugh, a privacy lawyer with Baker & McKenzie in Chicago who helped to negotiate the original safe harbor agreement. ''The ruling is so sweepingly broad that any mechanism used to transfer data from Europe could be under threat.''   At issue is the sort of personal data that people create when they post something on Facebook or other social media; when they do web searches on Google; or when they order products or buy movies from Amazon or Apple. Such data is hugely valuable to companies, which use it in a broad range of ways, including tailoring advertisements to individuals and promoting products or services based on users' online activities.   The data-transfer ruling does not apply solely to tech companies. It also affects any organization with international operations, such as when a company has employees in more than one region and needs to transfer payroll information or allow workers to manage their employee benefits online.   Frans Timmermans, the first vice president for the European Commission, which will be charged with carrying out the ruling, tried to ease the concerns of companies on Tuesday. He said businesses could still move European data to the United States through other existing treaties.   He added that the European Commission would work with national privacy regulators to ensure that the court's decision was carried out in a uniform fashion across the entire region.   ''Citizens need robust safeguards,'' said Mr. Timmermans. ''And companies need certainty.''   But it was unclear how bulletproof those treaties would be under the new ruling, which cannot be appealed and went into effect immediately. Europe's privacy watchdogs, for example, remain divided over how to police American tech companies.   France and Germany, where companies like Facebook and Google have huge numbers of users and have already been subject to other privacy rulings, are among the countries that have sought more aggressive protections for their citizens' personal data. Britain and Ireland, among others, have been supportive of Safe Harbor, and many large American tech companies have set up overseas headquarters in Ireland.   ''For those who are willing to take on big companies, this ruling will have empowered them to act,'' said Ot van Daalen, a Dutch privacy lawyer at Project Moore, who has been a vocal advocate for stricter data protection rules.   The safe harbor agreement has been in place since 2000, enabling American tech companies to compile data generated by their European clients in web searches, social media posts and other online activities.   Under the deal, more than 4,000 European and American companies had been expected to treat the information moved outside the European Union with the same privacy protections the data had inside the region. The United States government had lobbied aggressively in Brussels in recent months to keep the agreement in place.   The United States and the European Union have worked for roughly two years on a new safe harbor agreement. The court's ruling now puts pressure on negotiators to complete an agreement, but it may also complicate matters.   Any new deal had already been expected to give Europeans greater say over how their online information is collected, transferred and managed by tech companies. But the talks have stalled over what type of access to European data American intelligence agencies should be given, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   In addition, legal experts said that even if a new deal is reached, the court's decision would most likely still give the national privacy regulators some say over the transfer of data.   In its ruling, the European court noted that the region's 500 million citizens did not have the right to bring legal cases in United States courts if they believed their privacy had been infringed by American companies or by the United States government. A bill to provide this legal recourse is being debated in Congress, though analysts said it was unlikely to become law before the American elections next year.   Penny Pritzker, the American secretary of commerce, said she was disappointed about the European court's decision, adding she would work with the European Commission to finalize the new safe harbor agreement.   The legal ruling ''puts at risk the thriving trans-Atlantic digital economy,'' she said in a statement on Tuesday.   The lengthy negotiations have highlighted the different approaches to online data protection. In the United States, privacy is viewed as a consumer protection issue; in Europe, privacy is almost on a par with such fundamental rights as freedom of expression. Last year, Europe's top court ruled that anyone with connections to the region could ask search engines like Google to remove links about themselves from online results. European campaigners said this so-called right to be forgotten ruling would help protect people's online privacy, while many in the United States said the decision would curtail online freedom of speech.   Those differences became more pronounced after Mr. Snowden revealed how American and British intelligence agencies had seemingly unfettered access to people's online activities.   ''The United States safe harbor scheme thus enables interference, by United States public authorities, with the fundamental rights of persons,'' the judges said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to access to European data by American intelligence agencies.   The case reviewed by the European Court of Justice related to a complaint brought by Max Schrems, a 27-year-old Austrian graduate student, who argued that Europeans' online data was misused when Facebook was said to have cooperated with the N.S.A.'s Prism program.   That program is reported to have given the American agency significant access to data collected by several American tech companies. Facebook denies that the United States government had unlimited access to its users' data.   Mr. Snowden on Tuesday, after the court ruling, posted a message on Twitter praising Mr. Schrems: ''Congratulations, @maxschrems. You've changed the world for the better.''   In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Schrems, who is pursuing a separate civil class-action lawsuit against Facebook in an Austrian court, praised the decision.   ''Governments and businesses cannot simply ignore our fundamental right to privacy,'' he said, ''but must abide by the law and enforce it.''    "
Online Privacy: Who Writes the Rules?,"To the Editor: Fred B. Campbell Jr. is exactly correct when he writes that the Federal Trade Commission has dropped the ball on online privacy (''The Slow Death of 'Do Not Track,' '' Op-Ed, Dec. 27). Instead of following the approach that led to the end of unwanted telemarketing, the commission adopted a strategy that favors big companies and Washington lobbyists over Internet users and online privacy: vague goals, endless meetings, more warnings for users and no real impact on business practices.  The outcome, as Mr. Campbell puts it, ''could be worse than doing nothing at all.'' When Congress decided to put an end to junk calls, it passed legislation, made clear that companies would have to operate differently and created real consequences when they did not. The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission worked together to ensure that the rules were enforced. This is not simply historical commentary. The United States today faces the highest levels of identity theft and data breaches in the world. Most user passwords have been compromised. And the risks to ''digital natives'' will only increase as more data that cannot be protected is gathered. The Federal Trade Commission needs to be much more proactive. MARC ROTENBERG Washington, Dec. 27, 2014 The writer is president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research group. To the Editor: Fred B. Campbell Jr. mentions that the Federal Trade Commission strategy was modeled on the popular ''do not call'' rule. If that is the model, everyone can stop worrying. If it works as well as ''do not call,'' it will be totally ineffective and a waste of time, so it doesn't make any difference who writes the rules. ''Do not call'' is a farce, at least in my house. After multiple registrations, we get at least 10 calls a week on our home phone, and I get at least one a week on my cellphone. ARTHUR A. FLEISHER II Northridge, Calif., Dec. 27, 2014 "
Missteps in Europe's Online Privacy Bill,"The European Union could soon adopt a law that would strengthen online privacy protections for consumers, but it would come at a cost to free expression and leave a redacted history for Internet users. Last week, European Union leaders agreed on the final text of a privacy bill that the European Parliament will vote on next month. The law, which would go into effect in 2018, would require that companies explicitly obtain permission from people before using their data.    Consumers would also have the right to examine and correct the information or transfer it to other companies. This would, for example, prevent an email provider from making it so hard to move old emails to a new provider that consumers are essentially held hostage.    Under the bill, regulators would have the authority to penalize companies that violate the rules with fines of up to 4 percent of their global revenue. Businesses would have to notify regulators within 72 hours if personal data was stolen.   While many of the bill's provisions are sensible, some are troubling. The most problematic measure would expand what is known as the right to be forgotten, which lets people request that businesses delete personal information that they believe is no longer relevant or is out of date.   It is reasonable to allow people to delete some information, like embarrassing photographs they posted on Facebook. But this right has been used to make it harder to find legitimate information, like old news articles. More than 350,000 Europeans have asked Google to remove links to 1.3 million web pages from search results since the European Court of Justice ruled in May 2014 that people have a right to request such deletions. (The company says it has complied with 42 percent of the requests it has received. People can appeal Google's decision to privacy regulators and courts.)   The proposed law requires Internet companies like Google to immediately take down information while they decide whether a request for a permanent deletion is warranted. Disturbingly, news organizations and other websites would not have an opportunity to object to those immediate removals and might not even have a chance to protest permanent deletions.   It also is unclear whether the proposed law would require Internet companies to delete information just in Europe or around the world. Earlier this year, privacy regulators in France ordered Google to remove links from its search results everywhere, not just in France, after right-to-be-forgotten requests are made by French citizens. Google has criticized that decision and may appeal any fines levied by the regulators. If the French interpretation of the law is allowed to stand, officials in countries like China and Russia would be emboldened to demand that Internet companies remove material that they find objectionable from search results around the world.   European policy makers say they don't want to limit the freedom of expression, and have included safeguards that would, say, prevent politicians and other public figures from removing links to critical articles. European Union officials also say that links are removed only from the results of searches of a person's name. People can still find those links by searching for other relevant words or names. But that will not help when Internet users do not already know what those other keywords are.   Another unworkable provision would require that people younger than 16 have their parents' consent before opening accounts on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. Most social media companies now require parental consent for children under 13, which is much more practical given how many social media sites teenagers use. The measure does sensibly allow European Union countries to lower the age threshold to 13 for their citizens.   European lawmakers are clearly motivated by a desire to protect the privacy of their citizens. But they should be careful that in trying to achieve that admirable goal they do not harm other rights, like free speech.

Samsung Tweaks Television Policy Over Privacy Concerns,"After an outcry over privacy concerns, Samsung has clarified that some of its so-called smart televisions listen in on the conversations of viewers only if the viewers permit the devices to do so.  Samsung responded to an uproar that began after the company recently updated a privacy policy for its Internet-connected Smart TV line of sets. The new language implied that Samsung eavesdrops on its users, describing in one sentence a voice recognition capability that allows viewers to operate their televisions with verbal commands. ""Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition,"" the sentence said. In a blog post on Tuesday, Samsung said that sentence had ""led to confusion,"" and it posted a new explanation of how its voice recognition system works. While the new explanation is very similar to the old one, there are several significant differences. Samsung said the unnamed third party that receives voice recordings through Samsung television sets is Nuance Communications, a leading maker of voice recognition technology. The new statement also said that Samsung collects voice commands from viewers only when they click an activation button on their remote controls or screens and speak into a microphone embedded in the remote - not all the time. The company also emphasized that viewers could turn the voice recognition feature off completely, though they would lose some voice functions on their television. That will be reassuring to some people. ""Samsung takes consumer privacy very seriously and our products are designed with privacy in mind,"" the company said in its blog post. ""We employ industry-standard security safeguards and practices, including data encryption, to secure consumers' personal information and prevent unauthorized collection or use."" Samsung does not say in its privacy policy how long it or its partners store voice recordings of Samsung television viewers, nor does it say whether viewers can delete those recordings. Amazon takes a different approach with Amazon Echo, a new music system and virtual assistant for the home. Like Samsung's televisions, Echo collects voice commands from its users after they have activated the device with a verbal ""wake word"" or a button press. But the company also provides detailed instructions for deleting the recordings. "
"With 'Brandeis' Project, Darpa Seeks to Advance Privacy Technology","The Pentagon's advanced research arm is pursing privacy technology. And this time, it is technology intended to protect individual privacy rather than compromise it.  The new emphasis is a very different path from the one taken after the Sept. 11 attacks, when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, embarked on the Total Information Awareness program. It was to be an all-seeing digital surveillance system to hunt for terrorists. The outcry from privacy advocates prompted Congress to shut it down. But the technologies developed by Darpa made their way into the intelligence agencies and the electronic-spying program that so disturbed Edward J. Snowden, who leaked tens of thousands of documents. The new Darpa program is called Brandeis, a nod to the guiding principle of the research initiative. Louis Brandeis, a progressive lawyer who became a Supreme Court justice, was the co-author with Samuel D. Warren of an influential essay, ""The Right to Privacy."" Published in Harvard Law Review in 1890, it forcefully made the case that safeguarding privacy was essential to individual freedom.  The Brandeis manifesto was published two years after the introduction of the Kodak film camera, a privacy-threatening technology of its day. It could quickly capture images, recording people in normal poses and spontaneous moments. The previous wet-plate, lithographic cameras required their subjects to present themselves in frozen stillness. But with a hand-held Kodak camera, photo snappers were suddenly taking pictures of people in public places - downtowns, ballrooms and beaches. The ""camera fiends"" were seen as a menace, and banned from beaches and from the Washington Monument for a while. But while the times and the technology have changed, the fundamentals have not, according to John Launchbury, the Darpa program director for Brandeis. Privacy, he said, is a value at the heart of a free society, and an engine of progress.  ""Privacy is a key enabler to things we care desperately about, like democracy and innovation,"" Mr. Launchbury, an English computer scientist and cryptographer, said in an interview on Friday. Brandeis was one of several emerging-technology programs highlighted at a three-day conference last week in St. Louis, where Darpa invited 1,200 scientists and technologists from academia, large companies and start-ups. The event was part of the agency's drive in recent years to woo leading researchers and entrepreneurs to collaborate with Darpa. That effort has been a hallmark ofthe tenure of Arati Prabhakar, a trained physicist and former Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who became the head of Darpa in 2012. Brandeis is just getting underway. The companies and universities joining the program have been selected. But most are still negotiating contract terms, with only a few announced, including SRI International and Stealth Software. The kickoff meeting for the participants will be in October. The program will run for four and a half years, and its budget will be ""tens of millions of dollars,"" Mr. Launchbury said.  Many companies and university researchers are working on privacy-protecting technologies. Yet Darpa will support early stage research in areas like advanced cryptography, a field known as multiparty differential privacy, and machine-learning software that can learn and predict a person's privacy preferences - a clever digital assistant for privacy protection. The latter would be a big change from the complex privacy settings on search engines and websites now, which is a major reason much of the online population just accepts the default settings. The free flow of data, Mr. Launchbury noted, should be enormously valuable across every industry and scientific discipline. But that will only happen in an environment of trust, where, he said, the prevailing attitude is that ""you feel so in control of your data that you enable greater sharing at your discretion."" Today, the data world is pretty much wide open, and entire industries rely on mining and marketing people's data. If people have the ability to limit which of their digital footprints can be seen or tracked, doesn't that undermine the business model of many ad-based Internet companies, including Google and Facebook? Not necessarily, Mr. Launchbury replied. ""It would be a matter of, You can use this data for these purposes in exchange for a set of free services,"" he said. ""At least then it's a negotiation."" Naming the program Brandeis suggests a recognition that technology will be only a part of the answer to privacy challenges. So will an evolving legal framework and public attitudes. ""Privacy is such a huge space,"" Mr. Launchbury said. ""What we're working on here is not a solution. But we're hoping to develop a new technical capability and society can decide whether it wants to use it.""  "
"Sony Postpones Earnings Announcement, Blaming Hacking Attacks","HONG KONG - Sony said Friday that it would delay the report of its earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 as a result of the hacking attacks on its American film studio, Sony Pictures Entertainment.  As those attacks led to public discussions about cybersecurity and geopolitics, and Hollywood's relation with the two - and as the story moved from Sony to North Koreato the National Security Agency - it might have been easy to forget the scale of the disruption at the studio. In a filing Friday to the Financial Services Agency of Japan, the company said that after Sony Pictures shut down its entire computer network in response to the November intrusions, many crucial programs still were not running. Sony Pictures' ""financial and accounting applications and many other critical information technology applications will not be functional until early February 2015 due to the amount of destruction and disruption that occurred, and the care necessary to avoid further damage by prematurely restarting functions,"" the company said in the filing. As a result, Sony is asking for an extension of a month and a half for its earnings report, though it said it would hold a call on Feb. 4 to update analysts and investors on its operations outlook. The announcement comes as cybersecurity remains one of the hot topics at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where executives have been expressing concerns about the growing list of corporations that have been the victims of major attacks. In particular, the attacks on Sony have set off alarms because they were designed not simply to steal data and make money, but to embarrass and disrupt the operations of the company. Even though Sony will most likely have few concrete numbers to give investors on the Feb. 4 call, many analysts and investors will no doubt be dialing in, curious about the last line of Sony's filing on Friday: ""While Sony continues to evaluate the impact of the cyberattack on its financial results, it currently believes that such impact is not material.""

China's Premier Pledges to Help U.S. Stop Cybercrimes,"SEATTLE --  President Xi Jinping pledged in a speech here on Tuesday night to work with the United States on fighting cybercrime, saying that the Chinese government was a staunch defender of cybersecurity. ''The Chinese government will not in whatever form engage in commercial theft, and hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties,'' Mr. Xi said in an address to American business executives.     At the end of his first day of a state visit to the United States, Mr. Xi told his audience, which also included Chinese business leaders, that ''China is ready to set up a high-level joint dialogue mechanism with the United States on fighting cybercrimes.''   Mr. Xi appeared to be attempting to reassure his business audience, many of its members from tech industries at the forefront of cyberspace issues, but how far his words would be believed by the Obama administration remained to be seen.     At a briefing for reporters in Washington on Tuesday, a senior China adviser to President Obama said that ''we won't paper over those differences,'' a reference to cyberspace and economic issues. There would be ''very robust discussion'' with Mr. Xi, said the adviser, Daniel J. Kritenbrink.   Two weeks before Mr. Xi's arrival, one of his closest aides, Meng Jianzhu, the head of domestic security, visited Washington to deal with the administration's accusations that China was responsible for massive cyberattacks on American businesses and government agencies. The Chinese deny the administration's claims.   The meetings failed to lead to a concrete agreement that the administration had hoped for on how to deal with such attacks, particularly the theft of trade secrets from American companies that benefit their Chinese competitors, according to a senior administration official.   The tone of Mr. Xi's address across a range of issues was positive, without a jarring word. He refrained from talking about thorny differences with the United States over China's construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea. On China's softening economy he sounded a soothing tone, saying that all economies faced difficulties and though China was under downward pressure ''this is only a problem in the course of progress.''    He also told his audience not to worry about the Chinese stock market, whose sudden plunge over the summer sent shock waves across the world. He defended his government's intervention, which failed to stop the fall, saying the ''government took steps to stabilize the market and contain panic in the stock market and this avoided systemic risk.''    As Mr. Xi's advisers prepared him for his trip to the United States, he was encouraged by several Americans to include some personal themes that would resonate with the audience.    He won applause for a line about his anticorruption campaign against government officials not being like the television show ''House of Cards.''   The audience also appreciated his anecdote about ordering one of Ernest Hemingway's favorite cocktails, a mojito, when he visited Cuba.    The audience included Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and the company's founder, Bill Gates -- they sat on either side of Mr. Xi's senior adviser, Li Zhanshu -- as well as other senior executives whose tech firms have suffered in China from the imposition of new, intrusive security measures, commercial cybertheft and demands for transfers of technology.    Mr. Xi addressed some of those concerns with general reassurances but no specifics, saying. ''We will address the legitimate concerns of foreign investors in a timely fashion, protect their lawful rights and interests, and work hard to provide an open and transparent legal and policy environment.''   The reactions of the business community to Mr. Xi's promises may become clearer at a high-level tech forum Wednesday, organized by the Chinese in conjunction with Microsoft, and expected to draw 200 executives.   Since Mr. Xi came to power three years ago, human rights advocates and lawyers been rounded up and imprisoned, and Chinese nongovernmental organizations have been closed. The Obama administration has called these measures some of the most serious infringements of human rights in China in a long time.   On that issue, Mr. Xi sounded a familiar refrain by Chinese officials, saying ''we are ready to discuss rule-of-law issues with the U.S. side in a spirit of mutual learning for common progress.''   He was more precise about the operations of foreign nonprofits that have come under increasingly restrictive regulations in the last year, offering few concessions. Such groups, he said, ''need to obey Chinese law.''    In a speech before Mr. Xi spoke, the secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, warned him about problems with China's behavior on cyberspace practices, and seemed to want to disabuse Mr. Xi of an expectation that his meetings in Washington would be smooth going.    ''We -- and our companies -- continue to have serious concerns about an overall lack of legal and regulatory transparency, inconsistent protection of intellectual property, discriminatory cyber and technology policies, and more generally, the lack of a level playing field across a range of sectors,'' she said.   Mr. Xi arrived in Seattle on Tuesday morning on an Air China Boeing 747-400 aircraft, landing at Paine Field adjacent to a Boeing manufacturing complex 30 miles from the city center. He will visit the Boeing plant on Wednesday.   Accompanied by his wife, Peng Liyuan, a squadron of aides, senior government officials and nearly two dozen journalists from Chinese state news media, he was welcomed by the governor of Washington, Jay Inslee.   He then headed to a downtown hotel to meet with a group of governors from Western states, including Jerry Brown of California. Afterward, he prepared for the dinner, scheduled to begin early to accommodate Jewish guests who wanted to attend prayers marking the start of Yom Kippur at sundown.   The Chinese worked hard to front-load Mr. Xi's trip -- his first to the United States as president -- with two days of events in Seattle intended to show an upbeat relationship with American business. And in a broad sense it has worked as a show of force to President Obama about the power that China wields, and how much American companies need China even if its policies do not align with Washington's.   Yet frustrations are simmering here. The U.S.-China Business Council, one of the hosts of the dinner, said member confidence about doing business in China has eroded considerably over the past five years.   In 2010, 58 percent of executives were optimistic about the business outlook in China, while 33 percent were somewhat optimistic, said John Frisbie, the council's president. Now just 24 percent are optimistic while 67 percent are somewhat optimistic or neutral.    "
Arms Control for a Cyberage,"A recently disclosed document from the National Security Agency about the escalation of cyberattacks between the United States and Iran presents a chilling summary of how swiftly cyberwarfare developed from the first salvos against Iran's nuclear program a few years ago to a full-fledged cyberarms race.  The attacks and counterattacks grew in scope, it shows, even as the United States and its Western partners tried to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions, fostering the sense that doomsday bombs of the past were being supplanted by futuristic weapons far easier to develop and deploy, yet with enormous potential for destruction.    The N.S.A. document -- prepared in April 2013 for the agency's director -- was revealed this month by The Intercept, a website that reports on the trove from the former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden. It confirmed for the first time that American cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities -- presumably including the Israeli-American Stuxnet attack against Iranian computers that is regarded as the first shot of cyberwar -- led Iran to retaliate in 2012 against American banks and the Saudi Arabian national oil company. Iran, the memo declared, ''has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others'' and would most likely continue the attacks.   The memo could just as easily have dealt with China, Russia, North Korea or the dozens of other states that are working to defend their computer systems or to sabotage those of other states. The problem is that unlike conventional weapons, with cyberweapons ''there's no clear line between offense and defense,'' as President Obama noted this month in an interview with Re/code, a technology news publication. Defense in cyberwarfare consists of pre-emptively locating the enemy's weakness, which means getting into its networks. Recent attacks shows how easily systems considered impenetrable -- major banks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, an electrical utility -- can be invaded.    The N.S.A. document notes that Iran, for one, continues to adapt its techniques to ''circumvent victim mitigation attempts,'' as other global cyberraiders probably do, constantly adding momentum to the digital arms race. And as the race quickens, so does the clash between privacy and cybersecurity. President Obama was right to call for a ''public conversation'' on finding an appropriate balance of privacy and safety.    The tougher challenge is on the global level. Cyberwarfare has already done considerable damage and can lead to devastating consequences. The best way forward is to accelerate international efforts to negotiate limits on the cyberarms race, akin to the arms-control treaties of the Cold War. Barring that, there are few viable ways to bring these new weapons and their use under control.    "
Report Finds No Substitute for Mass Data Collection,"WASHINGTON -- A federal study released on Thursday concluded that there was no effective alternative to the government's ''bulk collection'' of basic information about every telephone call made in the United States, a practice that civil rights advocates call overly intrusive. Last year, after the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed details of the government's vast data-collection enterprise, President Obama asked intelligence agencies to assess whether there was a way to get at the communications of terrorism suspects without sweeping up records of all calls made and received inside the United States, including their length and other identifying information.  On Thursday, the National Academy of Sciences, in a detailed report that brought together communications and cybersecurity experts and former senior intelligence officials, said that ''no software-based technique can fully replace the bulk collection of signals intelligence.'' But it also concluded that there were ways to ''control the usage of collected data'' and to make sure that once it is in the government's hands, there are stronger privacy protections. The findings came a year after Mr. Obama announced modest reforms to practices of the National Security Agency that had been revealed by Mr. Snowden, including doing away with a huge government-run database of phone records and instead relying on separate databases managed by phone companies. Eventually, those records will be held only by providers like AT&T and Verizon. But the change has not happened yet, as officials try to figure out how they would search, with court orders, information they do not have on their own computer systems. Government officials have been clear that the transition will take considerable time. Mr. Obama's hope was that technology would solve the problem -- that new search technologies would make it possible to ''target'' the collection of the phone data, which does not include the conversations themselves. But the researchers could not find a way. ''From a technological standpoint, curtailing bulk data collection means analysts will be deprived of some information,'' said Robert F. Sproull, the chairman of the committee that examined the problem and a former director of Oracle's Sun Labs. But, he said, that ''does not necessarily mean that current bulk collection must continue.'' Since the uproar over Mr. Snowden's revelations and the program's effect on Americans' privacy, the politics of mass data collection have shifted. Terrorist attacks like the ones that killed 17 people in Paris last week, along with the rise of the Islamic State, have led to calls for more vigilance by intelligence agencies, swinging the pendulum back. Britain is now talking about expanding surveillance, and both its government and Mr. Obama's law enforcement agencies have protested moves by Apple, Microsoft and other technology companies to prevent snooping by routinely encrypting many types of mobile and computer communications. David Cameron, the British prime minister, was expected to raise those issues in detail in a visit with Mr. Obama on Thursday and Friday. The American Civil Liberties Union, a strong critic of the N.S.A. program, said in a statement from Neema Singh Guliani, the group's legislative counsel, that ''it would be a mistake to read the National Academy's report as supporting a policy of continued bulk collection.'' She added that the report did not contradict findings of groups that have concluded that ''the domestic bulk call record program has not helped stop an act of terrorism.'' But she noted that the report ''does importantly acknowledge that there are additional steps that the intelligence community can take to increase transparency, improve oversight, and limit the use of information collected.'' The report examined ways intelligence agencies could narrow searches to foreign research institutes, companies or government facilities, using generic situations that were clearly thin covers for events now unfolding in places like Libya and Syria. But it found all the approaches ultimately unsatisfactory. ''The 'needle in the haystack' metaphor is relevant here,'' it concluded. ''If the needle is not in the smaller haystack, no amount of smarter searching will help.'' ''There is no doubt that bulk collection of signals intelligence leaves many uncomfortable,'' the report said. ''Various courts have indeed questioned whether such collection is constitutional.'' But in the end, the committee concluded, the United States should focus on putting limits on how the data is viewed and used -- and by whom -- rather than limiting how much of it is collected. "
Hackers Use an Android App For Sex Extortion,"For years, criminals have been tricking people into performing embarrassing sexual acts on the Internet, and then blackmailing them with recordings of that behavior. Now there's an Android app for this sort of extortion.  Trend Micro, the cybersecurity firm based in Irving, Tex., said criminals have developed advanced mobile applications and tools that siphon their victims' online passwords and contacts to increase the chance that they will pay up. In a report provided to The New York Times on Monday, Trend Micro's researchers detailed a new Android app that criminals are using to pressure their victims into paying blackmail fees. Researchers said the extortionists first lure their victims through a number of online chatting tools like Skype, or KakaoTalk, an Asian chat service. Once the trap is set, they feign audio or messaging problems to persuade their target to download one of four malicious Android apps that can siphon off a phone number, stored passwords and address books. In some cases, the Android app turned the victim's device into a recording device. It also intercepted incoming and outgoing telephone calls and text messages. This shift toward sophisticated, moneymaking schemes is a significant escalation of what has been a longtime problem on the Internet. In 2008, Anthony Stancl, a Wisconsin teenager, created a fake female account on Facebook to bait classmates into sending naked pictures of themselves. He used those pictures to blackmail them into performing sexual favors. He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2010. That same year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a California man for hacking into 100 computers to gather information that was used to lure victims into sending sexual videos. Over the last two years, such schemes have become more elaborate. A year ago, in April, Interpol, together with the Philippine National Police, and law enforcement agencies around the world, arrested 58 people in the Philippines who were accused of posing as attractive women on Facebook, then baiting victims into sexual video chats on Skype. Interpol said this group recorded the chats, then demanded fees between $500 and $15,000 to keep those chats from becoming public. Victims were paying. Last March, police in Japan arrested two men suspected of being members of an extortion gang. In sifting through their digital devices and bank accounts, police said they discovered that the gang had managed to extort more than $29,000 from 22 victims between December 2013 and January 2014. Using their email, social media and bank accounts, Trend Micro traced several of the Android app developers and their money go-betweens to China. The company found evidence that the criminals opened different bank accounts for each extortion campaign, which Trend Micro said typically lasted just a few weeks. The researchers suspected that the criminals preyed predominantly on victims in China and Korea. ""The sextortion schemes we uncovered are complex operations that involve people across cultures and nations working together to effectively run a very lucrative business,"" the researchers wrote in their report.

"WikiLeaks Posts Sony Pictures Documents, Angering the Studio","LOS ANGELES --  Sony Pictures Entertainment reacted harshly on Thursday to word that WikiLeaks, a web portal devoted to disclosing confidential information from governments, corporations and other large and powerful entities, had posted a searchable archive of emails and other documents stolen from the studio last year by hackers.  Calling the original attack ''a malicious criminal act,'' Sony said in a statement that ''we strongly condemn the indexing of stolen employee and other private and privileged information.''    That was a response to a post on WikiLeaks in which the organization's editor in chief, Julian Assange, said the materials belonged in the public domain because they ''show the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation.'' In a statement introducing the archive, WikiLeaks said it contained 30,287 documents, along with 173,132 emails from more than 2,200 addresses.   ''It is newsworthy and at the center of a geopolitical conflict,'' Mr. Assange wrote of the archive. ''It belongs in the public domain. WikiLeaks will ensure it stays there.''   United States law enforcement officials attributed the original hacking, which occurred last November, to the North Korean government, which was angered over Sony's comic film parody of its leader, Kim Jong-un, in ''The Interview.'' Emails and other material taken from the studio were widely published and posted by news organizations, which culled the material from drop-boxes established by the hackers.   In adopting and indexing the material, WikiLeaks said it meant to ensure its continued availability in the face of a legal and public relations effort by Sony to push users away from the material. David Boies, representing Sony, sent letters warning news organizations against possessing or publishing stolen company material.   Whether because of the warnings or fatigue with the story of Sony's woes, interest in the trove had waned in recent months, though not before Sony executives, including its chief executive, Michael Lynton, and the chairwoman of its film operation, Amy Pascal, were embarrassed by some public revelations. For Ms. Pascal, who resigned her post under pressure in February in favor of a producing deal with the studios, those included a rude exchange discussing President Obama's purported preference for black-themed movies.   WikiLeaks on Thursday insisted that reporters had done little more than ''scratch the surface'' of a file that it says includes material describing Sony connections to the Democratic Party and the RAND Corporation, of which Mr. Lynton is a trustee.   Sony Pictures has been embroiled in a legal fight over claims that it negligently allowed employees' private information to be stolen. In its statement, the company said it was fighting for the ''safety, security and privacy'' of its 6,000 employees.    "
A Sensible Response to Cyberattacks,"The scope and sophistication of recent cyberattacks on American government, business and personal accounts are chilling. The latest, a breach of federal personnel records that could affect more than four million current and former employees, is a reminder that enhancing the nation's cyberdefenses has to be an urgent priority. Yet, in tailoring new programs and policies to fight hackers, members of Congress and the Obama administration should not allow a siege mentality to take hold.     The disclosures by Edward Snowden about the abuses of the National Security Agency have led to important reforms that have sought to prevent the government from collecting information about Americans in unlawful ways and to strengthen privacy safeguards. But that process still has a long way to go, and it would be unwise to let the rising threat of cyberattacks snarl it or roll it back.   This week, The New York Times and ProPublica, relying on documents leaked by Mr. Snowden, reported that the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. have cooperated closely on cyberthreat investigations in recent years.   The partnership, which has eroded a firewall that once kept criminal and intelligence probes separate, raises serious privacy concerns. As the N.S.A. sweeps up information from suspected hackers abroad under the authority of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it may be gathering large amounts of data about American citizens. Currently, such data, which could include copies of stolen emails and financial records, can be stored in databases. Law enforcement personnel may query it to build criminal cases against Americans that are unrelated to tracking down hackers.   Representative Ted Poe, a Texas Republican and former judge, has been among the outspoken critics of the practice, known as ''backdoor searches,'' which he sees as a breach of constitutional protections against unreasonable searches. ''The line is very muddy,'' Mr. Poe said, referring to the collaboration between the F.B.I. and the N.S.A. ''I'm very suspicious about how they work together on issues that cross the line.''   Cooperation between the N.S.A. and law enforcement agencies should not be inherently suspect, and will no doubt be crucial to enhancing protections against cyberattacks. It must, however, be done in a manner that is clearly lawful and that safeguards the privacy and civil liberties of American citizens.   The powers granted to intelligence agencies under Section 702, which were billed primarily as terrorism-fighting tools, expire in December 2017. Lawmakers should not wait until then to demand a fuller and clearer accounting of how the government has interpreted those authorities. It remains unclear, for instance, just how much information about Americans the N.S.A. sweeps up in the course of cyberinvestigations and later makes available to other government agencies. Also unclear is how routinely that data is searched by law enforcement personnel, and under what guidelines.   Experience has shown that Americans cannot count on intelligence agencies to be judicious, or the Obama administration to be forthcoming, so lawmakers should create tighter rules that ensure that intelligence programs have the robust privacy and civil liberty safeguards that the law and the Constitution require.   A cybersecurity bill currently before lawmakers, which sets ground rules for cooperation between the government and the private sector, may be an appropriate vehicle for that debate. Alternatively, reforms to Section 702 could be made in appropriations bills.   While the recent changes to the Patriot Act were insufficient, it is encouraging, at least, that more members of Congress from both parties have begun championing privacy in debates about national security. ''It wasn't really something Congress was engaged in in a bipartisan way,'' Mr. Poe said.

Survey of Foreign Companies in China Finds Pollution a Growing Problem,"BEIJING -- Foreign companies in China are struggling with growing issues, including a perception that their businesses are less welcome than before. Such problems have been building in the past year, and they were underscored in survey results released on Wednesday by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, which also found for the first time in the survey's 17-year history that most companies were having greater troubles recruiting executives because of air pollution.    Concerns about pollution have been on the rise in recent years among foreigners and Chinese. In the survey, more than half of the respondents said pollution made it more difficult to recruit senior executives to work in China. The top problem for companies trying to attract or retain senior executives, however, was the expectation of being highly compensated for working in China.    The difficulties faced by companies go well beyond human resources. Nearly half the respondents said that foreign companies were less welcome in China than before. Almost one-third of the companies said they had no plans to expand investments in China in the coming year, up from 27 percent last year and 16 percent in 2013.   The results reflect on-the-ground attitudes among many foreigners here that large Chinese cities have become less hospitable places to live and work, as well as similar perceptions among businesspeople outside the country. The survey included responses from 477 member companies in a wide range of industries. (An additional 48 companies provided partial responses but were not counted.) More than three-quarters of the companies have a presence in Beijing, and many have offices in other major Chinese cities.   Some companies said they would increase investment this year but at a slower rate compared with last year. They cited the top reasons as: expectations of slower growth in China or the existence of faster-growing markets elsewhere; barriers to market access or policies that discriminate against foreign companies; and concerns about an uncertain policy environment.   Nearly 60 percent of the respondents said they believed foreign companies were being singled out in government investigations, including pricing, and antimonopoly and anticorruption campaigns. On Monday, the American chip maker Qualcomm said it would pay a $975 million fine for violating China's antimonopoly law.   Sixty percent of the survey respondents said the risk of intellectual property leaks or information technology and data security threats were greater in China than in other geographic areas where the companies operated. More than 80 percent said their companies were suffering negative impacts from China's expansive system of Internet censorship and blocking, commonly called the Great Firewall.   China's efforts to block access to many websites have grown notably since the chamber conducted its survey. Since December, China has blocked applications that allow Internet users to download Gmail messages and also many brands of virtual private network, or VPN, software that allows users to leap over the Great Firewall and get to blocked sites like Google, Facebook and Twitter.   Duncan Clark, a technology investor and business consultant in Beijing, said the survey's results seemed to be grimmer every year. He noted that United States technology companies seemed to be facing a particularly difficult environment since the Edward Snowden leaks. And he added that resentment in China of the review process on foreign investment in the United States and other market-entry blocks to Chinese companies continued to corrode the countries' relationship.   ''Once national security is invoked, and also now 'Internet sovereignty,' it is hard for cooler heads to prevail,'' Mr. Clark said.   The report's executive summary said that companies continue to see growth opportunities but that ''challenges in China are on the rise, with a significant uptick in the number of companies reporting that the quality of China's investment environment is deteriorating.''   The report recommended that policy makers in Washington and Beijing continue to pursue a bilateral investment treaty, which some American executives say they hope will help remove significant barriers to the Chinese market.   The report did note some positive developments, like the fact that corruption was no longer listed by many companies as one of their top five business challenges. (In 2013, corruption ranked No. 4.) Since taking power in late 2012, Xi Jinping, China's president and Communist Party leader, has overseen a broad anticorruption campaign that is also focused on purges of his political enemies.   For the third year in a row, companies cited labor costs as their greatest challenge, followed by inconsistent regulations or unclear laws. Ranked third in the list of challenges for a fourth year was a shortage of qualified employees.   Despite all the hurdles, 67 percent of companies said they were ''profitable'' and 6 percent said they were ''very profitable.'' These numbers have roughly held steady since 2012.   ''Much work lies ahead for all of us in 2015 and beyond,'' wrote James Zimmerman, the chairman of the chamber, ''as the Chinese economy continues to mature, and the government implements and enforces a host of new laws that have been in the pipeline for years.''    "
Drug Patents Are a Hurdle for the U.S. in Trade Talks,"LAHAINA, Hawaii --  With 12 nations pressing to conclude the largest regional trade accord ever, United States officials find themselves squeezed between activists pressing to secure access to low-cost pharmaceuticals and Republicans who say Congress will reject a deal without strong patent protections for the drug industry. Negotiators gathered this week in Maui hoping the long-sought accord might be finished by Friday. But dozens of issues remain unresolved on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would link nations like Canada, Chile, Australia and Japan under rules of commerce covering 40 percent of the global economy.     No issue seems to elicit more passion than pharmaceuticals, where both sides are using the language of life and death.   ''The goal of the pharmaceutical industry is to change the rules internationally, to change global norms with a new monopoly that is cheaper for the companies and stronger,'' said Judit Rius Sanjuan, a legal policy adviser for Doctors Without Borders' medical access campaign, which wants lower-cost drugs on the market faster.   On the other side, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, singled out the next generation of pharmaceuticals, called biologics, and warned on Wednesday that ''a strong intellectual-property chapter -- including strong patent and regulatory data protections for biologics -- is vital to securing congressional support for this trade deal.''   The complexity of the pharmaceutical issues illustrates how difficult it will be to agree on broad trade rules for 12 countries, including giants like the United States and Japan and developing counties like Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam and tiny Brunei. United States negotiators are using novel arguments to secure positions. For instance, they are pushing to mandate open access to the Internet as an antipiracy measure, so Hollywood can use streaming videos to completely cut out the often-copied DVD.   But medicines remain a delicate problem, and if Japan's last stand is on rice and Canada's is on dairy, the United States' might be on pharmaceuticals.   About 5,600 medicines are in development in the 12 T.P.P. countries, according to the Senate Finance Committee. Of those, 3,372 are in the United States, including more than 900 biologics, which are grown from live cells. The industry contributes nearly $800 billion to the United States economy each year.   United States law protects data collected during the development of biologic medicines for 12 years, allowing drug makers to recoup their research and development investments before generic companies can come in with far cheaper versions. Negotiators for the United States say they are obligated to defend American law, even though President Obama has been pushing to shorten the data exclusivity protection to seven years.   But Congress can always change that window to conform to trade deals, said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and an observer in Hawaii. ''It happens all the time,'' he said. ''That's what a transition period is for,'' he said.   Countries in the talks have windows of eight years or fewer. Australia has dug in at five.   ''I've got a mandate for five,'' Andrew Robb, Australia's trade and investment minister, said, arguing that with complex biologics, it takes six or seven years for generic-drug makers to develop what are known as ''biosimilars.''   Activists here who cut their teeth during the AIDS drug wars 15 years ago want generic-drug makers to compete with pharmaceutical firms as soon as a drug reaches the market.   James Love, an activist with Knowledge Ecology International, and his wife, Manon Anne Ress, of the Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment, who has cancer, spent the flight to Maui pressing Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative, to secure access to expensive cancer drugs for people like Ms. Ress, who faces the potential of paying $30,000 out of pocket for her drugs, which for now are subsidized by the drug maker.   Negotiators already seem to be backing away from the hard-line United States position. Observers to the negotiations say the 12-year data-protection window almost certainly will be scaled back to five to seven years, a move that will probably satisfy neither the pharmaceutical firms and their allies nor the activists pressing to overturn the whole patent system.   The Pacific accord is structured so that other countries can join in the future, and the belief on both sides of the pharmaceutical fight is that once 12 nations ratify rules, they will become international standards.   Then there are politics. Australian negotiators insist that their Parliament will not accept any data protection beyond five years for drug companies that are so dominated by the United States. What left-wing members of Parliament see as price gouging also comes straight out of the government's coffers, because drugs are paid for by Australia's national health service.   Data protection may be arcane, but the stakes are high for both sides. Drug companies are also pressing to make the data they collect during clinical trials exclusive and protected for the longest period possible. That would require generic drug companies to replicate much of the process that created the drugs they seek to copy.   ''Data exclusivity'' is a more ironclad protection than a patent, because smaller pharmaceutical makers cannot afford to file patent applications in every country they do business in.   The firms also want access to the extrajudicial tribunals envisioned in the T.P.P.'s investor-state dispute settlement chapter. The tribunals are intended to give investors legal recourse if a government changes policies in ways that hurt the value of their investments.   The United States team is trying to find some middle course that preserves pharmaceutical companies' ability to recoup their research investments and maintains an incentive to innovate while finding alternative ways to ensure access to drugs.   That might mean transition periods for poorer countries that let cheap alternatives in and keep older drugs on the market longer. It could also mean incentives for United States drug companies to invest in T.P.P. countries that accept stronger intellectual-property protections.   The activists have been pressing for much more significant changes, such as a mandatory government fund to finance clinical trials, taking that cost off drug developers' balance sheet. But that approach seems to be a restructuring of the pharmaceutical industry that most negotiators, including Mr. Froman, the United States trade representative, cannot accept.   ''There's been no effort on U.S.T.R.'s part to foster innovation outside the private sector,'' Mr. Love said. ''None.''    "
$10 Million Settlement in Target Data Breach Gets Preliminary Approval,"A federal judge on Thursday gave preliminary approval to a $10 million settlement of a lawsuit brought by customers of Target, which experienced an online attack involving confidential customer data during the holiday season in 2013. According to documents filed with the United States District Court in Minnesota this month, shoppers affected by the breach could be awarded up to $10,000 each in damages. The settlement includes a draft of the form victims must complete to make claims, processed through a dedicated website.    Customers may still file objections to the terms of the proposed settlement, but Judge Paul A. Magnuson set a final hearing on the settlement for Nov. 10.    Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said, ''We are pleased to see the process moving forward and look forward to its resolution.'' The pending settlement was first reported by CNBC.   During the 2013 holiday season Target acknowledged that hackers had stolen credit and debit card information for 40 million of its customers. Early last year, the company revealed that additional personal information, like email and mailing addresses, had been stolen from 70 million to 110 million people and said there may have been overlap between those groups.   According to documents filed to the United States District Court in Minnesota this month, shoppers who were affected by the breach are eligible for damages up to $10,000 each.   But to claim damages, victims must prove, among other things, that unauthorized charges were made to their credit cards. They must also show that they invested time in addressing the fraudulent charges and incurred costs from correcting their credit report because of higher interest rates or fees, from replacing driver's licenses or other forms of identification, or from hiring identity protection companies or lawyers.   Target said that it had seen ''low levels of fraud'' linked to the breach.   Matthew A. S. Esworthy, litigation partner at Shapiro Sher Guinot & Sandler, said that many customers would have trouble proving that they had lost money because of the breach.   ''It's difficult to figure out how your card was compromised and if it was directly tied to a particular data breach,'' he said. ''People are buying more online and using their cards so frequently, making fraudulent charges so commonplace.''   Still, he said that as such attacks had mounted, courts had become more willing to entertain cases brought by breach victims. Another major retailer, Home Depot, said in September that hackers breached the company's cash register systems and compromised the account information of 56 million cardholders.   Courts have struggled with how someone proves being harmed by a particular breach. ''But you've seen everybody become a lot more familiar with problems associated with data breaches, and security in general, and the collateral consequences that result from it,'' Mr. Esworthy said.   Target's data breach shook customer confidence in the retailer at a critical time, and executives have said it had a noticeable effect on the bottom line. Target's chief executive at the time, Gregg W. Steinhafel, resigned and was succeeded in July by Brian Cornell, the former chief at PepsiCo Americas Foods.   Target has said that its computer security systems alerted it to suspicious activity after hackers had infiltrated its networks, but that it decided to ignore the alert, allowing what would become one of the largest data breaches recorded.   As part of the settlement, Target promises to bolster protection of customer data, including setting up a protocol for responding to online security threats and providing data security training to employees. Last month, it named Mike McNamara, a former executive at the British retailer Tesco, its chief information officer, and has named its first chief information security officer.   The retailer estimated recently that it had already accrued $252 million in expenses related to the data breach as of the end of January, a figure it said would be partly offset by an expected $90 million in insurance payouts. That estimate was based on the prospect of settling many lawsuits, Target said.   Target faces further claims from three of the four major credit card companies, and is likely to face action from the fourth, it said in an annual filing on March 13. State and federal agencies, including the state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, are also investigating the breach, and may seek to impose fines and other penalties, according to Target.    "
China: Diplomatic Protest Filed With North Korea Over Killings,"BEIJING -- China has made a formal diplomatic complaint to North Korea after a soldier fleeing the North killed four Chinese citizens in late December during a robbery attempt, according to a statement on Monday from a Chinese official and news reports from China and South Korea. The killings took place near the border between China and North Korea. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Monday that the North Korean had been detained by Chinese security forces and that the Public Security Bureau in China was ''handling the case according to law.''  A report by Xinhua, the state news agency, said the soldier had crossed the border into China in search of food. It gave no other details. A South Korean report by the Yonhap News Agency said the killings took place on Dec. 28 in the village of Nanping, north of the Tumen River, which marks the border between North Korea and China. The Yonhap report said the deserter had a gun and carried out the killings in the victims' homes. One person was also wounded, the report said, adding that the Chinese police and military personnel caught the soldier after a manhunt. A report in Beijing News, citing the head of the village, said the four people killed in Nanping were two older couples. The two households were said to have had children working in South Korea, and the parents lived alone. The North Korean soldier broke into the home of a man with the surname Che; ate some of his food; stole 100 renminbi, or about $16; and wounded Mr. Che, the article said. The northeast border with China is a common escape route for North Korean defectors. But in recent years, there have been fewer reports of defectors arriving in the area, perhaps in part because Kim Jong-un, the North's leader, has ordered tighter security at the frontier. China has traditionally been North Korea's closest ally, and opinions vary on what the Chinese leadership thinks of the North Korean government. Some American officials say they believe China has grown tired of North Korea's behavior. For example, a retired Chinese general, Wang Hongguang, published an essay in a state-run newspaper last month saying that China should stop cleaning up North Korea's ''mess'' and that North Korea was fated to collapse. But some North Korea analysts say that Beijing remains a strong supporter and that the United States should not count on China to turn on its neighbor in any significant manner. President Obama, citing evidence gathered by the F.B.I., has said that North Korea was behind a large-scale hacking attack in November against Sony Pictures. Though some cybersecurity experts say the case against North Korea is thin, the White House has asked for China's help in reining in North Korean hackers and has announced new economic sanctions against Pyongyang. Some American officials have said that North Korean hackers are working from inside China or carrying out attacks through its networks. On Monday, Ms. Hua, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, addressed Washington's request, saying: ''The current situation of relative stability on the Korean Peninsula has not been easy to come by. Relevant parties should act cautiously and avoid taking measures that might lead to the escalation or worsening of the situation and work together to safeguard the peace and stability of the peninsula.'' She added that China has ''repeatedly emphasized'' that it is against any form of cyberattack and that it does not allow any countries or individuals to use China's infrastructure or work from within the nation's borders to carry out network attacks and other illegal activities. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Hacker's List Struggles to Keep Up With Its New-Found Fame,"Hacker's List, an online meeting place for hackers and people who want to hire them, spent a good part of Friday struggling to keep the upstart web service running.  The roughly three-month-old website reported getting a flood of unexpected visitors after the site was profiled in a front-page article in The New York Times about the hacker-for-hire businesses. ""As some of you have noticed, we've been upgrading our server like crazy this morning,"" Hacker's List said in an email to customers. ""We have all been busy this morning trying to get ahead of what has turned out to be a turbulent but great morning."" The inaccessibility of the website at times led to some speculation that Hacker's List may have itself been hacked. But a man claiming to be one of site's three founders said in a separate email that the problems were simply the result from heavier-than-normal web traffic. ""It went viral,"" said the man who has identified himself only as ""Jack."" Still, later on Friday the website remained slow and inaccessible at times. All the owners of Hacker's List have sought to remain anonymous for now and will not disclose their identities. The owners contend the website is a legitimate business even though some of the job postings on Hackers' List seek hackers to things that might raise eyebrows: such as, gain access to another's email account, hack into a Facebook account or gain access to a company's database. In the email to customers, Hacker's List reminded its registered users to only use the website's escrow system for exchanging money between customers and hackers and to avoid direct payments for hacking jobs. The site's owners also advised users to ""be careful not to post personal information in your projects and try to use private message to further convey information."" The advisory about using the private message system may be because the job postings on Hacker's List are visible to anyone who registers as a user. Separately on Friday, Taia Global, a cybersecurity consulting firm, issued a report warning about ""mercenary hacker groups"" that are being paid wealthy businessman and companies to hack into competitors networks to steal corporate secrets. The consulting firm said so-called ""espionage-as-service"" is a growing problem for companies operating in the aerospace and defense industries. "
"Hackers Breached Data of Millions, Insurer Says","Anthem, one of the nation's largest health insurers, said late Wednesday that the personal information of tens of millions of its customers and employees, including its chief executive, was the subject of a ''very sophisticated external cyberattack.'' The company, which is continuing its investigation into the exact scope of the attack, said hackers were able to breach a database that contained as many as 80 million records of current and former customers, as well as employees. The information accessed included names, birthdays, addresses, email and employment information, including income data.      Anthem said no credit card information had been stolen, and it emphasized that it did not believe medical information like insurance claims or test results were compromised. It said hospital and doctor information was also not believed to have been taken.   Still, the attack, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, could be the largest breach of a health care company to date, and one of the largest ever of customer information.   Anthem said that the breach was detected on Jan. 29, and that the company was now working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The company said it had also hired Mandiant, a well-known cybersecurity firm, to look into vulnerabilities of its computer system.   In a letter to the company's members, Joseph R. Swedish, Anthem's chief executive, said he wanted ''to personally apologize'' for the security breach. He said his own personal information had been accessed and emphasized that the company was ''working around the clock to do everything we can to further secure your data.''   Anthem operates health plans under numerous brands, including Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.   The company said it would begin notifying members in the coming weeks. In a statement, the F.B.I. said that it was investigating the breach, and that people should alert officials to any possible instances of identity theft.   Anthem set up a website, www.AnthemFacts.com, and a toll-free number, 1-877-263-7995, to respond to any questions. The company said it would provide free identity repair services and credit monitoring.   The last year has seen an increasing number of sophisticated and ever larger hacks on corporate networks and even on federal government social media accounts.   In December, Staples, the office supply retailer, said hackers had broken into the company's network and compromised the information of about 1.16 million credit cards when they broke into the company's network in October.    JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, last summer said hackers had compromised some of the personal information of 83 million households and small businesses. But the bank has said that the attack was limited to nonfinancial information such as customer addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.    And in November, hackers that the United States government has said had ties to the North Korean government orchestrated a destructive attack on Sony Entertainment that resulted in a flood of confidential executive emails and personal information about employees and the company's plans for coming movies.    Federal authorities believe the attack was in response to Sony's plans to release the movie ''The Interview,'' a comedy about fictional plot to kill the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.   The ever increasing threat of cyberattacks on United States companies, whether carried out by cybercriminals looking to steal information to make money or nation-state actors looking to send a message, has become a top priority for federal law enforcement.    The F.B.I. now ranks cybercrime as one of its top law enforcement activities, and President Obama's recently proposed budget advocates sharply increasing spending on cybersecurity, to $14 billion.   Social Security numbers are a particularly popular target for hackers. Combinations of Social Security numbers, birth dates and names sell for more than even credit card numbers in an increasingly sophisticated black market, where such information is sold and resold through popular auction sites.    Law enforcement officials have openly said that keeping ahead of the hackers -- many of whom are believed to live overseas -- is a challenge. On Wednesday, Leo Taddeo, the F.B.I. agent in New York who oversees the cyber and special operations division, said at a financial services industry conference in New York that ''we are losing ground'' in the battle with hackers.    Other in law enforcement have said it is no longer a matter whether a company will be hacked but when it will be hacked.   The threat of a hacking is particularly acute in the health care and financial services industry, where companies routinely keep the most sensitive personal information about their customers on large databases.    ''We have seen a huge in uptick in health care hacks,'' said Vitor De Souza, vice president of communications for FireEye, the parent company of Mandiant.    Anthem learned of the hacking last week and called in Mandiant over the weekend. The company was not obligated to report the breach for at least several more weeks but chose to do so now to show that it was treating the matter seriously.    The F.B.I. praised Anthem for quickly alerting the authorities. ''Anthem's initial response in promptly notifying the F.B.I. after observing suspicious network activity is a model for other companies and organizations facing similar circumstances,'' said Joseph Campbell, an F.B.I. spokesman, in an email statement.

"Behind a Veil of Anonymity, Online Vigilantes Battle Islamic State","They use screen aliases like IS Hunting Club, TouchMyTweets and The Doctor. They troll Twitter for suspected accounts of Islamic State fighters, recruiters and fund-raisers. Then they pounce. In what has become a cyber analogy to the battles in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere between governments and the Islamic State, online vigilantes, some of them with diverse agendas, have united in a common cause to subvert the militant group's aggressive use of social media, particularly Twitter.    They expose suspect accounts that they post on blacklists via Twitter, and encourage other Twitter users to report the accounts to the social media network's violations department, a prerequisite for suspension or deletion.   ''Basically our work not only cripples their ability to spread propaganda, but also wastes their time,'' said a Twitter vigilante who goes by the screen name The Doctor.    Like others, The Doctor communicated through private online chats. All asked that their real identities be withheld for their safety, as many have received death threats.   Some vigilantes are affiliated with loosely knit hacking organizations like Anonymous, known more for infiltrating computer networks of governments and corporations to make political statements or for the ''lulz'' -- the hacker term for laughs. Others are lone operators.   #Anonymous #GhostSec #OpISIS pic.twitter.com/l2rLuKYZa5 -- DIGITÎ[#x203a]SHÎ[#x203a]DÃ[#x2dc]W (@DigitaShadow) March 13, 2015   But all view groups like the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, as an insidious threat. More than a few are women, some of whom call themselves Anonymisses, and some say they spend hours a day online hunting ISIS.   ''I do this because the atrocities I see from these ISIS scum on a daily basis enrage me,'' said a user who identified herself as TouchMyTweets and continued, '' This is my airstrike.''   Get ready for #12 Miss @f_11_7r and I'll come looking for that one too....I don't tire either. pic.twitter.com/xVVbdzcDPn -- TouchMyTweets (@TouchMyTweets) March 23, 2015   A loosely organized effort by computer hacking collectives aimed at disrupting the Islamic State and other violent jihadist causes began last year after the extemists posted images of beheaded captives. It gained momentum after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris in January, according to experts who study online jihadists.   89 Jihad sites #offline & 1,200+ Twitter accounts suspended. #OpCharlieHebdo pic.twitter.com/9t3ZlMhgbp -- AnonyOpNews (@AnonyOpNews) January 19, 2015   The effort is heavily focused on Twitter, which carries roughly 500 million messages a day, and has come under intense pressure because the Islamic State has shrewdly exploited it.   Critics, including cybersecurity experts and some members of Congress, contend Twitter has done little to stop the abuse. Twitter disputes that.   By some estimates, 70,000 to 90,000 Twitter accounts are used by the Islamic State to spread images of beheadings and other brutalities, lure recruits and even relay battle positions -- all with relative impunity because the system is free, enormous and, to a large extent, according to critics, unsupervised.   ''There is a massive usage of Twitter underway by ISIS,'' said Michael S. Smith II, principal and chief operating officer of Kronos Advisory, LLC, a security consulting company.   This month Anonymous and two related hacking groups, CntrlSec and GhostSec, have sought to take matters into their own hands, publicizing Twitter accounts that they say are operated by the Islamic State in violation of Twitter's policies on unlawful use. In recent days they posted a list of 9,200 suspect accounts.   #Targets #IceIsis https://t.co/407rOTDyd4 https://t.co/RbgTzF8C8u https://t.co/E9HixQOh00 -- CtrlSec - 0 (@CtrlSec0) March 24, 2015   Some are calling it the battle of Anonymous vs. ISIS.   ''We won't stop spamming ISIS accounts until all members/supporters of ISIS are off Twitter,'' said a hacker identified by the screen name IS Hunting Club.   The hackers exhort other users to report the accounts to Twitter, and Twitter, which says it does not censor or proactively monitor message traffic, then decides whether to terminate the accounts.   When a suspect account is terminated, vigilantes celebrate by posting the account name and affixing the term ''#TangoDown'' -- the same language used by antiterrorist commandos when they score a kill.   #TangoDown @safya_7729 with 1673 followers has been suspended #OpAntiISIS #IceISIS #OpISIS pic.twitter.com/RjtUTVhjkV -- â[#x2dc]¢ The Doctor â[#x2dc]¢ (@iridium_black) March 24, 2015   How many Twitter users are reporting suspect accounts because of this collaboration is unclear. Whether this vigilantism is significantly suppressing the use of Twitter by the Islamic State also has yet to be understood.   Asked for comment about the vigilantism, Twitter said in an emailed statement: ''We review all reported content against our rules, which prohibit unlawful use and direct, specific threats of violence against others.''   But with the increased focus on use by the Islamic State, Twitter has suspended accounts at the rate of 2,000 per week recently, a company official said on condition of anonymity.   If the size of a Twitter account's following is any indication, the hacking group GhostSec has a considerable force of activists behind it, with 6,274 as of Tuesday. CntrlSec had 2,039.   The Islamic State's own cyberactivists have been anything but passive. They have threatened Twitter's founder, Jack Dorsey, and his employees with death, posting ominous messages including a decapitated blue Twitter bird, the company's icon.   People working on behalf of the Islamic State have taken countermeasures like distributing lists of hackers to help avoid detection and urging followers to change account names if they suspect an impending complaint.   In late February, jihadist accounts on Twitter began circulating a manual for bypassing Twitter requirements for the phone numbers and email addresses of users, the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamic militancy online, reported a few weeks ago.   J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution who recently completed a study of Twitter use by ISIS, said the campaign by vigilantes might be having some effect, although it was impossible to measure. The recently posted list of 9,200 ISIS accounts, he said, is ''the biggest catch they've put down.''   Mr. Smith of Kronos expressed skepticism, asserting that the Twitter system still has thousands of Islamic State users.   A few weeks ago, senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent a bipartisan letter to Twitter's chief executive, Dick Costolo, urging him to increase efforts to combat groups like the Islamic State. ''Companies need to ensure that their social media services are not being hijacked for terrorist use,'' wrote Representative Ed Royce, the committee chairman.   Twitter's general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, responded in a letter, saying that the company had expanded its mechanisms for terminating accounts that violate its rules while preserving ''the ability of users to share freely their views -- including views that many people may disagree with or find abhorrent.''

"Activist Links Islamic State to 26,000 on Twitter","A cybersecurity activist who recently helped publicize 9,200 Twitter accounts that were said to be linked to the Islamic State released a roster of 26,382 accounts on Tuesday, the biggest such list yet. But the new list distributed by the activist, who goes by the Twitter name XRSone, appeared to be far from flawless.    It misidentified Al Jazeera's popular Arabic-language Twitter account as suspect, for example. Also erroneously listed, among others, were Zaid Benjamin, a Washington-based journalist with 82,300 followers who works for Radio Sawa, an Arabic-language broadcaster partly funded by the United States, and Yousef Munayyer, a prominent Palestinian rights advocate based in Washington, with 23,400 followers.    Reached late Tuesday by email, XRsone said the erroneously included accounts had been removed. He also said he believed that the list still ''has a high accuracy,'' and that his intent was to show that more could be done to expunge Islamic State supporters from Twitter, where by some estimates they have registered as many as 90,000 accounts.   The release of the list was part of a loosely organized effort by online opponents of the Islamic State, including well-known hacking groups like Anonymous as well as individuals, to expose what they call the Islamic State's brazen exploitation of Twitter for spreading its propaganda.   The Islamic State -- also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh -- has used Twitter to glorify beheadings, immolations and enslavement of enemies, pillaging of artifacts, and threats to foes of the group's self-described caliphate straddling Syria and Iraq.   ''Look through these accounts, you will see complete disregard for human life,'' the activist wrote in a blog post, titled ''Social Media War Machine,'' that included an embedded link to the list.   Anti-ISIS hackers and other online activists have been encouraging Twitter users to report suspected ISIS accounts to Twitter's violations department in order to have them suspended.

But Twitter does not do its own preventive policing or scrubbing of accounts, adhering to a free-speech policy that has aroused considerable criticism in the face of the Islamic State's extensive use of its network, which carries roughly 500 million messages a day in multiple languages.   In telephone and email exchanges, XRSone, who spoke on condition that his real name not be used because of death threats, said the new list contained roughly 10,000 active accounts and more than 15,000 that had been suspended.   He said the list, derived by a computer program that tracks account information including creation date, number of followers and language used, ''scrapes these names all on its own.''   He conceded that the list may contain ''false positives'' like the Al Jazeera Arabic account, which has nearly 4.6 million followers, but contended that such instances were the exception.   He said that while the list has a high degree of accuracy, ''it is a computer powered tool with a lack of discretion for each individual account,'' he said.   The program also checks Twitter for one-letter or one-number variants of defunct accounts, the activist said, which he called a common strategy by Islamic State users to rejoin Twitter if their accounts had been suspended.   XRSone contended the program showed that Twitter's ''suspension policy isn't really effective -- the problem never improves.''   Experts on the Islamic State's online presence had differing reactions to the new list. Some saw such an effort as potentially rife with inaccuracies, while others called it an understandable reflection of a growing online backlash against impunity for the Islamic State.   ''The public's interest in counterterrorism efforts is to be encouraged, and these efforts increasingly involve monitoring and thwarting the exploitations of social media platforms by terrorist groups like the Islamic State,'' said Michael S. Smith II, principal and chief operating officer of Kronos Advisory, a security consulting firm.   J.M. Berger, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a study on the Islamic State's use of Twitter published on March 5, expressed skepticism about the methodologies used for creating such lists. ''These things are not always as advertised,'' he said.    "
TV Network in France Returns to Air After Hacking,"PARIS --  The French television broadcaster TV5 Monde was back on the air Thursday, a day after hackers claiming to support the Islamic State militant group carried out a wide-ranging cyberattack on the network. The attack prompted strong reactions from the French government, which called on the nation's media outlets to remain vigilant.    The network was able to completely resume normal broadcasting around 6 p.m. Earlier in the day, it regained control of its social media accounts and put its website back online.    In a video published on TV5 Monde's Facebook page early Thursday, Yves Bigot, the network's director, said that the ''extremely powerful'' cyberattack started at 10 p.m. Wednesday.   The French Network and Information Security Agency, which operates under the authority of the prime minister to prevent and defend against cyberattacks, called the breach ''serious'' and said it had sent computer security experts to assist TV5 Monde. ''This morning we had sent four people, and in view of the situation, that team was strengthened,'' said Clémence Picart, a spokeswoman for the agency. ''Now we have 13 people on location who are with the TV5 Monde teams in order to understand the attack and put an end to it.''   A group calling itself the CyberCaliphate claimed responsibility for the attack, using the same name as hackers who took over the social media accounts of the United States Central Command in January and hacked into Newsweek's Twitter feed in February.   The claim of responsibility has not been confirmed, and French journalists who cover technology noted that it was difficult to determine whether the CyberCaliphate had been involved.   Prime Minister Manuel Valls condemned the cyberattack on Twitter, calling it an ''unacceptable attack on freedom of information and of expression.'' The Paris prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation.   On Thursday evening, the culture and interior ministers met with the heads of French broadcasters to discuss ways to prevent such attacks in the future. At a news conference after the meeting, the interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said that many elements pointed to the idea that a ''terrorist act'' was the cause of the cyberattack. But he said it was too early to say who exactly had been behind it.   Fleur Pellerin, the culture minister, said the French news media had to remain careful about potential flaws and vulnerabilities in their broadcasting and internal communication systems. ''We cannot rule out that similar attacks might happen yet again, that they might already be planned,'' Ms. Pellerin said at the news conference.   TV5 Monde is a French-language television network based in Paris that broadcasts news, feature programs and movies globally.   Media organizations in France are appealing targets, said Damien Leloup, a technology writer for the French newspaper Le Monde, because of their prominence online. In January, supporters of the Syrian government were able to penetrate Le Monde's Twitter account, and he said that other media were likely to suffer similar attacks.   ''If you can get on the Twitter account of Le Monde or Le Figaro or Libération, you have hundreds of thousands of followers, and you don't have so many companies in France with such big networks, so those media are tempting targets,'' Mr. Leloup said.   TV5 Monde was a particularly attractive target because it is widely watched in the French-speaking parts of Africa, and taking over its broadcasts and social media accounts could be a way to reach a large audience with a political message, Mr. Leloup said.   Screenshots of the hacked websites and social media accounts of TV5 Monde showed banners reading ''I am ISIS,'' a reference to the ''Je suis Charlie'' slogan that became popular after the January attacks in and around Paris that left 20 people dead, including three gunmen, one of whom claimed links to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In the week after those attacks, the French authorities reported a surge of cyberattacks by Islamist hackers against about 19,000 French websites.   A screenshot of TV5 Monde's hacked Facebook page showed a statement, purportedly by the CyberCaliphate group, that said President François Hollande had made ''a great mistake'' in supporting the American-led military coalition carrying out airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. ''That's why Parisians received January 'gifts,' '' the statement said.    "
Fighting Cyberattacks: A Financial Industry View," To the Editor:    Re ''Shortcomings of Cybersecurity Bills'' (editorial, May 14):   The ''shortcomings'' referred to in this editorial are in fact critically important legislative fixes that will empower businesses and government agencies with the best information to protect consumers and stay ahead of the rapidly evolving and increasingly malicious nature of cyberattacks.    Businesses and government need the ability to learn from each other regarding the nature and location of cyberattacks. This sharing of information will enable the public and private sectors to continually improve network security and protect Americans' information from cybercriminals.   To be clear: The goal is not to share personally identifiable information about clients. Our goal is the exact opposite: to protect Americans' sensitive information from threat or destruction. All of us -- industry, government and consumers -- are aligned in our effort to thwart criminal behavior.   Unfortunately, there are currently too many roadblocks that prevent businesses and government from learning from each other. Liability protections must be put in place so that businesses that share or receive cyberthreat information, or act proactively to prevent an attack, do not find themselves in violation of the law.   This is not about broad surveillance, hypothetical threats or uninformed action. We're talking about real, specific intelligence about threats. Cybersecurity legislation must move forward.   KENNETH E. BENTSEN Jr.   President and Chief Executive   Securities Industry and Financial   Markets Association   Washington    The letter was also signed by the leaders of the Financial Services Institute, the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Forum and the Financial Services Roundtable.

Senate Rejects Measure to Bolster Cybersecurity,"WASHINGTON --  On the heels of a vast breach of the personal information of federal employees, the Senate failed Thursday to advance a cybersecurity measure, the third time in three years that a bipartisan effort to tackle the problem has fallen victim to procedural actions. The measure, which failed, 40 to 56, was similar to an expansive bill passed by the House two months ago that would push companies to share access to their computer networks and records with federal investigators.     Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, attached the cybersecurity measure to a larger defense policy bill, hoping its complexity and broad bipartisan support would counter President Obama's threat to veto that measure. Democrats objected to the move and voted against the cybersecurity measure as a result.    Mr. McConnell, who said that Republicans had appended the cybersecurity measure to the defense bill out of a sense of urgency, excoriated Democrats from the Senate floor. ''The need for this smart, bipartisan, transparent measure couldn't be clearer,'' he said, adding, ''That hasn't stopped some Democrat leaders from thinking they should try to score political points by taking down a bipartisan measure to combat cyberattacks.''   The fight -- surfacing two weeks after a government surveillance program lapsed while Congress wrangled over changes to it -- underscored the difficulties Mr. McConnell faces in pushing his agenda with a narrow but diverse Republican majority and an aggressive Democratic minority schooled in the procedural practices Mr. McConnell used when he was in their position.    The fight over the cybersecurity bill also reflects the escalating rift between Republicans and the White House and Democrats over how to raise strict spending caps imposed in 2011 that are finally affecting a broad array of government programs.    Republicans want to use an emergency war funding account that is not subject to those limits to exceed caps on military spending. They have done so in a broad policy bill, shifting $38 billion in war funds into the department's regular operating budget.    Democrats and Mr. Obama, who argue for increased spending on nonmilitary programs, have denounced that as a gimmick and have threatened to filibuster or veto the bill. Democrats ''packed the car for their filibuster vacation, and they're ready to hit the road,'' Mr. McConnell snipped on the Senate floor.    To avoid that outcome on the defense bill, Republicans added the cybersecurity measure to it, mistakenly thinking that would compel Democrats to fall in line. The strategy backfired, leaving the United States without a comprehensive cybersecurity policy.    Data for least four million current and former government workers held by the Office of Personnel Management was recently compromised in an intrusion that appeared to target Social Security numbers and other personal information. Though the White House has not identified who it believes is responsible, federal officials say the intrusion apparently originated in China, and Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, asserted as much on Thursday, referring to it on the Senate floor as ''the hacking that the Chinese did.''    The private sector has been clamoring for a federal response in light of recent attacks that helped sink a major motion picture release by Sony Pictures Entertainment, exposed the credit card numbers of tens of thousands of customers of Target stores and compromised the personal records of millions of people who did business with the health insurer Anthem.   Policing the nation's computer networks has been complicated over the last decade by concerns from Republicans, who expressed reservations about burdens placed on the private sector, and from privacy advocates in both parties. The bills before Congress would not directly address the attack on the Office of Personnel Management systems, which resulted from a series of missteps that included the use of outdated detection technology, a failure to employ basic authentication techniques most Americans use for online banking, having not acted on previous security recommendations, and a lack of encryption on the data.   However, the attack bore a similar signature as those on two insurance companies and underscored the overall need for Congress to advance new policies, experts said.    ''It is as clear as a bell to me that this is case and point in favor of information sharing,'' said Paul Kurtz, who worked on the issue under in the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, and is the chief executive of TruStar, which aids companies in information sharing. ''It is really terribly unfortunate that this measure failed because of the politics on Capitol Hill.''   In a letter Thursday to Katherine Archuleta, the director of the personnel agency, the head of the largest government employee union said the agency's failure to encrypt government workers' Social Security numbers constituted ''a cybersecurity failure that is absolutely indefensible and outrageous.''    The breach, wrote J. David Cox, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, ''represents an abysmal failure on the part of the agency to guard data that has been entrusted to it by the federal work force.''   Mr. McConnell and Mr. Reid sparred over the measure in nasty terms Thursday, with an odd twist: Mr. McConnell did so while dressed in genteel seersucker as part of a celebration of the fabric in the Senate. For his part, Mr. Reid implored Mr. McConnell to go to his ''little bathroom'' at the Capitol and ''look in the mirror, because over that mirror, he should be able to see the words hypocrisy and cynicism.''   Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said Thursday that the White House was disappointed, adding that Congress was ''more interested in playing politics than they are in actually making sure that we have all the tools we need to protect the American people from cyberhacks.''

Use of Mobile 'Supercookies' Is Seen as a Threat to Privacy,"For the last several months, cybersecurity experts have been warning Verizon Wireless that it was putting the privacy of its customers at risk. The computer codes the company uses to tag and follow its mobile subscribers around the web, they said, could make those consumers vulnerable to covert tracking and profiling. It looks as if there was reason to worry.    This month Jonathan Mayer, a lawyer and computer science graduate student at Stanford University, reported on his blog that Turn, an advertising software company, was using Verizon's unique customer codes to regenerate its own tracking tags after consumers had chosen to delete what is called a cookie -- a little bit of code that can stick with your web browser after you have visited a site. In effect, Turn found a way to keep tracking visitors even after they tried to delete their digital footprints.    The episode shined a spotlight on a privacy issue that is particularly pronounced at Verizon. The company's customer codes, called unique ID headers, have troubled some data security and privacy experts who say Verizon has introduced a persistent, hidden tracking mechanism into apps and browsers that third parties could easily exploit.    While Internet users can choose to delete their regular cookies, Verizon Wireless users cannot delete the company's so-called supercookies.   ''Verizon is not in a position to control how others use its header,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''There's no doubt that this particular approach does introduce new privacy problems.''   Websites, digital advertising networks and online analytics services have for years placed bits of code in people's browsers to follow their online activities and show them advertising tailored to their interests. Verizon uses its customer tags to put subscribers into advertising categories, among other things.   In a recent interview, Praveen Atreya, a Verizon technology director who helped develop the technology behind the mobile marketing program, said the company's unique header was not intended for use by other companies to remember its subscribers or recover information about them.   Indeed, after a report on the practice by ProPublica, Turn announced it would suspend its use of Verizon's ID codes to regenerate tracking cookies and reconsider its use of the technique.   ''We feel this practice is legal,'' Max Ochoa, Turn's chief privacy officer, said in a phone interview. ''But given people's concerns, as soon as we get the new codes rolled out, we will suspend this practice.''   Telecommunications companies had long avoided selling information about their customers' activities because a federal law classified them as ''common carriers,'' akin to public utilities; the category is subject to strict data-privacy rules.    But in 2007, the Federal Communications Commission decided that the privacy regulations governing telephone communications need not apply to the wireless Internet service provided by phone carriers.   Online behemoths like Facebook and Yahoo, along with consumer database marketers like Acxiom and BlueKai, already enabled advertisers to target narrow customer segments, like 30-something men who earn more than $200,000 and are in the market for luxury cars. But the F.C.C.'s ruling paved the way for wireless providers to do likewise.   Verizon is now at the forefront of telecommunications companies selling intelligence about their customers to advertisers. AT&T experimented last year with a similar ad-targeting program, which involved inserting a unique numeric code into a subscriber's web requests. But after scrutiny in the news media, AT&T said it was halting its program, at least until it came up with a better approach.   The ad-targeting experiments by Verizon and AT&T are striking examples of the data-mining opportunities open to phone carriers now that they have become the nexus of the information universe, providing a connection to the Internet for people anywhere they go, at any time.   Verizon's marketing efforts are part of a high-frequency digital ad trading system called real-time bidding, in which many kinds of players track and analyze users' online activities to identify the characteristics of those who would be most receptive to certain ads.   A Verizon service called Relevant Mobile Advertising, for instance, combines details obtained from information resellers like Acxiom and Experian with the wireless carrier's own data to classify its mobile subscribers by gender, income, interests or other criteria; the company allows its subscribers to opt out of receiving ads customized through this program.   Another service, called Verizon Selects -- which consumers can opt in to in exchange for reward points -- segments subscribers based on their web browsing and use of apps.   Verizon says its customer categorization programs offer an advantage to advertisers because the company has a direct relationship with subscribers and it can understand their general location based on the places from which they make calls or send texts. The services use a unique alphanumeric code for each subscriber, rather than real names or contact information, to group them into ad clusters. Mr. Atreya, the Verizon director, says the company changes these customer codes every few days.   ''The intent was to provide a safe vehicle for us to be able to share information with our partners in the web ecosystem,'' Mr. Atreya said.   Verizon uses these ID tags to sell intelligence about its subscribers. Turn, a Verizon customer that works on behalf of advertisers or their agencies, can sync its own alphanumeric tracking codes with those Verizon tags.   Advertisers place orders with Turn to show ads to a specific audience, such as young suburban mothers or surfers who live near beaches. When Turn's system sees tags identifying users in those consumer clusters, it can place bids in electronic auctions to show those groups digital ads. Turn's system sees one million such bid opportunities a minute.   ''Verizon is one of many data partners,'' said Paul Alfieri, Turn's senior vice president for marketing. ''It's up to the advertisers to say, 'We're willing to pay for 10 data vendors to get that needle in a haystack,' or 'No data vendors.' ''   The controversy over Verizon's supercookie only worsened after Mr. Mayer at Stanford reported that Turn had been using the carrier's customer codes for an additional purpose: to regenerate its own tracking cookies after users had deleted them.   Mr. Atreya said he had not been consulted.   ''They did not talk to me. If they did, I would not have been satisfied,'' Mr. Atreya said.   Verizon was still evaluating its ad-targeting system, he said. He added that the company was considering allowing its subscribers to opt out of being tagged with its undeletable customer codes.   Some leading data-privacy and security experts contend that Verizon's use of unique and persistent customer ID tags makes its subscribers vulnerable to covert online tracking by third parties.   Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that focuses on information policy, said Verizon's use of supercookies highlighted the need for stronger privacy laws regulating wireless Internet services.   The practice has given ammunition to supporters of net neutrality -- the idea that the Internet should be a level playing field for companies of all sizes -- who have lobbied the F.C.C. to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers.    If that happens, it could prohibit carriers like Verizon from selling intelligence about its customers for ad-targeting purposes.   ''Stuff like this is worse than what Google or Facebook or anyone else does,'' Mr. Feld said. ''I can avoid Google and Facebook, in theory at least. But if the network operator is going to spy on me, there is nothing I can do about it.''    "
"Limit 'Right to Be Forgotten' to Europe, Panel Says","LONDON - Europe's so-called right to be forgotten should apply only in Europe. That was the recommendation published on Friday by an eight-person committee set up by Google to provide guidance over how the search giant should comply with a landmark privacy ruling in the 28-member bloc.  The committee can only provide recommendations to Google and does have the power to force the company to change its operations. It also does not have any legal powers in Europe, where countries' data protection authorities will make the final decisions on how the privacy ruling should be enforced. The ruling by Europe's highest court, published in May, said that anyone with connections to Europe could ask Google and other search engines to remove links about themselves from online searches. Yet while Google has tried to limit the privacy decision solely to its European domains like Google.fr and Google.de, many of Europe's data protection watchdogs have called on search engines to apply the right-to-be-forgotten decision to their worldwide domains, including Google.com. The standoff has divided Europe, where an individual's right to privacy is almost on par with freedom of expression, and the United States, where the First Amendment remains paramount. And a number of recent legal challenges have attempted to force Google to apply Europe's take on privacy across its global operations. Inits report, the group of privacy and freedom of speech advocates sided with Google, saying the privacy ruling should be limited to Europe. ""We believe that delistings applied to the European versions of search will, as a general rule, protect the rights of the data subject adequately,"" the committee said, noting that roughly 95 percent of web searches in Europe are funneled through Google's regional domains. The group said that other interests, including the right of others outside the European Union to access online information, also must be considered. The committee said that Google's efforts to remove links - it has so far taken down roughly 40 percent of the 767,000 link requests, according to its latest transparency report - represented a fair implementation of what Europe's highest court had demanded when outlining the privacy ruling last year. ""There is also a competing interest on the part of users within Europe to access versions of search other than their own,"" the committee added. Yet not everyone on the advisory group agreed with limiting the right-to-be-forgotten decision to just Europe. Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, a former German federal justice minister, said Europeans' right to privacy must be enforced worldwide. ""Since E.U. residents are able to research globally, the E.U. is authorized to decide that the search engine has to delete all the links globally,"" she wrote in the report. In contrast, Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, who also was part of the advisory group, said Europe's ruling, which forces Google to initially decide whether to remove links to online content, was fundamentally flawed and potentially hampered people's access to online information. ""I completely oppose the legal situation in which a commercial company is forced to become the judge of our most fundamental rights of expression and privacy,"" Mr. Wales wrote. ""The recommendations to Google contained in this report are deeply flawed due to the law itself being deeply flawed."" "
White House Proposes Broad Consumer Data Privacy Bill,"The Obama administration on Friday proposed a wide-ranging bill intended to provide Americans with more control over the personal information that companies collect about them and how that data can be used, fulfilling a promise the president had talked about for years. But some privacy advocates immediately jumped on the proposed legislation, saying it failed to go far enough, particularly given the broad statements President Obama had made on the issue. They said the bill would give too much leeway to companies and not enough power to consumers.     There are already a number of federal laws, like the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Video Privacy Protection Act, that limit how companies may use certain specific consumer records. The new proposed bill, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights Act, is intended to fill in the gaps between those statutes by issuing some baseline data-processing requirements for all types of companies.   ''It applies common-sense protections to personal data collected online or offline, regardless of how data is shared,'' the Obama administration said in a statement on Friday, ''and promotes responsible practices that can maximize the benefits of data analysis while taking important steps to minimize risks.''   The proposal, at its core, calls on industries to develop their own codes of conduct on the handling of consumer information. It also charges the Federal Trade Commission with making sure those codes of conduct satisfy certain requirements -- like providing consumers with clear notices about how their personal details will be collected, used and shared.   Companies that violate those requirements could be subject to enforcement actions by the commission or by state attorneys general.   The administration's proposal, considered a discussion draft, would need a congressional sponsor before it could be officially introduced. Already, though, industry analysts said that the proposal, along with several other legislative efforts on commercial privacy, was unlikely to be enacted in a Republican Congress.   The White House effort comes during heightened public awareness about both government and commercial data-mining. And the proposal drew sharp reactions.   Some prominent legislators and privacy law scholars said the administration's effort failed to endow citizens with direct and clear legal rights to control who collects their information and how they use it. And the bill, they say, largely puts companies in charge of defining their own criteria for fair and unfair use of consumers' personal details.   ''Instead of codes of conduct developed by industries that have historically been opposed to strong privacy measures, we need uniform and legally enforceable rules that companies must abide by and consumers can rely upon,'' Senator Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been investigating consumer-profiling companies called data brokers, said in a statement on Friday.   Companies like Acxiom, a database marketer in Little Rock, Ark., for instance, help marketers target individual consumers by estimated household income, ZIP code, race, ethnicity, social network or interests like ''smoking/tobacco'' or ''gaming-casino.''   Experian Marketing Services, another marketing company, uses data-mining to  stratify consumers into socio-economic clusters with names like ''small town, shallow pockets'' and ''diapers and debit cards.''    Armed with that kind of information, advertisers might, say, send smokers ads for the latest air filters. But in a report last year on data brokers, the Federal Trade Commission warned that such profiling could be also used in ways that could ''adversely impact consumers.'' Third parties, regulators wrote, could potentially use brokers' information on smokers to decide whether someone was ''a poor credit or insurance risk, or an unsuitable candidate for employment or admission to a university.''   The report called on Congress to enact legislation to protect this kind of volatile information by, among other things, requiring companies that serve consumers to obtain consent from individuals before collecting such sensitive details about them.   While the White House's proposal does not explicitly require companies to obtain affirmative consent to collect health information, it does call on companies to give individuals reasonable means to control the use of their personal data, depending on the context and ''in proportion to the privacy risk.''   Microsoft heralded the draft bill as a welcome first step in improving consumer trust in how companies handled their information.   ''The White House framework tackles issues that are crucial to build trust and foster innovation,'' Brendon Lynch, chief privacy officer of Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Friday. ''Not all will agree with every aspect of the proposal -- some will say it goes too far, while others will say it doesn't go far enough -- but it's a good place to start the conversation.''    But some privacy advocates warned against the bill's reliance on industry-developed codes of conduct. The process, they contended, would allow companies to define for themselves whether their data-use policies constituted privacy risks to consumers. They also said the bill offered companies loopholes that would help them avoid giving consumers meaningful control over their records and make it difficult for federal regulators to enforce the legislation.   ''While it claims to provide rights to consumers, behind its flimsy policy curtain is a system that gives real control to the companies that now gather our information,'' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.   A few privacy law scholars said that the draft bill could undermine protections consumers already had. If enacted as currently written, for instance, it could pre-empt stronger laws in a few states that require companies to obtain consumers' explicit consent before collecting unique biometric information like fingerprints or facial scans.   ''It would override state statutes that give people more protection,'' said Alvaro M. Bedoya, executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center. ''It would be a significant setback for privacy.''    "
Verizon Wireless Customers Can Now Opt Out of 'Supercookies',"Verizon Wireless customers now have the ability to completely opt out of the phone carrier's controversial ad-targeting program that tagged users with undeletable tracking codes, which critics called ""supercookies.""  The company announced in January that it planned to provide a complete opt-out of the program. Verizon said  Tuesday that its systems have now been changed to stop inserting the unique identifier, referred to as a UIDH, for customers who don't want to be in the program.  In the past, Verizon allowed users to unsubscribe from the marketing side of the program, but they had no option to disable being tagged with the customer codes. Some security researchers quickly illustrated that third parties, like advertisers, could easily exploit Verizon's persistent tracking to continually follow a user's web browsing activities.  In a statement, Debra Lewis, a Verizon spokeswoman, said privacy is a ""central consideration"" for the company when it develops new products and services.  ""As the mobile advertising ecosystem evolves, and our advertising business grows, delivering solutions with best-in-class privacy protections remains our focus,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""As a reminder, we never share information with third parties that identifies our customers as part of our advertising programs. In January, four Democratic members of the Senate's powerful Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation sent a letter to Verizon's chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, demanding an explanation for the company's data security and privacy practices. Shortly after, Verizon said it would provide a complete opt-out. But privacy advocates continue to press Verizon. Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, encouraged Verizon to go a step further.  ""This is an improvement, but it doesn't do nearly enough,"" he said. ""Verizon should discontinue its header injection program, or at a minimum make it opt-in.""  Verizon's Ms. Lewis said customers may log in to their accounts to change their participation in the company's data collection programs - whether it's opt-in or opt-out - in the privacy section of the company's website.

In Europe's Cross Hairs," Microsoft   RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN: Microsoft, which operates the Bing search service, signaled in July 2014 that it planned to follow the lead of Google, which responded to the May 2014 high court ruling by creating an online form that lets individuals request removal of links to material.     ANTITRUST: In a long-running antitrust case, the company paid almost ?2 billion in European fines over a decade.    Apple     ANTITRUST: European competition officials confirmed in April that they had sent questionnaires to music labels and rival music streaming companies in an attempt to gather evidence and decide whether to open an antitrust investigation into Apple's new music service.   TAXATION: European antitrust officials opened an investigation in June 2014 into whether Ireland gave preferential tax treatment to Apple.    Facebook     DATA PRIVACY: French, Italian and Spanish privacy officials announced in early April that they had opened investigations into the social network's privacy policies; similar inquiries have already been started by Dutch, Belgian and German officials. The regulators are asking whether Facebook gained sufficient approval from users when it gained access to their online data.     Amazon     TAXATION: The European Union's antitrust office released a preliminary finding in January that a tax deal between Amazon and Luxembourg appears to amount to unfair state aid that may have enabled the company to underpay its taxes. Antitrust officials had opened the investigation in October 2014.    "
The Government's Consumer Data Watchdog,"When does the free flow of personal data benefit consumers, and when might it damage their pocketbooks? That question, at the heart of the debate over information economics and fairness, took center stage one day last month when Hal R. Varian, chief economist of Google, and Ashkan Soltani, chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission, participated in a conference on big data and privacy at the Temple University Fox School of Business in Philadelphia.    Before an audience of professors and business students, Mr. Varian, a professor emeritus at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley, described the potential upsides of price discrimination -- the practice of charging people different amounts for the same product, based on their age, location, creditworthiness or other details specific to them.    ''It is largely beneficial,'' Mr. Varian told the audience, citing examples like discount offers for seniors. He added, ''You charge higher prices to people who can afford to pay higher prices.''     The argument was not unfamiliar to Mr. Soltani, a former student of Mr. Varian's at Berkeley and a data privacy researcher whose work once helped the F.T.C. bring a landmark case against Google. But when it came time for his presentation, Mr. Soltani took the opposite stance, arguing that online data-mining is so opaque to consumers that it can lead to unfair financial treatment.    A few years ago, as a technical consultant for an investigative series in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Soltani related, he studied how a consumer-profiling company collected details about the specific car makes, models and colors that individual shoppers looked at online, as well as the dates and number of times they looked at each car. When those shoppers subsequently made appointments to see the cars, he said, the company shared details about their online activities with their local dealerships.    Knowing how interested a customer is in a specific car, Mr. Soltani said, could give car dealers an unfair advantage in price negotiations.    ''They are potentially able to extract higher prices,'' he told the audience.   (Mr. Varian and Mr. Soltani both said they were speaking for themselves, not for their employers.)   The Federal Trade Commission is responsible for protecting consumers from deceptive or anticompetitive practices by companies. It has long hired computer scientists, as well as technically minded lawyers, to work on investigations of individual firms.    But in 2010, in an effort to help regulators keep current with rapid advances in technology -- and understand the possible risks to consumers of novel uses of their data -- the agency created the position of chief technologist. And in just a few years, it has established a tradition of appointing gadflies to the post, experts who have poked holes in companies' assurances that they were keeping the public's personal details safe and private.   The commission first tapped Edward W. Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton, to serve as chief technologist; he came to the agency after discovering security flaws in voting machines that hackers could have exploited to steal votes. More recently, Latanya Sweeney, a professor of government and technology at Harvard, served in the role; she famously demonstrated that it was possible to reidentify patients by name in the nameless medical records that hospitals routinely released to researchers.    Mr. Soltani's worldview is similar to his predecessors', but his résumé is different. At 40, he is younger and does not have their Ivy League affiliations. He is a populist who has conducted research into online consumer tracking and profiling for several national newspapers and government agencies.    In 2014, he was part of a team at The Washington Post that won a Pulitzer Prize in public service for a series of articles examining government surveillance techniques brought to light by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden. (He has also worked as a researcher at The New York Times and provided technical assistance for the newspaper's ''You for Sale'' series on the data brokerage industry.)   Along the way, Mr. Soltani has earned a reputation as a forensic specialist able to explain complicated technical processes in plain terms that policy makers and ordinary souls can understand.   ''If the store you went into tracked everything you tried on and touched and then followed you to other stores, and the stores would all exchange notes, I think people would be uncomfortable with that and stop shopping,'' Mr. Soltani said at the conference in Philadelphia. ''But that is exactly what happens online.''   That kind of talk has not exactly endeared him to the online advertising industry. After Edith Ramirez, the chairwoman of the F.T.C., announced his appointment last fall, Politico ran a news item in which an executive at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry group, suggested that the agency was doing itself a ''disservice by hiring advocates.''   But Mr. Soltani's fans credit him with matter-of-factly elucidating the inner workings of web and mobile services.   In a previous job at the F.T.C., in 2010, Mr. Soltani worked on an investigation of Google Buzz, a social network, in which he helped commissioners and staff lawyers understand the technical differences between the company's public statements on user privacy and its actual practices. In 2011, regulators charged Google with deceptive privacy practices, contending that the company had enrolled Gmail users in its social network without offering them clear ways to opt out or control how the service shared their personal details. As part of a settlement with the agency, Google agreed to submit to regular, independent privacy audits for the next 20 years.   ''He's not a bomb thrower. He's very much, 'Here are the facts and that's why we're worried,' '' David C. Vladeck, a professor of law at Georgetown, said of Mr. Soltani. Professor Vladeck, a former director of the F.T.C. Bureau of Consumer Protection, added, ''For a small agency, you want somebody who is willing to stick to their guns when they're right.''   As chief technologist, Mr. Soltani has helped the F.T.C. create a new unit, called the Office of Technology Research and Investigation, to enable the agency to examine a wider array of emerging technologies -- including Internet-connected cars, connected home devices and mobile payment systems -- and their potential implications for data security and privacy. Mr. Soltani said he was also working on recommendations for industry practices that could help promote innovation and consumer choice.   A few weeks ago, for instance, the agency filed a complaint against Nomi Technologies, a retail-tracking company that uses mobile phone signals to monitor shoppers' movements in stores. According to the complaint, the company had failed to live up to its commitment to inform shoppers about its in-store surveillance and allow them to opt out.    Mr. Soltani subsequently wrote a blog post detailing technical solutions -- like sending notices and opt-out messages directly to shoppers' mobile phones -- that could address that information asymmetry.   It seems the free flow of information benefits consumers most when the information flows in both directions.    "
Our 'Sense of Resignation' About Data Collection,"When it comes to data privacy, Americans seem to have given up. At least, that's what a new study from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania suggests. Respondents in the study objected to data collection by businesses, Natasha Singer reports in The Times, even if that collection came with some sort of benefit for the consumer. Ninety-one percent said it wasn't fair for companies to collect data without their knowledge and give them a discount in return, and 55 percent said it wasn't acceptable for a store to use their data to serve them better.  But 65 percent of respondents said they accepted they couldn't control companies' collection of their data. A manager at a school yearbook company told Ms. Singer he didn't appreciate Uber collecting data on him when he wasn't actually hailing a car: ""I think it's none of their business where I am up until the moment when I elect to use their service."" However, he said, he'd keep using Uber because it was convenient. This may sum up the attitudes of a number of Americans. It's not so much that we're fine with companies collecting and using data on our buying habits, financial solvency, health status and even physical whereabouts. It's more that we assume this is now the cost of doing business and there's nothing we can do to change it. It's easy to blame ordinary Americans for being willing to sacrifice their privacy for mere convenience. But simply jettisoning a few apps isn't enough to really protect your data. To truly keep your information to yourself, you'd need to reject some of the most common ways Americans communicate with friends and family, find out information, and buy the things they want and need. Given this, it's easy to see why many view data collection with what the lead author of the Annenberg study calls ""a sense of resignation."" Some claim that young people don't care about privacy, and that concern about how companies use our data will soon seem passé. This may be true, but if the Annenberg study is any guide, it won't be because we're genuinely comfortable giving up a variety of information as part of every commercial interaction we have. It will be because companies have convinced us we have no choice. "
Overlooked at Apple in Defense of Privacy,"Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com Twitter: @fmanjoo Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, delivered a speech last week that raised some eyebrows in the technology industry. ''I'm speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information,'' said Mr. Cook, who was being honored by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy watchdog group.    His blistering defense of privacy, which he and other Apple executives repeated at the company's developer conference this week, was notable. It isn't every day that you hear a tech executive admit there is an opaque trade-off at the heart of his industry. We users give digital giants access to our most private information, and they shower us with technology we can't do without. It is an arrangement baked into every decision made in every boardroom in Silicon Valley, and it is a bargain that many of us are uneasy about. Now, finally, here was the leader of the world's most powerful company asking whether that deal is worth the trouble.    But while Mr. Cook raised awareness for digital privacy, his speech glossed over two main issues. For one, he neglected to mention that Apple also collects a great deal of data about how we use technology. While it has more protections for that data than many rivals, the company plainly states in its privacy policy that it does use private data in many ways, including to build and market its own products, and to build its own advertising network. Apple's most profitable devices sit at the center of a tech ecosystem teeming with businesses that collect our data -- and if those social networks, search engines and other free apps didn't exist, Apple's products would be far less useful.   Mr. Cook also failed to fairly explore the substantial benefits that free, ad-supported services have brought to consumers worldwide. Many hundreds of millions of people now have access to more information and communication technologies because of such services.   An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.   The fact that Apple goes out of its way to include free services like Google search in its iPhones and iPads suggests that it agrees with the rest of the tech industry -- and many users -- that ad-supported services can, on balance, be good for the world. The question to ask is not whether we should ever use those free services, but rather whether, when we do use them, we are given enough information and disclosure to be able to make those decisions rationally.   ''There are timeless principles around fair dealings with consumers,'' said Nuala O'Connor, the president and chief executive of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a tech-focused think tank. ''And the first and main thing is, does the customer know what's happening to them?'' She argued that if companies were transparent and honest about how they use people's data, customers could freely weigh the benefits and costs of online services.   In his speech to EPIC, Mr. Cook offered a much starker, and less practical, view of privacy. ''We don't want your data,'' he said. ''We don't think you should ever have to trade it for a service that you think is free but actually comes at a very high cost.''   That bold pronouncement got me wondering whether Mr. Cook uses a different iPhone from every iPhone that Apple has ever sold me. On my iPhone, Google is right there in the search bar, by default. Microsoft's Bing is built into Siri, and Facebook and Twitter beckon me from the sharing menu.   If Apple really didn't think that its customers should trade their data for free services, you'd guess that it would build its own ad-free web search engine for its devices. But Apple does not do so. Instead, it sells off the search bar to ad-supported search companies. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that Apple's current deal with Google is worth billions; at least indirectly, then, Apple benefits financially from Google's ad-gotten gains.   And that's not all. When I go to Apple's App Store, I'm presented with a bevy of free apps that are supported either in whole or in part by ads. This vibrant marketplace works in Apple's favor -- the more free apps there are, the more useful the iPhone becomes. That dynamic explains why, in 2010, Apple created iAd, its own advertising network meant to foster the ad-supported app marketplace. IAd lets marketers target users of Apple's devices based on their purchases from the iTunes store, purchases that Apple of course tracks by default. (You can use an ad-supported search engine like Google to find instructions for opting out.)   There's nothing terribly wrong with any of this. Yes, there are downsides to the ad-supported tech industry, and, yes, privacy advocates and tech insiders like Mr. Cook should continue to push the entire industry to more stringently protect our data. But it would be insane to argue that we haven't seen benefits in return for this data. Anyone who uses devices like the ones Apple makes can see that ad-driven businesses like Google, Facebook and Twitter have improved people's lives in major ways.   Among other things, ad-supported services give us instant access to more information than was ever stored in the entirety of the world's libraries just a few decades ago. They also create systems that allow for instant communication and organization between more than a billion people. They are helping to provide life-changing miniature computers, also known as phones, to people in developing nations for about $50 each. They've given us artificial-intelligence supercomputers that can instantly translate languages or recognize speech. And, indirectly, they're creating upcoming wonders like self-driving cars and balloons that wire up the globe in Internet access.   Mr. Cook is fond of arguing that ''when an online service is free, you're not the customer; you're the product.'' That view is simplistic because it overlooks the economic logic of these services, especially the idea that many of them would never work without a business model like advertising. Services like social networks and search engines get substantially better as more people use them -- which means that the more they cost to users, the worse they are. They work best when they're free, and the best way to make them free is to pay for them with another business that depends on scale -- and advertising is among the best such businesses.   Mr. Cook is right to promote Apple's privacy policies. Apple places more restrictions on the use of data than other tech companies. This has been especially true recently after Apple moved to institute more rigorous security measures after an embarrassing hacking last fall in which female celebrities' photos were stolen from their iCloud accounts.   Apple's newer privacy and security initiatives -- including its decision to encrypt your iPhone data by default in a way that makes it virtually inaccessible to the government -- are laudable. At its developer conference this week, executives made the case that they could create services based on data about how you use your phone without sending that data into the cloud for analysis. This, they argued, was far safer than Google's practice of combining all your activities into a single dossier housed online that could be used to create more services but also to help advertisers.   ''I'm not saying Apple is perfect, but I think on privacy Apple does compare favorably with Google,'' said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of EPIC, the group that honored Mr. Cook. Mr. Rotenberg pointed to a number of areas in which ad-supported Internet companies have played loose with users' privacy; Google, Facebook, Snapchat and Myspace have all signed settlements with the Federal Trade Commission after misbehaving with data.   But it is also worth noting that Google and Facebook do not actually sell people's data to advertisers, as Mr. Cook suggested they did in his EPIC speech. (As with Apple's ad system, they allow marketers to target you based on your profile.) In many areas of security and transparency, Google has been ahead of Apple. For instance, Google offered two-factor authentication of cloud-bound data before Apple did.   Apple's business model also comes at a cost. Services that are sold as part of its hardware are usually hampered by lock-in and limits of reach. IMessage and FaceTime promise end-to-end encryption, which will prevent anyone from ever snooping on your conversations. But iMessage and FaceTime work only with other Apple devices because Apple has little business interest in building encrypted chat for people who can't afford iPhones.   So what to do if your friends can't afford privacy? You're not out of luck. Apple has made it easy for you. If you're O.K. taking the risk, download an ad-supported messaging app from the iPhone's App Store.    "
French Regulator Wants Google to Apply 'Right to Be Forgotten' Ruling Worldwide,"LONDON - France's privacy watchdog on Friday called on Google to apply a European data protection ruling to its global domains or face financial penalties. The move relates to a decree from Europe's top court last year that allowed anyone with connections to the region to request that links about themselves be removed from search engine results. That so-called right to be forgotten ruling has pitted Google, whose search engine holds a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, against some of the region's privacy regulators.  The authorities want the ruling to apply to all of Google's domains, including Google.com, although the company contends that Europe's privacy legislation should apply only to regional domains like Google.de in Germany. French authorities are now increasing the pressure on the American company, saying that Google must apply the ruling across all of its domains in the next 15 days or face penalties including fines up to 300,000 euros, or almost $340,000. Last year  Google was fined (EURO)150,000 for failing to adhere to the country's rules in a separate privacy case. Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who leads the French data protection authority, has been a vocal campaigner to expand Europe's rules beyond the 28-member bloc. The region's privacy officials will meet in Paris next week to discuss a variety of data protection issues, including the right to be forgotten ruling and pending changes to Europe's privacy legislation. ""For Google, the answer is worldwide,"" said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, when questioned late last year about the scope of the European privacy ruling. ""If people have the right to be delisted from search results, then that should happen worldwide."" The French have also been the most active Europeans to request that links be removed from search engine results. Since the ruling last year, more than 55,000 requests from France have been submitted to Google, with about half of the links removed, according to the company's latest transparency report. Google said that, when applying the right to be forgotten ruling, it had tried to strike a balance between individuals' privacy and the right to gain access to online information. ""The ruling focused on services directed to European users, and that's the approach we are taking in complying with it,"" Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement. "
"Changes to How Uber Collects Data Should Be Barred, Privacy Group Says","A leading privacy rights group wants the Federal Trade Commission to prohibit Uber from instituting changes to its privacy policy that the group says will allow the ride-hailing app to collect more detailed data about customers' whereabouts and use their contact lists to send their friends promotional pitches. The move by the nonprofit research group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, is likely to garner the attention of Washington regulators and privacy watchdogs in the coming weeks, as Uber's changes are scheduled to take effect July 15.    In a letter sent to the agency on Monday morning, the group, which is known as EPIC and is based in Washington, said that Uber had ''a history of abusing the location data of its customers.'' EPIC said  in its complaint that the coming changes were unfair, deceptive and posed a ''direct risk'' of consumer harm.    ''A company that has a bad reputation for misusing personal information should not be allowed to change its policy so it can gather more data,'' Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of EPIC, said in a phone interview.   Uber on Monday said in a statement that there was ''no basis for this complaint.'' It added: ''We care deeply about the privacy of our riders and driver-partners, and have significantly streamlined our privacy statements in order to improve readability and transparency.''   The stakes could be high for Uber, which is based in San Francisco and has made completely clear its global aspirations to upend existing consumer transportation systems. To date, Uber has raised nearly $6 billion in venture capital and is valued at more than $40 billion; the company has plans to raise at least $1 billion more, according to a person with knowledge of the company's plans, which could value it at $50 billion.   In just five years, Uber has swelled to serve more than 300 cities in 57 countries, and works with tens of thousands of drivers who complete millions of trips a day for Uber.   Uber's reputation is still recovering from public censure last year after allegations surfaced that company employees had mishandled trip data about individual consumers to track their locations, and inappropriately shared an internal tool -- colloquially known as ''God view'' -- that showed users taking trips in real time. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, subsequently wrote a letter to Uber's chief executive, Travis Kalanick, saying, ''The reports suggest a troubling disregard for customers' privacy, including the need to protect their sensitive geolocation data.''   Aside from privacy watchdog groups, Uber is also under attack from coalitions of drivers who claim that the company is unfairly exploiting workers without employing them, using a so-called ''1099'' designation as contract workers. Last week, Uber received a flurry of attention after a former driver who sued the company for reimbursement of expenses was deemed an employee, not a contractor, by the California labor commissioner's office.   Uber's policy changes may have been intended to ward off government interference with its privacy practices. But the complaint from EPIC is likely to reignite public discussion over the service's use of customer data.   Among other things, the letter asked the F.T.C. to halt Uber's collection of any customer location details that are not required to deliver a service; to require Uber to delete location information once a ride has been completed; and to require Uber to publish specific details about the system it uses to profile and evaluate customers.   In a recent post on the Uber website, Katherine Tassi, Uber's managing counsel of data privacy, wrote that the updated policy was intended to more clearly and concisely explain the kinds of details the company gathered and how it used them.   ''In the interest of transparency,'' she cited two changes in particular: In addition to asking permission to obtain access to a customer's location when the Uber app is running in the foreground, the updated policy allows the company to ask for location details when its app is running in the background; the company may also ask for access to a user's contact list and use that information to send marketing promotions to contacts.   ''In either case, users will be in control,'' Ms. Tassi wrote. ''They will be able to choose whether to share the data with Uber.''   But the EPIC letter contended that Uber had deceptively reassured consumers that they would be in control of their data when the updated policy actually deprived them of that control.   The updated policy, for instance, says that even if consumers deny Uber access to their precise location information from their devices, it will not limit the company's ''ability to derive approximate location from your I.P. address'' -- which is the numerical address assigned to users' Internet connections and relayed when users visit an app or website. In other words, even if certain customers expressly decline to share their whereabouts, Uber's updated policy allows the company to collect some location information anyway.   ''With a cellphone, the I.P. address might get you a city or part of a city,'' said Jonathan Mayer, a computer scientist and lawyer at Stanford University. ''But, if you are using a landline address, that could in fact be incredibly precise -- to an exact address or part of a building, depending on how it is configured.''   Mr. Mayer said that his office I.P. address locates him on the fourth floor in a certain section of the Gates Computer Science Building at Stanford.   In the letter, EPIC also contended that Uber had deceptively suggested that users would have control over their contact lists. For instance, if people who use Android devices give Uber access to their contact list and use the app, the complaint says, they will not be able to rescind that permission.   The complaint also said that, by regularly sending ''unsolicited'' text messages to customers and people on their contact lists, Uber may be violating a federal law that prohibits making phone calls that involve ads or telemarketing without prior express written consent.   ''These updated statements don't reflect a shift in our practices; they more clearly lay out the data we collect today and how it is used to provide or improve our services,'' Uber said in its statement.   The F.T.C. generally reads letters from consumer groups. In the past, public complaints from groups with the stature of EPIC have put pressure on companies to change their practices. It was at EPIC's annual awards dinner this month that Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, delivered a speech rebuking the tech industry for poor data privacy and security practices.   ''We welcome complaints from consumers and consumer groups and review them carefully,'' said Justin Cole, a spokesman for the F.T.C.   He declined to comment on whether the agency was investigating Uber's privacy practices.    "
Google Fights Effort to Apply 'Right to Be Forgotten' Ruling Worldwide,"Google, the search giant, is gearing up for a fight in France. The company said Thursday that it would not comply with demands from the country's privacy regulator, who has said Google must apply a European data protection ruling to all of its global domains. The standoff relates to a legal decision by Europe's top court last year that allowed anyone with connections to the region to request that links about him or her be removed from search engine results.   This so-called right-to-be-forgotten ruling has pitted Google, whose search engine holds a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, against some of the region's privacy regulators. Other search engines, including Microsoft's Bing service, also must comply with the decision. Google has said it will remove links on its European domains like Google.fr in France, but will not apply the decision to its non-European domains, including Google.com. In response, several of Europe's privacy regulators - led by Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who heads the French data protection authority - have said that Google must remove links on its worldwide domains or face financial penalties. In a blog post published on Thursday, Peter Fleischer, the company's global privacy counsel, said that no country should control the type of online content available in other countries. Mr. Fleischer added that such practices could lead to multiple countries' trying to outdo one another with strict rules, which could eventually reduce all types of material that are available online. ""If the C.N.I.L.'s proposed approach were to be embraced as the standard for Internet regulation, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom,"" he wrote in the blog post, referring to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, the French privacy regulator. ""In the end, the Internet would only be as free as the world's least free place."" In a statement, the French regulator said it had received Google's statement, and that it would respond within the next two months. ""We note that Google's arguments are partly political,"" the regulator added. ""Those of C.N.I.L., in turn, were based strictly on legal reasoning."" The C.N.I.L. had given Google until the end of July to comply with its initial decision, which was announced in early June. The regulator has the power to issue one-time fines of up to 300,000 euros, or almost $330,000, to companies that fail to comply with its data protection rules. In 2014, for example, Google was fined (EURO)150,000 for failing to adhere to the country's rules in a separate privacy case. After not complying with the French regulator's initial demands to apply the right-to-be-forgotten decision to its global domains, Google is now expected to fight the case in local courts. That process could take several years. Since Europe's right-to-be-forgotten decision was first announced in May 2014, more than 60,000 requests have been made from France, more than from any other country. About half of those links in France were removed, according to Google's latest transparency report.  A number of other countries, including Russia, have proposed their own versions of the right to be forgotten, which has led campaigners for freedom of expression to warn that such decisions could limit what content is readily available online in these countries. "
France Rejects Google's Efforts to Limit Application of Privacy Ruling,"France's privacy watchdog just will not take no for an answer. On Monday, the country's data protection authority rejected Google's efforts to limit how a landmark European privacy ruling may be applied worldwide.  The ruling, handed down last year by Europe's top court, allows anyone with connections to Europe to request that global search engines remove links to items about themselves from search queries. Several European privacy regulators, particularly in France, have urged that this so-called right to be forgotten be applied to all of Google's search domains. In contrast, Google has argued that the privacy ruling should only apply to European websites like Google.de in Germany or Google.fr in France. The standoff took another turn on Monday after the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, or C.N.I.L., the French privacy watchdog, said that it had rejected Google's appeal for the ruling to be limited to Europe. The country's data protection agency said that limiting the privacy decision to just domains in Europe could be easily bypassed by individuals based in the 28-member European Union, which would nullify the court's privacy ruling. The watchdog also said that once Google had agreed to remove the links, the company was required to apply the decision across all of its domains, not just those in Europe. The French regulator rejected an assertion by Google that it was trying to extend French control over how people around the world retrieve online information. Google has said that France's efforts may lead other countries, particularly those governed by authoritarian governments, to try to gain similar control over global Internet access. ""Contrary to what Google has stated, this decision does not show any willingness on the part of the C.N.I.L. to apply French law extraterritorially,"" the agency said in a statement on Monday. ""It simply requests full observance of European legislation by non-European players offering their services in Europe."" The French privacy watchdog said that Google must now apply the privacy decision to its global domains or face fines that could total as much as $340,000. Google was fined $170,000 last year for failing to adhere to France's rules in a separate privacy case. A spokesman for Google was not immediately available for comment. The French regulator has emphasized that it does not want to control how people around the world surf the Web, yet Google and free-speech campaigners have balked at Europe's attempts to spread the right-to-be-forgotten ruling to other jurisdictions. In a blog post published in July, Peter Fleischer, Google's global privacy counsel, said that no country should control the type of online content available in other nations. He added that such practices could lead to multiple countries' trying to outdo one another with strict rules, which could eventually reduce all types of materials that are available online. France's efforts to regulate online privacy come as people in the country remain the most active in Europe when it comes to seeking the removal of online links about themselves. So far, more than 66,000 such requests based on almost 220,000 online links have been submitted by people living in France, the largest figure of any European country, according to Google's latest transparency report. "
Facebook to Appeal a Belgian Court's Ruling on Data Privacy,"Facebook intends to appeal a privacy ruling in Belgium that forces the social media giant to stop collecting digital information about people who are not its users. The ruling, announced late on Monday, is the latest in a number of European data protection cases that have engulfed Facebook, which collects reams of data on individuals' online activities to power its fast-growing digital advertising business.    Many of the Continent's data watchdogs, as well as the European Court of Justice, the European Union's highest court, have also taken a tough line on how American technology companies gain access to, manage and use people's digital information. The efforts are part of Europe's strict data protection rules that have enshrined an individual's privacy as a fundamental right on a par with freedom of expression.    In Monday's ruling, a court in Brussels said that Facebook could no longer collect and store online information from people in Belgium who do not have an account with the social network. The court said that Facebook did not have individuals' consent to gather the information.   The company had collected data on people's online activities -- both those of Facebook users and those of people who do not have Facebook accounts -- through so-called digital cookies. The cookies, tiny files that attach themselves to users' computers or smartphones, are embedded on Facebook pages and on those of other companies that have links to the social network though Facebook's ''like'' button.   Facebook will face daily fines worth up to $270,000 if it fails to comply with the court's decision, according to Belgian law.   In response, the company said that it had used cookies for more than five years without facing privacy complaints, and that it would now take its case to the Belgian Court of Appeal. But Facebook also said it would take steps to stop collecting online information about people in Belgium who do not use its site by the end of the week.   ''We are working to minimize any disruption to people's access to Facebook in Belgium,'' Sally Aldous, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement.   The case was filed this year by Belgium's data protection authority, which had balked at changes to Facebook's terms and conditions that would have given the company greater say over how it collected and used individuals' online information.   In total, five European privacy regulators -- from Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain -- are investigating whether the company's new privacy conditions run afoul of their countries' domestic data protection rules.   Facebook has fought to limit the impact of those investigations, saying that only the Irish data protection authority has jurisdiction over its new privacy conditions because Facebook's international headquarters are in Dublin. Roughly 80 percent of Facebook's 1.4 billion users outside North America are managed through its Irish base.   Despite the company's efforts to rely on the Irish data protection regulator, though, many of Europe's privacy watchdogs have sought an increasingly greater say in how digital information about their citizens is handled.   That position became stronger last month after the European Court of Justice gave national authorities greater powers over how companies like Facebook and Google store online data.   The court said that people's digital information, like social media posts or search histories, could no longer be transferred to the United States under a 15-year-old agreement known as safe harbor. The judges ruled that the United States did not offer sufficient protection for Europeans if their data was misused by companies or by government agencies.   As part of its decision, the court also said that Europe's national privacy authorities had the right to intervene if they believed their citizens' data was at risk when companies moved information outside national borders.   And in a sign that regulators are taking advantage of their new powers, the Continent's data protection authorities have demanded that Europe and the United States agree to a strengthened trans-Atlantic data transfer deal by early next year. If those efforts falter, regulators may start to fine companies that misuse Europeans' online information. American and European Union officials are trying to negotiate a new pact.    "
"Europe, Shaken by Paris Attacks, Weighs Security With Privacy Rights","As France comes to terms with its deadliest domestic attack since World War II, attention has quickly turned to whether European governments need to reassess how they collect, manage and use people's digital footprint. Already, European politicians are mulling new rules that would allow them to share airline passenger data across the 28-member bloc to identity potential terrorists. And new legislation in France and Britain is expected to give intelligence agencies further access to people's digital lives. That includes allowing French officials to tap phones and access emails without judicial review and forcing Internet providers in Britain to potentially hold individuals' communication data for a year so that agencies can review the records when necessary.    Yet European data protection advocates and lawmakers say the strong rules that limit how companies can handle information will likely remain in place, highlighting how Europe has separated how companies handle people's data from the needs of governments to protect national security. The region's tough privacy rules are enshrined as a fundamental right on par with freedom of expression.    ''Fundamental rights are just that, fundamental,'' said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. ''Of course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.''   In recent months, Europe's tough stance towards privacy has taken on greater importance for companies, particularly American tech giants. That includes attempts by some of Europe's data protection authorities to force search engines like Google to allow people anywhere in the world to ask for the removal of links about themselves from online queries when the information is deemed out of date or irrelevant. If granted, such requests would give Europe's privacy watchdogs greater say over how the Internet is policed anywhere in the world.   And in a landmark decision, the European Court of Justice, the region's highest court, ruled last month that a 15-year-old data-sharing agreement between Europe and the Unites States was invalid. The decision, in part, was based on the judges' view that Europeans did not have sufficient legal protection if their data was accessed unlawfully by American intelligence agencies when it was transferred outside of Europe.   Such challenges, says Mr. van Eijk, will only increase if European governments -- and overseas partners like the United States -- fail to balance the national security needs of accessing digital information with the region's civil liberties. After the Sept. 11 attacks, as well as attacks in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005, local authorities passed sweeping reforms to give national agencies greater powers to find, track and stop those who were planning future atrocities.   The region's mood about surveillance changed, though, after the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, who outlined in 2013 how United States and British intelligence agencies had gained widespread access to people's digital lives.   These disclosures have led to a series of legal challenges aimed at curbing the powers of American and European intelligence agencies. Advocates also have taken aim at companies, including several American tech giants like Facebook and Google, which have been accused of allowing access to their networks as part of the surveillance programs. The companies deny that they cooperated with these activities.   That push has led to stronger individual privacy protections demanded from companies, even though experts say Europe's national intelligence agencies continue conducting their own surveillance activities on their citizens and those outside their national borders. Last week, for instance, a Brussels-based court ruled that Facebook could not collect online data on people who did not use the social network in Belgium, though the company said it would appeal the ruling.   Many countries' intelligence services, privacy groups say, already have access to much of the Internet traffic in Europe and father afield, as long as there's sufficient oversight to these surveillance efforts. Others say it remains unclear whether increased powers, particularly access to encrypted online messaging services, would have thwarted the most recent attacks in Paris.   Yet in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, some say they believe the scales may tilt back toward national security, as evidenced by the recent push for expanded surveillance powers in Britain and France.   ''The French and British laws are now seen as the new status quo,'' said Claude Moraes, a British politician who is chairman of the civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee in the European Parliament. ''The political climate in Europe is changing.''   But some European lawmakers are already warning that expanded surveillance should not go too far. While governments have a duty to keep their citizens safe, these politicians say, allowing national intelligence agencies almost unfettered access to people's digital lives -- from their phone calls and texts to online search histories and social media posts -- could jeopardize Europe's hard-won civil liberties that may prove difficult to unwind.   ''If we go down this path, we would be falling into the trap of these terrorists who want to limit our freedoms,'' said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who had campaigned for greater limits on intelligence agencies' surveillance activities.   ''I'm afraid that governments want more and more powers when it's not proven that they would be effective in preventing future terrorism cases,'' he added.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Before Donating, Check Out Charities and Their Privacy Policies","Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.com As the year draws to a close, many people are considering charitable donations. But before writing a check or clicking to make an online donation, it's best to do some homework. American charities receive about a third of their donations during the holiday season, according to BBB Wise Giving Alliance, which evaluates nonprofits. And there are now more ways than ever to donate, via social media and mobile apps. But that also means there are more ways for questionable organizations to solicit money as well. And even legitimate charities vary in the way they protect donor privacy.    Some charities, for instance, may trade or sell donor contact information to other charitable organizations, or to marketing companies that sell donor lists, as a way to generate revenue. That's why, after making a donation, you may receive mailings or telephone calls from other groups you've never heard of.    That transfer of information may put off some donors, said Sandra Miniutti, vice president for marketing at Charity Navigator, which ranks charities on various criteria, including donor privacy policies. Donors give money to one charity ''out of the goodness of their heart,'' she said, '' but then they feel bombarded.''   Daniel Borochoff, president of CharityWatch, said charities sold information as a form of fund-raising, which can be positive. By allowing a group to sell your contact information, you're in effect increasing the impact of your donation: ''It's an important revenue stream for the charity.''   But, he said, charities should make their policies clear, so donors can make an informed decision. ''It's very much a personal preference,'' he said.   To reduce the chance of having your information sold, check the organization's profile on a charity watchdog site; Charity Navigator and BBB Wise Giving Alliance both factor a charity's donor privacy policies into their reports, and CharityWatch is adding donor privacy criteria early next year, Mr. Borochoff said. Or visit the charity's website directly, and see if its policy on donor privacy is easy to find and clearly stated. Make sure the policy is specific to donors, Ms. Miniutti said, not just a general website privacy policy.   The site should say whether it sells donor contact information, or whether it does so only with the donor's permission, charity watchdogs say. If the site has an ''opt out'' policy, be sure to opt out if you don't want your information traded.   Doing some research before donating can also help decrease the chances of becoming a victim of a swindle. The attorneys general in Nebraska and 21 other states have compiled a list of ''wise giving'' tips that advise consumers to be especially cautious when they are solicited by email or text, or on social media. Always visit the charity's website, or call it directly, they advise, to confirm that the request is legitimate.   Here are some questions and answers about protecting yourself when making a donation:   â- Does the size of my donation make a difference in how my personal information is treated?   It may, charity watchdogs say. Giving $5 here and there tends to increase the odds of your information being sold, because the charity may not consider you an important source of sustainable funds. Or the charity may seek to augment the small donation by selling the information to raise more money. It makes more sense to concentrate your giving on a few reputable, well-managed groups that you feel strongly about, which helps maximize the impact of your money. ''It's not like the stock market, where you want to have a diversified portfolio,'' said Mr. Borochoff of CharityWatch.   Some charities may protect the names of donors of large sums, while selling the names of others. Thomas Tighe, chief executive of Direct Relief, a medical assistance and disaster relief agency, said that nonprofit did not sell or trade donor information, no matter how much is given. ''Why would we treat our small donors any differently?'' he said, adding that it seemed unfair to penalize donors who may simply be less able to make a large donation.   â- Where can I check the tax-exempt status of a charity?   The Internal Revenue Service maintains a searchable list on its website.   â- Can I donate anonymously and still receive a tax deduction?   Yes. A ''donor-advised fund'' allows you to make a tax-deductible contribution to a fund, which in turn makes donations to charities. Large financial companies offer such funds, as do some private foundations, but the minimum contribution to establish one is typically $5,000 or much more. Charity Navigator offers an anonymous giving option for less affluent donors through its online ''Giving Basket,'' which allows users to give through a donor-advised fund operated by Network for Good; the minimum donation is $10, Ms. Miniutti said.    "
Europe's Justice Commissioner Prepares for a Difficult 2016,"By any standard, Vera Jourova has had a busy year. As the European commissioner of justice, Ms. Jourova, a 51-year-old Czech, just helped to complete the largest overhaul in the region's privacy rules in roughly 20 years. The changes, released late Tuesday, could have serious consequences for some of the world's largest tech giants like Google and Facebook, including potential fines of as much as 4 percent of companies' global revenues if they run afoul of Europe's tough data protection rules. Ms. Jourova has also been at the center of the region's somewhat stumbling response to a recent European court ruling that stopped companies from using a so-called safe harbor agreement to move online data between Europe and the United States.  Europe's policy makers have been trying to hammer out a new deal with their American counterparts, though both sides remain far apart on the access that United States intelligence agencies should have to Europeans' data and what type of legal remedies Europeans can take in American courts when their data is misused. Yet as Europe winds down for the end of the year, Ms. Jourova's in-tray already is filling up for 2016. Her most pressing task will be to complete a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement by the end of January. If a deal is not done by then, some of Europe's national privacy watchdogs have suggested they could start investigations into companies that they believe are not protecting their citizens' data. Already, a number of agencies, including the French and Spanish regulators, have sent letters to international companies reminding them of their obligations after the current safe harbor agreement was invalidated, according to legal counsels to a number of multinational companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. In an interview, Ms. Jourova said she still believed a data transfer deal could be reached by the end of next month, though she called on American authorities to give greater assurances that Europeans' data would be protected from potential abuse from private and government entities. ""A deal will only be made if there's an equitable approach in the United States,"" Ms. Jourova said, adding that she was scheduled to speak to her American counterparts at the Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission later this week. ""By the end of January, we will have enough commitments from Americans bodies that European data protection rules will be ensured on American soil."" Ms. Jourova must also calm nerves across the region after the completion of the new, tough data protection rules. Along with heavy sanctions, the overhaul enshrines the so-called right to be forgotten into European law and forces any company with European customers - even if it does not have headquarters in the 28-member European Union - to comply or face potential fines. Several trade groups representing the likes of Google and Microsoft already have raised concerns that Europe's new privacy rules might not be carried out uniformly. In a last-minute change, for example, Europe's policy makers said anyone under the age of 16 must get parental consent to use online services like Snapchat and Instagram, but also included a provision letting national governments reduce that threshold to 13 years old if they so choose. Companies also are concerned that the region's heavy sanctions for privacy abuses - say, when a company does not ask permission to use an individual's online information - may be pursued with different levels of vigor in some countries compared to others. Facebook, for instance, is facing five separate investigations - in France, Spain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands - over potential data protection violations. And under the new regime, privacy experts said, companies could face a lottery over how national regulators view the financial damages caused by such activities. For Ms. Jourova, Europe's new privacy rules must be uniform across the region, though she said the European Commission had work to do before the rules go into force in 2017 to educate regulators, companies and Europe's citizens about the current proposals. ""They are independent bodies and can do whatever they want,"" she said in reference to Europe's data protection authorities. ""But it would be a failure if they impose different sanctions for the same data breach."" "
"Key to Opting Out of Personalized Ads, Hidden in Plain View","It has been seen countless times, yet it may be the advertising industry's best-kept secret. What exactly is that small turquoise triangle, often in the upper right corner, that appears in many online ads? It is the logo for AdChoices, and the idea is that if consumers do not like the personalized ads they are seeing -- those that pop up based on information gathered from their browsing history or habits -- they can click on the symbol, and it will take them to a page that explains how they can opt out of seeing them.    The Digital Advertising Alliance, the organization behind AdChoices, likes to boast that the AdChoices logo is seen more than a trillion times every month and that it is ''a great, effective program that's one of its kind,'' said Lou Mastria, executive director of the organization. He added that there have been eight million unique opt-outs since AdChoices began.    But a study this year by the advertising agency Kelly Scott Madison found that while 26 percent of web users said they were familiar with the AdChoices logo, only 9 percent of those understood what it meant.   ''I think the intent of AdChoices was really good, and the purpose was very well intentioned, but the consumer education piece never happened,'' said Kay Wesolowski, digital media director of Kelly Scott Madison.   The AdChoices program was started in 2010 by the alliance, a group of more than 400 organizations and companies involved in the advertising industry.   Opting out does not necessarily stop companies from tracking users' information, but it does stop them from targeting those users with what are known as interest-based ads.   Privacy groups say the program is flawed.   ''It puts the burden on consumers, it's hard to use, and most people don't know what it does,'' said Claire Gartland, a consumer protection lawyer for the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center.    The reality is that most consumers are ambivalent: They want content to be free, which ads allow for, and many like targeted ads that speak to their interests. On the other hand, web users in general are very nervous -- and unclear -- about what information is being collected about them, Ms. Wesolowski said.   The idea behind AdChoices is that it provides an option to forgo the targeted ads.   It works like this: A user searches for, say, the best ice cream in New York. Up comes a Yelp page that also features an ad for Macy's, because the ice cream lover recently bought something online from the department store.   If users want to get rid of these targeted ads, they can click on the triangle -- its size is small so that it does not use up too much valuable ad real estate -- and will then be taken to a page from the advertising network that Macy's paid to place the ad. This page explains what AdChoices does and how to opt out of targeted ads.   There is also a page that tells users how many advertising networks are following them -- often many more than expected. A way to opt out of these networks is provided.   There is a technical hitch, though. If users decide at any point to delete all their cookies -- the small text files used to track web preferences -- then the AdChoices opt-out function, which is also a cookie, will be deleted. One way to ensure the opt-out stays on a browser is to click Protect My Choices on the choices page.   For some, the process seems too complicated.   ''It should take the average consumer a millisecond to opt out, rather than having to look around for the appropriate icon,'' said Julia Zukina, a lawyer who published a paper on the issue.   The Digital Advertising Alliance did offer a public education program a few years ago that largely emphasized the benefits of targeted ads; the ad campaign the group ran in 2012 and 2013 used the slogan ''Will the right ads find you?''   Mr. Mastria said his organization would begin a new education initiative next year. It offers an AdChoices app called AppChoices, which is available in English and Spanish.   He also pointed to another study released this year by Truste, a company that certifies websites for compliance with privacy standards. The study said that 37 percent of web users were aware of the AdChoices icon and that 19 percent of those aware of the icon (or 7 percent of the total) had clicked on it.   Tracking companies are collecting information primarily about hobbies and shopping tendencies, and not identifiable personal or financial information, Mr. Mastria said. Often, in fact, the tracker does not even know if someone bought a specific item from a retailer -- that is why people are sometimes shown ads for items they have already purchased.   But Ms. Gartland, the consumer protection lawyer, said the United States needed a system more like the European Union's, in which customers are notified that a website is using cookies to track them and the user needs to opt in. She said advertisers opposed an opt-in program because they would lose revenue, while Mr. Mastria said most consumers in the United States would not want the European model because they preferred targeted ads over more general ones and liked the convenience of the American system.   Consumers can install a plug-in in their browser that sends a signal to a website telling it not to track them, but not all websites honor that request, Ms. Gartland said.   Although AdChoices has many critics, ''At least now when people say, 'I'm tired of having ads following me around -- how do I get rid of them?' we have an answer,'' said JC Cannon, who worked for Microsoft for 16 years and is now an independent online-privacy consultant. ''We didn't have an answer 10 years ago. For the average consumer, this is the best available today.''    "
"Q&A: While in China, Protect Your Devices and Data","HONG KONG - China is one of the world's most dangerous Internet environments, with risks including government-sponsored on­line attacks, piracy and malware. Thomas Parenty, a former National Security Agency official who runs a security consulting firm, offered his views on how to ensure that devices and personal information stay safe in China. Here are excerpts.   Q.  What's the biggest threat for foreign firms in China? ­  A.  The biggest danger for companies comes from insiders: local staff, suppliers or partners. What really makes the biggest impact on Western companies is they share key information with local partners with whom they cooperate without taking adequate precautions regarding digital control over that information.  Q.  What kind of mistakes do you see people making in trying to be secure in China? ­  A.  During sensitive meetings, organizers will sometimes insist that participants remove the SIM cards or batteries from their mobile phones because they have heard that hackers can use mobile phones to spy on meetings. But then everyone has a laptop in front of them, and the laptops  are probably more susceptible. So people address the smaller risk while neglecting the bigger risk.  Q.  If you're going on a business trip to China, what kind of precautions should be taken? ­  A.  Update all your software before you leave home. Then when you're in China, don't update any of your software. You should also enable whole disk encryption on all your devices. IOS and Android have it for smartphones, and Windows and Mac have it built in for computers. If you want to be extra paranoid, you can set a firmware or BIOS password. That makes it more difficult for someone who has  access to your computer, for example, in your hotel room, to boot your computer from a USB drive and bypass the encryption. Switching gears, you also want to make sure you have a VPN service that will protect you from anyone snooping on you in an airport lounge or hotel hot spot. A helpful list of personal VPNs currently working in China is at greycoder.com. "
"Encryption Is More Important, and Easier, Than Ever","SAN FRANCISCO - Twenty years after Netscape introduced encryption to web browsers to safeguard the private data of Internet users, roughly two-thirds of web traffic still moves on unprotected channels, according to research by Sandvine, a network equipment provider. Whether you visit Amazon's product pages, stream a movie from Netflix or read the tax rules on the Internal Revenue Service's website, marketers and hackers can snoop on everything you do.  But now, the computer industry and the United States government have embarked on a major, multifront campaign to have basic web encryption - known as HTTPS or TLS encryption - more widely adopted. Anonprofit group backed by several leading technology companies and advocacy groups, including Mozilla, Cisco Systems and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is offering a free set of services called Let's Encrypt to help website administrators incorporate HTTPS security into their sites. Tech giants like Google and Apple are also flexing their power to encourage websites and mobile app makers to adopt basic encryption or be penalized in web searches and the Apple App Store. And the Obama administration - embarrassed by Edward J. Snowden's revelations of mass surveillance by the National Security Agency and the theft of federal personnel records by foreign hackers - has ordered all publicly accessible websites run by the executive branch to use HTTPS encryption by the end of 2016. HTTPS encryption essentially creates a private connection between a user's browser and the website being visited so that the information being exchanged cannot be viewed or modified by an outsider. Typically signified by a lock symbol in the address bar, it is routine on sites intended for the exchange of confidential financial data, such as bank or store checkout pages. Big sites like those owned by Facebook, Yahoo and Google have also adopted such basic encryption in recent years. But millions of websites are unprotected, especially older sites and those whose pages pull in  content from third parties, such as news sites that show advertising coming from many sources. Without encryption, digital trackers can - and do - scoop up detailed information about people's browsing habits on those sites. Some of the snooping is done by marketers looking to build profiles of web users and some by Internet service providers that want to insert extra ads on web pages visited by their users. An unencrypted connection also opens the possibility of a hacker's impersonation of a trusted website for more nefarious reasons, such as to steal personal information. ""When the page you visit is not secure anywhere along the network path, anyone, whether it's the N.S.A. or another government or the I.S.P., can sniff on your traffic and see what you're browsing,"" said Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet policy group involved in several projects to promote encryption. Configuring a new site for HTTPS encryption can be complicated and costly, especially for a small company without a dedicated tech services team. Let's Encrypt, the new offering from the Internet Security Research Group, is intended to take some of the inconvenience out of the process by offering a complete package of free security services that a website operator can install on the server to easily set up or convert a site to include encryption. ""We want every site on the web to be able to provide HTTPS,"" said Mr. Hoffman-Andrews, who has been working on the project. ""We think that's a value."" The centerpiece of Let's Encrypt is the site certificate, a sort of digital ID card that tells a web browser like Firefox or Safari that, say, the Chase.com you are visiting after typing the address into your address bar is really the bank and not an impostor. These certificates are sold by hundreds of providers around the world, some more reputable than others, but going through the process of getting a certificate and properly integrating it into your website can be more trouble than many sites want to go through. The Let's Encrypt team decided to simplify the setup, including getting approval to issue its own certificates. The project began offering its first certificates in September and plans wide-scale issuance in November. Josh Aas, executive director of the Internet Security Research Group and a engineer on leave from the Mozilla Corporation, said that one goal was to remove the excuse that encryption is too hard to put in place. In the early days of HTTPS encryption, the technology and certificates were expensive to set up and slowed down page loading times significantly. Most websites, especially those that did not handle particularly sensitive information such as financial data, chose not to incorporate it. But now the installation process is simpler and the consequences of ignoring encryption are greater. So it's not enough to just encrypt traditionally sensitive pages like online shopping carts. ""We need to treat all users' data as if they really care about it,"" Mr. Aas said. Google, whose search engine serves as the guide to the Internet for so many people, is trying to encourage change through its powerful positions in web search and online advertising. Starting last year, Google began raising the ranking of encrypted pages in web search results and lowering the ranking of unencrypted pages - a subtle nudge to website owners to adopt HTTPS. The company has also changed its advertising systems to encourage advertisers to serve their ads on encrypted channels. While a web user can check for the lock icon to see if a site is secure, apps have no such obvious signaling system. Apple is supporting more security across the board. In the latest version of its operating system for iPhones and iPads, Apple is pushing application developers to use HTTPS to protect communications between apps and the web. Apple is not yet penalizing apps that fail to use encryption, but developers expect the company to do so eventually. The federal government is also waking up to the importance of encryption. The White House's order in June that all websites run by the executive branch adopt HTTPS encryption covers about 1,300 web domains, including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Weather Service. ""The federal government should require strong security for all of its properties,"" said Eric Mill, a technologist at 18F, the federal team that helped draft the policy. "
I.R.S. Data Breach May Be Sign of More Personalized Schemes,"The plot to steal information on 100,000 taxpayers from the Internal Revenue Service and hijack nearly $50 million in refunds not only reveals a previous security breach but hints at a wider fraud that may bedevil Americans in the future. Some security and tax experts warned that this latest data theft might be a prelude to more targeted schemes aimed at duping taxpayers into handing millions of dollars over to criminals or to help thieves circumvent the agency's security filters next year and beyond.     ''This breach is not just about what this single group is going to do with the information, but what happens when this information gets sold on the black market,'' said Peter Warren Singer, the author of ''Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know.'' ''It's rare for the actual attackers to turn the information directly into money. They're stealing the data and selling it off to other people.''   It is almost impossible to find a business or government agency that has not had some kind of security breach, he noted. Millions of customers at companies like Target and the private insurer Anthem have had data compromised. And this year, TurboTax temporarily halted electronic filing of state income tax returns after seeing an uptick in attempts to use stolen information to file fraudulent returns and wrongly claim tax refunds.   With the I.R.S., it was not the agency's own system that was hacked. Criminals had already obtained individuals' Social Security numbers, addresses and birth dates and then used the information to trick the network and gain access to taxpayers' returns and filings through an application on the I.R.S. website.   ''There was no identity theft within the I.R.S.'s actual system,'' said Aaron Blau, a tax expert in Tempe, Ariz. ''These people already had all of this data. They could have used this information to call your bank, your doctor, your insurance carrier, and they would have gotten through 100 percent of the time. In this case they chose to use the I.R.S.''   Many Americans are being attacked more directly, Mr. Blau said. One popular scheme is to cold-call taxpayers and threaten them with prosecution if they do not immediately pay money supposedly owed to the I.R.S. by directing them to purchase a prepaid debit card and then transfer the money. Now, with more detailed information from returns, criminals could better target potential victims, and bolster their credibility with information stolen from taxpayer filings, Mr. Blau said.   Reusable prepaid cards have become a magnet for fraud, according to law enforcement officials, with criminals often posing as bill collectors, government agents and others.   Without more information about the individuals who were targeted, it is hard to know the endgame, said Marc Goodman, the author of ''Future Crimes.'' Mr. Goodman noted that previous security breaches had sometimes been used to embarrass politicians, celebrities or corporate figures, and tax returns would provide a rich source of personal information.   Although some critics have been quick to condemn the I.R.S., several tax experts said using this episode to vilify the agency was unfair.   ''The I.R.S. takes data, privacy and data security extremely seriously,'' said Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law at the University of Southern California and former staff director of the Joint Tax Committee of Congress. ''They do their best, but the resources arrayed against it have become increasingly well-funded and sophisticated, and the problems will only compound over time.''   William Gale, co-director of the tax policy center at the Brookings Institution, agreed that the issue extended beyond a single agency. ''I don't think this is an I.R.S. problem per se. It is facing the same problems that all the major data providers have.''   The I.R.S. has repeatedly said that protecting taxpayer information and combating fraud were priorities. Half of the attempted information thefts were rebuffed through a system of filters that are used to detect fraud, the agency said.   Still, there is little debate that its efforts have been hampered by budget cuts. Just two months ago, an agency overseer issued what now seems to be a prescient warning.   ''Resources have not been sufficient for the I.R.S. to work identity theft cases dealing with refund fraud, which continues to be a concern,'' J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, testified before a Senate subcommittee.   The agency's budget has been cut by 17 percent over the last four years after taking inflation into account, and its work force, now at roughly 83,000, has been reduced by 12,000. This year, John A. Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, warned that impending budget cuts would have devastating effects, including the delay of new protections against identity theft and refund fraud.   Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said that the agency has been starved for funds: ''The Congress has been targeting the I.R.S. for years.''   Nina E. Olson, who leads the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent office at the I.R.S., has criticized the agency for its handling of identity theft cases.   In her annual report, she noted that victims often must ''navigate a labyrinth of I.R.S. operations and recount their experience time and again to different employees. Even when cases remain in one I.R.S. function, they may be transferred from one assistor to another with significant periods of non-activity.'' On average, the agency took nearly six months to resolve cases.   She added that cases were also frequently closed prematurely, ''before all related issues have been fully addressed.''   Her office recommended that a single officer be assigned to handle each case.   In an email, she spoke to a broader issue: ''While granting taxpayers enhanced access to their tax information remains a laudable goal, the overriding priority must be to protect taxpayers' confidential tax information from exposure.''   As for this most recent data theft, the I.R.S. urged taxpayers not to contact the agency, saying it would only delay the already overburdened staff. Anyone whose information was stolen will be contacted, the agency said.   The best advice at this stage, Mr. Blau, the tax expert, said, is, ''Hurry up and wait.''    "
Director of Personnel Agency Resigns After Hacking Is Revealed,"WASHINGTON --  Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, resigned under pressure on Friday, one day after the government revealed that two sweeping cyberintrusions at the agency had resulted in the theft of the personal information of more than 22 million people, including those who had applied for sensitive security clearances. Ms. Archuleta went to the White House on Friday morning to inform President Obama that she was stepping down immediately. She said later in a statement that she felt new leadership was needed at the federal personnel agency to enable it to ''move beyond the current challenges.''     Her resignation marked a swift reversal but did little to calm the aftershocks of the disclosure this week of what appears to be the largest cybertheft affecting the federal government. On Thursday, Ms. Archuleta insisted in a conference call with reporters that she would stay on to address the vulnerabilities that led to the breach.   Both attacks are believed to have originated in China, but administration officials have declined to name a culprit.   Mr. Obama and his administration struggled on Friday to cope with the fallout from the intrusion, which compromised the Social Security numbers, addresses, financial and health histories and other private details of millions of people, and to come to terms with the longer-term implications of a computer security lapse that has underscored severe weaknesses across the federal government.   Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said while he welcomed the news of Ms. Archuleta's resignation, ''I don't think we can expect that a change of a single person can be a satisfactory answer to the problems at O.P.M.''   ''Every other agency should have its head examined if it's not taking steps to protect its data,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''Because if there's a problem at one agency, there's likely a problem at other agencies.''   ''Not enough,'' Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said in a statement on Friday. In a post on the technology website Wired, Mr. Sasse said the breach may have handed China ''the largest spy-recruiting database in history.''   ''Unless we admit our mistakes, and build a robust response and deterrence strategy, it will absolutely happen again,'' Mr. Sasse wrote.   The revelations have set off a crisis response by the administration to technology weaknesses that officials acknowledge plague the entire federal bureaucracy.   At the White House, Josh Earnest, Mr. Obama's spokesman, said the administration was rushing to conduct a ''rapid reassessment of the state of cybersecurity measures, and accelerate the implementation of reforms that need to be adopted.''   Those include the wider adoption of two-factor authentication, which requires anyone with the password to a system to use a second, one-time password to log in from an unrecognized computer, he said.   The administration is also working, Mr. Earnest said, to impose stricter curbs on ''privileged users,'' who have enhanced access to a computer system, and better monitoring their conduct on government networks.   He said the administration had not yet arrived at an estimate of the potential cost of addressing the data theft and protecting its victims. O.P.M. has offered three years of free credit reporting, monitoring and protection to the millions affected, but some members of Congress and organizations representing federal employees are demanding a lifetime of such services.   Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement that ''this should have been addressed much, much sooner, but I appreciate the president doing what's best now.''   Mr. Earnest said Ms. Archuleta had resigned ''of her own volition,'' adding that while she had been an ''effective director, Mr. Obama believed that new leadership at the agency was ''badly needed.'' He also noted that she does not have ''this particular expertise'' in cybersecurity.   Beth Cobert, the deputy director of management at the Office of Management and Budget and a former longtime management consultant at McKinsey & Company, will step in temporarily to replace Ms. Archuleta while a permanent successor is found, Mr. Earnest said.   Ms. Archuleta, who assumed her post in November 2013, had been under pressure from lawmakers in both parties to resign since last month, when she announced the first of two separate but related computer intrusions that compromised the personnel files of 4.2 million current and former federal workers.   On Thursday, she divulged the breach also had led to the theft of the personal data of 21.5 million people who had applied for government background checks, likely affecting anyone subjected to such an investigation since 2000. About 3.6 million people's information was stored in both hacked databases.   On a conference call detailing the scope of the intrusion late Thursday afternoon, Ms. Archuleta insisted she would not step down in the face of calls for her ouster.   But just hours later, she was at the White House to inform Mr. Obama she would depart. In her statement on Friday, Ms. Archuleta, the first Latina to head the O.P.M., said she was proud of her efforts to promote diversity and her information technology strategic plan, and that serving there had been ''the highlight of my career.''   Ms. Archuleta served in the Clinton administration, and later under Mr. Obama as the chief of staff of the Labor Department. When she started at the personnel agency in 2013, she unveiled a plan of action that included improvements to its antiquated computer systems and bolstering protections against cyberintrusions. But she was also tasked with speeding a sluggish background check process that could stretch on for months or more.   On Thursday, she said she had launched a 90-day interagency review of the background check process that she would co-chair. Now that audit will fall to Ms. Cobert.     "
China Seeks Businessman Said to Have Fled to U.S.,"LOOMIS, Calif. --  China is demanding that the Obama administration return a wealthy and politically connected businessman who fled to the United States, according to several American officials familiar with the case. Should he seek political asylum, he could become one of the most damaging defectors in the history of the People's Republic. The case of the businessman, Ling Wancheng, has strained relations between two nations already at odds over numerous issues before President Xi Jinping's first state visit to the United States in September, including an extensive cybertheft of American government data and China's aggressive territorial claims.    Mr. Ling is the youngest brother of Ling Jihua, who for years held a post equivalent to that of the White House chief of staff, overseeing the Communist Party's inner sanctum as director of its General Office. Ling Jihua is one of the highest-profile casualties of an anticorruption campaign that Mr. Xi has made a centerpiece of his government.    The Obama administration has thus far refused to accede to Beijing's demands for Ling Wancheng, and his possible defection could be an intelligence coup at China's expense after it was revealed last month that computer hackers had stolen the personnel files of millions of American government workers and contractors. American officials have said that they are nearly certain the Chinese government carried out the data theft.   Mr. Ling's wealth and his family's status have allowed him to move freely in elite circles in China, and he may be in possession of embarrassing information about current and former officials loyal to Mr. Xi.   Mr. Ling appears to have evaded the Chinese authorities. He is now in the United States, according to several American officials and his next-door neighbor here in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, where property records show Mr. Ling owns a 7,800-square-foot home, which he bought from a professional basketball player for $2.5 million.   The Chinese government in recent months has been raising pressure on the Obama administration to return Mr. Ling, according to the American officials. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss a delicate diplomatic matter that has already complicated an arrangement made in April between the Department of Homeland Security and China's Ministry of Public Security.   Under that arrangement, signed during a visit to Beijing by Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, the United States would be able to repatriate many of the tens of thousands of Chinese currently in the United States awaiting deportation, some in American detention facilities. In return, the United States would help the Chinese track down wealthy fugitives from China living in the United States who might also be breaking American laws.   Several American officials confirmed that Mr. Ling is in the United States, but they would not say publicly whether Mr. Ling had applied for asylum or give information about his whereabouts. The Department of Homeland Security, which handles asylum cases, does not comment about specific cases because of privacy laws.   China's Foreign Ministry did not comment after being sent a faxed request for information on Mr. Ling's case. Press officers for the White House, State Department and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.   Three telephone numbers that people in California used to contact Mr. Ling all had Dallas area codes. Mr. Ling, whose English is said to be poor, did not respond to text messages in Chinese requesting an interview. Two of the three numbers are no longer in service, and no one answered the third number.   Christopher K. Johnson, a former C.I.A. analyst focusing on China, said the Chinese leadership might want Mr. Ling's assistance in prosecuting his older brother. And, Mr. Johnson said, it would want to prevent the ''treasure trove'' of knowledge he has about Chinese politics from passing to United States officials.   ''The leadership would want this guy badly,'' Mr. Johnson, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in a telephone interview. ''There's no question that he would have access to a lot of interesting things.''   While it is unclear how much Ling Wancheng knows, the Communist Party itself has revealed some tantalizing clues about his brother Ling Jihua's behavior, claiming that his corruption was a family affair. Last month, the party announced that Ling Jihua -- a loyalist to the previous president, Hu Jintao -- had been expelled from the party and would be tried, saying that he had ''accepted huge bribes personally and through his family.''   Ling Jihua, 58, rose through the Communist Party's Youth League under Mr. Hu in the 1980s and eventually served as either deputy or chief of the Central Committee's General Office from 1999 to 2012. He was Mr. Hu's personal secretary and closest protégé, and his position came with great powers: the ability to control the guards who protected the senior leadership, a significant voice in top personnel appointments and a central role in carrying out policy.   ''It's really the nerve center for the entire system,'' Joseph Fewsmith, a professor at the Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University who focuses on Chinese politics, said of Ling Jihua's former position. ''This is the essence of power politics.''   Ling Jihua was expected to advance to the elite Politburo, as every person who previously held that position since 1942 had done, including former Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.   But on March 18, 2012, Ling Jihua's son was killed when the black Ferrari he was driving crashed in Beijing. One of two women with him in the car later died.   Ling Jihua's botched cover-up of the episode helped lead to his political downfall. He was denied a spot on the Politburo, demoted to a less important post and, in December 2014, officially put under a corruption investigation.   But the corruption inquiry into Ling Jihua goes far beyond the Ferrari crash, and his younger brother, Ling Wancheng, may have played an important role.   As a senior official, Ling Jihua had his moves monitored. But his brother, as a private citizen, was far less constrained. He built a fortune as the chief of a Beijing-based investment company, which bought well-timed stakes in companies that went on to hold successful initial public offerings, earning the firm $225 million, according to a report in Caixin, a respected Chinese news media company. A company using the same California address that he used to buy his home in Loomis also bought at least two golf courses, one near Loomis, the other in Carson City, Nev., property records show.   Ling Wancheng is one of several Chinese citizens in the United States whom Beijing has requested be returned to China. A forum has been established to discuss these cases, called the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement Cooperation, where the Chinese regularly press their case to Obama administration officials.   However, Ling Wancheng, who is believed to be in his mid-50s and goes by the name Wang Cheng or Jason Wang, was not on the publicly disclosed list of 40 fugitives believed to be in the United States that was released by the Chinese government this year, indicating how delicate the case may be to the senior leadership.   Marc Raimondi, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said the department ''has repeatedly shown that it will vigorously pursue prosecutions in the United States where there is alleged money laundering or other criminal activity in this country by fugitives sought by China.''   But, he added, ''it is not sufficient to simply provide a list of names.'' The department has urged China to provide evidence, Mr. Raimondi said.   In late 2013, Mr. Ling, using the name Wang Cheng, and a person using the name Li Ping, the same name as a former presenter on state television whom the Chinese news media have identified as Mr. Ling's wife, bought a house in a gated community in Loomis from a National Basketball Association player, Beno Udrih, real estate records show.   Ray Matteson, Mr. Ling's neighbor in Loomis, and his wife soon became friends with the couple next door, who introduced themselves as Jason and Jane Wang. The Mattesons invited them over for dinner or drinks at least three times. Mr. Ling offered gifts, once giving them a bottle of liquor from the family's home province, Shanxi, and on another occasion two magnums of California wine.   The Mattesons said their neighbor had given no hints about his family's high-level political struggle, the arrest of Ling Jihua and another older brother or the death of his nephew.   ''In my mind, there's no question he was a gentleman,'' said Mr. Matteson, who, along with another person who met him in Loomis, confirmed that Jason Wang was the man identified in the Chinese news media as Mr. Ling. Neither person, however, could match the woman introduced as Jane Wang with pictures of Li Ping, the former Chinese television presenter.   Mr. Ling would send text messages to his next-door neighbors. His English was poor, so he often used emoji, like a thumbs up or a happy face. He would send links to videos he found funny, and he asked for advice on where to find people to clean his windows.   Mr. Matteson said he had not seen Mr. Ling since October, when the two couples had dinner at Mr. Matteson's home. But if Mr. Ling was in hiding in the United States, the prosaic details of maintaining a California estate kept him tethered to Loomis: There were homeowners association fees to pay, and a gardener had to keep the bushes trimmed and the lawn mowed.   Mr. Matteson's last contact with Mr. Ling was in May, when the alarm system in Mr. Ling's house was activated and the security company asked Mr. Matteson to contact Mr. Ling to obtain the code to enter the gate to his home.   The Mattesons said they had never seen any unusual activity in the neighborhood, except for one visit several months ago by officers from the Department of Homeland Security, who said they were trying to contact Mr. Ling.   Ling Wancheng's visa status is unclear. Christopher Bentley, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of Homeland Security, said that it usually took one to three years for an asylum case to be settled. During that period, he said, the asylum seeker is allowed to stay legally in the country.    "
Cybersecurity Looms as Obstacle for Nominee to Lead the Office of Personnel Management,"Nominating someone to lead the Office of Personnel Management - the federal government's version of the human resources department - does not typically result in a high-profile showdown. But it might be a different matter with the White House's announcement on Tuesday that President Obama wants Beth Cobert, currently the acting director, to officially assume the top job.  Senate Republicans immediately showed that they intended to make her nomination as much about a serious cybersecurity breach at the agency as about her qualifications. They hope to refocus attention on what they believe is the administration's inadequate response to cybersecurity threats. The agency disclosed this summer that a major cyberattack against the Office of Personnel Management had exposed the personal information, including fingerprints, of as many as 20 million federal workers, contractors and their families.  Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, said he hoped Mr. Obama and his team would use the confirmation process as ""an opportunity to more thoroughly address the legitimate concerns of the American people regarding the cyberattack at O.P.M., particularly the millions who have been harmed by the lack of competence in confronting the attack.""  ""The president and his team need to give the American people renewed confidence, and that means pledging to work with policy makers to enact real reforms rather than accepting failure,"" he said. Ms. Cobert, a former director and partner at McKinsey & Company, has a solid reputation in the administration and on Capitol Hill. But if she hopes to make it through the Senate, she is going to need to explain what the administration is doing to protect the workers and others whose information was stolen, and what she is doing to prevent a recurrence.

Ex-Morgan Stanley Adviser Receives Probation for Data Theft,"A former Morgan Stanley financial adviser who downloaded information on thousands of the firm's clients to a personal computer, some of it ending up for sale online, was given three years of probation by a federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday.  Galen Marsh, who was fired after some of the downloaded information was found posted on the Internet late last year, had faced a maximum of five years in prison. He pleaded guilty in September to one count of unauthorized access to a computer and was ordered to pay Morgan Stanley restitution of $600,000 and forfeit the computer equipment he used.    Judge Kevin T. Duffy of Federal District Court in Manhattan announced the sentence on Tuesday to a relieved Mr. Marsh.   ''We are ecstatic by the judge's sentence,'' said Robert C. Gottlieb, his defense lawyer. ''We are grateful that Judge Duffy felt that leniency was warranted in this case.''   Mr. Marsh and his lawyer have contended that he did not intend to sell the information, share it or post it online. One theory was that foreign hackers got into his home computer and took the information.   A spokesman for Morgan Stanley had no comment on Tuesday.   Prosecutors said Mr. Marsh used the bank's computers from June 2011 to December 2014 to gain access to confidential information about certain clients in 6,000 unauthorized searches. He obtained names, addresses, telephone numbers, account numbers and investment information on approximately 730,000 client accounts. He uploaded information to his personal computer at home in Hoboken, N.J.   This year, Morgan Stanley said he took data on roughly 10 percent of the firm's 3.5 million wealth management customers.   Mr. Marsh was talking about job opportunities with two other financial institutions from late 2013 to the end of last year. He retrieved the client information to use it for his personal advantage, prosecutors said in September.    "
Former Federal Prosecutor to Join Debevoise & Plimpton,"David A. O'Neil, a longtime federal prosecutor who helped the government negotiate one of the biggest corporate plea deals in American history, has landed in the private sector. In an interview over the weekend, Mr. O'Neil said he would join the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton as a partner in its Washington office, where he will handle white-collar defense and cybersecurity issues. Debevoise, which caters to some of the biggest banks and corporations in the world, is expected to announce the hiring on Monday. ""They've got a legendary white-collar practice, and it's an exciting place to make my home as a law firm partner,"" said Mr. O'Neill, 41, the latest prosecutor to file through the revolving door between government and the defense bar.  Mr. O'Neil - who as acting head of the Justice Department's criminal division helped extract an $8 billion plea deal from BNP Paribas, the French bank accused of doing business with Iran - will join Debevoise two years after the firm lost two top litigators to the Obama administration. Mary Jo White left Debevoise to become chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, while Andrew J. Ceresney, one of her top lieutenants, became the commission's enforcement director. In hiring Mr. O'Neil, Debevoise did not seek a replacement so much as a new direction. The firm asked him to expand its white-collar practice in Washington, in part by identifying other seasoned prosecutors and defense lawyers who might join the office. ""Dave is not the last step in this process,"" said Bruce E. Yannett, chairman of the firm's white-collar and regulatory defense group. ""In some ways he's the first."" The move reflects a new reality in the white-collar world. Wall Street banks, once the domain of prosecutors in Manhattan, increasingly are caught in the cross hairs of regulators and prosecutors in Washington as well. The Justice Department's criminal division in Washington orchestrated many of the biggest Wall Street settlements in recent memory, including a crackdown on interest rate manipulation and money laundering. The higher profile has turned the criminal division into a steppingstone to lucrative law firm partnerships. And law firms are lining up to woo the prosecutors - and pay them up to a few million dollars a year. Covington & Burling hired three senior criminal division prosecutors. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett recently recruited Jeffrey Knox, the former head of the criminal division's fraud section. And Davis Polk hired Neil MacBride, a Justice Department official in Washington who also was the United States attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Amid the scramble, Debevoise has sought to distinguish itself with a cybersecurity practice. Recent hacking incidents, most notably at Sony Pictures, have shaken the corporate world and prompted law firms to expand their focus on the field. Mr. O'Neil, who will incorporate cybersecurity issues into his practice, began his prosecutorial career as an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan. He later joined the solicitor general's office, where he helped handle the government's effort to uphold the 24-year sentence of Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron. Mr. O'Neil grew up in Madison, Wis., and Charlottesville, Va., where his father, Robert M. O'Neil, was president of the University of Wisconsin Systems and University of Virginia.  He graduated from Harvard Law School and, like his father, was a clerk on the United States Supreme Court. He worked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; his father, for Justice William J. Brennan Jr.  "
White House Takes Cybersecurity Pitch to Silicon Valley,"SAN FRANCISCO --  President Obama's newly installed defense secretary, Ashton B. Carter, toured Silicon Valley last week to announce a new military strategy for computer conflict, starting the latest Pentagon effort to invest in promising start-ups and to meet with engineers whose talent he declared the Pentagon desperately needed in fending off the nation's adversaries. Mr. Carter immediately acknowledged, though, the need to rebuild trust with Silicon Valley, whose mainstays -- like Apple, Google and Facebook (whose new headquarters he toured) have spent two years demonstrating to customers around the world that they are rolling out encryption technologies to defeat surveillance. That, of course, includes blocking the National Security Agency, a critical member of the military-intelligence community.    ''I think that people and companies need to be convinced that everything we do in the cyber domain is lawful and appropriate and necessary,'' Mr. Carter told students and faculty at Stanford.     He urged the next generation of software pioneers and entrepreneurs to take a break from developing killer apps and consider a tour of service fending off Chinese, Russian and North Korean hackers, even as he acknowledged that the documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, ''showed there was a difference in view between what we were doing and what people perceived us as doing.''   Mr. Carter's careful appeal was part of a campaign last week by government officials trying to undo the damage of Mr. Snowden's revelations. While Mr. Carter got a respectful hearing, Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, and a group of other government officials ran into a buzz saw of skepticism at the world's largest conference of computer security professionals, just 30 miles to the north.    Those officials argued for some kind of technical compromise to allow greater security of electronic communications while enabling the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies to decode the emails and track the web activities of suspected terrorists or criminals. Yet many among the computer security professionals at the conference argued that no such compromise was possible, saying that such a system would give Russians and Chinese a pathway in, too, and that Washington might abuse such a portal.   Not long after Mr. Johnson declared that ''encryption is making it harder for your government to find criminal activity and potential terrorist activity,'' large numbers of entrepreneurs and engineers crammed into the first of several seminars, called ''Post-Snowden Cryptography.'' There, they took notes as the world's best code makers mocked the Obama administration's drive for a ''technical compromise'' that would ensure the government some continued access.    Ronald Rivest, one of the inventors of a commonly used encryption algorithm, took on the arguments by Mr. Johnson and other senior officials, including John P. Carlin, the head of the Justice Department's national security division, that the best minds in Silicon Valley could find a way to ensure legal government access while still assuring users that communications and data stored in their iPhones and the cloud are safe.   ''There are lots of problems with these ideas,'' Mr. Rivest said. ''We live in a global information system now, and it's not going to be just the U.S. government that wants a key. It's going to be the U.K., it's going to be Germany, it's going to be Israel, it's going to be China, it's going to be Iran, etc.''   It was clear all week that the Snowden revelations, while fading in memory across much of the country, have not been forgotten in the rapidly growing computer and encryption communities here.    One of Mr. Johnson's deputies, Phyllis Schneck, projected colorful graphics on a screen that showed the government's plans for real-time monitoring and blocking of malware flowing through the Internet, urging private industry to help.    ''We want you to make money,'' said Ms. Schneck, a former chief technology officer at McAffee Inc., known for its virus-protection software. Many in the crowd, though, said they worried whether the government would turn any malware-monitoring system to other uses.   Mr. Obama's cybercoordinator, Michael Daniel, who has been trying to preside over the unwieldy administration debate over encryption rules, was meeting executives in private and calling in public for ''cybernorms of behavior'' that could constrain the kind of hackers who attacked American corporations, the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon. But he acknowledged that this was an area where the grindingly slow wheels of diplomacy were being outpaced by technological development.    ''The government fears its own obsolescence,'' said retired Adm. Patrick M. Walsh, who left the Navy in 2012 and is now an executive at iSight Partners, a cybersecurity firm.   Mr. Carter, in his Stanford talk, noted that past wars were fought state to state. But in computer conflict, he said, the most sophisticated threats and weapons are seen by banks, security firms and Silicon Valley companies like Apple, Google, Yahoo, Twitter and Facebook that serve as conduits for the world's communications. That is data Washington most needs.    Yet nearly two years after the Snowden revelations, many companies are as reluctant as ever to give the government any information unless they are compelled to do so, particularly as they try to convince foreign customers in global markets that they are doing everything they can to keep Washington at a distance.    The new defense secretary received what was probably the warmest welcome of government officials on the tour through Silicon Valley. Mr. Carter, who did graduate work at Stanford, returned for much of last year, until Mr. Obama pulled him back to Washington. That time gave him a new appreciation, he said, for how ill suited the Pentagon's lumbering procurement system is in taking advantage of new technology and start-ups.    At Facebook, he talked with Sheryl Sandberg, a former colleague from the Clinton administration, about using social media to connect the troops -- and the challenges it poses as terror groups become adept at exploiting it. On Friday, he went to a venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, to meet with the founders of a series of relatively new ventures.    ''He really just wanted to explore how their technologies might be applied to current problems at the Pentagon,'' said Margit Wennmachers, a partner at the firm, who joined the session.    During the meetings, Mr. Carter spoke with an executive of Github, an Andreessen Horowitz portfolio company, which China recently targeted in a cyberattack intended to keep Western news reports out of the hands of the Chinese public.   Mr. Obama, on a trip to Stanford in February, had expressed sympathy with those who were striving to protect privacy, even while saying it had to be balanced against the concerns of the F.B.I. and other agencies that fear ''going dark'' because of new encryption technologies. (Apple says that with its new iPhone operating system, it has no way to decode data in phones, even if given a court order.) Mr. Obama's aides say decisions about how to resolve these differences are still months away.   With so much more data at stake, and attacks so frequent, cryptographers say the need for encryption is greater than ever.    One proposal, by Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency, is to develop a split-key system in which companies hold half and the government, or some outside agent, holds the other half of the key to unlock encrypted communications. The two would be put together only with approval of a court. But many computer security experts reject that idea, saying it would leave too much room for theft and would motivate other governments to require the same.   ''The amount of information that intelligence officials are collecting -- even if some sources go dark -- is dramatically more than it has been in history,'' Paul Kocher, a cryptographer, said Wednesday. ''The idea that we need to stop rolling out technology to keep our industries and businesses safe, to keep a few sources from going dark, is certainly not a trade-off.''    "
Record Retention,"Four of Wall Street's biggest banks on Monday agreed to cooperate with New York regulators and retain copies of communications sent through the messaging platform known as Symphony.  The New York State Department of Financial Services was concerned that the platform would allow traders to delete or encrypt information that could be used to track evidence of rigging schemes among traders at various banks. Messaging in chat rooms is believed to have figured prominently in schemes to manipulate global exchange rates and benchmark interest rates.    Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Bank of New York Mellon have agreed to keep copies of all electronic communication sent through the Symphony platform to and from one another for seven years. They have also agreed to store the duplicate copies of decryption keys for messages with independent custodians. The agreement essentially nullifies a feature initially marketed by Symphony that allowed for ''guaranteed data deletion.'' The system is scheduled to be introduced on Tuesday.   ''We are pleased that these banks did the right thing by working cooperatively with us to help address our concerns about this new messaging platform,'' said Anthony J. Albanese, the acting superintendent of the Department of Financial Services.   ''This is a critical issue since chats and other electronic records have provided key evidence in investigations of wrongdoing on Wall Street,'' Mr. Albanese said in a statement. ''It is vital that regulators act to ensure that these records do not fall into a digital black hole.''   Symphony's chief executive, David Gurle, said: ''The agreement is another positive development on the eve of Symphony's launch. Symphony's platform safeguards against cyber threats while strengthening customers' compliance operations and facilitating their ability to meet their regulatory obligations.''   Symphony, a start-up based in California, was created by Goldman Sachs and is backed by a consortium of major banks. It has positioned itself as an alternative to Bloomberg's chat program used by traders and investors around the world. The four banks that reached agreements with the Department of Financial Services represent the banks within the consortium that the regulator regulates.   ''We are pleased our discussions with the D.F.S. have been constructive and Symphony's messaging solution addresses their concerns and further enhances our process around security and compliance,'' a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs said in an email.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
F.B.I. Director Repeats Call That Ability to Read Encrypted Messages Is Crucial,"The F.B.I. director and the Manhattan district attorney on Wednesday sought to reopen the argument that law enforcement and intelligence officials need to have access to encrypted information on smartphones with court approval. The question seemed settled last month after President Obama decided not to push legislation requiring American technology companies -- notably Apple, Google and Facebook-- to roll back smartphone encryption schemes that make it almost impossible to read a target's communications, even if investigators have a court order. But the terrorist attacks in Paris may have changed the politics on both encryption and a range of surveillance issues, with critics renewing their charge that the Obama administration is not using all tools available to stop terrorism.     In a speech at a cybersecurity conference in New York, James B. Comey, who since taking over the F.B.I. has been the most vociferous about the ''going dark'' problem facing investigators, warned that ''we're drifting to a place'' where court orders to gain access to text messages or computer communications ''are ineffective.'' Both devices and data in transmission are often encrypted so well that the law enforcement and intelligence agencies cannot crack the coding -- and their makers have designed the system so they do not hold the key.    ''With lack of cooperation, we are left with 50-foot-high walls on either side,'' Mr. Comey said. ''We have to get to a place where we push information to each other at a pace that moves with the speed of the threat.''   He was joined by Cyrus R. Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, who released a 42-page white paper arguing that his office was unable to execute 111 search warrants for smartphones from September 2014 to October 2015 because the devices employed Apple's ''full disk encryption.'' That technology prohibits anyone, except the iPhone's owner, from accessing a device's contents without a user's password.   ''Last fall, a decision by a single company changed the way those of us in law enforcement work to keep the public safe and bring justice to victims and their families,'' the paper said, referring to Apple. ''We risk losing crucial evidence in serious cases if the contents of passcode protected smartphones remain immune to a warrant.''   Representatives for Apple did not return requests for comment. In the past, Apple's chief executive, Timothy Cook, has taken up the other side of the argument, making the case that a way to allow the government access without making the data vulnerable to others simply does not exist.   Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company, also singled out by the district attorney's office, declined to comment.   But Bill Conner, president and chief executive of Silent Circle, a firm that sells software to encrypt cellphone conversations and a ''Blackphone'' that encrypts almost all smartphone activity, said Mr. Comey was looking to return to an era that was over. ''The reality is, we have to encrypt more data to keep the bad guys out,'' Mr. Conner said, noting the series of recent breaches that allowed Chinese hackers to get the security records of 22 million Americans with security clearances, including Mr. Comey himself.   Mr. Vance's report argued that law enforcement officials should not seek a ''back door'' to get inside encrypted phones, but rather a roll back to Apple's previous encryption methodology. Until roughly a year ago, the company kept the key to unlock customers' communications in the event it received a court order.   But its newest encryption system, part of its operating system, keeps iPhone data secure even from Apple. The company no longer holds the keys; customers do. Google switched on a similar system as the default in Android phones last year, though not every Android manufacturer turns the encryption on by default.   Apple and Google have said they always planned to move to full disk encryption schemes, largely to keep pace in the longstanding cat-and-mouse game with cybercriminals. But the timing of their moves -- after disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor -- suggested that the companies were reacting to disclosures that some critics said made them government collaborators.   Mr. Comey said in his speech that encryption technology was already in use by the Islamic State. He argued that recruiters for the extremist group used unencrypted messages to reach out to prospective members, then switched to encrypted methods once they netted a good prospect. But American and French officials have said they have no definitive evidence to back up claims that the terrorists behind Friday's attacks used encrypted communications.   The French news media reported on Wednesday that the predawn raids in the Paris suburb of St.-Denis were prompted by the discovery of a mobile phone with unencrypted contents that was discovered by investigators in a trash can near the Bataclan concert hall. Contrary to warnings that encryption has left investigators in the dark, in this case, French officials were able to easily access a detailed plan of the Bataclan assault and an unencrypted text message sent at 9:42 p.m. on Friday that said, ''On est parti on commence,'' which roughly translates as, ''Here we go, we're starting.''    Some security experts and cryptographers said some officials were trying to use the Paris attacks to push their agenda.   ''What you're now seeing is the two-day impulse response,'' said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University. ''Never waste a good crisis, as they say.''    "
Citigroup Study Faults Law Firms Over Silence on Attacks by Hackers,"Every month it seems another American company reports being a victim of a hacking that results in the theft of internal or customer information. But the legal profession almost never publicly discloses a breach. The unwillingness of most big United States law firms to discuss or even acknowledge breaches has frustrated law enforcement and corporate clients for several years. That frustration bubbled over in a recent internal report from Citigroup's cyberintelligence center that warned bank employees of the threat of attacks on the networks and websites of big law firms.    ''Due to the reluctance of most law firms to publicly discuss cyberintrusions and the lack of data breach reporting requirements in general in the legal industry, it is not possible to determine whether cyberattacks against law firms are on the rise,'' according to the report, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.    The report, issued last month, said it was reasonable to expect law firms to be targets of attacks by foreign governments and hackers because they are repositories for confidential data on corporate deals and business strategies. The report said bank employees should be mindful that digital security at many law firms, despite improvements, generally remains below the standards for other industries.   It said law firms were at ''high risk for cyberintrusions'' and would ''continue to be targeted by malicious actors looking to steal information on highly sensitive matters such as mergers and acquisitions and patent applications.''   The bank's security team also highlighted several ways hackers had intruded on law firms, by directly breaching their systems, attacking their websites or using their names in so-called phishing efforts to trick people into disclosing personal information.   The Citigroup team issued the report as other Wall Street banks are putting pressure on the legal profession to do more to prevent the theft of confidential client information. For nearly a year, banks and law firms have talked about forging a closer partnership to share some information about hacking incidents. Banks are also demanding more documentation from law firms about online security measures as a condition of retaining them for assignments.   In the last several months, Mandiant, the security firm that is a division of the security consultant FireEye, has been advising a half-dozen unidentified law firms that were victims of a breach or other attack, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Federal law enforcement authorities are urging law firms to be more open about reporting incidents. Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation have met with law firm leaders in the last few years to discuss online security. Top federal prosecutors at the Justice Department have begun to do the same.   John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, spoke this month at an American Bar Association conference in New Orleans, impressing on the lawyers the need to promptly inform clients and law enforcement authorities of attacks that could compromise confidential information.   ''There are still a lot of companies that try to go it on their own,'' Mr. Carlin said in a recent interview. ''They try to circle the wagons.''   Mr. Carlin, who said he had not seen the Citigroup report, said law firms needed to report breaches and serious incidents when they happen and should not view such events as ''a badge of shame.'' He said he planned to deliver a similar message to big money managers and investors at a hedge fund conference in May in Las Vegas.   The Citigroup report noted that Fried Frank was the victim of a so-called watering hole attack in 2012 in which hackers infected its website with malware, an intrusive program that can be transferred to visitors to the site.   Steve Lewis, director of information systems at Fried Frank, said the law firm's data network had ''never been breached and client information has never been compromised.'' In an emailed statement, Mr. Lewis added that the firm's public website was hosted by an outside vendor and ''contains no confidential information.''   Also in 2012, the Citigroup report said, the name of Covington & Burling, a large firm based in Washington, was used in a phishing campaign that appears to have been orchestrated by a ''China-based group'' of hackers. The report said the campaign, which typically involves sending fake but realistic looking email, may have been an effort to learn more about the law firm's prominent corporate clients given its work for military contractors and energy companies, including its work on several solar energy projects at the time.   Covington also may have been an intriguing name for hackers to misuse because Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, once worked there.   The Citigroup report said the information on the attacks involving Covington and Fried Frank had come from iSight Partners, a security consulting firm based in Dallas that has received financial backing from Blackstone. As with Fried Frank, there is no indication Covington's systems were breached.   Citigroup issued a statement on Thursday distancing itself from the report. A person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said the bank had stopped distributing it.   ''The analysis relied on and cited previously published reports. We have apologized to several of the parties mentioned for not giving them an opportunity to respond prior to its publication in light of the sensitive nature of the events described,'' said Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman.    The bank's report also mentioned incidents involving two smaller firms -- Puckett & Faraj and Gipson, Hoffman & Pancione. Puckett, a Washington-area firm, was hacked in 2012 by activists associated with the group Anonymous, who were angered by the firm's representation of a United States soldier who pleaded guilty in connection with his role in the death of 24 Iraqi civilians, the report said. Gipson, based in Los Angeles, said in 2010 it was hacked that year because of a software piracy lawsuit it filed against the Chinese government.   John Hultquist, a manager at iSight, said it had gathered data on the incidents from various sources but declined to provide specific details. He said hackers were targeting a wide range of professional services firms in many ways.   ''It's not only law firms being targeted for cyberespionage and by cybercriminals,'' he said. ''Auditors are regularly targeted, even strategic communication firms.''    "
'Veep' Recap: The Expendabelles," Season 4, Episode 3: ""Data""  Like last week's episode of ""Veep,"" which featured an intense and poignant look at the platonic love affair between President Selina Meyer and her body man, Gary, Sunday's show also ends on a serious note.  We begin on Good Friday, which turns out to be a very bad Friday for Selina and her team. Her aides have just discovered that the 8-year-old ""H.I.V. girl"" the president mentioned in a recent speech has been outed by a thread on Reddit, and helped along by a massive White House data breach.  ""This is catching fire like a gas station in a Michael Bay film,"" warns Mike, her press secretary. ""What's our line here?"" Selina decides on a tried-and-true ""This Town"" formula - someone needs to be fired. And her team initially thinks they can get away with axing a low level aide, one of the seemingly interchangeable young women who roam the West Wing, dressed in the unofficial uniform of slightly frumpy skirt suits. (Think Ann Taylor's most basic beige line).  ""We call them the expendabelles,"" quips Dan, Selina's Machiavellian and fast-talking aide. ""O.K., Dan, go sacrifice a virgin,"" the president says.  But, like many a Washington crisis, the problem snowballs, a truth made abundantly clear when Selina's campaign starts hemorrhaging their microdonors because they don't want the president's re-election effort to have their personal data anymore.  ""It's vital that these small time nobodys realize we respect them,"" hisses Amy, Selina's campaign manager, in the president's ear as she leaves an event.  Key family groups then start withdrawing their support from the administration's Families First bill. But the real trouble comes when the team finds out that the data breach - a timely fictional issue in a real 21st-century world grappling with privacy concerns  - goes far deeper than they think. A direct mailer featuring Selina with babies and children was intentionally targeted at ""recently bereaved parents,"" using leaked child mortality data.  ""Well that's a federal crime,"" the president tells her staff. ""You could go to jail."" And, as a quick aside, welcome to the world of Big Data. Targeting parents who have recently lost a child may be a step too far into the unseemly muck, not to mention illegal. But in 2012, I remember hearing a credible rumor that a rival campaign had asked a top data firm to provide a list of dog owners - who it planned to target with an ad pointing out that Mitt Romney had famously strapped his family dog, Seamus, to the roof of the car (in a crate) for a long road trip. A decision is made: Team Meyer needs a big time name on the chopping block, chum to (hopefully) make the press stop digging into the data breach before they discover the more nefarious truth.   The unlucky soul? Dan Egan.  ""It's a perfect fit,"" Kent tells Dan, coolly, pointing out that he worked on the Families First bill and is handsome - ""Therefore, guilty looking."" (There had been an initial thought to fire Ben, one of the president's most senior aides, but they eventually settled on Dan, deciding to keep Ben on board so that he might be sacrificed, if necessary, at a later date).  The rest of the episode is edited like one of the final scenes from ""The Godfather."" Selina, with plausible deniability, sits on the South Lawn reading a picture book to a group of kids at an Easter egg roll as her staff scrambles behind the scenes to save themselves, Dan pleads for his political life, and Mike stands behind the podium, getting ready to, in the words of Ben, ""cut the throat of a bigger goat."" So how does Dan bleed? Just as you'd expect him to - with pure, red ambition.  We first see Dan begging for his job. Then, we see him resigned, arguing in favor of a title promotion before he's forced out. And, finally, the episode ends with Dan alone in his car, not wallowing but frantically working his cell. ""So it looks like I am a free agent again,"" he says, putting a rather euphemistic spin on his current situation.  ""Yeah, so, give me a call. It's the same number as in the last two messages.""  I doubt we've seen the last of Dan Egan.  "
North Korea Denounces U.S. Over Its Latest Sanctions,"SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea denounced the United States on Sunday for imposing new sanctions on it after a cyberattack on Sony Pictures, calling them byproducts of American ''hostility'' toward the North.  North Korea reiterated its denial of involvement in the hacking of Sony computers and said Washington's sanctions would only strengthen resolve to pursue its ''military first'' policy. That policy calls for an arms buildup, including nuclear weapons development, as a ''deterrent'' against Washington's policy. ''The persistent and unilateral action taken by the White House to slap sanctions against the D.P.R.K. patently proves that it is still not away from inveterate repugnance and hostility toward the D.P.R.K.,'' an unidentified government spokesman was quoted as saying by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. D.P.R.K. stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. The statement from the spokesman was the North's first reaction to the new sanctions the Obama administration announced on Friday. The retaliatory sanctions came days after the United States officially blamed North Korea for the hacking of Sony, which produced ''The Interview,'' a comedy film about a C.I.A. plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un, North Korea's leader. The hacking destroyed many of the studio's computers and leaked numerous private emails and business files. North Korea called the film an ''act of war,'' but it has repeatedly denied involvement in the hacking. In its statement on Sunday, North Korea noted that many cybersecurity experts had expressed skepticism about Washington's evidence that the country was responsible for the cyberattack. Dismissing such doubts, Washington on Friday announced sanctions against 10 North Korean government officials and three organizations, including the North's main intelligence agency, which American officials said was the source of ''many of North Korea's major cyberoperations.'' Analysts said the sanctions would have limited effect because North Korea had already been under tough United States sanctions for several decades. "
Federal Prosecutor to Join Paul Weiss Law Firm,"In the span of 18-months, the federal prosecutor Richard Tarlowe racked up six insider trading convictions, helping secure some signature moments in a long-running investigation. Next month, Mr. Tarlowe will leave that prosecutorial career behind.  Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison has hired Mr. Tarlowe as counsel in its litigation department, he said in an interview on Wednesday. Mr. Tarlowe, currently head of the complex frauds and cybercrime unit at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, will now focus on white collar criminal defense, cybersecurity and foreign corrupt practices cases. Mr. Tarlowe, who worked at Goldman Sachs after graduating from Harvard Law School, is the latest white collar prosecutor in Manhattan to decamp to the private sector. Last month, three longtime federal prosecutors in Manhattan landed at Boies Schiller. In the interview, Mr. Tarlowe said he chose Paul Weiss because of its track-record for litigation, a reputation he knew first hand as a prosecutor. Many of the firm's Wall Street clients, including the hedge fund SAC Capital, were targets of federal investigations. ""I feel very honored about the opportunity,"" said Mr. Tarlowe, 39, adding that he believes ""there's no firm in the world that has a stronger litigation or white collar defense practice."" While many of Paul Weiss's cases are of the Wall Street variety, Mr. Tarlowe said he was also drawn to the eclectic nature of its clients. Paul Weiss, for example, is currently handling the investigation into so-called deflate-gate, in which the New England Patriots used game balls that turned out to be under inflated. Choosing Paul Weiss will also reunite Mr. Tarlowe with his old supervisor, Lorin Reisner. Mr. Reisner led the office's criminal division until he joined Paul Weiss last summer. The recent hires signal that Paul Weiss - home to the famed litigator Theodore V. Wells, Jr., whose clients have included I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby and Eliot Spitzer - is building its next generation of litigators. ""It is critical that Paul Weiss continues to recruit star talent for the white collar group in order to support our preeminent platform in this area,"" Mr. Wells said in an interview. ""We are very conscious about issues of succession."" He added that, while Mr. Tarlowe has most recently focused on cyber crime and other complex frauds, ""this is not a niche hire."" His hire coincides with a wave of federal investigations into Wall Street. As clients encounter such scrutiny, every white shoe law firm in New York has scrambled to add prosecutors to their rosters. ""Given the unprecedented scrutiny of Wall Street and other industries, we are thrilled to add someone of Rich's talents to our firm,"" said Brad Karp, Paul Weiss's chairman. At the United States attorney's office, which he joined in 2007, Mr. Tarlowe prosecuted several big Wall Street cases. The six insider trading cases he helped win between June 2011 and December 2012 included the conviction of Rajat K. Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs director accused of leaking boardroom secrets. Mr. Tarlowe, a native of Roslyn, NY., who is married with two young daughters, was also part of the trial team that convicted Anthony Chiasson and Todd Newman. A federal appeals court recently overturned those convictions, a victory for Paul Weiss, which helped handle Mr. Chiasson's appeal. "
"Iran Is Raising Sophistication and Frequency of Cyberattacks, Study Says","WASHINGTON --  In February, a year after the Las Vegas Sands was hit by a devastating cyberattack that ruined many of the computers running its casino and hotel operations, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., publicly told Congress what seemed obvious: Iranian hackers were behind the attack. Sheldon G. Adelson, the billionaire chief executive of Sands, who is a major supporter of Israel and an ardent opponent of negotiating with Tehran, had suggested an approach to the Iran problem a few months before the attack that no public figure had ever uttered in front of cameras.    ''What I would say is: 'Listen. You see that desert out there? I want to show you something,' '' Mr. Adelson said at Yeshiva University in Manhattan in October 2013. He then argued for detonating an American nuclear weapon where it would not ''hurt a soul,'' except ''rattlesnakes and scorpions or whatever,'' before adding, ''Then you say, 'See, the next one is in the middle of Tehran.' ''     Instead, Tehran directed an attack at the desert of Nevada. Now a new study of Iran's cyberactivities, to be released by Norse, a cybersecurity firm, and the American Enterprise Institute, concludes that beyond the Sands attack, Iran has greatly increased the frequency and skill of its cyberattacks, even while negotiating with world powers over limits on its nuclear capabilities.   ''Cyber gives them a usable weapon, in ways nuclear technology does not,'' said Frederick W. Kagan, who directs the institute's Critical Threats Project and is beginning a larger effort to track Iranian cyberactivity. ''And it has a degree of plausible deniability that is attractive to many countries.''   Mr. Kagan argues that if sanctions against Iran are suspended under the proposed nuclear accord, Iran will be able to devote the revenue from improved oil exports to cyberweapons. But it is far from clear that that is what Iran would do.   When Mr. Clapper named Iran in the Sands attack, it was one of the few instances in which American intelligence agencies had identified a specific country that it believed was using such attacks for political purposes. The first came in December, when President Obama accused North Korea of launching a cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Other United States officials have said that Iran attacked American banks in retaliation for sanctions and that it destroyed computers at the oil giant Saudi Aramco in retaliation for the close Saudi ties with the United States.   The evidence from the Norse report, along with analyses by American intelligence agencies, strongly suggests that Iran has made much greater use of cyberweapons over the past year, despite international sanctions. The attacks have mostly involved espionage, but a few, like the Sands attack, have been for destructive purposes.   In the report, to be released Friday, Norse -- which, like other cybersecurity firms, has an interest in portraying a world of cyberthreats but presumably little incentive in linking them to any particular country -- traced thousands of attacks against American targets to hackers inside Iran.   The report, and a similar one from Cylance, another cybersecurity firm, make clear that Iranian hackers are moving from ostentatious cyberattacks in which they deface websites or simply knock them offline to much quieter reconnaissance. In some cases, they appear to be probing for critical infrastructure systems that could provide opportunities for more dangerous and destructive attacks.   But Norse and Cylance differ on the question of whether the Iranian attacks have accelerated in recent months, or whether Tehran may be pulling back during a critical point in the nuclear negotiations.   Norse, which says it maintains thousands of sensors across the Internet to collect intelligence on attackers' methods, insists that Iranian hackers have shown no signs of letting up. Between January 2014 and last month, the Norse report said, its sensors picked up a 115 percent increase in attacks launched from Iranian Internet protocol, or I.P., addresses. Norse said that its sensors had detected more than 900 attacks, on average, every day in the first half of March.    Cylance came to a different conclusion, at least for Iran's activities in the past few months, as negotiations have come to a head. Stuart McClure, the chief executive and founder of Cylance, which has been tracking Iranian hacking groups, said that there had been a notable drop in activity over the past few months, and that the groups were now largely quiet.    American intelligence agencies also monitor the groups, but they do not publicly publish assessments of the activity. Classified National Intelligence Estimates over the past five years have identified Russia and China as the United States' most sophisticated, and prolific, adversaries in cyberspace.    However, American officials have said that Iran and North Korea concern them the most, not for their sophistication, but because their attacks are aimed more at destruction, as was the case with the attack on Sony Pictures. In addition to the Sands attack last year -- about which Mr. Clapper gave no detail in public -- Iran has been identified as the source of the 2012 attack on Saudi Aramco, in which hackers wiped out data on 30,000 computers, replacing it with an image of a burning American flag.    American intelligence officials say Iran's most sophisticated hackers are limited in number, but work for both front companies and the government. The officials are concerned that as destructive attacks become more frequent, the temptation will rise to launch attacks on what the government calls ''critical infrastructure,'' like railways, power grids or water supplies.   Cylance researchers, for example, noted that Iranian hackers were using tools to spy on and potentially shut down critical control systems and computer networks in the United States, as well as in Canada, Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and a handful of other countries. Their targets have included a network that connects Marines and civilians across the United States, as well as networks of oil companies and major airlines and airports.   Norse's researchers also noted attacks from Iran that were directed at so-called Scada systems -- short for supervisory control and data acquisition systems -- like the kind that the United States and Israel attacked at Iran's nuclear enrichment center in Natanz, using code that caused about 1,000 centrifuges to self-destruct.    That strike, often referred to as the Stuxnet attack, may have inspired the Iranians to begin a cycle of retaliation, a recently disclosed memo from Edward J. Snowden's trove of National Security Agency documents indicates. Norse says it saw evidence that Iranian hackers probed the network of Telvent, a company now owned by Schneider Electric that designs software to allow energy companies and power grid operators to control their valves and switches from afar.   The company's systems were breached by Chinese military hackers in 2012. Two years later, Norse said, it witnessed 62 attacks, in a span of 10 minutes, from an I.P. address in Iran on a Telvent system that provides the foundation for all of the company's Scada infrastructure.   ''This activity,'' Norse researchers wrote, ''might be interpreted as an Iranian effort to establish cyberbeachheads in crucial U.S. infrastructure systems -- malware that is dormant for now but would allow Iran to damage and destroy those systems if it chose to do so later.''    "
"Washington, Though Still Divided, Comes Together on Trade and Other Issues","WASHINGTON --  Partisan peevishness is alive and well on Capitol Hill. But increasingly, Congress, under Republican control, is pressing forward on broad aspects of President Obama's end-of-term agenda. On a huge trade agreement, Republicans are pursuing legislation with virtually no Democratic support. Lawmakers from both parties are also considering a major bill to improve the nation's cybersecurity, rewriting an education law that will affect almost every public school in the country, and overhauling government surveillance to incorporate new protections the president has demanded. Within a month or two, lawmakers in both parties hope to begin negotiating higher spending levels to accommodate White House demands.     These efforts come on the heels of bipartisan bills to change the Medicare payment system and to give Congress a voice on any deal with Iran over its nuclear program.    ''I would like nothing better than to see a counterintuitively productive final two years of the president's term, and I think that's possible,'' said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who worked with the White House on both the cybersecurity and surveillance bills. ''Republicans want to succeed here, and Democrats don't want these two years to be wasted.''   In many ways, the busy lawmaking season reflects the tailoring -- or shrinking -- of Mr. Obama's policy agenda to find an intersection with Republicans. His biggest dreams, like a comprehensive immigration overhaul and gun control legislation, have faded along with his blue-and-red campaign posters saying, ''Yes, We Can.''    The forward movement also reflects Republicans' eagerness for legislative achievements before the 2016 presidential race, and their far larger say in drafting legislation and setting the terms of the debate after gaining full control of Congress last year.    Democrats also say that while Republicans were once set on blocking everything the president wanted to get done, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, as minority leader, is encouraging cooperation, even as Republicans block items such as the confirmation of Loretta E. Lynch as attorney general.   On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee will hold its final hearing on legislation granting the president ''fast track'' negotiating authority to complete a trade accord with 12 Pacific Rim nations, and it will formally draft the bill on Wednesday. The House Ways and Means Committee will draft similar legislation on Thursday, moving forward on one of the president's top priorities over the vociferous opposition of much of his party.   On Wednesday, the House is expected to overwhelmingly approve legislation encouraging broad data sharing, in exchange for some legal immunity, between private companies and the Defense Department and the National Security Agency as a way to combat cyberattacks. The administration has pressed hard for a legislative response to cyberattacks like those on Sony, Target and the health insurer Anthem, and lawmakers have added privacy protections in consultation with the White House.   The Senate Judiciary Committee, again reflecting a presidential push, will soon unveil a sweeping rewrite of the law governing government surveillance of phone and Internet communications. It is expected to end government dragnets of so-called metadata -- records of the numbers and times of all phone calls. It is also expected to establish an independent consumer and public advocate at the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees such programs; allow the publication of some of the court's opinions; and let technology companies be more transparent about what the government has sought.   And there is more to come. Last week, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved a bipartisan revision of the Bush-era No Child Left Behind education law. The committee's chairman, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and its ranking Democrat, Patty Murray of Washington, met with Mr. Obama at the White House on March 24 to go over the bill.   ''We have a long way to go before this bill moves through the committee, gets debates and passes on the Senate floor, goes to conference with the House bill, and hopefully gets signed into law,'' Ms. Murray said last week. But she and Mr. Alexander emphasized that this would be a bipartisan effort, with the White House's involvement.   In some cases, the legislation has been years in the making, but the timing is now right. In 2012, a muscular piece of legislation on cybersecurity fell victim to a Republican filibuster largely because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued that it would be too burdensome for corporations.   ''Since that time, there have been so many more cyberattacks,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has worked for years to pass cybersecurity legislation. ''It is clear we were ahead of our time. And there is a clear consensus now to move forward.'' Using past bills as a foundation, lawmakers worked with the Obama administration to draft a compromise bill supported by most business groups.    The new push on trade promotion authority stems from Mr. Obama's ''strategic pivot'' to Asia since the opening months of his presidency and a yearslong effort to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would be the largest trade deal since the North American Free Trade Agreement.    Last year, the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said he would need 50 Democrats to pass the trade legislation, fearing that his Tea Party wing would balk at granting Mr. Obama the authority to do anything. But the Tea Party rebellion has not caught fire, and conservative groups like Americans for Tax Reform, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute have come out strongly in favor of the trade authority, as has the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal.   In a first for Mr. Obama, he may achieve a legislative victory on an almost party-line vote in which his party votes no.   ''We're still going to need Democrats, and we're going to need more than the 10 they're trying to lowball,'' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee. ''But there's been a misconception that modern Republicans are more antitrade than they actually are.''    "
Owner Identified of Site Offering Hackers for Hire,"He calls himself an ethical hacker who helps companies and individuals fight back against the bad guys operating online. Over the years, Charles Tendell also has emerged as a commentator in the news media about the threat posed by overseas hackers and is a former co-host of an online radio show about security. But behind the scenes, Mr. Tendell, a Colorado resident and a decorated Iraq War veteran, started a new website called Hacker's List that allows people to anonymously post bids to hire a hacker. Many users have sought to find someone to steal an email password, break into a Facebook account or change a school grade.     Mr. Tendell, 32, who owns a consulting firm in Denver called Azorian Cyber Security, confirmed on Tuesday that he was the sole owner of the website. He said Hacker's List, which began as something of an ''off the cuff idea,'' grew far faster than he anticipated.   ''I never expected it to turn into what it is,'' said Mr. Tendell, a graduate of the University of Phoenix who became certified as an information systems security professional and an ethical hacker in 2011. ''I was testing the waters and wanted to see if it works.''   The verdict is still out on whether Hacker's List, which started in November, will work as a business. The propensity is for people to use it as a way to search for hackers willing to break the law as opposed to doing legitimate online investigations and surveillance.   The website has caused a stir in the online world because of its unusual approach to matching ordinary people looking to do a bit of private espionage with so-called hackers-for-hire. The company, which collects a fee for every completed assignment, has garnered considerable news coverage, including a front-page article in The New York Times in January, with much of the coverage focusing on the dubious legality of the requests.   Until now, the identity of the founder of Hacker's List had remained a mystery. An employee of Hacker's List named ''Jack'' had said on a number of occasions that the owner was not ready to talk.   The lack of disclosure surrounding Hacker's List is one reason the hackers-for-hire service has drawn considerable scorn from security consultants, who say the website is an invitation to illegal and unethical behavior. Some lawyers have said the owners could be civilly liable for maintaining a service that permits customers to seek to hire hackers for illegal activities.   Others have wondered if the website is an elaborate online joke or a sting operation set up by federal authorities.   The website's rules of operation repeatedly note that the service does not condone illegal activity, but that appears to have done little to stop people from seeking to hire hackers to carry out tasks that most would say break the law.   But Mr. Tendell said much of the criticism of Hacker's List was misplaced. He noted that even if an illegal job were posted by an anonymous user, it would not necessarily be carried out. He said clearly illegal job postings were removed if someone complained, but he said what mattered were the jobs that were completed.   ''No one is going to complete an illegal project through my website,'' he said.   Still, Hacker's List has had its share of operational hiccups since its debut, and its website has crashed a number of times. A few more than 4,000 potential jobs have been posted on Hacker's List, but many of them have not received a bid from a hacker. Mr. Tendell said about 250 jobs had been completed since the website went online.   Some hackers have tried to disrupt the service, and more recently the service has banned hackers who were looking to defraud job posters.   A few days ago, Twitter suspended the Hacker's List account, which automatically sends out new job postings. Twitter would not comment on the suspension but many of the account's tweets promoted jobs like ''hack a PayPal account.'' A Twitter spokesman would not comment on the reason for the suspension. Mr. Tendell said he did not know why Twitter suspended the account.   Mr. Tendell's role in setting up Hacker's List was unmasked in part by Erik Solomonson, a blogger who lives in New York and works for a web hosting company. He decided to do a bit of digging into the formation of Hacker's List. Mr. Solomonson unearthed an archived domain registration statement for Hacker's List from October, just before the website went live, that listed Mr. Tendell as the administrator and contact person for the site.   A few weeks later, Mr. Tendell's name was removed from a revised domain registration. The name that replaced his was David Harper, who is said to live in New Zealand and could not be contacted.   The older domain registration for Hacker's List also suggested there might be a tie-in with Neighborhood Hacker, another online hackers-for-hire firm that is also based in Colorado. Mr. Tendell said he had done work with Neighborhood Hacker but was not an owner of that company.   Mr. Solomonson said Mr. Tendell's involvement with Hacker's List pointed to how difficult it was for consumers to assess the legitimacy of firms that say they offer legal hackers-for-hire services.   It's inappropriate for someone like Mr. Tendell, who calls himself a ''white hat hacker,'' to be involved in any way with an operation that potentially is profiting from illegal activity, Mr. Solomonson said.

U.S. Scolds China for Online Attacks,"WASHINGTON --  Top Obama administration officials admonished China in a bilateral meeting on Tuesday for sponsoring online attacks against businesses, but they remained silent -- at least publicly -- on the suspected role of Chinese hackers in the recently discovered theft from government computers of personal data on millions of federal employees and contractors. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., after praising China for some economic and diplomatic actions, suggested that the country was not a ''responsible competitor'' in cyberspace. ''Nations that use cybertechnology as an economic weapon, or profits from the theft of intellectual property,'' he said, ''are sacrificing tomorrow's gains for short-term gains today.''      Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew raised the topic more than once at the meeting, known as the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, saying at one point, ''We remain deeply concerned about government-sponsored cybertheft from companies and commercial sectors.''    Secretary of State John Kerry said little publicly on the subject, but he told the visitors that the two sides would have ''a very frank discussion of cybersecurity and other ongoing concerns'' once they went behind closed doors.    The officials' remarks, opening two days of meetings, confirmed that the hacking issue would cloud the discussions, which were expected to cover a range of matters, many of them also divisive. Those include policies on trade, banking and investment, China's currency and its disputed claims in the South China Sea -- the last another issue on which Mr. Biden and Mr. Kerry publicly scolded China.   While expectations are low for achievements at the seventh annual gathering, both sides hope for progress toward agreements to be announced in September, when President Xi Jinping comes to Washington for a state visit.    The Chinese officials were publicly mum on the Americans' hacking complaints, except for a nonresponsive comment from State Councilor Yang Jiechi. ''We believe that cybersecurity is very important,'' he said. ''We think that countries should work together to develop an international code of conduct for cyberinformation sharing.''    American officials, including President Obama, have linked China's government to the hacking of insurance companies, military contractors and other corporate interests in the United States. But, as on Tuesday, they have stopped short of publicly accusing the Chinese government of complicity in the attacks that stole personal, financial and medical records of at least four million federal workers, and perhaps millions more people, although intelligence and private sector officials have traced the invasions to one or more groups in China.   Mr. Kerry lauded the nations' joint efforts in several areas: Afghanistan, North Korea, counterterrorism and the negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear program. With a deadline looming, those talks ''are reaching a pivotal moment,'' he said. All those subjects are on the meeting's agenda.    But Mr. Kerry chided China for plans to expand construction of outposts in waters that are the subject of disputes with neighboring nations, citing ''the need to reduce tensions -- rather than add to them -- in the South China Sea and the East China seas.'' Mr. Biden implicitly rebuked China as well, saying that ''responsible countries'' respect international sea lanes, and criticizing ''nations that disregard diplomacy and use coercion and intimidation to settle disputes.''    While human rights groups complain that the administration gives their concerns short shrift in forums with China, Mr. Biden did question Beijing's treatment of women, minorities, journalists and religious leaders, as well as nongovernmental, civil society and education groups. Responsible nations ''respect human rights not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it's absolutely economically necessary,'' he said.   The conclave opened on a positive note, however, as Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lew and their counterparts celebrated the climate change accord that their nations' presidents announced in November, committing both to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

"Hacking Exposed 21 Million in U.S., Government Says","WASHINGTON --  The Obama administration on Thursday revealed that 21.5 million people were swept up in a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast trove of personal information, including Social Security numbers and some fingerprints. Every person given a government background check for the last 15 years was probably affected, the Office of Personnel Management said in announcing the results of a forensic investigation of the episode, whose existence was known but not its sweeping toll.     The agency said hackers stole ''sensitive information,'' including addresses, health and financial history, and other private details, from 19.7 million people who had been subjected to a government background check, as well as 1.8 million others, including their spouses and friends. The theft was separate from, but related to, a breach revealed last month that compromised the personnel data of 4.2 million federal employees, officials said.    Both attacks are believed to have originated in China, although senior administration officials on Thursday declined to pinpoint a perpetrator, except to say that they had indications that the same actor carried out the two hacks.   The breaches constitute what is apparently the largest cyberattack into the systems of the United States government, providing a frightening glimpse of the technological vulnerabilities of federal agencies that handle sensitive information. They also seemed certain to intensify debate in Washington over what the government must do to address its substantial weaknesses in cybersecurity, long the subject of dire warnings but seldom acted upon by agencies, Congress or the White House.   ''This incident that we are talking about today is unfortunately not without precedent,'' said Michael Daniel, the White House cybersecurity coordinator. ''We have to raise our level of cybersecurity in both the private sector and the public sector.''   In a conference call to detail the grim findings and announce the agency's response, Katherine Archuleta, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, said that she would not resign despite calls from members of Congress in both parties for her dismissal.   ''I am committed to the work that I am doing at O.P.M.,'' she said. ''We are working very hard, not only at O.P.M. but across government, to ensure the cybersecurity of all our systems, and I will continue to do so.''   She announced new security measures that would be installed at the agency as well as free credit and identity theft monitoring for the victims of the breach, although she said there was ''no information at this time to suggest any misuse or further dissemination of the information that was stolen from O.P.M.'s system.''   Even so, national security officials have acknowledged the seriousness of the intrusion. Before the scope was made public on Thursday, James B. Comey, Jr., the director of the F.B.I., called the breach ''a very big deal,'' noting that the information obtained included people's addresses; details on their neighbors, friends and relatives; their travel destinations outside the United States; and any foreigners they had come into contact with.   ''There is a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for, tried to work for or works for the United States government,'' Mr. Comey said during a briefing. ''Just imagine you are an intelligence service and you had that data, how it would be useful to you.''   Administration officials said it was the personnel office's work to modernize its computer systems that first led it to detect the breach.   In April, the agency informed the Department of Homeland Security that it had found an intrusion, and the department went to work with the F.B.I. to learn more, said Andy Ozment, a top cybersecurity official at Homeland Security. That inquiry, he said, revealed that the intruder had broken into a network at the Interior Department that held a personnel office database, leading to the theft of records of 4.2 million current and former federal employees. It also found that there had been a computer intrusion at the personnel office itself, leading to the much larger trove of background check records.   Mr. Ozment said the hacker in both cases gained access to the computer systems ''via a compromised credential of a contractor.''    The debacle has touched off a scramble by federal officials to bolster the security of their networks. Tony Scott, the government's chief information officer, said every agency was racing to make improvements, including the use of basic tools like two-factor authentication that requires anyone with the password to a system to use a second, one-time password to log in from an unrecognized computer.    ''This is important work across all of the agencies of the federal government to make sure that we greatly enhance the cybersecurity profile of the U.S. government as a whole,'' Mr. Scott said.   But that effort comes after almost two decades of warnings from government auditors and other internal investigations into the vulnerabilities in federal agency networks. ''There's still much that agencies need to do that they are not doing to protect their systems,'' said Gregory C. Wilshusen, the director of information security issues at the Government Accountability Office, which has conducted cyber audits for almost two decades.   Warnings from auditors about serious vulnerabilities are often ignored by agency officials, he added. ''That's been a recurring theme. They believe they've taken corrective actions, but when one goes back to check, we find that they haven't.''   The revelations quickly prompted calls for the ouster of Ms. Archuleta, whose agency had been warned in a series of reports since 2007 about the many vulnerabilities on its antiquated computer systems.   Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Ms. Archuleta and her top technology official should resign or be removed.    ''Their negligence has now put the personal and sensitive information of 21.5 million Americans into the hands of our adversaries,'' Mr. Chaffetz said. ''Such incompetence is inexcusable.''   The criticism was bipartisan. Senator Mark W. Warner, Democrat of Virginia, also called on Ms. Archuleta to step down.   ''The technological and security failures at the Office of Personnel Management predate this director's term, but Director Archuleta's slow and uneven response has not inspired confidence that she is the right person to manage OPM through this crisis,'' Mr. Warner said in a statement.    That attackers were able to compromise the agency using a contractor's credentials is unacceptable, security experts say, given the wide availability of two-factor authentication tools, which have become standard practice, particularly since a cyberattack at Target nearly two years ago, when hackers managed to break into the retailer's system using the credentials of a heating and cooling contractor.    ''A second offense is more unacceptable than the first,'' said Suni Munshani, the chief executive of Protegrity, a data security company. ''The O.P.M. and government agencies need to get their act together and better protect the information of their employees and citizens.''    "
"Summer Camp, N.S.A.-Style: There's a Lot Less Hiking Than Hacking","ARLINGTON, Va. -- This is not your typical summer sleepaway camp. Bonfires and archery? Try Insecure Direct Object References and A1-Injections.    The dozen or so teenagers staring at computers in a Marymount University classroom here on a recent day were learning -- thanks to a new National Security Agency cybersecurity program that reaches down into the ranks of American high school and middle school students -- the entry-level art of cracking encrypted passwords.   ''We basically tried a dictionary attack,'' Ben Winiger, 16, of Johnson City, Tenn., said as he typed a new command into John The Ripper, a software tool that helps test and break passwords. ''Now we're trying a brute-force attack.''   Others in the room stumbled through the exercise more slowly, getting help from faculty instructors who had prepped them with a lecture on the ethics of hacking. In other words, they were effectively told, do not try this at home.    ''Now, I don't want anybody getting in trouble now that you know how to use this puppy,'' Darrell Andrews, one of the camp's instructors, warned loudly. ''Right? Right?'' he added with emphasis.   As campers around the country sleep under the stars and dive into mountain lakes, 1,400 youths have packed their overnight bags or lunchboxes for a very different experience.   They are attending dozens of free overnight and day camps across the country supported by the N.S.A., better known for its bulk collection of Americans' phone records and its spying on foreign leaders. Like the C.I.A. and other elite intelligence agencies, the N.S.A. has for decades recruited on college campuses and run collegiate programs, but this summer the agency is making sure that middle- and high-school-age students -- and some teachers, too -- are learning how to hack, crack and defend in cyberspace.   The goal of GenCyber, as the summer camp program is called, is to catch the attention of potential cybersecurity recruits and seed interest in an exploding field as more and more of the nation's critical transactions, from warfare to banking, move into the realm of cyberspace.   N.S.A. officials say building the next generation's cyberspace work force is a matter of national security, as a string of massive breaches at the federal Office of Personnel Management and private companies have highlighted. Studies anticipate the need to fill hundreds of thousands of new cybersecurity jobs in coming years.   That includes jobs with the N.S.A., which has its own worries about filling recruitment quotas these days because of increased competition from higher-paying private companies and bad publicity after Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A contractor, leaked a trove of classified documents showing the agency's surveillance programs as far more extensive than most Americans knew.   ''These kids are the ones that are going to be building the next products that we all rely on, the things we can't even imagine will exist in the future,'' Steven LaFountain, the head of the N.S.A.'s in-house College of Cyber and the leader of the camp program, said in an interview at the N.S.A.'s heavily fortified headquarters in Fort Meade, Md.   ''If they have just a little bit more understanding of security when they're doing that,'' he said, ''I think it will make the products that much better.''   With the help of a seed grant from the National Science Foundation, the agency started a small pilot program under Mr. LaFountain's direction last year, sponsoring six camps at colleges and universities.   This summer it has expanded to 43 camps, and about half of the 1,400 students are girls.   Mr. LaFountain hopes the program will grow to 200 camps in all 50 states by 2020.   So far there has been strong interest, he said, given the long waiting lists for the camps this year.   The N.S.A. gives each camp loose guidelines, but largely leaves it up to the colleges and universities and the instructors running them to decide which topics and exercises to cover. Unlike other popular programming and engineering camps, though, the N.S.A. also mandates that GenCyber camps be offered free of charge.   At California State San Bernardino, where there is an N.S.A. camp open only to local Girl Scouts, campers will build, program and fly drones. Campers at Norwich University in Vermont will put together their own computers.   And here at Marymount University, where campers are staying in dorms for their two-week program, visits to the N.S.A. and a security operations center break up classroom time.   The idea -- and the challenge -- of the camp, according to its head, Diane Murphy, a professor of information technology at Marymount, is to first teach students how to hack, so they can understand and defend against attackers they might encounter in cyberspace.   ''It's a fine balance for me as a teacher, because you have to teach them some of the hacking techniques, and layer that in with an ethical discussion,'' Ms. Murphy said in an interview before camp began.   ''They are most interested in the attacking things.''   A packed schedule of activities -- lectures on network forensics, student presentations on protecting private accounts, and what turned out to be a high-volume debate on the ethics of Mr. Snowden and WikiLeaks -- drive critical points home.   ''One of the things you have to discuss -- since you are going to rule the world in a couple years -- is, is this good or bad?'' Ms. Murphy said she repeatedly tells campers.   Mr. LaFountain said the agency would not make sales pitches to campers, but hoped that the work of the agency would be enough to lure them into the field.   ''We're not trying to make these camps something to make people pro-N.S.A. or to try to make ourselves look good,'' he said. ''I think we'll look good naturally just because we're doing something that I think will benefit a lot of students and eventually the country as a whole.''   Back at Marymount, a group of campers crowded around a lunch table did not seem all that concerned about the spy agency's reputation.   They said they were just happy to get to stay on a college campus with other tech-savvy students their own age while learning skills their high schools back home were not ready to teach.   ''I'd definitely take this camp over a basketball camp,'' Garvan Vines, 15, of Bowie, Md., said as he finished a bite of a sub sandwich. He said he was trying to decide between a career in cybersecurity and one in programming, so he hoped that the camp, his second GenCyber camp of the summer, would offer a good sampling of those alternate paths.   Besides, he said, ''at basketball camp they are mostly just giving you the same instructions over and over.   ''This is, like, progressive.''   Andy Lieu, 17, of Denver, picked up where his lunchmate left off.   ''At a basketball camp, everyone's trying to better themselves,'' he said. ''Here you have to collaborate and work as a group.''   Others around the table nodded in agreement, including Allyssia Dela Cruz, 15, who was in her second year at cybercamp.   ''To be honest, if you were to ask,'' she said, ''I think most people here spend more time on the computer than playing sports anyway.''    "
Valerie Plame Is Among Hillary Clinton's September Fund-Raisers,"Hillary Rodham Clinton will make a two-day swing across the West Coast to raise money next month, including the holding of a fund-raiser with the exposed former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame.  A Clinton campaign supporter described the event in an email as a ""briefing in the post-Snowden world."" Ms. Plame and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, will take part in a lower-dollar fund-raising event at the Palo Alto, Calif., home of Mike McNerney, a cybersecurity expert, and his wife, Jillian, according to an email sent to Mrs. Clinton's supporters detailing her events in September.  Michelle Kraus, who is also a cybersecurity expert as well as a former fund-raiser for President Obama and now a ""Hillblazer"" bundler for Mrs. Clinton, described the ""conversation"" with Ms. Plame and Mr. Wilson as part of life in the era since Edward J. Snowden, a former government contractor, leaked secret government files that exposed the National Security Agency's surveillance operations, ranging from private citizens to foreign leaders. Ms. Plame, once a covert C.I.A. officer, had her identity exposed by President George W. Bush's administration after Mr. Wilson criticized the White House and the war in Iraq that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Ms. Plame and Mr. Wilson are longtime supporters of Mrs. Clinton. They backed her in her 2008 presidential campaign, and wrote an op-ed endorsement this past April in USA Today that was timed with her campaign announcement that described her as the best choice for president. Mrs. Clinton will attend four other events in California, some hosted and involving tech entrepreneurs.

Return of a Dreaded Question: 'Do You Make Money?',"SAN FRANCISCO -- A funny thing happened to Orion Hindawi while he was raising $120 million for his cybersecurity start-up last month: Investors asked him about profits. A year ago, Mr. Hindawi raised $90 million, followed by an additional $52 million this year from the Silicon Valley venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. Investors were willing to place a $900 million valuation on his company, called Tanium, without so much as a glance at revenue or profit margin.    This time, not so. As he made the rounds with investors like Institutional Venture Partners and T. Rowe Price, Mr. Hindawi said, he was asked to show sales and profit margins. ''A lot of the funders we spoke with are starting to get really scared,'' he said. ''This time the questions were, 'Is this a sustainable business? Do you guys actually make money?' ''    That sudden dose of skepticism about cybersecurity start-ups, which as a group recorded record investments last year, may be a harbinger of change across the entire technology sector. With global stock markets struggling, investors may be ready to move away from the focus on growth over profits of the last few years.   If that shift proves to be more than a blip, it will represent a sharp turnabout. Cybersecurity entrepreneurs in recent years have had an easy time raising money as breaches at the nation's largest companies and government agencies have become front-page news.   In 2014, American venture capitalists poured $1.77 billion, a record amount, into private security start-ups, topping the previous record of $1.62 billion invested in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.   ''There was a big rush to fund cyber companies over the past 12 to 24 months,'' said David Cowan, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. ''But now there's a sense that there are many, many out there already and a good story is not enough to attract capital anymore.''   And there are too many companies trying to do the same thing: identify ''anomalous'' behavior on computer networks and respond to attacks in real time, Mr. Cowan said.   ''That pretty much sums up 95 percent of the companies raising money at the RSA show,'' he said, referring to the giant RSA cybersecurity conference held in San Francisco in April. ''If that's what you're promising and you think you've found a really sexy value proposition, guess what -- it's not that sexy when the room is full of people just like you.''   If interest from venture firms is any indication, Tanium must still be sexy. The Emeryville, Calif., company's technology can test the millions of computers that are attached to corporate networks, ask them questions, and patch them or shut them down in seconds, if need be.   Tanium has been profitable since shortly after it started working with customers in 2012 (it was founded in 2007). Mr. Hindawi and his father, David, were not initially interested in raising venture capital, but the value Andreessen Horowitz was willing to put on their company and the business connections the venture firm could provide were too good to ignore.   Still, Mr. Hindawi said he was surprised that venture capitalists were willing to place a $900 million valuation on a young company without so much as a glance at revenue or margin.   ''Up until a year ago, nobody cared that we were cash flow positive,'' he said. ''None of those things factored in. They basically said, 'We don't really care. What's the growth rate?'''   The diligence he encountered during the company's latest funding round was almost a relief, he said, maybe an indication that some semblance of sobriety had returned to tech funding.   But it may be just a semblance. Mr. Hindawi turned away $400 million in cash offers in the latest round. The investors who made the cut -- Institutional Venture Partners, TPG Growth and T. Rowe Price -- valued Tanium at $3.5 billion, nearly four times the $900 million valuation it received last year and double the $1.75 billion valuation that Andreessen Horowitz gave it last March, according to two people familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms were confidential.   Tanium did not need the cash, Mr. Hindawi conceded, but he chose to raise money now, in part, because word that he had recently turned down an acquisition offer sent investors flocking to the company's door -- and a quarter-billion dollars in the bank would help it survive if a downturn hit.   ''I never want to raise money again,'' Mr. Hindawi said. ''If there's a market downturn or a 'black swan' occurs, I want to make sure we cross that bar.''   Saving up cash from private investors may also be wise because the public markets have not been kind to security companies lately.   So-called next-generation security companies like FireEye, the company that owns Mandiant; Palo Alto Networks; Qualys; and Splunk have all experienced sharp drops in their share prices. Qualys's stock is down to a little over half the $55 it traded at last May, Palo Alto Networks' stock is down nearly 17 percent since July, Splunk's stock is down 20 percent since July, and FireEye's stock, which reached a high of $85.64 last year, now hovers under $40.   Those slides could continue with recent market volatility. On Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent for the day. It recovered on Wednesday, but is still down 9 percent from its recent high in July. The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular gauge of the broader market, has tumbled 10 percent since July.   With the risk of a downturn growing, Tanium is not the only security start-up putting money away for a rainy day. Crowdstrike, which runs cyberthreats through a powerful cloud computing system, received $100 million from Google Capital in July, for example.   George Kurtz, the company's chief executive, said the investors from Google were not just throwing money around. They spent a lot of time with Crowdstrike's customers, to understand the technology before investing.   Mr. Kurtz said he learned from the dot-com crash that it is better to give up a little ownership stake in return for investment dollars that can turn into a safety cushion if business turns bad.   ''I've never seen a company go out of business from dilution, but I have seen companies go out of business because they didn't raise enough money,'' he said.    "
U.S. and China Agree to Rein In State-Sponsored Computer Thefts,"WASHINGTON --  President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China took their first concrete steps on Friday toward reining in the rising threat of cyberattacks between the world's two largest economies, pledging that their governments would refrain from computer-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain even as Mr. Obama suggested that he might still impose sanctions if rampant Chinese hacking persisted. With Mr. Xi standing beside him at a Rose Garden news conference, Mr. Obama said the two had reached a ''common understanding'' that neither the United States nor China should engage in state-sponsored cyberintrusions to poach intellectual property, and that they would together seek ''international rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.''    But Mr. Obama said that he had told the Chinese president during two hours of meetings at the White House that the escalating cycle of cyberattacks against American targets ''has to stop,'' warning Mr. Xi that the United States would go after and punish perpetrators of those offenses through traditional law enforcement tools and, potentially, with sanctions.    ''The question now is, 'Are words followed by actions?' ''Mr. Obama said of China's commitments on cyberthreats. ''And we will be watching carefully to make an assessment as to whether progress has been made in this area.''   It was the third set of meetings between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi in the last three years, and it came at a potential pivot point in United States-China relations, with the Obama administration determined to find areas where it can cooperate with Beijing but increasingly wary of its behavior. Besides their meeting at the White House, the two presidents spent more than two and a half hours together Thursday night at a private dinner at Blair House, across from the White House.   At their news conference, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi made an effort to demonstrate that they had made progress on curbing cyberattacks, even as they skirted direct references to some of the most contentious issues, including the United States' claim that China was behind the theft of security dossiers on roughly 22 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management.   ''Confrontation and friction are not the right choice,'' Mr. Xi said. ''Confrontation will lead to losses on both sides.''   The pledge on cybersecurity -- a hard-fought and not entirely expected bit of progress that was still under negotiation until the final hours before the two presidents met -- came as Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi sought to spotlight their cooperation on the world stage.   They hailed progress on climate change, with Mr. Xi announcing a new commitment to start a national cap-and-trade system in 2017 to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and both countries outlining ambitious goals for reaching a global climate pact at a December summit meeting in Paris, including winning commitments from every country to reduce emissions. They also celebrated their cooperation on the nuclear accord with Iran and said they were both committed to pressing ahead against the North Korean nuclear problem, which has defied solution for more than 20 years.   But there was ample evidence, even as Mr. Obama welcomed Mr. Xi with a 21-gun salute and a state dinner on Friday night, that the two nations remain deeply at odds on key issues.   Speaking in the Rose Garden, they clashed over China's reclamation of islands in the South China Sea, which Mr. Xi defiantly defended, suggesting that China's buildup on artificial islands in the strategic waterway would move ahead and flatly denying that it was militarizing any territory.   Mr. Obama said he told Mr. Xi that he had ''significant concerns'' over the activities, ''which makes it harder for countries in the region to resolve disagreements peacefully.'' While the United States has no territorial claim in the waters, he added, ''we just want to make sure that the rules of the road are upheld.''   The Chinese president stuck to his guns, bluntly asserting, ''We have the right to uphold our own territorial sovereignty and lawful and legitimate maritime rights and interests.'' Mr. Xi said China's construction activities ''do not target or impact any country, and China does not intend to pursue militarization.''   The exchange underscored the degree to which Mr. Xi has in many ways confounded Mr. Obama's hopes and expectations.   ''As the most powerful leader in China in decades, Mr. Xi presented an opportunity for greater collaboration,'' said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser on Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Instead, he ''turned out to be an ultranationalist, bent on achieving the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation even if it meant damaging ties with the U.S. as well as China's neighbors.''   In another point of friction, Mr. Obama said he had deep concerns over human rights in China, describing what sounded like a lecture he had given to Mr. Xi about the issue.   ''I expressed in candid terms our strong views that preventing journalists, lawyers, NGOs and civil society groups from operating freely, or closing churches or denying ethnic minorities equal treatment, are all problematic in our view, and actually prevent China and its people from realizing its full potential,'' Mr. Obama said, using an acronym for nongovernmental organizations, which face strict restrictions under proposed legislation in China.   The stern message elicited only a generic response from Mr. Xi, who said democracy and human rights were ''the common procedure of mankind,'' but then added, ''We must recognize that countries have different historical processes and realities, that we need to respect people of all countries in the right to choose their own development independently.''   Even the agreement on cybersecurity left room for differences. The United States and China said they would cooperate with requests to investigate cybercrimes and, according to a White House fact sheet, ''mitigate malicious cyberactivity emanating from their territory.'' But while Mr. Obama said they had agreed on ''the principle that governments don't engage in cyberespionage for commercial gain against companies,'' Mr. Xi said nothing of computer-enabled spying, speaking only of ''cybercrime,'' a narrower formulation.   The two countries also embraced a United Nations accord, adopted in July, that commits the signatories not to target one another's critical infrastructure -- such as power plants, cellphone networks and financial transactions -- in peacetime. But that leaves open many questions, since there are many definitions of what constitutes critical infrastructure.   The morning began with an elaborate White House welcome, complete with cannons reverberating across the South Lawn as a military band played ''March of Volunteers,'' the anthem of the People's Republic of China since the 1949 revolution, and ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' The two leaders strolled across the grass reviewing neat rows of troops, then stopped to shake hands with crowds of children waving American and Chinese flags, including some who attend Washington Yu Ying Academy, a Chinese immersion school.    Later, they announced a ''One Million Strong'' initiative that aims to have a million American students learning Mandarin by 2020.   Both pro- and anti-China protesters were kept a block from the White House throughout the meeting, and the day's events went off without an incident like the heckling that so angered the Chinese when President George W. Bush hosted Mr. Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, in 2006.   Follow the New York Times's politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.

Senate Approves a Cybersecurity Bill Long in the Works and Largely Dated,"WASHINGTON --  After four years of false starts and strife over privacy protections, the Senate passed legislation by a vote of 74 to 21 on Tuesday that would help companies battle a daily onslaught of cyberattacks. But there is one problem with the legislation, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, or CISA: In the years that Congress was debating it, computer attackers have grown so much more sophisticated -- in many cases, backed by state sponsors from Shanghai to Tehran -- that the central feature of the legislation, agreements allowing companies and the government to share information, seems almost quaint. To many in the trenches of daily computer combat, it is a little like the insistence of some cavalry officers in the 1930s on sticking to horses, rather than investing in mechanized divisions.    The sponsors of the legislation concede that it would have done nothing to help Sony Pictures Entertainment, whose computers were melted down 11 months ago in a remarkably destructive attack for which the White House blamed North Korea.    That attack was not based on the kinds of previously seen computer viruses or tools that companies and the government could warn each other about. It would not have stopped the Chinese from cleaning out security records on 22 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management, which failed to put in place the same basic computer-hygiene practices that the federal government urges companies and individuals to practice. It would not have helped the State Department and the White House, whose unclassified emails were hacked by the Russians.   ''We are talking about feel-good legislation,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has long been a critic of the bill because he maintains it does not do enough to protect the privacy of information shared by companies. ''It would not have prevented any major hacks.''   But he said that his colleagues ''wanted to be able to say they voted for something to combat hacking'' and that this was what they had come up with. At the White House, which has been pushing for cybersecurity legislation since President Obama took office, senior officials also acknowledged that the proposed legislation is ''so 2009.''   That may be a little harsh: For low-level cyberattacks, the idea of companies and the government sharing data about the ''signatures'' of cyberspace intruders -- the digital trail that shows where they came from and what their code looks like -- may have some value. ''If you took the position that no single thing solves the problem, then you would never do anything -- it's a defeatist attitude,'' said Rajesh De, a former general counsel of the National Security Agency. ''You have to start with something.''   Still, the lesson of the much-debated cybersecurity legislation, which was opposed by technology companies and supported by financial services firms that demanded liability protection in case they shared data that infringed on a customer's privacy, is that cyberthreats move at digital speeds and Congress moves at, well, congressional speed.   Indeed, the Senate legislation faces more legal wrangling at a House-Senate conference at which conferees must reconcile the Senate bill with two similar, albeit slightly different, bills passed by the House in April: the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, or P.C.N.A., and the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, or N.C.P.A.A., which were eventually combined.   Both bills, like the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, would establish a voluntary threat information-sharing vehicle, whereby companies and government agencies can share information about attackers' code and techniques, and risk alerts. Both bills also include liability protections for private companies, shielding them from lawsuits for sharing certain types of data. And both set up some privacy safeguards for customers' personal information.   But the logistics of each bill are slightly different and will have to be hammered out by the conference. Lawmakers face a slew of criticism from stakeholders and privacy advocates, who worry the legislation could provide a new conduit for government surveillance, and that the liability protections could discourage companies from investing in better cybersecurity defenses.   The most vocal opposition has come from the Center for Democracy and Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union, which both argue that the Senate bill could be abused by the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain information on Internet users, unrelated to cybersecurity threats, without a warrant. In its current form, any cyberthreat information shared with the Department of Homeland Security would be shared with the N.S.A., the F.B.I. and other agencies.   The bill ''risks turning the cybersecurity program it creates into a backdoor wiretap by authorizing sharing and use of cyberthreat indicators for a broad array of law enforcement purposes that have nothing to do with cybersecurity,'' Greg Nojeim, a senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, wrote in a blog post.   The Computer and Communications Industry Association trade group, which represents Google and Facebook among others, wrote an open letter this month  saying the bill does not ''sufficiently protect users' privacy'' and complaining that the bill may even ''cause collateral harm to the systems of innocent third parties.''   The bill would authorize controversial ''countermeasures''-- retaliatory actions by companies, or security firms, aimed at disrupting or disabling the computers of adversaries. But critics argue that such measures could backfire.   The oddity of the legislation is that it focuses on what many in the cyberworld consider to be a diminishing form of defense: collecting and sharing those ''signatures,'' which the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. periodically circulate to a select list of major corporations. Most sophisticated cyberattackers have figured that out.   ''I think the fruits of detecting signatures and patterns of broad attacks are already picked,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a Harvard law professor. ''The biggest threats,'' he said, are far more customized, ''with elements of social engineering or betrayal of an employee with access to data or code.''   In fact, the list of tasks that most cybersecurity experts describe as important to deterring attacks is largely missing from the bill. A 2012 cybersecurity bill, which would have required that companies meet certain standards in exchange for immunity from lawsuits, failed to pass after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued that the rules would be too onerous on companies.

Anonymous Hackers Fight ISIS but Reactions Are Mixed,"People from various hacking collectives have tried for several months to block social media accounts that spread propaganda and attempt to recruit fighters for the Islamic State, but those campaigns gained a new energy on Twitter after the Paris attacks. Hashtags like #OpParis and #OpISIS have allowed the public to see the inner workings of those efforts, which seem to get results. The best-known group involved, the shadowy collective Anonymous, has claimed to have helped take down as many as 20,000 Twitter accounts since the attacks.    But experts have mixed views over whether the tactics risk creating a crude online dragnet that penalizes Arab speakers and sometimes sweeps up journalists and others with no Islamic State links.   On Twitter and on the website Pastebin, Anonymous has issued a rallying cry.    We report that now begins the session offensive.  Any site or accounts found pro-#ISIS must be attacked!  #Anonymous #TangoDownISIS #OpParis -- #OpParis (@OpParisOfficial) November 23, 2015   The group also has an extensive how-to list for anyone interested in taking ISIS offline. Those tactics include posting the names of thousands of questionable accounts and deploying a tool that searches certain keywords on social media and uses a bot to report inappropriate behavior to Twitter.   The keyword-search strategy is what hackers say can help shut down ISIS recruiters, but it is also a crude approach that can be controversial. In March, efforts by cybersecurity activists to identify more than 20,000 Twitter accounts of ISIS supporters inadvertently swept up the accounts of news organizations and journalists.   And on Monday, affiliates of GhostSec, a subgroup of Anonymous that claims to have carried out more sophisticated efforts, like infiltrating ISIS message boards, warned against reporting all Arabic tweets.   #GhostSec pic.twitter.com/oamzsTHeAP -- GhostSecPI (@GhostSecPI) November 23, 2015   Other groups, with different motivations and affiliations, claim to use different tactics, and ideological disagreements and infighting can sometimes play out in public.   For example, Ghost Security Group, which claims to help governments with intelligence reports, is not to be confused with the hackers of GhostSec.org. And not all participants in public Anonymous chats support the efforts. ''Paris deserved everything it got,'' one user wrote in a chat on Tuesday.   The real danger is that keyword search tactics will shut down people who are trying to monitor the Islamic State, warned Lawrence Husick, co-chairman of the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Center for the Study of Terrorism.   ''This is likely to implicate people who follow ISIS but don't support it,'' Mr. Husick said. ''They follow it for research and intelligence purposes. So it's painting with too broad a brush.''   Mr. Husick said also that Anonymous had sometimes  disseminated incorrect information.   ''I'm never in favor of cybervigiliantism,'' he said, ''even when it serves what I think is a just purpose.''   And in any case, Mr. Husick added, ''ISIS has demonstrated that it's pretty adept at putting up new accounts quickly.''   But Mark Wallace, the chief executive of the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project, supports the reporting and blocking of accounts en masse.   ''When the puppet pops back up, in the context of social media it's not as strong a puppet,'' Mr. Wallace said. ''You're weakening that person's presence on Twitter with each time you take them down.''   Mr. Wallace said Twitter serves as a funnel that attracts recruits with propaganda to public message boards that support ISIS and, from there, to encrypted channels. ''It's the funnel,'' he said of Twitter. ''Without the funnel, you wouldn't have the flow of people.''   So far, Twitter has not followed the lead of another social networking behemoth, Facebook, which has historically cracked down on pages that align themselves with terrorist organizations.   ''There is no place for terrorists on Facebook,'' Andrew Souvall, a spokesman for Facebook, told Wired. ''We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.''   Getting the Islamic State off Twitter would be a monumental task. In a report released in March, the Brookings Institution said there were at least 46,000 active ISIS supporters on Twitter from September to December of last year. Based on geographic data, the most active users were in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq and the United States.   Mass reporting appears to be getting results on other platforms. Last Thursday, an account affiliated with GhostSec.org applauded efforts by activists in the takedown of hundreds of channels on Telegram, a Russian messaging app with encryption that drew scrutiny in the days after the Paris attacks.   That's what? 242 ISIS channels blocked in 2 days.. Good job. @telegram https://t.co/smcDGwPLCi -- GhostSecPI (@GhostSecPI) November 19, 2015   Mr. Wallace said Twitter could be doing more, adding that a detailed request from the Counter Extremism Project asking Twitter do a better job of identifying and shutting down propaganda accounts was met with a canned reponse. He says that safety could be sacrificed in the name of maintaining free speech.   ''They have to change the way to look at this and be part of the solution,'' Mr. Wallace said of Twitter. ''There's no right to tweet in the Constitution. I think we have to have a debate about that.''   In April, Twitter shut down 10,000 ISIS-related accounts in one day, and a representative said that some of the reports had come from online hacking groups. A spokesman for Twitter would not comment on how it is using the latest round of reports, but the website The Daily Dot reported last week that a Twitter representative, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the company was not using the lists generated by third parties, calling them ''wildly inaccurate.''   When American officials were asked to characterize the efforts of Anonymous and other groups, the State Department and the Department of Defense declined to comment on specific efforts made by hackers to close ISIS-related accounts. But the State Department did say it was ''encouraged'' by Telegram's recent announcement that it had shut down 78 channels related to the Islamic State.   ''We are always tracking and evaluating technological changes in the radicalization messaging space, and are continually working to amplify and empower credible third parties to counter ISIL's messages,'' a State Department spokesman said on Friday.   In an interview posted on the website The Cryptosphere last week, representatives for GhostSec and Ghost Security Group offered details about their claims.   Digita Shadow, a hacker who works with the Ghost Security Group, said that activists had succeeded in blocking 149 extremist websites and over 100,000 social media accounts to date. TorReaper of GhostSec.org said that hackers had infiltrated ISIS message boards to ''learn from the inside.''   They said they had been inspired by the Paris attacks.   ''We come from various different backgrounds,'' another GhostSec.org hacker known as Ransacker told The Cryptosphere, ''but one common denominator among us is a strong desire to thwart ISIS.''    "
"Hackers Demand Ransom From TalkTalk, British Telecom Firm","The chief executive of TalkTalk, a British telecommunications provider, said on Friday that she had received a ransom demand from hackers who had claimed responsibility for stealing data on some of the company's four million customers.  TalkTalk, which offers cable and fixed-line services in Britain, said local authorities had opened a criminal investigation into the widespread data breach. The hackers may have gained access to personal data on the company's customers, including sensitive information like credit card details, dates of birth and addresses.    ''Yes, we have been contacted, by I don't know whether it's an individual or a group purporting to be the hacker,'' Dido Harding, TalkTalk's chief executive, told the BBC.   Ms. Harding did not provide further details on who the hackers could be.   Blair Bishop, a TalkTalk spokeswoman, confirmed that the company had been contacted by someone claiming responsibility and seeking payment.   In a statement, the broadband provider said it did not know how much of its users' data had been compromised, and that the British police were leading the investigation into the matter. TalkTalk said it had become aware of the breach late on Wednesday.   ''We have also begun contacting all customers directly with full details,'' the company said in a statement.   TalkTalk's shares fell as much as 11 percent in morning trading in London, but recovered by the afternoon and were down 2.3 percent in midafternoon trading.   Despite the claims of responsibility, it remained unclear whether the group that had contacted TalkTalk was behind the breach or whether the ransom demands were credible.   Yet TalkTalk's data breach -- the third successful attack on the company in the past 12 months -- is the latest in a number of online hackings that have affected a wide range of companies, including Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase.   It also potentially represents a high-profile example of hackers' efforts to ransom stolen online data to companies or individuals.   Such tactics, commonly known as ransomware, have often involved hackers encrypting people's computer data and holding it hostage until a fee is paid. In certain instances, hackers have also stolen data directly from companies and demanded payment for not publishing the material online.   Despite TalkTalk's rapid response to the data breach, some users and security experts criticized the company for going public about the hacking before knowing all the details.   The telecom provider's efforts, however, come before planned changes in Europe that would force any company that has been affected by a data breach to inform privacy regulators within three days of the hacking or potentially face fines.

LinkedIn Settles Class-Action Suit Over Weak Password Security,"LinkedIn, the largest business-oriented social network, has agreed to compensate up to 800,000 people who paid for its premium services to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that it falsely assured them it was using strong security measures to protect their personal information.  In June 2012, a file containing 6.5 million encoded LinkedIn user passwords was posted on a Russian hacker site.  The passwords were protected with a weak form of security, allowing hackers to easily unravel the code and find the actual passwords. The company, which had about 160 million users at that time, quickly put in place improved security measures, but everyone was advised to change their passwords immediately. While there was no indication that the breach had any disproportionate effect on the small number of LinkedIn users who were paying the company a subscription fee for extra services, those customers argued in court that the company had deceived them about the level of its Internet security when they had signed up. Under the settlement, tentatively approved by a federal district court in Northern California in late January, 800,000 American users who paid for premium services between March 15, 2006 and June 7, 2012, are eligible to make a claim on the $1.25 million settlement fund. After fees for the plaintiffs' lawyers are deducted, that works out to about $1 per affected user. However, only those who apply will receive a share of the fund, which means the actual payment to successful applicants will probably be larger. (For more details and instructions on how to apply, visit the official settlement page.) In a statement, LinkedIn said, ""Following the dismissal of every other claim associated with this lawsuit, LinkedIn has agreed to this settlement to avoid the distraction and expense of ongoing litigation."" LinkedIn is also close to settling a more sweeping case involving its practice of scanning the email contact lists of its users and sending repeated invitations to those contacts to connect on the service. The company told Judge Lucy H. Koh of Federal District Court earlier this month that it had tentatively accepted a mediator's proposed settlement in the case, according to reports on several legal news sites. Details of the proposal were not disclosed but will be filed in court by March 24.  A LinkedIn spokesman, Hani Durzy, said the company had no comment ""at this time"" on the proposed settlement of the second case. "
Wall St. and Law Firms Plan Cooperative Body to Bolster Online Security,"The threat of ever-larger online attacks is bringing together Wall Street banks and the big law firms that do work for them in an alliance that could result in some sharing of basic information about digital security issues. For nearly a year, banks and law firms have discussed setting up a legal group that would be affiliated with the banking industry's main forum for sharing information about threats from hackers, online criminals and even nation states -- the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. Several people briefed on those discussions said those talks would most likely lead to the establishment of such a group by the end of the year, a recognition that hackers are increasingly focusing on big law firms to glean information about their corporate clients.     Federal authorities, including President Obama, are pressing companies to share information about hackings with one another and law enforcement as way to deter the theft of information about consumers and employees.   Law enforcement agencies have long been concerned about the vulnerability of United States law firms to online attacks because they are seen by hackers and nations bent on corporate espionage as a rich repository of company secrets, business strategies and intellectual property. But attacks on law firms often go unreported because the firms are private and not subject to the same kind of data-breach reporting requirements as public companies that handle sensitive consumer information.   Over the last several months, Mandiant, the security firm that is a division of FireEye, has been advising a half-dozen law firms that were the subject of a breach, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mandiant, during a recent presentation at a legal conference, said many of the bigger hackings of law firms had ties to the Chinese government, which was seeking information on patent applications, trade secrets, military weapons systems and contract negotiations.   The law firm group under consideration would be set up as an organization to share and analyze information and would permit firms to share anonymously information about hackings and threats on computer networks in much the same way that bank and brokerage firms share similar information with the financial services group. And while the two groups would not necessarily share information with each other, the law firms would have access to some of the resources of the financial center, which has existed since 1999 and is one of the better-funded industry threat-sharing organizations.   ''The F.S.-I.S.A.C. was designed to facilitate the sharing of threat information with each other, and there is value in involving law firms,'' said Anish Bhimani, the financial group's chairman and a JPMorgan Chase managing director. ''A lot of this started because the banks were individually talking to the law firms about security information and someone said, 'This is ludicrous, let's do it together.' ''   An executive order signed by Mr. Obama on Feb. 13 specifically encourages private companies in the same industries to form organizations to better share information about online security and attacks. But the discussions between the banks and law firms began months before the executive order, said the people briefed on the negotiations.   The conversations between the banks and law firms began with a working group of about a dozen Wall Street banks -- including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- meeting periodically to discuss cybersecurity issues with representatives of big law firms like Sullivan & Cromwell; Cravath, Swaine & Moore; and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. More recently, the talks have included representatives of the International Legal Technology Association, an association of about 2,000 law firms.   The conversations between the banks and law firms were underway before last summer's attack on JPMorgan that compromised mainly email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses for 83 million households and small-business customers.   Bill Nelson, the president and chief executive of the financial group, said the plan was for his organization to anonymously provide the legal group with some of the security threat information that banks have seen on their networks. He said there would be a ''loose affiliation'' with the legal group.   The law firms might also be able to participate in security conferences sponsored by the financial services group, which takes in over $7.5 million a year in grants and membership fees.   The membership in the legal group would be voluntary, but it is expected that most large law firms and those that do regular business for a financial services firm would join, said the people briefed on the matter.   Over the last year, big banks have required more documentation from law firms about online security measures as a condition for retaining a firm for a job. Some banks, for instance, are increasingly demanding that law firms do no work for a bank on computers that can be reached by a public network.   Officials with law firms declined to talk publicly about the legal group, but several said privately that it would be a good idea. However, they said the threat of a breach was often overstated by banks, security consulting firms and law enforcement.    "
New Job for F.B.I. Agent Who Supervised JPMorgan Breach Case,"A top federal agent who was helping to oversee the criminal investigation into the hacking attack against JPMorgan Chase last summer is leaving for a job with a private investigation firm.  Austin P. Berglas is leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation after nearly 16 years to take a job with K2 Intelligence, a corporate investigations firm. K2 is expected to announce the hiring of Mr. Berglas, who served in the Army before joining the F.B.I., on Tuesday.    Mr. Berglas will serve as a senior managing director and head of United States cyber investigations for the firm.   K2, co-founded by Jules B. Kroll and his son Jeremy, recently announced that it had received a major investment from the American International Group, the insurance giant. The Krolls formed K2 after the family sold its corporate investigations firm Kroll to Marsh & McLennan for $1.9 billion in 2004.   The new firm, which now has about 300 employees working in offices around the world, is moving to position itself as a leader in digital security. The firm hopes that in hiring Mr. Berglas, who most recently was the assistant special agent in charge of cyber investigations for the New York office of the F.B.I., will strengthen its reputation in online security investigations and help it recruit other investigators.   Mr. Berglas's departure from the F.B.I. is not likely to affect the investigation into the breach of JPMorgan, which resulted in hackers gaining access to email addresses and phone numbers for 83 million households and small businesses. For some time now, federal authorities have been confident that they will be able to identify and file criminal charges against some of the hackers, possible as soon as next month, said two people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly.   The F.B.I. has already been concerned about losing top talent to the private sector, which can pay big salaries to hire investigators at a time of rising worry over hackers and data breaches.   In 2013, Mr. Berglas caused a bit of a stir in the hacker world when he told The Huffington Post that the F.B.I. had effectively neutralized Anonymous, a confederation of so-called hacktivists, as a source of major online attacks. Mr. Berglas said a series of arrests the F.B.I. had made of some Anonymous members had proved to be an effective deterrent.   More recently, Mr. Berglas has taken part in a campaign by the F.B.I. to encourage United States companies to be more proactive in reporting data breaches and intrusions by hackers to federal authorities. In his new job at K2, Mr. Berglas will find himself working on digital security from the other side, advising companies that either have been breached or are trying to avoid it.    "
Verizon Wireless to Let Users Opt Out of Ad Tracking,"Verizon Wireless, which has been under fire by privacy advocates since late last year, has decided to make a major revision to its mobile ad-targeting program. Users who do not want to be tracked with an identifier that Verizon uses for ad-targeting purposes will soon be able to completely opt out, the company said on Friday. In the past, Verizon allowed users to opt out of the marketing side of the program, but they had no option to disable being tagged with its undeletable customer codes, which critics dubbed ''supercookies.'' Some security researchers quickly illustrated that third parties, like advertisers, could easily exploit Verizon's persistent tracking to continually follow a user's web browsing activities.     In a recent interview, Praveen Atreya, a Verizon director who helped develop the technology behind the mobile marketing program, said the company was considering allowing its subscribers to opt out of being tagged with its undeletable customer codes. On Friday, Verizon confirmed this decision.   Debi Lewis, a Verizon spokeswoman, issued this statement:   Verizon takes customer privacy seriously and it is a central consideration as we develop new products and services. As the mobile advertising ecosystem evolves, and our advertising business grows, delivering solutions with best-in-class privacy protections remains our focus.   We listen to our customers and provide them the ability to opt out of our advertising programs. We have begun working to expand the opt-out to include the identifier referred to as the UIDH, and expect that to be available soon. As a reminder, Verizon never shares customer information with third parties as part of our advertising programs.   The about-face from Verizon comes less than a day after four Democratic members of the Senate's powerful Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation sent a letter to Lowell C. McAdam, the chief executive of Verizon, criticizing the company's data security and privacy practices and demanding an explanation.   ''While Verizon allows customers to affirmatively prohibit the sharing of information collected by these supercookies, it does not allow customers to remove the supercookies altogether, doing nothing to stop third parties from exploiting their existence,'' the senators wrote in the letter. ''Because of the threats to consumer privacy, AT&T wisely discontinued the use of similar mobile trackers, while Verizon has chosen to carry on.''   Also this month, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco, started a consumer petition asking federal agencies to penalize Verizon and Turn, a digital marketing software company that works with Verizon, for failing to fully disclose their tracking practices to consumers. More than 2,000 people have since signed the petition.   ''The telecom giant did not properly disclose the nature of the tracking header,'' the text of the petition said. ''They do not allow customers to opt-out of the tracking, and their current explanation of its use is deceptive at best.''   But even if Verizon now allows subscribers to opt-out of having their online activities tracked using a unique customer code, that option may not satisfy privacy advocates who say consumers are unlikely to understand the implications of default tracking. Some say Verizon should have the feature turned off by default and require people to voluntarily switch it on.   ''What they really should be doing is opt-in,'' said Nate Cardozo, a staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.   But whether Verizon ultimately gives its subscribers the choice to opt out or opt in, cyber-security experts say Verizon will still have to grapple with a basic issue: how to prevent third parties from hijacking its unique customer codes for their own purposes.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Tough Talk From European Commissioner About U.S. Tech Companies,"LONDON - American tech companies have long suspected that Europe is out to get them. They might be right. In a speech on Tuesday, Günther Oettinger, the European Commission member in charge of the digital economy, lashed out at the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook, saying that these United States tech giants were grabbing large chunks of Europeans' online data and trying to sidestep Europe's tough privacy rules - and that Europe needed a forceful response.   ""Americans are in the lead. They have the data, the business models and the power,"" Mr. Oettinger, a German politician, told an audience in Brussels. ""They come along with their electronic vacuum cleaner and suck up all the data, take it back to California, process it and sell it as a service for money."" The commissioner also warned on Tuesday that international tech companies must do more to comply with the region's strict data protection rules, which are now being revised to give Europeans greater control over their online activities. Under the current proposals, companies that misuse individuals' data may face fines of up to $125 million or 5 percent of their global revenue, whichever is higher. ""Anyone who wants to take advantage of our data will have to comply with our rules or they are going to have trouble with the competition authorities,"" said Mr. Oettinger, who added that companies like Apple and Facebook now had more information about their customers than did banks.  If companies do not comply, Mr. Oettinger added, they ""ultimately, perhaps, may be thrown out of the single market."" His comments come as several American tech companies face legal challenges over how they operate in the 28 European Union countries. Google is fighting a four-year antitrust investigation into its dominant position in Europe's online search market. The European tax arrangements of both Apple and Amazon are being investigated after questions were raised about whether they had received preferential tax treatment from certain European countries.  And the social network Facebook, whose roughly one billion non-American users are regulated from Dublin, where the company has its European headquarters, is facing questions from Dutch, Belgian and German data protection regulators about whether its revamped privacy policy complies with European law. As Europe's economy continues to sputter, the region's policy makers want to tap into the growing number of technology hubs in Europe to create jobs, build new industries and compete with the likes of Silicon Valley. As part of these efforts, the European Commission is working on a number of digital rules aimed at making it easier for European companies to stand toe-to-toe with their international rivals. Its efforts include plans to overhaul the region's data protection laws, copyright legislation andsales tax regime so that digital companies from Portugal to Poland can become pan-European businesses that can compete with the likes of Alibaba of China. Until now, however, many European tech companies have found it difficult to raise sufficient venture capital to take on the latest start-ups from the West Coast, while Europe's diverse national laws have made it hard for companies to expand quickly across the 28-member bloc. ""We desperately need a digital single market,"" Michel Combes, chief executive of the telecommunications provider Alcatel Lucent, said in an interview. ""Competition isn't on a European level. It's on a global level."" "
The President's Weak Privacy Proposal,"President Obama has said that the country needs a strong privacy law so consumers can protect personal information from advertisers, Internet firms, employers and other businesses. But the country is not going to get it from Mr. Obama. The bill his administration recently offered will do little to help individuals while giving companies great leeway in determining how they collect, use and share personal data.  Americans are increasingly worried about their privacy. About 91 percent of those surveyed by the Pew Research Center last year said they felt people had lost control of how personal information is collected and used by companies. Mr. Obama has been aware of those concerns for some time. In 2012, he called for a privacy bill of rights that included lots of admirable ideas. He said individuals should have the right to ''reasonable limits'' on the collection of personal data by businesses, and that people should be able to see and correct information that companies have collected about them.     The draft bill released by the White House on Friday only vaguely reflects those ideas and is riddled with loopholes. It seems tailored to benefit Internet firms like Google and Facebook and little-known data brokers like Acxiom that have amassed detailed profiles of individuals. For good reason, many privacy groups and some Democratic lawmakers have criticized the draft.   Under the bill, companies would be allowed to create their own codes of conduct governing how they collect, use and share personal information. The Federal Trade Commission would have to approve those codes, but the legislation would make it hard for the regulator to reject weak ones. Companies would be required to notify individuals about the information they are collecting. But they would not have to get permission first.    Further, businesses could refuse to let individuals see data about themselves if they determine that the individual requests are ''frivolous or vexatious.'' Vexatious means causing annoyance, frustration or worry. This is a fairly low bar for the legal departments of thin-skinned, easily vexed corporations to meet.    The draft bill would also limit civil fines against businesses that violate the law to a maximum of just $25 million, a pittance for many big companies. The law wouldn't be enforceable for two years after it is enacted. No company could be penalized for any violations that occur in the first 18 months after it started collecting personal information. And the law would pre-empt most state privacy laws, which can often be much stronger and more comprehensive than their federal counterparts.   The only possible explanation for why the Obama administration proposed a bill as deeply flawed as this one is that it thinks this is the only kind of legislation that might gain the support of businesses and their Republican allies in Congress. Even so, with few exceptions (like Microsoft), the bill has not been embraced by the people it was supposed to appeal to. The Internet Association, which represents businesses like Amazon, Facebook and Google, complained that it ''casts a needlessly imprecise net.''   No bill at all would have been better than this one, which would effectively codify bad behavior.     "
PreCheck Expansion Plan Raises Privacy Concerns,"Email: jsharkey@nytimes.com THE idea raised alarms among privacy advocates: Social media postings would be fair game for private companies doing background checks on people applying for the PreCheck security program, under a government request made in December. Not long after, the Transportation Security Administration last month abruptly withdrew that request for proposals. Among those concerned was Thomas P. Bossert, a security consultant and a former Homeland Security aide to President George W. Bush, who said it represented a ''massive expansion and outsourcing of the government's data-mining.''    That doesn't mean the idea has gone away, however.    The T.S.A. said in a filing that it had sent the request for proposals back for revisions because of ''some difficulties'' with the language, as the agency proceeds with its plan to hire private companies to get more travelers into PreCheck, which now has about 950,000 members.   ''T.S.A. is interested in exploring ways to work with the private sector to expand and strengthen PreCheck,'' a spokesman, Ross Feinstein, said in an email interview.   The request for proposals was posted Dec. 22 on a government website for businesses seeking federal contracts, and withdrawn on Feb. 7. A section of it described the scope of personal data that private companies could use to evaluate PreCheck applicants, who pay $85 for the enrollment process. Besides criminal and other governmental records, companies could also use ''other publicly available information such as directories, press reports, location data and information that individuals post on blogs and social media sites'' for background checks, the guidelines said. Data about retail purchases could also be considered.   PreCheck, which allows approved passengers to pass through security with less scrutiny than others (like not having to remove shoes or take laptops from cases), is the surviving descendant of a succession of Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System programs. The goal of these has been to use background checks to create a large pool of what is called trusted or known travelers -- those who have been determined to pose little risk, who can be processed more quickly through security.   Under John S. Pistole, who left the T.S.A. in December after four years as administrator, PreCheck got off to a strong start in December 2013, and for the most part it has brought relief at security for many passengers. But growth seems to have slowed, and the agency is looking for help in increasing enrollment. Congress has long pressured the T.S.A. to include private contractors in more of its operations.   Mr. Bossert, who was deputy assistant to the president for Homeland Security in the Bush administration, said in an interview that while privacy issues were the most provocative aspect of the request for proposals, his broader concerns are potential security flaws in a too-aggressive rush to ''entice people with reduced security'' into a widely expanded PreCheck, while shifting the administrative and marketing of the program to private enterprise.   ''They think if they could just advertise it more, and if it were easier to sign up, they would get more people into PreCheck,'' he said. Mr. Pistole and others at the T.S.A. have described ambitious plans to have as many as 50 percent of air travelers in the country using some kind of risk-based expedited security plan like PreCheck, but Mr. Bossert suggested that enrollment might have peaked. ''I suspect that the people who travel a lot already pay for it, and those who don't travel a lot don't find it to be worthwhile,'' he said.   There is strong political resistance to government collection of private data beyond the simple background checks now used for PreCheck. On the other hand, private companies now routinely delve into various databases of readily available information on individuals' behaviors and buying patterns, using the data to put targeted ads on user's screens or suggesting something to buy on Amazon.   ''Private industry already has access to all kinds of commercially available personal data about you, and people generally are comfortable with that,'' Mr. Bossert said.   But people are far less comfortable with the prospect of a company sifting through the vast amount of commercially available personal data for the purpose of creating a potentially intrusive security profile that would be collected under the aegis of a government agency, he added.   Mr. Bossert predicted that the T.S.A. would reissue the proposal in basically the same form, with modifications to the most contentious language.   Business travelers, who fly more frequently than others, are the prime users of PreCheck and similar programs like Global Entry, which provides fast-pass re-entry at airport customs checkpoints for Americans returning from international trips. But business travel executives said agency officials didn't consult them before issuing the request for proposals in December.   ''How secure is the biometric and personal data? What happens to the data if these companies go out of business? Is that data then just for sale to whoever decides to buy the company?'' asked Greeley Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives. ''We're not necessarily against the idea, but we're concerned about the execution.''   Michael W. McCormick, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, said closer consultation with corporate travel representatives was needed to iron out concerns about using private enterprise for the PreCheck program.   ''It's an area where though the intentions are good, it's fraught with issues,'' he said.    "
Varied Privacy Rules in Europe Complicate the Protection of Users' Online Data,"LONDON -- Who has the right to regulate Facebook? That question lies at the heart of a growing fight here after many of Europe's privacy watchdogs opened investigations into how the social network obtains and uses individuals' online data.    The investigations are concerned with changes in Facebook's privacy settings, which were updated this year and simplified the often hard-to-understand rules into concise and comprehensible language.    For some of Europe's regulators, which oversee stricter data protection rules than those in the United States, the changes raised concerns that the social network did not give people enough say over how their online data was used. The watchdogs also questioned how Facebook collected information on people who visited websites other than Facebook that had embedded ''like'' buttons connected to the social network.   At least five European regulators -- France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium -- are investigating Facebook's new privacy settings. They are expected to meet this month to discuss the continuing investigations, which could lead either to fines or to demands that Facebook alter its use of online information   ''This is just the beginning of our investigation,'' said Mathias Moulin, deputy director of enforcement at the French data protection regulator, who is overseeing the review of the company's activities. ''This is a global issue with a global company.''   The social network, however, says it complies with Europe's strict data protection rules. Facebook says it has been in contact with Ireland's privacy regulator about the policy, because the company's non-American activities are regulated from Dublin, the site of its international headquarters. The company contends that Europe's other regulators do not have the jurisdiction to demand changes to how it uses people's data.   ''The primary regulation should come from where a company's headquarters is located,'' said Richard Allan, who runs Facebook's policy team in Europe. ''It doesn't make sense that 28 regulators should make different interpretations of the same law.''   Ireland's data protection authority says it has been in contact with its European counterparts about their investigations.   The standoff over how Europe's complex privacy rules should be interpreted highlights the growing headache for American tech companies operating across the 28-member bloc.   The debate is whether individuals' privacy should be protected primarily by their domestic regulators or by the watchdog in the country where a company has its European headquarters. Reforms aimed at answering this question are expected by the end of the year, though domestic privacy regulators are eager to hold on to the power to police activities in their own countries.   Some countries, particularly France and Germany, have taken tough lines on protecting individuals' online data, fining companies like Google after the search giant breached local privacy rules. But others, like Britain, are perceived to have less stringent polices that are welcomed by tech companies. That is particularly true for Ireland, which has attracted companies like Apple, Dropbox and LinkedIn through one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the region.   ''Of course Facebook would go to a country with the lowest levels of data protection,'' said Peter Schaar, a former federal data protection commissioner in Germany. ''It's natural they would choose Ireland.''   The battle to regulate Facebook in Europe is only a sign of things to come.   Last Monday, Ireland's data protection authority assumed control of policing how Twitter collects and uses the data of its roughly 240 million non-American users. The company's European headquarters are in Dublin.   Yet as Twitter looks for new ways to crunch users' data to increase its revenue from digital advertising and other activities, analysts say that Twitter -- along with other tech companies -- may also start to face tough questions from Europe's many, and often conflicting, privacy regulators.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
France Pressures Google on Data Protection Ruling,"LONDON -- France's privacy watchdog on Friday called on Google to apply a European data protection ruling to its global domains or face financial penalties. The move relates to a decree from Europe's top court last year that allowed anyone with connections to the region to request that links about themselves be removed from search engine results. That so-called right to be forgotten ruling has pitted Google, whose search engine holds a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, against some of the region's privacy regulators.     The authorities want the ruling to apply to all of Google's domains, including Google.com, although the company contends that Europe's privacy legislation should apply only to regional domains like Google.de in Germany.   French authorities are now increasing the pressure on the American company, saying that Google must apply the ruling across all of its domains in the next 15 days or face penalties including a one-off fine of up to 300,000 euros, or almost $340,000. Last year  Google was fined ?150,000 for failing to adhere to the country's rules in a separate privacy case.   Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who leads the French data protection authority, has been a vocal campaigner to expand Europe's rules beyond the 28-member bloc. The region's privacy officials will meet in Paris next week to discuss a variety of data protection issues, including the right to be forgotten ruling and pending changes to Europe's privacy legislation.   ''For Google, the answer is worldwide,'' said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, when questioned late last year about the scope of the European privacy ruling. ''If people have the right to be delisted from search results, then that should happen worldwide.''   The French have also been the most active Europeans to request that links be removed from search engine results. Since the ruling last year, more than 55,000 requests from France have been submitted to Google, with about half of the links removed, according to the company's latest transparency report.   Google said that, when applying the right to be forgotten ruling, it had tried to strike a balance between individuals' privacy and the right to gain access to online information. The company is expected to fight the move by the French regulator in the country's courts.   ''The ruling focused on services directed to European users, and that's the approach we are taking in complying with it,'' Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Daily Report: Educational Software Gets Attention from State Politicians,"Children throughout the United States are heading back to school and many of them - some for the first time - will be using a range of online learning tools. Unfortunately, it is not always clear what the companies providing those tools are allowed to do with the information they glean from students.  In just the last year, 182 bills intended to protect student information have been introduced in 46 states, according to a report from Data Quality Campaign, a nonprofit group that supports the use of student data in education. Fifteen of those states have produced 28 laws. It is a significant change from just two years ago, when only Oklahoma had such laws on the books. So why the shift? The overall market for educational software intended for prekindergarten through 12th grade was estimated to be about $8.4 billion last year, and that number should increase substantially this year. But much of this software collects data about individual students to customize what they are learning. Many companies realize that is a concern. About 170 firms, including Google, Apple and Microsoft, have signed a pledge not to use the student data collected by their education apps and sites for personalized advertising. Still, that's not likely to dissuade legislatures from enacting laws that could vary a great deal from one state to another. It is, potentially, a recipe for confusion. But at least most big tech companies and politicians can agree that amassing data about students raises troubling questions. "
European Court Adviser Calls Trans-Atlantic Data-Sharing Pact Insufficient,"LONDON --  The laws governing companies that share online customer data between Europe and the United States may soon become a lot tougher. A legal position published in Luxembourg on Wednesday by a senior adviser to Europe's highest court said that a trans-Atlantic ''safe harbor'' agreement allowing companies to ship people's data between both regions did not provide sufficient checks on how that information may be used.    The ruling by Yves Bot, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice, could have a significant impact on companies like Facebook and Google, which routinely move data about people's online activities like social media postings and online search queries outside the 28-member bloc.    ''This could have a major economic impact on Europe and the U.S. if the court follows this opinion,'' said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels.   Although the opinion is nonbinding, the position of the senior adviser is often followed by the court. A final judgment is expected by the end of the year, though some analysts said a decision could come as early as next month.   In his opinion, Mr. Bot said that American privacy rules did not offer European citizens enough protection, or legal recourse, against their online data being misused by companies or national governments.   He added that the potential collection of people's online information, often without their knowledge, infringed on Europeans' fundamental rights. An agreement between Europe and the United States that allowed companies to share data also should have been suspended, he said.   Mr. Bot also said that domestic regulators in each European country should have the right to suspend transfers of data about their citizens to the United States if the watchdogs believed that the privacy of individuals had not been guaranteed.   ''The law and practice of the United States allow the large-scale collection of the personal data of citizens of the E.U. which is transferred, without those citizens benefiting from effective judicial protection,'' Mr. Bot said in a statement.   ''Interference with fundamental rights is contrary to the principle of proportionality, in particular because the surveillance carried out by the United States intelligence services is mass, indiscriminate surveillance,'' he added.   Many technology companies rely on transferring data between regions to power their operations, particularly for online advertising. But European privacy campaigners have balked at this because American data protection rules do not offer the same protection to individuals that is available in Europe, where privacy is viewed as a fundamental right almost on par with freedom of expression.   By suggesting that companies may not be able to move data about their European customers to the United States, the court adviser's opinion may force companies like Google and Facebook to rely more heavily on their European operations. They might need to build new data centers in Europe to analyze people's online activities.   Industry executives have warned that companies may not be able to offer new services to Europeans if such offerings relied on sending online data outside the 28-member bloc.   ''We are concerned about the potential disruption to international data flows if the court follows today's opinion,'' John Higgins, director general of DigitalEurope, an industry trade group, said in a statement.   While the advocate general's opinion does not have to be followed by the court, analysts say that in many cases, the judges have followed the advice.   There have been some exceptions, though.   Last year, the European Court Justice ruled that people with connections to Europe could ask that search engines like Google remove links about them from online search queries. That decision on the so-called right to be forgotten went against the advice of the court's advocate general.   The adviser's opinion on Wednesday is related to a case brought by Max Schrems, an Austrian graduate student, who has argued that Europeans' online data was misused when Facebook was said to have cooperated with the National Security Agency's Prism program.   That program, which was revealed by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, supposedly gave the agency unfettered access to data collected by several American tech companies, including Facebook and Google.   Mr. Schrems, who is pursuing a separate civil class-action lawsuit against Facebook, said the N.S.A.'s access to information on Facebook's European users broke the region's tough privacy rules. He has also argued that the data-sharing agreement -- known as safe harbor -- between Europe and the United States does not give Europeans sufficient recourse if their data is misused by companies or national governments.   ''It is great to see that the advocate general has used this case to deliver a broad statement on data transfers to third countries and mass surveillance,'' Mr. Schrems said in a statement.   Facebook said on Wednesday that it did not give government intelligence agencies backdoor access to customer data, and that the company complied with European privacy rules.   ''Like the thousands of other companies who operate data transfers across the Atlantic, we await the full judgment,'' Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement.   The so-called safe-harbor agreement has been in place since 2000 and enables American technology companies to compile data generated by their European clients in their web searches and other online activities.   Currently, the companies can use the data for business and marketing purposes in the United States, even though Europe's rules governing online data privacy tend to be more stringent than American ones.   Under the agreement, more than 3,000 European and American companies are expected to treat the information with the same privacy protections as if the data had remained within the European Union. That agreement, however, is now in jeopardy after the advocate general's legal opinion on Wednesday.   Mr. Schrems initially focused his privacy complaints against Facebook in Ireland, where the company has its non-American headquarters. But local courts there referred his case to the European Court of Justice, which now must decide whether the trans-Atlantic data-sharing rules are sufficiently rigorous.   ''This case is a very big deal,'' said Christopher Kuner, co-director of the Brussels Privacy Hub, a research center, at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium. ''It has the potential to be the biggest-ever data protection case in Europe.''    "
Postal Service Is Faulted on Privacy Protections,"WASHINGTON --  Employees of the United States Postal Service failed to properly safeguard documents that included the names, addresses and financial information used by its law enforcement arm to monitor the mail of people suspected of criminal activities or for national security purposes, an internal investigation found. The information, which is collected as part of the Postal Service's mail cover surveillance program, could potentially reveal personally identifiable information and compromise the privacy of the mail, according to the report, which was conducted by the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General and released Thursday.     A mail cover is a surveillance tool used by the service to monitor the mail of a person suspected of criminal activity by recording the information on the outside of all letters and packages delivered to a home or business. Law enforcement officials say it is an important investigative tool, but privacy advocates say the practice is ripe for abuse because it does not have judicial oversight and is shrouded in secrecy.   The report released Thursday follows a similar audit last year that examined the use of mail covers by outside law enforcement agencies.   The most recent report examines the internal use of the program by the Postal Inspection Service, the law enforcement arm of the Postal Service, and found similar problems.   According to the report, the Postal Inspection Service approved 118,577 mail covers requested by its postal inspectors and 39,966 requested by external law enforcement authorities in fiscal years 2010 through 2014.   Auditors said they found numerous problems with the way the agency handled mail covers. According to the report, Postal Service personnel at six of nine postal facilities visited by auditors did not adequately safeguard the collected documents.   For example, at a postal facility in the New York District, a carrier placed a mail cover package, with names, address and other information, on top of his workstation, where it was accessible to other employees. The information was supposed to be secured.   During a visit to a facility in the Chicago District, auditors found that a form used to record the name and address of the subject of an investigation was posted on a mail carrier's workstation and could be seen by other employees.   Postal Service auditors said managers at the postal facilities failed to ''provide adequate oversight to ensure employees followed the procedures.''   The problems identified by the inspector general also were not limited to internal mail covers.   In one instance, Postal Inspection Service personnel did not notify a requesting law enforcement agency in one of the 11 episodes where the mail cover was compromised. In the other 10 episodes, postal managers informed local law enforcement about the breaches and took disciplinary action against employees for publicly disclosing the mail cover.   Although the postal auditor noted that the Post Office has taken steps to address some of the issues it identified in the May 2014 audit, problems persist. The audit found that the agency still had trouble collecting information from the law enforcement agencies that requested mail covers.   The mail cover program has received the attention of privacy advocates and some members of Congress.   Last week, Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, introduced a postal reform bill that would make a number of changes to the program, including providing statistics regarding the mail covers program, which includes the number of external and internal requests, as well as approvals.

Group Sees European Privacy Crackdown as Chance to Make a Deal,"Companies are scrambling. American and European lawmakers are upset. And no one really knows how to respond. The cause of the anxiety? The decision two weeks ago by Europe's highest court to strike down a 15-year-old international agreement, known as safe harbor, that had allowed companies to move digital information like people's web search histories between the European Union and the United States.    The ruling has left businesses like Facebook and Google, which rely on the easy transfer of online information to make money from digital advertising, on uneasy legal footing.    A new safe harbor agreement between Europe and the United States could help ease some of that uncertainty, but negotiators have been unable to reach a new deal for two years.   And in a sign of increased tension, European privacy regulators say they will start to enforce tougher oversight of data transfers, including issuing fines and banning overseas data transfers, by the end of January if a new agreement is not reached.   Yet despite the uncertainty, a group of leading global privacy experts says government officials in Europe and America should use the ruling to their advantage -- as a way to create better cooperation between agencies. The group, whose project is called Privacy Bridges, will publish recommendations on Wednesday that offer regulators a series of specific steps to help officials work better together.   ''We should never waste a good crisis,'' said Jacob Kohnstamm, a member of the group and the data protection regulator in the Netherlands. ''We're trying to make things a little less onerous with these practical steps.''   In particular, the group wants greater cooperation between Europe's privacy regulators and the Federal Trade Commission, the American agency primarily in charge of data protection issues. Such collaboration could reduce misunderstandings on each region's stance toward privacy, build trust between global regulators and share the best ways to handle new tech trends like cloud computing, according to the group.   The experts' conclusions, which can be put into effect within current privacy rules, will be presented at a global privacy conference in Amsterdam next week. Many of the world's data protection regulators, including those from the United States, are expected to discuss the European court ruling at the conference.   The group, whose members include Daniel J. Weitzner, a former deputy chief technology officer at the White House, will recommend that countries give individuals greater control over how their data is used. In addition, they say, companies should be more transparent when government agencies request access to people's online information.   But even if all of the recommendations were adopted, many legal questions would remain.   ''It seems like the European court just pulled the plug on the whole thing,'' said Mr. Weitzner, who is now leads the M.I.T. Cybersecurity and Internet Policy Research Initiative, in reference to the recent legal decision. ''We felt a sense of urgency; we needed to move things forward.''   Despite these efforts, companies are still grappling to find ways to stay on the right side of Europe's tough privacy rules.   Some American cloud computing companies, for instance, have contacted European rivals in efforts to reduce their legal risks when providing online services within the 28-member bloc. That could involve American tech companies transferring legal responsibility -- and data -- of their European users to local cloud computing competitors, which already comply with the region's tough privacy rules.   ''People who wouldn't give us the time of day are now pursuing us,'' said James Kinsella, an American entrepreneur who runs Zettabox, a cloud computing company whose data is held only within Europe. Mr. Kinsella declined to name the American companies with which he was discussing partnerships.   ''These deals won't make or break our business,'' he added. ''But we clearly have a solution to this privacy problem.''   The ruling also has added new wrinkles to some longstanding legal disputes.   On the day of court's decision, Microsoft, which is in a fight with the United States government over attempts to seize a customer's data stored in Ireland, also filed a letter to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, citing the European privacy ruling as grounds for not sharing the user's information with American authorities.   Microsoft's lawyers said the court's decision showed the company would violate European privacy law if it moved individuals' personal data to the United States without sufficient guarantees in place.   And the company is considering additional data centers in Europe to serve its users in the region, in part as a response to the court's recent privacy ruling, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. ''Individuals should not lose their fundamental rights simply because their personal information crosses a border,'' Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said in a blog post. ''This principle underlies every aspect of the European Court's decision, and it makes sense.''    "
Major Cybersecurity Bill Is Set to Clear the Senate,"While most of the attention in Congress is focused on fiscal issues and leadership fights, a major cybersecurity bill is quietly moving in the Senate.  Senators on Tuesday are scheduled to consider multiple proposed changes to the measure before a final vote, which Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, could try to force as early as Tuesday evening. Backers of the legislation say it could help secure the nation's digital infrastructure by allowing private companies to share information about threats and attacks with the federal government, to help companies better protect themselves.  ""The legislation's voluntary information-sharing provisions are key to protecting the personal information of the people we represent,"" Mr. McConnell said. Critics of the measure, which was drafted in the Intelligence Committee, say it could lead to more government snooping and grant access to private information without substantially reducing the possibility of damaging disclosures of personal data. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, plans to propose changes to bolster privacy protections. Despite the criticism, the measure has bipartisan support, and it is likely to pass and move into negotiations with the House, which has passed its own cybersecurity bills. "
Fed Expected to Raise Rate and High Expectations for New 'Star Wars',"Update for Consumer Prices On Tuesday, the Labor Department is expected to release its latest update on changes in consumer prices for November. With the continuing plunge in oil prices -- average pump prices dropped 19 cents in just one month -- and widespread discounting in sectors from apparel to cars last month, analysts expect the Consumer Price Index to remain flat. Even a drop in the headline number is unlikely to push the Federal Reserve off course and deter it from raising the benchmark interest rate when it meets on Wednesday. --Patricia Cohen    Data Protection in Europe    European policy makers are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to complete long-awaited data protection rules aimed at giving people across the region a greater say over how companies use their personal data. The overhaul, which will come into force over the next two years, could lead to fines totaling millions of dollars for tech giants like Google and companies like the drug maker Pfizer if they fail to comply with Europe's privacy rules, which are significantly more stringent than those in the United States. --Mark Scott   Deadline for Halliburton and Baker Hughes   While Halliburton's $35 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes was announced a year ago, the companies face a looming deadline on Tuesday for approval by the Justice Department. Since the two oil service providers first agreed to the deal, oil prices have plunged, making it more difficult to sell assets to allay any regulator concerns about competitiveness. Last week, regulators sued to block Staples's acquisition of Office Depot. --Leslie Picker   Fed Expected to Raise Rate   The drumroll is over. It's time for the main event. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the Great Recession. The first increase won't amount to much.   The Fed, which has held the rate near zero for seven years as the mainstay of its economic stimulus campaign, is likely to set a new range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. The more important question is how quickly the Fed plans to continue raising rates. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will have a chance to frame those expectations when she holds a planned news conference after the announcement. --Binyamin Appelbaum   Valeant's Outlook   Valeant Pharmaceuticals International will hold a meeting for investors and analysts on Wednesday, at which the company is expected to discuss its financial outlook for next year as well as certain drug development programs. The stock of the once high-flying company has been inching up recently after losing more than two-thirds of its value on concerns about the sharp price increases on some Valeant drugs and the company's relationship with a mail-order pharmacy that is now being shut down. Investors will be looking for updates on the pharmacy matter at the meeting, which is scheduled to run from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. --Andrew Pollack   General Electric Looks Ahead   On Wednesday afternoon, General Electric will present its outlook for next year. In 2015, G.E. accelerated its post-financial crisis shift away from finance and back to its industrial roots, selling and servicing machinery such as jet engines, power generators, medical imaging machines and oil field equipment.   With the strategy in place, next year should be one of execution for G.E. Analysts will be closely watching the company's forecasts for major industrial markets, especially as oil prices continue to drop, and the probable impact on G.E.'s business. Wall Street's consensus estimate for G.E. in 2016 is $1.51 earnings per share on revenue of $129 billion. --Steve Lohr   Puerto Rico Bond Restructuring   Thursday is the deadline for Puerto Rico's electric power authority to reach a deal with its creditors to restructure its debt. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has persuaded many bondholders to exchange their debt for new bonds with more favorable terms to the struggling utility. But the agency has struggled to win over the insurance companies that are backing about 30 percent of the bonds, putting a restructuring in jeopardy. --Michael Corkery   E.U.'s Year-End Summit Meeting   European Union leaders plan to meet late this week for their last scheduled summit conference of the year. Discussions are expected to begin on Thursday in Brussels with a focus on migration, security and British demands to reform the bloc.   On Friday, the leaders are scheduled to turn to economic and monetary issues, including the so-called European Deposit Insurance Scheme, which was proposed last month by the European Commission, the bloc's executive agency.   The system would aim to ensure that all depositors across the 19 countries using the euro could be equally confident that their savings were safe. But Germany, which has long resisted sharing fiscal risks with other eurozone countries, has signaled reservations about the idea. That means leaders are likely to agree, at most, to a gradual introduction of such a system. --James Kanter    'Star Wars' Anticipation   After nine months of nearly nonstop publicity -- fan conventions, magazine covers, 500 storm troopers on the Great Wall of China, retail hoopla and theme park tie-ins -- is there anyone anywhere not yet aware that ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' arrives on Friday? For Disney, which bought Lucasfilm, the studio behind the ''Star Wars'' franchise, for $4 billion in 2012, the stakes are gargantuan. If opening-weekend ticket sales are perceived by investors to fall short, even by a little, the entertainment conglomerate's stock will undoubtedly get roughed up on Dec. 21.   Disney has been trying to dial back expectations, but Wall Street thinks ''The Force Awakens'' will deliver one of the biggest openings -- if not the biggest -- in Hollywood history, surpassing the $209 million that ''Jurassic World'' generated in June. --Brooks Barnes    "
An E.U. Nod to Tougher Data Rules,"European officials approved long-awaited data protection regulations on Tuesday, the latest effort in the region to give people a greater say over how their digital information is collected and managed. The changes, expected to go into effect by early 2017, would put into law across the 28-member European Union some policies now enforced after court rulings or in specific countries only. They are intended to bolster Europeans' privacy rights, which are viewed by the bloc as on a par with freedom of expression.    ''These new Pan-European rules are good for citizens and good for businesses,'' Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner, said in a statement on Tuesday. They ''will profit from clear rules that are fit for the digital age.''    The new rules were approved at a meeting of representatives from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union; the European Parliament; and member states. The officials had been meeting regularly since the summer to reach a compromise, though they often differed on how far Europe's privacy rules should go in capping companies' access to people's online information.   Europe's national governments and the European Parliament are widely expected to back the proposals later this week, support that is necessary for the rules to go in effect.   Among the new policies approved on Tuesday:   â-  Allowing national watchdogs to issue fines, potentially totaling the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars, if companies misuse people's online data, including obtaining information without people's consent.   â-  Enshrining the so-called right to be forgotten into European law, giving people in the region the right to ask that companies remove data about them that is either no longer relevant or out of date.   â-  Requiring companies to inform national regulators within three days of any reported data breach, a proposal that goes significantly further than what is demanded by American authorities.   â-  Obliging anyone under 16 to obtain parental consent before using popular services like Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram, unless any national government lowers the age limit to 13.   â-  Extending the new rules to any company that has customers in the region, even if the company is based outside the European Union.   The tough stance on privacy has often put the European Union at odds with large American tech companies like Google and Facebook, which collect and mine data from social media posts and online search results as part of their digital advertising activity. The companies, as well as consumer groups and some national politicians, have lobbied to either limit the strength of the legislation or to ensure that people have greater control over their online data.   ''Europe's approach to privacy is much stronger than in the United States,'' said Peter Church, a technology lawyer at Linklaters in London. ''There's a fundamental difference in culture when it comes to privacy.''   Policy makers agreed on fines totaling up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue for the most serious breaches to European data privacy rules -- potential sanctions that put Europe's data protection rules on par with the region's onerous competition laws.   ''This would be a major step forward for consumer protection and competition and ensure Europe has data protection rules that are fit for purpose in the digital age,'' Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has campaigned for tougher penalties, said in a statement on Tuesday.   The threat of sizable fines has raised concerns for many of the large tech companies that will be most affected by the changes, some of which have complained that Europe's data protection overhaul unfairly targets their activities compared with those of smaller European rivals. European and national politicians deny the accusations.   ''Linking sanctions to worldwide turnover makes zero sense,'' said Alexander Whalen, a senior policy manager at Digital Europe, a Brussels-based trade body whose members include Google and Microsoft. ''We have to be smarter about this.''   Numerous areas of privacy policy remain unresolved, however, according to data protection experts. That is particularly true for efforts to decide which of Europe's many national regulators will have the final say in determining if a company has breached the region's privacy rules.   Facebook, for instance, has run into problems after at least five national privacy watchdogs -- in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain -- started investigations into whether the social network broke data protection laws. Last month, a Belgian court ruled that Facebook could not collect information on people in the country who did not use its service, a ruling the company is appealing.   Facebook contends that Ireland -- where the company has its international headquarters -- is the only country that can make such privacy rulings, though Europe's new data protection rules would allow the region's many data protection watchdogs to intervene if they suspect their citizens' data has been misused.   ''National authorities still have a lot of room to decide how to implement the rules,'' said Patrick van Eecke, a data protection lawyer at DLA Piper in Brussels. ''That was not supposed to be the intention of these reforms.''    "
Apple Confirms Discovery of Malicious Code in Some App Store Products,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Hackers have found their way into Apple's App Store. Apple confirmed on Sunday that a tool used by software developers for the company's devices was copied and modified by hackers to put bad code into apps available on the App Store.    So far about 40 apps with malicious code, or malware, have made it into the App Store, said researchers at Palo Alto Networks, an online security company that is investigating the incident. In a blog post, the security company said the breach could potentially affect hundreds of millions of users.    The list includes some of the most popular apps in China, like the ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi. Many of the apps are popular elsewhere as well, like the messaging app WeChat, which has about 500 million users, and the business card scanner CamCard. The Chinese online security company Qihoo said it has found more than 300 infected apps.   The fake developer code ''was posted by untrusted sources,'' said Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman. ''To protect our customers, we've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software.''   It was unclear on Sunday how many people had downloaded the apps based on the hacked developer tool. Security researchers at the giant Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, Palo Alto Networks, the app makers and Apple are working to assess the damage, said Ryan Olson, who leads a threat research team Palo Alto Networks.   Chatter about modified versions of the developer code, called Xcode, started to surface last week on Weibo, China's version of Twitter.   Researchers found that some copied versions of Xcode had been modified to embed malicious software into apps. As app makers checked to see whether their products had been infected, Apple and security researchers worked to find and get rid of the bad versions of Xcode, which were all on a cloud hosting service owned by the Chinese Internet company Baidu. Mr. Olson said Baidu has removed them.   In a statement posted to an official Tencent blog on Saturday, the company said that the flaw had been repaired and would not affect users who upgrade the WeChat app. ''A preliminary investigation into the flaw has revealed that there has been no theft and leakage of users' information or money, but the WeChat team will continue to closely monitor the situation,'' it said.   Apple said on Sunday that it was working with developers to make sure they were using the proper version of Xcode, the tool used to create the apps.   Once the infected apps are downloaded, researchers said, the malicious code can open particular websites designed to infect the device with more viruses. It can also open innocuous-looking pop-up screens that ask users for more information, like passwords to their Apple account.   ''Since the dialogue is a prompt from the running application, the victim may trust it and input a password without suspecting foul play,'' Palo Alto Networks said in its blog post.   Researchers said only the most recent versions of the apps created with the counterfeit version of Xcode were at risk.   This security breach illustrates the lengths to which hackers will go to break into Apple's hardware and software, which has long been thought of as having superior security.   ''Apple has been extremely successful at keeping malware out of the App Store,'' Mr. Olson said.   Mr. Olson said that even in this case, hackers did not crack Apple's software. Instead they took advantage of the fact that many Chinese developers use copies of Xcode that are held on Chinese servers, since they load faster than the version of the code that's available from Apple.   The bad Xcode was available only to those developers who had disabled Apple's safety features. Otherwise Apple would have presented a warning that something was wrong with Xcode, Mr. Olson said.   Many of the websites that were receiving stolen information have been discovered and shut down, according to researchers.   Mr. Olson said versions of Xcode from Apple should be safe.    "
"State Dept. Calls 3 Clinton Emails 'Secret' After Reviewing 6,300 Pages","WASHINGTON --  Three emails sent to Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2011 when she was secretary of state contained information that should have been considered ''secret,'' the government's second-highest classification, according to a State Department review of about 6,300 pages of her emails made public on Wednesday. In one case, officials have deemed the email secret because aides to Mrs. Clinton attached a document containing the minutes of secret negotiations in 2008 between Israelis and Palestinians that had been posted online by the Al Jazeera television network.    In another instance, two emails sent to Mrs. Clinton contained summaries of confidential discussions among officials of six world powers about Iran's nuclear program. The emails, sent by Jake Sullivan, one of Mrs. Clinton's top advisers at the State Department, have now been marked secret by the department.    The heavily redacted emails were posted online by the State Department, the latest in a series of monthly disclosures ordered by a court after revelations that Mrs. Clinton had used a private email system when she was secretary of state.   Among the emails released Wednesday were five that appear to be attempts by hackers to penetrate Mrs. Clinton's email system. The messages appear to be notices of speeding tickets from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. But the emails are well known as phishing attempts by hackers in Russia. It is not clear whether Mrs. Clinton clicked on the malware-infected messages.   By itself, the spam directed at Mrs. Clinton's email does not indicate that her server was infected, or that the Russian hackers suspected of originating the phishing campaign had access to her network. But it does raise questions, because the State Department itself has been subjected to relentless attacks from Russian cyberespionage experts.   The emails could have been randomly generated, rather than directed at her. But because her email address was not widely known, the attempt to lure her to respond to a fake email probably passed through someone who knew her well enough to have the address, and to be an unknowing conduit for the infected email.   Investigators who now have the server will look for malware or spyware, but malicious code found on State Department servers last year was complex, so there is no assurance that there would be evidence of any attack on Mrs. Clinton's server.   ''As we have said before, there is no evidence that the system was ever breached,'' said Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. ''All these emails show is that, like millions of other Americans, she received spam.''   The latest batch of emails also includes quirky exchanges between Mrs. Clinton and her aides on topics as varied as Mrs. Clinton's difficulty adjusting the volume on her phone and her frustrations with a White House operator who did not believe she was really the secretary of state.   As a presidential candidate, Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly had to answer questions about the private server she used for the emails she sent and received. It is against the law to possess classified electronic material outside a secured government network.   Dozens of emails Mrs. Clinton sent and received were not classified at the time they were sent, but have now been made ''confidential.'' One other email, made public in May, has been reclassified as secret. The inspector general for the intelligence community said in August that two other emails were ''top secret,'' although the State Department has contested that classification.   A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the emails released Wednesday. All three of the ''secret'' emails released by the State Department were almost completely redacted before they were posted online.   The ''secret'' email containing the 2008 Israeli-Palestinian document noted only the attendees at the meeting in Jerusalem on June 15, 2008. They included Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, and several officials from Israel and the Palestinian Authority.   That document remained available on Al Jazeera's website.   The two emails about the Iran nuclear program were sent by Mr. Sullivan in January 2011 and appear to include a summary of talks conducted by the ''P5+1,'' the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. The subject line was ''FW: Summary of Day One of Istanbul P5+1 talks.''   State Department officials appear to have concluded that those details about conversations among foreign officials should have been classified as secret at the time they were sent.   Many of the other emails released on Wednesday provided a window into the day-to-day communications of Mrs. Clinton's State Department.   In one email in February 2010, Mrs. Clinton complained to Huma Abedin, a top aide, of troubles trying to place a telephone call.   ''Right now I'm fighting w the WH operator who doesn't believe I am who I say and wants my direct office line even tho I'm not there,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote.   Other emails suggest the secretary of state's lack of technological prowess. In one, Mrs. Clinton tells Ms. Abedin that she cannot turn on her phone's ringer.    ''Monica will come turn ringer on,'' Ms. Abedin replied. ''Any that u want us to set up, let me know.''    Many of the emails to Mrs. Clinton offer fawning compliments from friends, family or staff members. But in at least one, praise came from an unexpected source: Anita McBride, who was chief of staff to Laura Bush, the former first lady.   ''We are so fortunate she is where she is. I know it's so damn hard,'' Ms. McBride wrote to one of Mrs. Clinton's aides. ''I'll pray for her.''   In one email, Mrs. Clinton demanded to know who ''made the decision that State will not use the terms 'mother and father' and instead substitute 'parent one and two.' '' Mrs. Clinton wrote that someone should ''address this today'' to avoid ''a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al.''   ''I'm not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress,'' she added.   Mrs. Clinton's emails also show her private frustration over her interactions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as she pressed his government in early 2010 to make concessions the United States believed were critical to move toward a peace settlement.   ''FYI. Israelis spinning up a storm, starting with plane briefing on the way over,'' an aide to Mrs. Clinton wrote to her, noting that one reporter at the briefing said the Israelis ''sounded a bit cocky.''   ''They always sound cocky -- in the air or on the ground,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote back, to Mr. Sullivan.

4 Arrested in Schemes Said to Be Tied to JPMorgan Breach,"A huge computer attack against JPMorgan Chase last summer may have been more of an attempt to fuel an ongoing pump-and-dump stock scheme rather than an effort to steal financial data from the nation's biggest bank. Federal authorities on Tuesday announced the arrest of four men in Florida and Israel in connection with a series of fraudulent investment schemes involving penny stocks and Bitcoin that spanned the globe, from Florida to New York to Israel to Cyprus and Russia.     But authorities also suspect that some of the men arrested, along with a fifth man charged but still at large, had a hand in last summer's hacking at JPMorgan that compromised the contact information for 83 million of the bank's customers, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   None of the five men have been charged with the theft of email addresses and other contact information from the bank or carrying out the hacking.   Still, authorities are hoping that some of the defendants will seek to cooperate with the investigation and provide prosecutors with enough evidence to also file charges over the hacking -- one of the largest ever targeting a United States bank.   A series of court filings unsealed by federal prosecutors in Manhattan did not mention the attack on JPMorgan's vast network that went on for several months before it was discovered in late July. Rather, the court filings detailed charges involving a multiyear campaign to drive up the price of worthless penny stocks by pitching them to unsuspecting investors through millions of spam emails.   One of the people briefed on the matter said he believed that the defendants had intended to use some of the email addresses obtained in the JPMorgan hacking to find other people who could be persuaded to invest in otherwise worthless stocks.   Still another scheme involved an unlicensed money-transfer operation used by criminals to cash in Bitcoin paid by people to get malicious software removed from their computers. The perpetrators of that scheme sought to hide their illegal activities by taking control of a small New Jersey credit union.   It is not clear how the five men came to know each other or how the schemes were related.   A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on the arrests. The bank has said the breach did not compromise customer financial information or sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.   The two men charged and arrested in Florida, Anthony Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, both attended Florida State University, according to their LinkedIn pages. The men were charged with running an illegal money-transfer operation that converted the digital currency Bitcoin into cash for online criminals.   Information about their lawyers could not be learned late Tuesday.   Less is known about the three Israel residents charged with running a pump-and-dump stock scheme that dates back to at least 2011. Two of the men, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, were arrested in Israel. United States prosecutors said they would seek to extradite them. A third man, Joshua Samuel Aaron, an American citizen who lives in both Israel and the United States, was charged but remains at large.   In a criminal indictment, Mr. Aaron was described as a frontman for the pump-and-dump schemes who went by the alias ''Mike Shields'' and communicated with unidentified stock promoters in the United States at Mr. Shalon's direction. Prosecutors contend the investment schemes made millions of dollars for the men, who laundered their money through bank accounts for a Cyprus-based shell company that had no actual business.   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed its own civil lawsuit against Mr. Shalon, Mr. Orenstein and Mr. Aaron.   Information about their lawyers could not be learned.   Soon after the hacking was discovered at JPMorgan, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation determined the attack was not particularly sophisticated even though the bank's security people had argued otherwise. The hacking succeeded largely because the bank failed to properly put updates on a remote server that was part of its vast digital network.   Early on, federal authorities had identified some of the five men as being involved in the hacking but did not have enough evidence to charge them, said the people briefed on the matter.   So authorities began investigating them for other possible acts of wrongdoing and discovered the pump-and-dump scheme and the illegal money-transfer operation.   It is not clear if any of the email addresses stolen from JPMorgan were used by the defendants to further one of their penny stock schemes.   Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement: ''As alleged, the defendants manipulated trading in U.S. securities from overseas, using fake identities to funnel millions of dollars in unlawful proceeds through a web of international shell companies. Using false and misleading spam emails sent to millions of people, these defendants allegedly directed their pump-and-dump scheme from their computers halfway around the world.''   The attack on JPMorgan garnered major headlines and attention last year because of the number of people affected and a theory that it may have been tied to Russian gangs, with possible ties to the Russian government. Federal authorities, however, quickly ruled out the Russian government as a suspect, as well as the possibility of direct ties to Russian gangs. The court filings on Tuesday, however, suggest some loose connection to Russia.   The attack on the bank was discovered somewhat by accident. In July, security employees of the bank learned that the website for the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge, a charitable race organized by the bank, had been hacked and compromised. The website is run by an outside vendor for the bank. But information gleaned from the hacking on the racing website pointed back to a bigger problem with the bank's own network.   After that, the bank discovered its own breach. While the hacking itself was not said to be sophisticated, it went on long enough to give the hackers access to 90 servers.   JPMorgan says it spends $250 million a year on online security and intends to double that amount.   Federal authorities in New York had made the JPMorgan attack a priority investigation because the bank is a critical component of the nation's financial system. The hackers had tried to infiltrate nearly a dozen other financial institutions but were less successful. By the spring, some investigators were expressing confidence in private that they expected to announce some arrests by the summer if not earlier.   Much of the JPMorgan investigation for Mr. Bharara's office was overseen by Nicole Friedlander, a chief of the online crimes division, who was working while out on maternity leave for several months, said people briefed on the matter.   It remains to be seen whether prosecutors working with the F.B.I. can get any of those arrested to provide the evidence they need to bring charges for the hacking as well.    "
Going Behind Enemy Lines to Get Ahead of Hackers,"CHANTILLY, Va. --  On a recent Wednesday morning, 100 intelligence analysts crammed into a nondescript conference room here and dialed into a group call with 100 counterparts in Argentina, Brazil, Cyprus, India, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Taiwan and Ukraine. As they worked their way around the room, the analysts briefed one another on the latest developments in the ''dark web.''    A security firm in Pakistan was doing a little moonlighting, selling its espionage tools for as little as $500. Several American utility companies were under attack. A group of criminals were up to old tricks, infecting victims with a new form of ''ransomware,'' which encrypts PCs until victims pay a ransom.   The analysts, employees of iSight Partners, a company that provides intelligence about threats to computer security in much the same way military scouts provide intelligence about enemy troops, were careful not to name names or clients, in case someone, somewhere, was listening on the open line.    Within 30 minutes, they were all back at their keyboards, monitoring underground chatter and markets, analyzing computer code meant to cause harm, watching the networks of potential attackers and poring over social media channels for signs of imminent attacks.   For the last eight years, iSight has been quietly assembling what may be the largest private team of experts in a nascent business called threat intelligence. Of the company's 311 employees, 243 are so-called cyberintelligence professionals, a statistic that executives there say would rank iSight, if it were a government-run cyberintelligence agency, among the 10 largest in the world, though that statistic is impossible to verify given the secretive nature of these operations.   ISight analysts spend their days digging around the underground web, piecing together hackers' intentions, targets and techniques to provide their clients with information like warnings of imminent attacks and the latest tools and techniques being used to break into computer networks.   The company's focus is what John P. Watters, iSight's chief executive, calls ''left of boom,'' which is military jargon for the moment before an explosive device detonates. Mr. Watters, a tall, 51-year-old Texan whose standard uniform consists of Hawaiian shirts and custom cowboy boots, frequently invokes war analogies when talking about online threats.   ''When we went into Iraq, the biggest loss of life wasn't from snipers,'' he said. It was from concealed explosive devices. ''We didn't get ahead of the threat until we started asking ourselves, 'Who's making the bombs? How are they getting their materials? How are they detonating them? And how do we get into that cycle before the bombs are ever placed there?'''   ''Our business,'' Mr. Watters continued, ''is tracking the arms merchants and bomb makers so we can be left of boom and avoid the impact altogether.''   ISight's investors, who have put $60 million into the company so far, believe that its services fill a critical gap in the battle to get ahead of threats. Most security companies, like FireEye, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks and Intel's security unit, focus on blocking or detecting intrusions as they occur or responding to attacks after the fact.   ISight goes straight to the enemy. Its analysts -- many of them fluent in Russian, Mandarin, Portuguese or 21 other languages -- infiltrate the underground, where they watch criminals putting their schemes together and selling their tools.   The analysts' reports help clients -- including 280 government agencies, as well as banks and credit-card, health care, retail and oil and gas companies -- prioritize the most imminent and possibly destructive threats.   Security experts say the need for such intelligence has never been greater. For the last three years, businesses have been investing in ''big data'' analytic tools that sound alarms anytime someone does something unusual, like gain access to a server in China, set up a private connection or siphon unusually large amounts of data from a corporate network.   The result is near constant and confusing noise. ''Except for the most mature organizations, most businesses are drowning in alerts,'' said Jason Clark, the chief security officer at Optiv, a security firm.   The average organization receives 16,937 alerts a week. Only 19 percent of them are deemed ''reliable,'' and only 4 percent are investigated, according to a study released in January by the Ponemon Institute, which tracks data breaches. By the time criminals make enough noise to merit a full investigation, it can take financial services companies more than three months, on average, to discover them, and retailers more than six months.   ''Just generating more alerts is wasting billions of dollars of venture capital,'' said David Cowan, an iSight investor and a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. The last thing an executive in charge of network security needs is more alerts, he said: ''They don't have time. They need human, actionable threat intelligence.''   Mr. Cowan and others point to what happened to Target in 2013, when the retailer ignored an alert that ultimately could have stopped criminals from stealing 40 million customers' payment details from its network.   A year earlier, iSight warned its clients that criminals were compiling and selling malware that was specifically designed to scrape payment data off cash registers. Had Target received that warning, the blip on its network might not have gone unnoticed.   ''Target faced the same problem every retailer does every day,'' Mr. Watters said. ''They are awash in a sea of critical alerts every day. Without threat intelligence, they had roulette odds of picking the right one.''   Gartner, the research firm, estimates that the market for threat intelligence like iSight's could grow to $1 billion in two years from $255 million in 2013. Gartner predicts that by 2018, 60 percent of businesses will incorporate threat intelligence into their defensive security strategy.   ISight, which plans to file for an initial public offering of stock next year, hopes to capitalize, as do the dozens of other cyberthreat intelligence outfits now flooding the market, each with a slightly different approach.   That proliferation of start-ups has led to a new complaint from computer security chiefs: overlapping information -- sometimes as much as 40 percent -- in the reports they receive, none of which is cheap. ISight charges customers based on size, and while it does not disclose pricing, some customers say they pay $500,000 or more annually for the company's services, as much as five times what low-end services charge.   ISight makes 90 percent of its revenue from subscriptions to its six intelligence streams, each focused on a particular threat, including cyberespionage and cybercrime.   The company's most recent competition comes from its oldest clients, particularly banks, which have been hiring former intelligence analysts to start internal operations. One former client, which declined to be named because of concerns that doing so could violate a nondisclosure agreement, said it had been able to build its own intelligence program at half the cost of its canceled iSight subscriptions.   But most businesses do not have the same resources as, say, a company like Bank of America, whose chief executive recently said there was no cap on the bank's cybersecurity budget.   Many of those businesses remain paralyzed by the drumbeat of alarms that expensive security technologies are sounding on their networks.   At iSight's threat center, the company's approach is perhaps best summed up by a logo emblazoned on a T-shirt worn by one of its top analysts: ''Someone should do something.''    "
Firms Pit Artificial Intelligence Against Hacking Threats,"Sometimes the best way to stop a bad machine is with a lot of good machines. Several companies are applying the techniques of artificial intelligence, or A.I., to the world of security, and they are using a whole bunch of machines strung together in so-called cloud computing networks to do it. Originally the province of university researchers and now one of the ways Google and other companies figure out what is going on across the web, A.I. technology is being employed by security companies who say they can beat criminals by using many of the same strategies. Much as Google examines websites for significant information and watches the behavior of people searching and surfing the web, A.I. security companies look for malicious sites or try to examine and predict the behavior of malware, which is software meant to cause problems.  ""We're looking at about 200,000 samples of malicious code a day, so we can guard maybe 11 million events in a microsecond,"" said Tomer Weingarten, the chief executive of a computer security company called SentinelOne. To stay on top of that volume, Mr. Weingarten said, requires the equivalent of 10,000 computers. As computing becomes more pervasive, traditional defenses are proving inadequate. For example, the firewall, which was once an effective safeguard on the perimeter between a corporate network and the world, is now problematic: It has become harder to say where systems begin and end as they become connected to more and more things. In 2013, Target was hacked when criminals entered the main servers through software for a company heating system that was managed by a contractor. More recently, ""sandboxes"" have been developed that temporarily isolate incoming programs and files to see if they try something malicious. In response, hackers have written code enabling malware to recognize that it is being quarantined - sometimes by contacting a computer's operating system directly - so it does not take any suspicious action until it detects that it has been released. Every day, SentinelOne's computers scour the many listings worldwide of known malware and attack codes, which are publicly posted by government agencies and private security organizations. Using machine learning, an A.I. technique of pattern mapping, the computers then look for similarities with known techniques and try to identify similar behaviors that precede attacks. That information is then loaded into computing ""agents"" that are inside its clients' computers. The agents observe events inside a computer almost the moment they occur. If, for instance, a so-called ransomware program starts to encrypt a user's files (to lock up the computer, which will be freed only once the owner pays a ransom), the agent will isolate the program and notify the system administrator. Often, it can also undo whatever damage was caused by reverting the few files that were affected to an earlier state. ""Sometimes it's easy to see malicious behavior - no legitimate application would just start encrypting everything,"" Mr. Weingarten said. ""Other times, they are 'spraying the heap,' looking for all the commands being queued up in the computer so they can rewrite the system and insert their code. Normal applications don't do these things."" Every piece of malware also has its own biography within the system. Mr. Weingarten recently called up a program called Troldesh, which was first observed on the evening of April 9. It created files on the infected computer, then changed the files and notified a server in Russia that it was ready. ""This starts to look suspicious,"" Mr. Weingarten said. Signals can be bounced around, so it is hard to say just where Troldesh originated. It also communicated with machines in Hungary, Austria and Germany. Troldesh was identified and stopped, but a hacker could reuse much of the code in other malware. That is why A.I. tries to learn hackers' rules and habits. Another challenge in protecting today's computer networks is how poorly understood much of the world's software is. ""There are 600 million individual files known to be good, and a malware universe of about 400 million files,"" said Lawrence Pingree, an analyst with Gartner. ""But there's also 100 million pieces of potentially unwanted adware, and 200 million software packages that just aren't known. It takes a lot of talent to figure out what's normal and what isn't."" The process, which he calls ""endpoint detection,"" looks at and acts on what goes on in individual machines. Many of the same techniques can also be used on other kinds of bad online behavior. Carlos Guestrin, a well-regarded expert in machine learning, is chief executive and co-founder of a company called Dato. In addition to traditional A.I. businesses like figuring out shopping preferences, he started looking at fraudulent behaviors. ""We caught spam with machine learning by looking at sequences of words, now we look for the code in a virus, like DNA, that makes it do unusual things,"" Mr. Guestrin said. ""With human fraud, you look for relationships about who sends money to who, or who is hiding fraudulent transactions. If a finite number of people keep sending each other money, they're probably trying to look like legitimate businesses."" G2 Web Services, based in Bellevue, Wash., helps banks figure out if a website is fraudulent or is selling contraband. Using Mr. Guestrin's product, coupled with human experience, on hundreds of millions of sites, G2 improved its ability to predict fraud and crime by 13 percent. Over millions of transactions, that amounts to quite a lot. G2 can also flag prohibited content, like child pornography, which exists on about 1.5 percent of all merchant websites. Sometimes a criminal will put a link to, say, a store for illegal growth hormones in an otherwise honest site, without the merchant's ever knowing about the link placement. Another use for A.I. is spotting ""transaction laundering,"" in which an illegal business tries to appear legitimate by processing transactions through a legal site. The company is making strides against cybercrime, since ""the guys who run these illicit sites are also into viruses and malware,"" said Alan Krumholz, principal data scientist at G2. ""It's a cat-and-mouse game. They go from one business into another."" "
Tracking the Cyberattack on Sony to North Koreans,"WASHINGTON -- The trail that led American officials to blame North Korea for the destructive cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November winds back to 2010, when the National Security Agency scrambled to break into the computer systems of a country considered one of the most impenetrable targets on earth. Spurred by growing concern about North Korea's maturing capabilities, the American spy agency drilled into the Chinese networks that connect North Korea to the outside world, picked through connections in Malaysia favored by North Korean hackers and penetrated directly into the North with the help of South Korea and other American allies, according to former United States and foreign officials, computer experts later briefed on the operations and a newly disclosed N.S.A. document. A classified security agency program expanded into an ambitious effort, officials said, to place malware that could track the internal workings of many of the computers and networks used by the North's hackers, a force that South Korea's military recently said numbers roughly 6,000 people. Most are commanded by the country's main intelligence service, called the Reconnaissance General Bureau, and Bureau 121, its secretive hacking unit, with a large outpost in China.  The evidence gathered by the ''early warning radar'' of software painstakingly hidden to monitor North Korea's activities proved critical in persuading President Obama to accuse the government of Kim Jong-un of ordering the Sony attack, according to the officials and experts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about the classified N.S.A. operation. Mr. Obama's decision to accuse North Korea of ordering the largest destructive attack against an American target -- and to promise retaliation, which has begun in the form of new economic sanctions -- was highly unusual: The United States had never explicitly charged another government with mounting a cyberattack on American targets. Mr. Obama is cautious in drawing stark conclusions from intelligence, aides say. But in this case ''he had no doubt,'' according to one senior American military official. ''Attributing where attacks come from is incredibly difficult and slow,'' said James A. Lewis, a cyberwarfare expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The speed and certainty with which the United States made its determinations about North Korea told you that something was different here -- that they had some kind of inside view.'' For about a decade, the United States has implanted ''beacons,'' which can map a computer network, along with surveillance software and occasionally even destructive malware in the computer systems of foreign adversaries. The government spends billions of dollars on the technology, which was crucial to the American and Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear program, and documents previously disclosed by Edward J. Snowden, the former security agency contractor, demonstrated how widely they have been deployed against China. But fearing the exposure of its methods in a country that remains a black hole for intelligence gathering, American officials have declined to talk publicly about the role the technology played in Washington's assessment that the North Korean government had ordered the attack on Sony. The extensive American penetration of the North Korean system also raises questions about why the United States was not able to alert Sony as the attacks took shape last fall, even though the North had warned, as early as June, that the release of the movie ''The Interview,'' a crude comedy about a C.I.A. plot to assassinate the North's leader, would be ''an act of war.'' Dinner in Pyongyang The N.S.A.'s success in getting into North Korea's systems in recent years should have allowed the agency to see the first ''spear phishing'' attacks on Sony -- the use of emails that put malicious code into a computer system if an unknowing user clicks on a link -- when the attacks began in early September, according to two American officials. But those attacks did not look unusual. Only in retrospect did investigators determine that the North had stolen the ''credentials'' of a Sony systems administrator, which allowed the hackers to roam freely inside Sony's systems. In recent weeks, investigators have concluded that the hackers spent more than two months, from mid-September to mid-November, mapping Sony's computer systems, identifying critical files and planning how to destroy computers and servers. ''They were incredibly careful, and patient,'' said one person briefed on the investigation. But he added that even with their view into the North's activities, American intelligence agencies ''couldn't really understand the severity'' of the destruction that was coming when the attacks began Nov. 24. In fact, when, Gen. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, had an impromptu dinner in early November with his North Korean counterpart during a secret mission to Pyongyang to secure the release of two imprisoned Americans, he made no mention of Sony or the North's growing hacking campaigns, officials say. In a recent speech at Fordham University in New York, Mr. Clapper acknowledged that the commander of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, Kim Yong-chol, with whom he traded barbs over the 12-course dinner, was ''later responsible for overseeing the attack against Sony.'' (General Clapper praised the food; his hosts later presented him with a bill for his share of the meal.) Asked about General Clapper's knowledge of the Sony attacks from the North when he attended the dinner, Brian P. Hale, a spokesman for the director of national intelligence, said that the director did not know he would meet his intelligence counterpart and that the purpose of his trip to North Korea ''was solely to secure the release of the two detained U.S. citizens.'' ''Because of the sensitivities surrounding the effort'' to win the Americans' release, Mr. Hale said, ''the D.N.I. was focused on the task and did not want to derail any progress by discussing other matters.'' But he said General Clapper was acutely aware of the North's growing capabilities. Jang Sae-yul, a former North Korean army programmer who defected in 2007, speaking in an interview in Seoul, said: ''They have built up formidable hacking skills. They have spent almost 30 years getting ready, learning how to do this and this alone, how to target specific countries.'' Still, the sophistication of the Sony hack was such that many experts say they are skeptical that North Korea was the culprit, or the lone culprit. They have suggested it was an insider, a disgruntled Sony ex-employee or an outside group cleverly mimicking North Korean hackers. Many remain unconvinced by the efforts of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to answer critics by disclosing some of the American evidence. Mr. Comey told the same Fordham conference that the North Koreans got ''sloppy'' in hiding their tracks, and that hackers periodically ''connected directly and we could see them.'' ''And we could see that the I.P. addresses that were being used to post and to send the emails were coming from I.P.s that were exclusively used by the North Koreans,'' he said. Some of those addresses appear to be in China, experts say. The skeptics say, however, that it would not be that difficult for hackers who wanted to appear to be North Korean to fake their whereabouts. Mr. Comey said there was other evidence he could not discuss. So did Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the N.S.A. director, who told the Fordham conference that after reviewing the classified data he had ''high confidence'' the North had ordered the action. A Growing Capability North Korea built its first computer with vacuum tubes in 1965, with engineers trained in France. For a brief time, it appeared ahead of South Korea and of China, which not only caught up but also came to build major elements of their economic success on their hardware and software. Defectors say that the Internet was first viewed by North Korea's leadership as a threat, something that could taint its citizens with outside ideas. But Kim Heung-kwang, a defector who said in an interview that he helped train many of the North's first cyberspies, recalled that in the early 1990s a group of North Korean computer experts came back from China with a ''very strange new idea'': Use the Internet to steal secrets and attack the government's enemies. ''The Chinese are already doing it,'' he quoted one of the experts as saying. Defectors report that the North Korean military was interested. So was the ruling Workers' Party, which in 1994 sent 15 North Koreans to a military academy in Beijing to learn about hacking. When they returned, they formed the core of the External Information Intelligence Office, which hacked into websites, penetrated fire walls and stole information abroad. Because the North had so few connections to the outside world, the hackers did much of their work in China and Japan. According to Mr. Kim, the military began training computer ''warriors'' in earnest in 1996 and two years later opened Bureau 121, now the primary cyberattack unit. Members were dispatched for two years of training in China and Russia. Mr. Jang said they were envied, in part because of their freedom to travel. ''They used to come back with exotic foreign clothes and expensive electronics like rice cookers and cameras,'' he said. His friends told him that Bureau 121 was divided into different groups, each targeting a specific country or region, especially the United States, South Korea and the North's one ally, China. ''They spend those two years not attacking, but just learning about their target country's Internet,'' said Mr. Jang, 46, who was a first lieutenant in a different army unit that wrote software for war game simulations. Mr. Jang said that as time went on, the North began diverting high school students with the best math skills into a handful of top universities, including a military school specializing in computer-based warfare called Mirim University, which he attended as a young army officer. Others were deployed to an ''attack base'' in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, where there are many North Korean-run hotels and restaurants. Unlike the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the cyberforces can be used to harass South Korea and the United States without risking a devastating response. ''Cyberwarfare is simply the modern chapter in North Korea's long history of asymmetrical warfare,'' said a security research report in August by Hewlett-Packard. An Attack in Seoul When the Americans first gained access to the North Korean networks and computers in 2010, their surveillance focused on the North's nuclear program and its leadership, as well as efforts to detect attacks aimed at United States military forces in South Korea, said one former American official. (The German magazine Der Spiegel published an N.S.A. document on Saturday that provides some details of South Korea's help in spying on the North.) Then a highly destructive attack in 2013 on South Korean banks and media companies suggested that North Korea was becoming a greater threat, and the focus shifted. ''The big target was the hackers,'' the official said. That attack knocked out almost 50,000 computers and servers in South Korea for several days at five banks and television broadcasters. The hackers were patient, spending nine months probing the South Korean systems. But they also made the mistake seen in the Sony hack, at one point revealing what South Korean analysts believe to have been their true I.P. addresses. Lim Jong-in, dean of the Graduate School of Information Security at Korea University, said those addresses were traced back to Shenyang, and fell within a spectrum of I.P. addresses linked to North Korean companies. The attack was studied by American intelligence agencies. But after the North issued its warnings about Sony's movie last June, American officials appear to have made no reference to the risk in their discussions with Sony executives. Even when the spear-phishing attacks began in September -- against Sony and other targets -- ''it didn't set off alarm bells,'' according to one person involved in the investigation. The result is that American officials began to focus on North Korea only after the destructive attacks began in November, when pictures of skulls and gruesome images of Sony executives appeared on the screens of company employees. (That propaganda move by the hackers may have worked to Sony's benefit: Some employees unplugged their computers immediately, saving some data from destruction.) It did not take long for American officials to conclude that the source of the attack was North Korea, officials say. ''Figuring out how to respond was a lot harder,'' one White House official said.

"SendGrid Email Breach Was Used to Attack Coinbase, a Bitcoin Exchange","SAN FRANCISCO - Hackers targeted SendGrid, a mass email service used by 180,000 companies including Uber, Pinterest, Spotify and Foursquare, to infiltrate Coinbase, one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges.  SendGrid confirmed that one of its Bitcoin-related clients was compromised on Wednesday. It would not name the customer, but Coinbase confirmed in an email on Thursday that hackers had compromised its SendGrid account, though it said no Bitcoin were stolen. In a statement, SendGrid said it believed the attack was an isolated one. However, another SendGrid customer said it had also been targeted by similar attacks through the service in recent weeks, and there is evidence that other Bitcoin companies are being targeted via their mass email providers.  Mass email services like SendGrid, which sends 14 billion emails a month, are a powerful tool for hackers looking to send spear-phishing emails on a large scale. SendGrid sends transactional emails on behalf of trusted companies like Spotify and Pinterest, alerting customers to updates in the service and new followers. Most customers don't even realize the emails are coming from SendGrid, making it more likely that they would take the bait and click on malicious code that grants hackers access to their accounts.  Late last month, ChunkHost, a fast cloud service provider that accepts Bitcoin and is used by many Bitcoin-related clients, said it was targeted by hackers through its SendGrid account. Nate Daiger, a co-owner of ChunkHost, said that a hacker had managed to persuade a SendGrid employee to change his company's account information over the phone, took over ChunkHost's account and reset passwords for two of its Bitcoin-related clients in an apparent attempt to steal Bitcoin wallets. Ultimately, Mr. Daiger said, the attack was unsuccessful because both clients used two-factor authentication, a security mechanism that requires a second password when logging into an account from an unrecognized machine. Mr. Daiger said this was the second time his company was targeted by hackers through SendGrid. When Mr. Daiger tried to warn other SendGrid customers about the potential security hole in a blog post, he said that he was asked by SendGrid to retract his post. He refused.  In an email, SendGrid denied asking Mr. Daiger to retract the blog post. In a statement, SendGrid said that it was not the only email service provider that had been targeted in an attempt to steal Bitcoin, and that the compromise at Coinbase, using its service, was an isolated incident. ""From SendGrid's perspective, this appears to be an isolated attack on one SendGrid customer, however we are aware that users of other Bitcoin related businesses have been targeted this week with phishing attacks via multiple email service providers,"" the company said in a statement. Online, users of two Bitcoin services, including Localbitcoins and Btcjam, complained they were receiving spear-phishing emails through mass email service providers. They did not name the service providers, although one Localbitcoins spear-phishing email appeared to come from Mailchimp, a SendGrid competitor that sends email newsletters on behalf of seven million customers. Mailchimp did not return repeat requests for comment, nor did Localbitcoins or Btcjam. But the motivation for attacking these companies was crystal clear.  Mr. Daiger said that although hackers were ultimately unsuccessful in stealing Bitcoin, he did not foresee them surrendering their efforts any time soon. ""The fact that you could potentially steal thousands or millions of dollars make these attacks pretty motivating!"" he said. "
Q. and A.: Adam Fisk on Evading Internet Censorship in China,"In recent months, China's Internet regulators have further restricted the already limited access that China's 648 million Internet users have to the web. Several Google services, including Gmail and Gchat, have become inaccessible. Virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, that once let users skirt online censorship have also been blocked. Tools such as GreatFire.org's ""mirrored"" websites and the Internet bandwidth-sharing service Lantern have so far allowed users to access the open Internet. These services use the encrypted hosting of information by so-called cloud service providers around the globe, including in China. Chinese Internet regulators would have to shut down such services, including those run by Amazon and Microsoft, to stop these censorship-evading tools.  Some analysts have argued that the economic cost of blocking these services is too high and that the number of users of censorship-evading tools is too low to prompt such intervention by censors. This month, however, unidentified hackers targeted GreatFire.org's service in an unprecedented distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack, flooding the service with billions of requests an hour and setting off concerns that the patience of China's Internet censors had run out.   Adam Fisk is the lead developer of Lantern, a censorship-evading tool that became available in 2013 and is largely financed by the United States State Department. The software allows users in countries where the web is not censored to share part of their Internet traffic with users in countries with censorship, such as Iran and China. The software has been installed 135,000 times so far, Mr. Fisk said, allowing unrestricted transfers of 150 terabytes of data every month. Mr. Fisk, 39, was also a developer of LimeWire, a once-popular network that relied on peer-to-peer technology for file sharing. It was shut down in 2011 after a judge ordered most of its services disabled amid accusations of facilitating music piracy. In an interview, he discussed how Lantern works and how it has reacted to the new measures by Chinese Internet regulators.  Q.   How many people use Lantern in China and the rest of the world?   A.  Over all, Lantern use is still relatively low. It's about 10,000 weekly active users in the world. In China, it's about 6,000 or 7,000 weekly active [users].  Q.    Who would use Lantern in China?   A.  We intentionally know very little about our users, but we know that people like [the Chinese artist] Ai Weiwei have used it, tweeted about it. The goal behind Lantern is to be free and easy to use, a service that works really well, so that anyone can use it. In terms of where we're at now, it's still the intellectual elite that tends to be more active on the Internet and tends to be more informed about the tools that are out there.  Q.    What measures have Chinese Internet regulators taken to strengthen the Great Firewall since you started Lantern?   A.  The biggest change has been the most recent V.P.N. blocking. To me, that blocking is fascinating in the sense that the ways V.P.N.s are blockable are obvious and trivial. So I think the reason they hadn't been blocked earlier was that the only people who can access V.P.N.s are people who have foreign credit cards.  Technically, that block was really fairly obvious. One of the reasons that Lantern exists is that things like V.P.N.s are easy to block. The V.P.N. blocking didn't affect Lantern.  Q.    But you used Gmail and Gchat before they were blocked, right?  A.  We didn't use Gchat to tunnel traffic. It was really more to kickstart the network. If you have a friend who lives in an uncensored region, you can access the Internet through that friend, or a friend of that friend. That's really the reason we used Gchat. We tunnel to it, because it's blocked.  Q.    When you tunnel traffic, you operate through cloud services or peers. Do you expect that the rise of services like Lantern and GreatFire will result in more attempts to block cloud services?  A.  This might be one I can't answer.  Q.   Let me rephrase the question. Collateral freedom tools such as Lantern operate on cloud services. These cloud services are extremely important for Chinese businesses and shutting them down would cause economic damage. Do you think those who are regulating the Great Firewall are aware of this?   A.  I definitely think they are aware of it, and it really reflects the interconnectedness of the global economy. And for me, the big danger - both for China and the Internet as a whole - is the Balkanization that we are starting to see. The question in my mind is the degree to which the Balkanization is damaging to the Chinese economy. I don't know if anyone has looked at that. But, if so, many services not being available or in danger of not being available would have a significant impact for innovation. Some of the best technology companies in the world have been affected.  Q.   Where do you see that Balkanization of the Internet heading? Do you think concerns over the economic damage will prevail and keep the Internet free?   A.  There is an overlap in interest between [Chinese] government officials and people in the industry. Hopefully, the interconnectedness of the global economy is strong enough and vital enough that we see a move away from Balkanization.  Q.    What are you currently working on?   A.  We are working on fleshing out the peer-to-peer approach. It relies on global interconnectedness, not of businesses but of people. It's using real-life social networks to build this backbone of information exchange about ways to access the open Internet.  One other big focus is speed. Also we are looking at mobile. We are releasing this Twitter app called Firetweet, which is basically a Twitter client in censored regions. So you don't really know it's Lantern running in the back end, but it just works in censored regions.  Q.    Is there a chance that censors can infiltrate your networks?    A.  We really assume that censors are going to penetrate the peer-to-peer network and are going to run as peers. So we just focus on providing access. We don't do much to prevent monitoring. Censors can actually see which websites you are accessing, but - because traffic is encrypted - they cannot see what you are doing on these websites. What we are more concerned about is censors actually blocking Lantern through infiltration. The way our algorithms work makes it very difficult to do that. They would need to penetrate the Lantern social network on a massive scale.  Q.   Do you see the collateral freedom community moving away from cloud services to peer-to-peer?    A.  I don't see that happening. We are the only ones working on that that I know of. The peer-to-peer network can perform really well, but making it perform consistently is a challenge. It comes down to the location of peers. If we have people accessing in China, we have to make sure they have access through peers in Tokyo and not in Iceland.    Q.   And in the wider community?   A.  That's a big open question. If cloud-based centralized services start getting blocked more and more, it's unclear what the next step is. "
"The Web-Connected Car Is Cool, Until Hackers Cut Your Brakes","WHEN the history of the connected car is written, this week may go down as a pivotal moment for consumers worried about security. That is because a pair of technology researchers said that they had wirelessly hacked a Jeep Cherokee through its Internet-connected system, allowing them to take control of critical components like the engine, brakes and even steering under certain conditions.    The revelation left automakers scrambling to reassure their customers that security was a top priority, and Fiat Chrysler said that a software patch it had released a week earlier was designed to plug the hole used by the same two researchers, who had alerted the company before going public.    But the breach showed just how vulnerable the new breeds of web-connected vehicles can be, and the challenges that manufacturers face in defending against the types of attacks common in other technology fields.   ''Customers are demanding new capabilities and more technology, so the risk is only going to increase for vehicles,'' said Jon Allen, a web security expert at Booz Allen Hamilton. Auto manufacturers, he said, ''know they need to get ahead of this from a security perspective.''   Such a web-enabled threat is relatively new for the industry: Complex computer software has been used for years to power cars' performance, but those computerized brains were always walled off inside the cars themselves; they were not connected to the wider world. For example, when the same researchers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, hacked into a Ford Escape in 2013, they could do so only by plugging a cord directly into the vehicle.   Now, the need for a cord is gone. About 27 million vehicles worldwide are now connected to the Internet, and that number is predicted to triple by 2022, to more than 82 million, according to IHS Automotive.   ''The reality is that this is something that needs to be on the forefront of the industry's radar,'' said Akshay Anand, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. ''It's not talked about as much as it should be.''   The issue has also gotten the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.   In February, Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, released a report that found only a handful of automakers had systems in place to even detect a hacking intrusion. Mr. Markey, together with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, has also drafted legislation to establish federal web security standards for automobiles.   A video and article posted by the technology news site Wired showed just how helpless a driver would be in a hacking attack.   As the Jeep Cherokee barreled down a St. Louis highway at 70 miles an hour, the driver, who participated in the experiment, was rendered helpless to control the air-conditioning fan, radio, windshield wipers and the car's digital display. The two hackers, sitting with a laptop in a basement 10 miles away, took control of them all, even cutting the engine at one point and bringing the Jeep to a stop as traffic whizzed by. Later, they also cut the brakes.   Mr. Valasek, in an interview, said he and Mr. Miller spent nearly two years trying to crack the puzzle. Chrysler, like many automakers, has said it designs its entertainment and wireless connectivity system to be separate from the system that controls automotive functions of the car, like the engine and brakes. But the two men have proved that a bridge from one to the other is possible.   ''Probably to them it was two separate things,'' Mr. Valasek said, referring to Chrysler's engineers. ''But people like us think differently, and we thought how it could work until we found the way.''   The pair's hacking technique is not applicable only to Jeeps, Mr. Valasek said. It could have been used on any Fiat Chrysler vehicle using its Uconnect entertainment and wireless connectivity system.   ''Five years ago, the auto industry did not consider cybersecurity as a near-term problem,'' said Egil Juliussen, senior analyst and research director with IHS Automotive. ''This view has changed.''   Fiat Chrysler said that it ''monitors and tests the information systems of all of its products to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in the ordinary course of business.'' The company said that its new software patch had closed the security hole the two men had identified.   Other automakers sought to reassure their customers as well.   General Motors said in a statement that ''our customers' safety and security is paramount, and we are taking a multifaceted approach to secure in-vehicle and connected-vehicle systems.'' The company said it was ''designing vehicle systems that can be updated with enhanced security as these potential threats arise.''   Volvo said its cars were ''designed with several layers of protection in hardware and software'' and ''enhanced with encryption and security protocols that are unique to each individual car. This process serves to prevent the remote access and disablement of critical systems.''   An Audi spokesman described security as a high priority and said the company intended to ''constantly protect our cars and customers against vulnerability risks.''   Mr. Anand, the Kelley Blue Book analyst, said the future was likely to be one where constant vigilance would be required. That could mean something akin to running antivirus software on computers -- where intrusion threats are being monitored in real time, both by consumers themselves and by automakers.   ''Automakers will need to be watching this around the clock to spot threats right away,'' he said. ''And we could see warnings for drivers as well, when suspected intrusions are detected.''   Mr. Allen, the web security expert with Booz Allen Hamilton, said automakers would most likely have to develop some kind of safe, ''disconnected'' mode that drivers could immediately revert to if a threat were flagged, so the vehicle would be cut off from the web.   He said that as new features were introduced and software updates offered, consumers should also get more control over whether they want to use them.   ''Just as now I can decide, 'Do I want to upload my credit card to my iPhone?' I should get to decide, 'Is this something I want to upload in my vehicle?' '' he said.   Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut senator supporting tighter rules for vehicles' web security, said automakers had a responsibility to safeguard their vehicles.   ''It's as basic as selling a car without door locks,'' he said. ''No automaker would think of doing that, and they shouldn't sell cars connected to the Internet without minimal protections against hackers.''    "
"Man Charged With Hacking Stumbled by Taking Scheme Offline, Experts Say","He had stolen a trove of gossip-page trophies: unpublished movie and television scripts, as well as sex tapes and nude images of celebrities, all by hacking their computers or cellphones, the authorities said. Yet in seeking to profit from his deeds, Alonzo Knowles abandoned perhaps the guiding rule of cybercrime: Hide online.    Mr. Knowles, a 23-year-old from the Bahamas, agreed to fly to New York to show off his pile of stolen scripts in person, according to a federal criminal complaint issued on Tuesday. He gave an interested buyer his name, birth date, passport number and money transfer account number to set up the trip.    Despite his clumsiness, Mr. Knowles managed to walk through gaping holes in the email accounts of actors, radio hosts and professional athletes -- illustrating how vulnerable high-profile targets can be, even after damaging episodes like the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment last year.   Digital security experts said on Wednesday that many companies have buttoned up in the wake of incidents like the Sony hacking, leaving employees as the main channels into company data.    Simply clicking on an emailed virus can expose a world of payroll information, for example, or even explicit films.   ''It boils down to the weakest link in the chain,'' said Austin Berglas, who is the head of online investigations in the United States for the K2 Intelligence firm and a former top agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York. ''That's how a lot of legitimate companies that spend millions and millions get compromised -- because their weak links are humans.''   Mr. Knowles told his interested buyer, who turned out to be an undercover agent, that ''going after a high-profile celebrity'' can be difficult. So, instead, he used what he described as his ''social engineering'' process, in which he identified celebrities' friends through photos and got into the friends' email accounts to learn about his target, according to the complaint.   Social media accounts with nothing more than a trace of a celebrity's private life can set the stage for hacking.   ''Celebrities use it to promote their brand,'' said Thomas G. A. Brown, a former chief of the computer crimes unit at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, ''but they may also inadvertently reveal information that can be used to attack them indirectly.''   None of the victims in the case involving Mr. Knowles have been identified. His trove included scripts for several episodes of a coming season of a popular television drama, the complaint alleged; representatives for HBO, Showtime and FX said they were not aware of their networks' having been involved.   In arguing on Tuesday for Mr. Knowles to be detained, Kristy J. Greenberg, a federal prosecutor, said at a hearing, ''We have the defendant's own admissions on recordings, audio and video recordings, talking about his targeting of various victims, how he would go after them and go after their friends and their loved ones, in order to gain access to their most private matters.''   Mr. Knowles's lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, had no comment on Wednesday.   For all the discretion Mr. Knowles showed in gaining access to the email accounts and downloading the scripts, which were watermarked with actors' names, his approach to selling the scripts seemed amateurish. He argued that a buyer -- he contacted a radio host before being led to the undercover agent, according to the criminal complaint -- could package the unpublished scripts and sell them as a book to fans who did not want to wait for a show to air. And when the undercover agent asked for personal information, details of his plot and a meeting in New York, he simply complied.   ''I would have asked to be paid in Bitcoins,'' Mr. Berglas said. ''There are so many more anonymous ways. The promise of riches clouds, oftentimes, these criminals' judgments.''   The case involving Mr. Knowles has not drawn nearly as much attention in entertainment circles as the embarrassing email exchanges divulged in last year's hacking of Sony, in large part because there is no evidence that the stolen goods got out before his arrest.    Jordan Arnold, the head of private client services at K2 Intelligence and a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office, cautioned that ''a thief is not an honest salesman,'' and there was always a chance Mr. Knowles had earlier found another buyer.   He recalled working on a case as a prosecutor in Manhattan involving a stolen wedding video of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. The suspects swore to undercover investigators that they would sell them the only copy of the video, he said, only for officials to find after their arrest that they had kept a duplicate.    "
Lenovo and Superfish Penetrate the Heart of a Computer's Security,"The same week researchers reported that the National Security Agency had been embedding surveillance tools in the guts of thousands of machines in Iran, Russia and other countries, it was revealed that the world's largest personal computer company had been doing something similar to its customers. The Chinese computer-making giant Lenovo was inserting spyware - its defenders would call it adware - in its PCs. This software could track customers' every online move, intercept secure web sessions and render their computers vulnerable to hackers.  The company buried its software in the lowest level of a PC's operating system, precisely where customers and antivirus products would never detect it, and had been siphoning data back to servers belonging to Superfish, an Israeli software company headquartered in Silicon Valley that markets itself as a visual search company. The discoveries are the latest in a string of revelations that indicate that as traditional security defenses have begun fully to surround the outer layers of our devices, criminals, nation-states' hackers and apparently advertisers have turned their focus inward, to the very heart of the machine, where their code is easily concealed. Before this week's discoveries, there have been only two known cases of malicious code attacking the lowest level of a machine. The first was a 1998 computer virus, called CIH, for the initials of its author, Chen Ing-Hau, then a 24-year-old college student in Taiwan. The virus was dubbed Chernobyl because it was timed to strike on April 26, 1999, the 13th anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Though it was designed to  prove that a concept would work in the real world, it quickly spread beyond Taipei's Tatung Institute of Technology to millions of computers around the world. The incident was a wake-up call to computer security experts, who for years had been developing antivirus products for the outer layers of a computer's operating system, but not the lowest levels of a machine. Security experts started to talk about there being ""a race to the bare metal"" of a machine. Their fears were realized in September 2011, after security researchers discovered Mebromi, a second virus. The virus modified the first software that runs on a machine - the basic-input-output-system, or BIOS - in such a way that any attempt to clean it from the computer would be futile because the BIOS would just continue to reinfect it. But Mebromi affected only a small set of Chinese users. What makes the latest discoveries so disconcerting is that if a government or company can plant spyware in the lowest level of a machine, it can steal your passwords, serve up any web page, steal your encryption keys and control your entire digital experience, undetected. ""If they can do that, they can do anything,"" said Peter Horne, the technology expert who first discovered the spyware in Lenovo's products. Mr. Horne, a 25-year veteran of the financial services technology industry, was the first to discover Superfish early last month in a new Lenovo Yoga 2 Notepad he bought in Sydney, Australia. Even though the PC came with McAfee antivirus software, Mr. Horne said, he installed antivirus software made by Trend Micro. Neither virus scanner picked up adware on the machine. But Mr. Horne noted that traffic from the PC was being redirected to a website called best-deals-products.com. When he dug further, he found that website's server was making calls to Superfish adware. Superfish's ""visual discovery"" adware, Mr. Horne and others now say, is far more intrusive than typical adware. It not only drops ads into a user's web browser sessions, it hijacks a secure browsing session and scoops up data as users enter it into secure websites. In the process, it makes it easy for hackers to intercept communications. Mr. Horne returned his PC and went on to test Lenovo's demonstration machines at Best Buy stores in New York and Boston and at other retailers in Sydney and Perth. He found Superfish adware on other Lenovo Yoga 2 models and the Lenovo Edge 15. Superfish's co-founder, Adi Pinhas, did not return requests for comment. In a statement issued on Thursday, Lenovo said it had included Superfish in some consumer notebooks shipped between September and December ""to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping."" Citing bad user reviews, the company said it had stopped including the adware in January, the same month Mr. Horne brought the issue to the company's attention (and never received a response). By partnering with Superfish, Mr. Horne said, ""Lenovo is either extraordinarily stupid or covering up. Either is an offense to me."" As news of the Lenovo issue began circulating on Thursday, security researchers developed online tools for users to figure out whether Superfish was installed on their machines, and Microsoft began rooting out Superfish with its Windows Defender antivirus software. ""The problem is: What can we trust?"" Mr. Horne said. ""People trust software, then learn it gets compromised. We trust hardware and firmware, until you learn it's been compromised with adware. We trust the actual box, until we learn it's been taken into a little room somewhere."" "
"In Privacy Update, Reddit Tightens Restrictions on Nude Photos","For nearly a decade, Reddit, the huge online message board, has been known for its freewheeling stance on letting its users govern themselves. That has resulted in an outpouring of user-generated content - for better or, sometimes, for worse - that attracts nearly 160 million regular users to the site.  Now, Reddit is starting to change its views, if only ever so slightly. Reddit announced a change to its privacy policy on Tuesday that prohibits posting nude photos or videos of people engaged in sex acts without their prior consent to have it posted.   The policy shift will likely upset members of a number of Reddit communities, some of which use the site to trade illicit photos taken of others without their permission. A few years ago, Michael Brutsch created a large sub-community called ""Jailbait"" dedicated entirely to posting and trading photos of underage girls. Reddit has undergone a series of changes over the last year, including the departure of its chief executive and a fresh $50 million round of venture capital. The company has re-dedicated itself to proving it can build a long-lasting, sustainable business on top of the huge amount of traffic it regularly attracts, which has caused some degree of self-scrutiny.  ""I really want to believe that as we enter the next 10 years of Reddit life, essentially the most trafficked media site on the Internet, the opportunity here to set a standard for respecting the privacy of our users,"" Alexis Ohanian, Reddit's co-founder and executive chairman, said in an interview.  Mr. Ohanian said he and his co-founder, Steve Huffman, have always taken privacy on the platform seriously, but the changes reflect catching up with the evolution of technology - including the advent of cloud-based online storage and the ubiquity of smartphones - over the ten years since the site was created. That is particularly pertinent for Reddit, which was embroiled in a scandal last Fall after hackers stole nude photos of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence and posted them to online message boards, including Reddit.  Since the episode, the company has showed signs of buttoning up. Reddit removed all forums dedicated to trading the photos in response to a flurry of  takedown requests, which, according to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, can be made by those who own the rights to the photos.  Jessica Moreno, Reddit's head of community, said that someone who wants a photo removed ""would need to contact Reddit at contact@reddit.com and alert us to the image with a link.""  Reddit also plans to create a series of moderation tutorials, an effort to help teach its users how to better govern their sub-communities to foster a more positive environment. That includes the appointment of a new head of community, who will work with volunteer Reddit users who moderate their own forums. Mr. Ohanian emphasized that the site was made up predominantly of positive sub-forums where users help and support one another, and sometimes engage in large-scale altruistic movements to support other members of the community.  But he noted that the new changes are reflective of how he and Ellen Pao, Reddit's chief executive, have began to think more deeply about the future of how Reddit will look in the years ahead.  ""For all of us in social media, we're all venturing into new territory,"" Mr. Ohanian said. ""We've never seen these platforms - like Reddit, like Twitter - ever before."" "
Data Security Is Becoming the Sparkle in Bitcoin,"Some couples opt for a traditional wedding, while others go for the Elvis impersonator in Las Vegas. But David Mondrus and Joyce Bayo may be the first to have incorporated Bitcoin. Before about 50 guests at a Walt Disney World hotel in Florida recently, the couple used a Bitcoin automated teller machine to record their written vows on the currency's so-called block chain -- an open ledger that permanently stores information.    ''A diamond is forever, a marriage is forever, but when was the last time anyone looked at their wedding vows?'' Mr. Mondrus said. ''This technology allows us to get that data and store it in a way that is retrievable and noncorruptible.''   As Bitcoin's price has declined over the last year, critics have been quick to declare the virtual currency dead. Bitcoin's true value, though, might be not in the currency itself but in the engine that makes it possible.    Underlying Bitcoin -- created as a way to make payments directly, anonymously and outside government control -- is the block chain, a decentralized database that is driven by cryptography.   Explaining how the block chain works can tangle the tongues of even those who are most enthusiastic about Bitcoin. Most resort to metaphors or diagrams. At a basic level, the block chain is a searchable ledger where all transactions are confirmed, in a matter of minutes, by a network of computers working to perform complex algorithms. Each part of the network maintains a copy of the ledger. About six times an hour, a new group of accepted transactions -- a block -- is created, added to the chain and broadcast to the other parts of the network. In this manner, all transactions are recorded and linked and thus can be traced. It is nearly impossible to modify past blocks in the chain.   By simply downloading the Bitcoin software, anyone can gain access to the block chain, search it and submit transactions to the network.   Entrepreneurs worldwide are now working to harness that technology for use beyond Bitcoin transactions. The block chain, they say, could ultimately upend not only the traditional financial system but also the way people transfer and record financial assets like stocks, contracts, property titles, patents and marriage licenses -- essentially anything that requires a trusted middleman for verification.   ''There's a race going on to extend the block chain's capabilities,'' said Adam Ludwin, a co-founder of Chain.com, a start-up that seeks to help developers build Bitcoin applications.   On web forums and at Bitcoin conferences, talk is shifting to the next generation of applications built on block-chain technology. So-called Bitcoin 2.0 projects dominated the conversation at the Satoshi Roundtable, a retreat for Bitcoin enthusiasts at a resort in the Dominican Republic in February, according to accounts from some participants. About 20 percent of Chain's roughly 5,000 users are developing nonfinancial block-chain applications, compared with less than 10 percent a year ago, Mr. Ludwin said. Banks and multinational telecommunications companies are quietly expressing interest in ways to take advantage of the block chain.   Investors are also starting to bet on the technology. Through the end of February, Bitcoin companies had raised $550 million in venture capital, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. And although much of that financing has been directed to trading platforms, exchanges and digital-wallet start-ups -- $106 million alone has gone to Coinbase, a popular provider of Bitcoin wallets -- companies working on block-chain applications are beginning to secure chunks of financing.    For instance, Blockstream -- which is looking to extend the block chain's capabilities -- announced it had raised $21 million in November. Ripple Labs, which oversees an online payment system called Ripple, has raised $9 million and is finalizing another round of financing.   Among the venture capital firms that have backed Bitcoin-related companies is Khosla Ventures, an investor in Blockstream and Chain. Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla, said the firm's investments were based on the conviction that the block chain would alter the way society thought about transactions -- financial or otherwise.   ''Anytime there's a broker -- anytime there's an expert attesting to the validity of something -- all of that could be obviated by the block chain,'' Mr. Rabois said. ''It's not a guaranteed success, but the upside is so large that as a venture investor, it's an extremely attractive investment opportunity.''   Several start-ups are developing ways to transfer traditional money using the block chain in the hopes of streamlining financial transactions. One such company, Coins.ph, based in the Philippines, has seized on the block chain's peer-to-peer technology as a way to improve the remittance business and global payments by lowering costs and speeding up transactions. The company's goal is for people to use its services without having to understand the block chain, much as people send email without thinking about the Internet.   ''The way I think of the block chain is a really modern infrastructure to move money around the globe,'' said Marwan Forzley, the chief executive of Align Commerce, another start-up seeking to make cross-border payments easier.   Although companies focused on financial applications for the block chain far outnumber those experimenting with other uses, the gap is narrowing. For example, a start-up called BlockSign verifies signed documents on the block chain. Another company, Filecoin, is aiming to build a marketplace for storing data on the block chain.   PeerNova -- which said it was planning to announce financing that would bring its total to about $20 million -- is developing a technology that will use the block chain to prove the authenticity of a document, like a patent. The company is also toying with registry applications for other records, including title deeds and financial data.   ''Our entire system of contracts is based on a trusted third party,'' said Naveed Sherwani, the chief executive of PeerNova. But with the block chain, he added, ''there is no third party anymore.''   With the rise of the block chain has come a fundamental question: Should technology replace human discretion? Some experts, even those who study cryptocurrency, are skeptical.   ''There are very good reasons why we have legal and social institutions and economic intermediaries,'' said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton who studies block-chain technology.   In his teaching, Professor Narayanan said he often used car ownership as an example. In theory, block-chain technology could eliminate the need for, among other inconveniences, title certificates and dealers to ensure the secure transfer of money and property. The idea initially sounds appealing, but if the car is broken into or stolen, he said, the block chain alone will not be able to resolve the dispute.   ''It's not just one human you're getting rid of, but the entire economic, legal and social structure that reinforces the idea of property,'' he said.   There is also still broad support for Bitcoin. Many investors and entrepreneurs maintain that Bitcoin will outgrow its early role as a speculative investment and become a viable alternative currency for international payments. Others see countries turning to Bitcoin when their own currency is unstable.   The virtual currency must also maintain some value for the network to work. Bitcoin miners, the computers that drive the block chain, win Bitcoins if they successfully solve complex cryptographic problems. If Bitcoin's value continues to drop, it could become too expensive to keep the computers running.   But there are also those wary of moving too fast. Though enthusiastic about the block chain's potential, a group of Bitcoin supporters, many of them early adopters, wants start-ups to focus first on strengthening existing Bitcoin applications, like digital wallets and trading platforms, before developing other uses for the underlying technology.   Exchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars, euros and other currencies, have been especially vulnerable. Anxiety from the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, a prominent exchange based in Japan, is still high. And a security breach in January at Bitstamp, another exchange, sent further ripples of doubt through the Bitcoin industry.   ''People are rightfully talking about the block chain,'' said Jeremy Liew, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that has invested in a number of Bitcoin start-ups, including Blockchain, a digital-wallet provider and software developer, and BTCChina, a Chinese exchange. ''The question is how do you realize the first opportunity here?''   ''You can't jump to the top of the stairs,'' he added. ''Everything is a process.''    "
"For Ransom, Bitcoin Replaces the Bag of Bills","In the old days, criminals liked their ransom payments in briefcases full of unmarked bills. These days, there's a new preferred method for hostage takers: the virtual currency Bitcoin.    In a modern day version of a mob shakedown, hackers around the world have seized files on millions of computers, taken down public websites and even, in a few cases, threatened physical harm. The victims -- who have ranged from ordinary computer users to financial firms and police departments -- are told that their only way out is through a Bitcoin payment that is sometimes more than $20,000.   One set of attackers, believed to be based in Russia and Ukraine, collected about $16.5 million in Bitcoins in a little over a month, primarily from victims in the United States, according to the security firm Sophos.   Criminals like the virtual currency because it can be held in a digital wallet that does not have to be registered with any government or financial authority -- and because it can be easily exchanged for real money. At the moment, a single Bitcoin can be sold online or on the street for around $290.    ''The criminal underground very much likes Bitcoin,'' said Curt Wilson, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Arbor Networks. ''It's enabled a greater sense of obfuscation.''   Bitcoin, which was released by an anonymous creator in 2009, has recently been gaining mainstream appeal. Start-ups in the industry have won investments from big names like Goldman Sachs and the New York Stock Exchange, which have praised the technology as a faster, more efficient way to complete financial transactions.   But the proliferation of ransom demands has provided an unhappy reminder of the virtual currency's continuing appeal to the criminal underworld, long after the authorities shut down the online drug bazaar, Silk Road, where heroin and cocaine were sold using Bitcoin.   The latest reminder of Bitcoin's underbelly came last week with the arrest of two Florida men. The authorities said victims of malware were steered to Coin.mx, a site run by the two men, to buy the Bitcoins to pay the ransom demanded by the malware. The complaint suggested that the criminals also used the site to launder their proceeds.   In a separate set of recent cases, security experts said, several financial firms have been attacked by a criminal, or circle of criminals, going by the name DD4BC, who have threatened to overwhelm the firms' public websites with message traffic unless a Bitcoin payment was made. These corporate victims are generally asked to pay about $10,000, the security experts said, and the attacks have shown no signs of abating.   ''Do not ignore me, as it will just increase the price,'' DD4BC said in one email that was made public. ''Once you pay me you are free from me for the lifetime of your site.''   Ted Weisberg, the president of the brokerage firm Seaport Securities, which was hit in June, said that he initially thought the message was a joke. But as he called competitors, he said, he quickly learned that the threat was real. Seaport's website ended up being down for a day and a half. Mr. Weisberg's firm did not pay the ransom and repelled the bombardment of traffic with the help of one of its technical providers.   The extortion attempts have been widespread enough that the brokerage industry's self-governing regulatory agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, warned its members in June to contact the F.B.I. if they received a message from DD4BC.   Ransom payments entered the digital world long before Bitcoin came on the scene. Previously, though, the methods for paying attackers could be cumbersome and risky for the extortionist. A credit card payment or bank transfer could easily be traced by the police, so the victims were usually asked to buy prepaid cards like Green Dot's MoneyPak. Partly because of their use by swindlers, these cards were recently taken off the market.   Bitcoin has made the delivery of ransom more seamless and untraceable for criminals because the virtual currency system is run by a decentralized network of computers that collects no personal information about users. Unlike the days of bulging briefcases, Bitcoin payments can be made without an in-person meeting. What's more, Bitcoin transactions are designed to be irreversible, so victims cannot reclaim their money as they could with a credit card or PayPal transaction.   Early Bitcoin users quickly realized that the currency could be useful for ransom payments. But in late 2013, the threat spread far beyond the virtual currency community when the first version of Bitcoin-fueled ransomware, known as CryptoLocker, began to spread around the globe.   The software encrypted all of the files on a computer and offered a key to unlock the files in exchange for a Bitcoin payment. Victims were directed to several websites where they could buy Bitcoins through a bank transfer.   When an alliance of international authorities took down CryptoLocker in mid-2014 and identified the mastermind as a 30-year-old Russian named Evgeniy Bogachev, the group said that the software had spread to 234,000 computers. Since then, much more virulent strains have popped up, most of them under the name CryptoWall, and spread even more widely to the computers of anyone who opened infected attachments.   The authorities have had trouble estimating the number of victims because many do not report their problem and quietly pay the price. But in late 2014, Dell SecureWorks said CryptoWall had infected over 800,000 computers. New versions of the malware, going by names like TorrentLocker and Dirty Decrypt, have popped up frequently since then.    A police department in Durham, N.H., that was hit by CryptoWall in June 2014, refused to hand over the ransom and was able to revert to backup files. But more recently, police departments in Dickson County, Tenn., and Tewksbury, Mass., have said that they chose to pay the roughly $500 ransom rather than deal with the headache of trying to circumvent the hackers.    Beyond these attacks, extortionists went after two longtime Bitcoin advocates last year, threatening to exploit personal information about the men's families if they did not pay up.   When one of the men, Hal Finney, refused to submit, the assailant called the local police and reported a murder at Mr. Finney's home, resulting in a SWAT team taking over the home, the family has said. The other victim, Roger Ver, threw off his attacker by offering a Bitcoin bounty of roughly $20,000 for his attacker's arrest.    Some leaders in the Bitcoin community have suggested potential ways to fend off the ransom threats, digitally marking any coins used for ransom payments, similar to how dollar bills used in hostage situations are marked with invisible dye.   But such solutions have been held up because of the value that many Bitcoin believers have put in the virtual currency's unfettered free movement.    "
Box Toughens Security to Draw Regulated Customers,"Box, a cloud-based data storage and collaboration company, hopes it has solved one of the last great impediments to businesses going fully online. On Tuesday, the company announced a technology that adds another layer of data encryption to its service. The idea is to put in new kinds of protection from hackers and snoops. If it works, regulated industries like finance and healthcare might move their data from locally maintained computers to Box's machines, which are accessed via the Internet to office computers and mobile devices.  ""Classified data hasn't moved to the cloud,"" said Aaron Levie, the co-founder and chief executive of Box. ""We've added another layer of security to address that.""  Box already encrypts the data it stores, as well as virus scanning, he noted, but the new security technology appeared to appease concerns at clients with particularly sensitive data.  The service, called Enterprise Key Management, or EKM, relies on a so-called public key program, a very hard kind of encryption to break. The customer puts the data into Box through software inside Amazon Web Services. When Box sends the data back out to a customer, it must ask permission from the customer, and also creates for the customer an audit trail of who accessed which files. ""This isn't really a security feature, though it adds that,"" Mr. Levie said. ""This adds a level of data control."" Legal departments in several regulated businesses had looked at the feature, he said, and concluded it could enable them to move data online. Public keys have been known about and used for decades. What made the Box technology difficult is that it appears not to severely affect latency, or the speed with which data can be retrieved.  It is not clear how many customers Box may pick up with the new feature, though data breaches like the recent loos of 80 million patient records from Anthem hardly argues for the superiority of legacy systems. Box currently has more than 44,000 paying businesses. Other cloud providers are likely to respond to the stronger and audit-oriented security tech, however.  Dropbox for Business, which asserts it has 100,000 businesses, also encrypts its data, both in transit and while stored with the company, as well as providing services like identity management. It does not address encryption from the client side yet, though it does recommend third-party providers to provide added security. "
Uber Hires Two Engineers Who Showed Car Hackings,"Uber is continuing its hiring spree of top technical talent by recruiting two respected computer security engineers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek. Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek will work in Uber's offices in Pittsburgh, where the company has based its self-driving car and robotics research. In a statement, Uber said the two men would work closely with Joe Sullivan, Uber's chief security officer, and John Flynn, the chief information security officer, to ''continue building out a world-class safety and security program at Uber.''    The hirings, which were earlier reported by Reuters, are the latest talent grab by the ride-hailing start-up, which is valued at more than $50 billion by investors and has raised more than $6 billion in private capital. This year, Uber hired Mr. Sullivan, a respected information security engineer, away from Facebook. And over the last year, the company has also systematically plucked talent from different divisions of Google, such as its mapping and geo units, poaching more than 100 engineers.    Uber, which is based in San Francisco, has made security a top focus this year after a breach of its computer systems in February. The breach  potentially exposed the names and driver's license identification numbers of as many as 50,000 of the company's drivers.   The potential for breaches is escalating as cars transform into Internet-connected computers. A report from Verizon last November found that 14 car manufacturers accounted for 80 percent of the worldwide auto market, and each one has a connected-car strategy. Security experts say one remote hacking of an Uber vehicle could spell disaster for the ride-hailing company.   Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek have made car hacking a focus. In August, the two demonstrated at the Black Hat and Def Con hacking conferences a way to control hundreds of thousands of vehicles remotely. Over the Internet, they were able to track down cars by their location, see how fast they were traveling and manipulate their blinkers, lights, windshield wipers, radios and navigation and, in some cases, control their brakes and steering.   Mr. Miller, a former ''global network exploitation specialist'' for the National Security Agency, most recently worked at Twitter. He was hired there after making a name for himself by exploiting Apple- and Android-powered devices.   Two years ago, he and Mr. Valasek turned their attention to cars, because cars were a more tangible target, they said, and because of the increasing momentum behind Internet-connected vehicles.   ''I've been in security for more than 10 years, and I've worked on computers and phones. This time, I wanted to do something that my grandmother would understand. If I tell her, 'I can hack into your car,' she understands what that means,'' Mr. Miller said in an interview last month.   ''Also, I drive cars,'' Mr. Miller added. ''I would like them to be safe.''   In 2013, they described how they were able to take control of a Ford and a Toyota by plugging in a diagnostic port that could manipulate the speed and steering of the vehicles. Car manufacturers were not so concerned, given that someone would need physical access to the car to take control, and that just as much harm could be inflicted with a knife to the tires.   So the two instead focused on gaining remote access to cars, and discovered a vulnerability in a hardware chip that connected Fiat Chrysler cars to the Internet. From there, they discovered a way to crawl into another hardware chip that controlled the vehicles' electronics, as well as its locks, windshield wipers, speedometer, lights and blinkers. Depending on how fast the driver was going, they could even engage and disengage the brakes and steering.   Last month, Fiat Chrysler issued a recall of 1.4 million vehicles after Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek revealed the vulnerability.   Uber's Advanced Technology Center, the name of its center in Pittsburgh, works on mapping, vehicle safety and autonomy, according to Uber's website. The group works on developing safe critical software and hardware systems, analyzes system defects and identifies security problems. The company has said its autonomous car research is in its very early stages, and has said it considers the initiative a long-term bet.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Smart City Technology May Be Vulnerable to Hackers,"So-called smart cities, with wireless sensors controlling everything from traffic lights to water management, may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, according to a computer security expert. Last year, Cesar Cerrudo, an Argentine security researcher and chief technology officer at IOActive Labs, demonstrated how 200,000 traffic control sensors installed in major hubs like Washington; New York; New Jersey; San Francisco; Seattle; Lyon, France; and Melbourne, Australia, were vulnerable to attack. Mr. Cerrudo showed how information coming from these sensors could be intercepted from 1,500 feet away - or even by drone - because one company had failed to encrypt its traffic. Just last Saturday, Mr. Cerrudo tested the same traffic sensors in San Francisco and found that, one year later, they were still not encrypted.  Mr. Cerrudo said he was increasingly uncovering similar problems in other products and systems incorporated into smart cities. He has discovered simple software bugs, poorly installed encryption or even no encryption at all in these systems. And he has found that many are wide open to a fairly common attack, known as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, in which hackers overwhelm a network with requests until it collapses under the load. Mr. Cerrudo has found ways to make red or green traffic lights stay red or green, tweak electronic speed limit signs, or mess with ramp meters to send cars onto the freeway all at once. Security researchers say that the opportunities for a maliciously minded hacker or government abound. Last year, security researchers at the Black Hat Europe conference in Amsterdam demonstrated how to black out parts of cites simply by manipulating smart meters and exploiting encryption problems in power line communication technology. Increasingly, cities are automating systems and services. Saudi Arabia, for example, is investing $70 million to build four new smart cities. In South Africa, a $7.4 billion smart city project is already underway. By 2020, the market for smart cities is predicted to reach $1 trillion, according to Frost & Sullivan, a consulting firm. ""The current attack surface for cities is huge and wide open to attack,"" Mr. Cerrudo writes in a report he plans to present this week in San Francisco at the annual RSA Conference on security. ""This is a real and immediate danger."" The threat is not just hypothetical. Last year, security companies discovered a hacking group, known both as Dragonfly and Energetic Bear, that was actively targeting power networks across the United States and Europe. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in a report that ""a sophisticated threat actor"" had broken into the control system network at a public utility, simply by guessing a password on an Internet-connected system. And in 2012, Chinese military hackers successfully breached the Canadian arm of Telvent. The company, now owned by Schneider Electric, produces software that allows oil and gas pipeline companies and power grid operators to gain access to valves, switches and security systems remotely. It also keeps detailed blueprints on more than half the oil and gas pipelines in North America. In 2013, the energy industry became the most-targeted sector for hackers in the United States, accounting for 56 percent of the 257 attacks reported to the Department of Homeland Security that year. Some scientists are trying to redesign the smart grid to make it less vulnerable. Currently, the smart grid is centralized, controlled by the energy suppliers, which makes utility companies a juicy target for hackers. But this year, Science Daily reported that Benjamin Schäfer, a physicist from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization; his colleagues Marc Timme and Dirk Witthaut; and a master's student, Moritz Matthiae, developed a model that showed, in theory, that smart meters could be monitored directly at customer sites, and decentralized in such a way that would make them much less vulnerable to attack. For now, their research only works in principle. So Mr. Cerrudo said municipal leaders had to start thinking of their cities as vast attack surfaces that require security protection just as a corporate network might. He encourages municipalities to adopt basic security measures like encryption, passwords and other authentication schemes and an easy mechanism for patching security holes. He suggests that cities create their own computer emergency response teams, or CERTs, to address security incidents, coordinate responses and share threat information with other cities. He also suggests that cities restrict access to their data; track and monitor those who do have access; and run so-called penetration tests, in which hackers try to break into cities so that municipalities can learn where they are most exposed. Finally, he suggests that cities prepare for the worst, as they would for a natural disaster. ""When we see that the data that feeds smart city systems is blindly trusted and can be easily manipulated - that the systems can be easily hacked and there are security problems everywhere - that is when smart cities become dumb cities,"" Mr. Cerrudo said.

"Encryption, Always Important, Is Now Easy","SAN FRANCISCO -- Twenty years after Netscape introduced encryption to web browsers to safeguard the private data of Internet users, roughly two-thirds of web traffic still moves on unprotected channels, according to research by Sandvine, a network equipment provider. Whether you visit Amazon's product pages, stream a movie from Netflix or read the tax rules on the Internal Revenue Service's website, marketers and hackers can snoop on everything you do.     But now, the computer industry and the United States government have embarked on a major, multifront campaign to have basic web encryption -- known as HTTPS or TLS encryption -- more widely adopted.   A nonprofit group backed by several leading technology companies and advocacy groups, including Mozilla, Cisco Systems and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is offering a free set of services called Let's Encrypt to help website administrators incorporate HTTPS security into their sites.   Tech giants like Google and Apple are also flexing their power to encourage websites and mobile app makers to adopt basic encryption or be penalized in web searches and the Apple App Store.   And the Obama administration -- embarrassed by Edward J. Snowden's revelations of mass surveillance by the National Security Agency and the theft of federal personnel records by foreign hackers -- has ordered all publicly accessible websites run by the executive branch to use HTTPS encryption by the end of 2016.   HTTPS encryption essentially creates a private connection between a user's browser and the website being visited so that the information being exchanged cannot be viewed or modified by an outsider. Typically signified by a lock symbol in the address bar, it is routine on sites intended for the exchange of confidential financial data, such as bank or store checkout pages. Big sites like those owned by Facebook, Yahoo and Google have also adopted such basic encryption in recent years.   But millions of websites are unprotected, especially older sites and those whose pages pull in  content from third parties, such as news sites that show advertising coming from many sources.   Without encryption, digital trackers can -- and do -- scoop up detailed information about people's browsing habits on those sites. Some of the snooping is done by marketers looking to build profiles of web users and some by Internet service providers that want to insert extra ads on web pages visited by their users.   An unencrypted connection also opens the possibility of a hacker's impersonation of a trusted website for more nefarious reasons, such as to steal personal information.   ''When the page you visit is not secure anywhere along the network path, anyone, whether it's the N.S.A. or another government or the I.S.P., can sniff on your traffic and see what you're browsing,'' said Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet policy group involved in several projects to promote encryption.   Configuring a new site for HTTPS encryption can be complicated and costly, especially for a small company without a dedicated tech services team.   Let's Encrypt, the new offering from the Internet Security Research Group, is intended to take some of the inconvenience out of the process by offering a complete package of free security services that a website operator can install on the server to easily set up or convert a site to include encryption.   ''We want every site on the web to be able to provide HTTPS,'' said Mr. Hoffman-Andrews, who has been working on the project. ''We think that's a value.''   The centerpiece of Let's Encrypt is the site certificate, a sort of digital ID card that tells a web browser like Firefox or Safari that, say, the Chase.com you are visiting after typing the address into your address bar is really the bank and not an impostor. These certificates are sold by hundreds of providers around the world, some more reputable than others, but going through the process of getting a certificate and properly integrating it into your website can be more trouble than many sites want to go through.   The Let's Encrypt team decided to simplify the setup, including getting approval to issue its own certificates. The project began offering its first certificates in September and plans wide-scale issuance in November.   Josh Aas, executive director of the Internet Security Research Group and a engineer on leave from the Mozilla Corporation, said that one goal was to remove the excuse that encryption is too hard to put in place.   In the early days of HTTPS encryption, the technology and certificates were expensive to set up and slowed down page loading times significantly. Most websites, especially those that did not handle particularly sensitive information such as financial data, chose not to incorporate it.   But now the installation process is simpler and the consequences of ignoring encryption are greater.   So it's not enough to just encrypt traditionally sensitive pages like online shopping carts. ''We need to treat all users' data as if they really care about it,'' Mr. Aas said.   Google, whose search engine serves as the guide to the Internet for so many people, is trying to encourage change through its powerful positions in web search and online advertising.   Starting last year, Google began raising the ranking of encrypted pages in web search results and lowering the ranking of unencrypted pages -- a subtle nudge to website owners to adopt HTTPS.   The company has also changed its advertising systems to encourage advertisers to serve their ads on encrypted channels.   While a web user can check for the lock icon to see if a site is secure, apps have no such obvious signaling system. Apple is supporting more security across the board. In the latest version of its operating system for iPhones and iPads, Apple is pushing application developers to use HTTPS to protect communications between apps and the web.   Apple is not yet penalizing apps that fail to use encryption, but developers expect the company to do so eventually.   The federal government is also waking up to the importance of encryption.   The White House's order in June that all websites run by the executive branch adopt HTTPS encryption covers about 1,300 web domains, including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Weather Service.   ''The federal government should require strong security for all of its properties,'' said Eric Mill, a technologist at 18F, the federal team that helped draft the policy.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
How My Mom Got Hacked,"The author of the essay collection ''You Must Go and Win'' and the novel ''Note to Self.'' MY mother received the ransom note on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. It popped up on her computer screen soon after she'd discovered that all of her files had been locked. ''Your files are encrypted,'' it announced. ''To get the key to decrypt files you have to pay 500 USD.'' If my mother failed to pay within a week, the price would go up to $1,000. After that, her decryption key would be destroyed and any chance of accessing the 5,726 files on her PC -- all of her data -- would be lost forever. Sincerely, CryptoWall.     CryptoWall 2.0 is the latest immunoresistant strain of a larger body of viruses known as ransomware. The virus is thought to infiltrate your computer when you click on a legitimate-looking attachment or through existing malware lurking on your hard drive, and once unleashed it instantly encrypts all your files, barring access to a single photo or tax receipt.     Everyone has the same questions when they first hear about CryptoWall:    Is there any other way to get rid of it besides paying the ransom? No -- it appears to be technologically impossible for anyone to decrypt your files once CryptoWall 2.0 has locked them. (My mother had several I.T. professionals try.)    But should you really be handing money over to a bunch of criminals? According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center, this answer is also no. ''Ransomware messages are an attempt to extort money,'' one public service announcement helpfully explains. ''If you have received a ransomware message do not follow payment instructions and file a complaint.'' Right. But that won't get you your files back. Which is why the Sheriff's Office of Dickson County, Tenn., recently paid a CryptoWall ransom to unlock 72,000 autopsy reports, witness statements, crime scene photographs and other documents.    Finally, can law enforcement at least do something to stop these attacks in the future? Probably not. Many ransomware viruses originate in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries. The main difficulty in stopping cybercriminals isn't finding them, but getting foreign governments to cooperate and extradite them.    By the time my mom called to ask for my help, it was already Day 6 and the clock was ticking. (Literally -- the virus comes with a countdown clock, ratcheting up the pressure to pay.) My father had already spent all week trying to convince her that losing six months of files wasn't the end of the world (she had last backed up her computer in May). It was pointless to argue with her. She had thought through all of her options; she wanted to pay.    Only, paying turned out not to be so easy; the CryptoWall hackers take only Bitcoins.   Picture the kind of early-adopting, hoodie-wearing member of the technocracy totally comfy with the idea of a cybercurrency neither backed nor issued by any central bank or government. Now picture the opposite of that. That is my mom. Having never so much as purchased an app in her life, my mom had no idea how to buy Bitcoins. Happily, her ransomers had anticipated this problem and included a link to a step-by-step guide, complete with pictures.    She'd managed to make a cash deposit via Bank of America to the unique Bitcoin ''wallet'' provided by her ransomers, but since Bitcoin's price is extremely volatile, her payment had already fallen $25 short by the time it arrived. (Credit and debit payments can take up to six days to process.) The fastest way to send the extra $25 was to make a direct deposit at an A.T.M. that handled Bitcoin transactions. That's where I came in. Coin Cafe, the Bitcoin provider my mother had chosen, had an A.T.M. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, not too far from where I lived.    The Bitcoin A.T.M. was not easy to find. It was housed in the second floor hallway of a cooperative work space, tucked inside an old Nynex phone booth. On one hand, I appreciated the winking irony of this sight gag. On the other hand, Fidelity Investments this was not.    Inside was a little white box with no buttons, just a screen, a camera eye and a money slot. I scanned in the QR code my mom had sent me. The machine whirred to life. ''Balance query in progress,'' it announced. This query remained in progress for the next 20 minutes during which I left three messages on Coin Cafe's voice mail before abandoning the booth to get some coffee and walk around in the rain.    The fourth time I called, a human being answered the phone and told me the problem had been fixed. I hurried back to the A.T.M., scanned in my QR code, sent some Voldemorts $25 in crisp bills and called my mom. The whole experience had not done much to allay my misgivings about Bitcoin; what did allay them was Mike Hoats, the nice bearded man Coin Cafe sent over to fix the A.T.M.    We got to talking after I made my payment, and he told me that, while no one at Coin Cafe believed people should fund criminal activity by paying the ransom, their job was to broker the purchase and sale of Bitcoins, which, like cash, could be used for any purpose. CryptoWall had thrust them into the unwitting roll of ransomware advisers, coping with grandmothers crying on the phone at the thought of losing all their photos or small-business owners whose family income was on the line. Coin Cafe didn't like profiting from the victims (according to the company, these transactions are in the low single digits as a percentage of its total business), but they were downright mortified to learn that CryptoWall had anointed them as one of their Bitcoin providers of choice, with praise for their ''fast, simple service.'' That's how my mom found out about Coin Cafe -- from her ransom note.   This referral is only one of the handy services CryptoWall provides to ensure a more seamless customer experience. Others include the ability to ''decrypt one file for free'' and a message interface one can use ''in case of any problems with payment or having any other questions.'' What next, I wondered. Twenty percent off when you refer this malware to a friend? Frequent virus cards? Black Friday ransom specials?   ''I THINK they like the idea they don't have to pretend they're not criminals,'' Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos, told me when I reached him in Vancouver by phone. ''By using the fact that they're criminals to scare you, it's just a lot easier on them.'' They don't have to hire a professional translator to get their English perfect, Mr. Wisniewski explained, or engage in any of the baroque subterfuge required of someone pretending to be a Nigerian gentleman farmer who just needs a little help claiming his inheritance.    In addition to being criminals, these peddlers of ransomware are clearly businesspeople, skillfully appropriating all the tools of e-commerce. From branding (CryptoWall is a variant of a fearsome earlier virus called CryptoLocker, which was shut down last year) to determining what they can extort (ransomware hackers have tested the market with prices as low as $100 and as high as $800,000, which the city of Detroit refused to pay in order to have its database decrypted), these operators are, as Mr. Wisniewski put it, part of ''a very mature, well-oiled capitalist machine.'' It's also an incredibly lucrative machine: Some experts estimate that CryptoLocker hackers cleared around $30 million in 100 days in 2013. And more than a million PCs worldwide have been hit with the CryptoWall virus.    Even after reading through numerous descriptions of CryptoWall 2.0 as ''the largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internet'' and ''an enormous danger for computer users,'' I still couldn't help thinking this was mainly a problem for moms who persist in using big, boxy PC computers and small-town police departments. Mr. Wisniewski quickly disabused me of that notion. Although CryptoWall has primarily affected Windows computers and Android cellphones so far, there is no technological barrier that prevents the virus from infiltrating Macs like mine. And when it does, Mr. Wisniewski chuckled, I should expect the ransom to be a lot higher.   So what can we all do to protect ourselves? Keep our computers backed up on an independent drive or by using a cloud backup service like Carbonite, take those software update and ''patch'' alerts seriously and, most of all, Beware the Attachment. (Remember: Brand-name businesses like J. Crew or Bank of America will rarely send you an attachment.)   Of course, this advice arrives too late for my mom. And it appeared her payment had arrived too late as well: By the time I got home from Greenpoint, her CryptoWall ransom had been raised to $1,000, and the $500 in Bitcoins she had deposited had vanished. In a panic, she wrote to Mike Hoats asking for advice. What he told her sounded crazy to me. Use the CryptoWall message interface to tell the criminals exactly what happened. Be honest, in other words.   So she did. She explained that the virus had struck the same week that a major snowstorm hit Massachusetts and the Thanksgiving holiday shut down the banks. She told them about the unexpected Bitcoin shortfall and about dispatching her daughter to the Coin Cafe A.T.M. at the 11th hour. She swore she had really, really tried not to miss their deadline. And then a weird thing happened: Her decryption key arrived.   When I shared the news with Mr. Hoats, he was jubilant. ''That is great news, truly!'' he wrote. ''Whoever these yahoos are, they have some little shred of humanity.''   But Mr. Wisniewski had a more pragmatic take. ''From what we can tell, they almost always honor what they say because they want word to get around that they're trustworthy criminals who'll give you your files back.''    Welcome to the new ransomware economy, where hackers have a reputation to consider.    "
Bitcoin Exchange Bitstamp Resumes Services,"Bitstamp, the prominent Bitcoin exchange that suspended its services this week after a security breach, has resumed operations, capping a period of uncertainty in the virtual currency industry.  ""We are happy to announce that we are back open for business with a newly redeployed website and back-end systems that are safer and more secure than ever,"" Nejc Kodric, the chief executive of Bitstamp, wrote in a blog post on the exchange's website on Friday afternoon.   Bitstamp, one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges, went dark after some of its virtual wallets were compromised on Sunday, resulting in a loss of roughly 19,000 Bitcoins worth about $5 million. In a message on Tuesday announcing its decision to close, the exchange emphasized that the lost Bitcoins represented only a ""small fraction"" of its total Bitcoin reserves, most of which are held in secure offline storage systems out of the reach of hackers. The exchange, based in London, also urged customers not to deposit Bitcoins to previously issued Bitcoin deposit addresses. The blog post on Friday did not provide more specific details on the breach. Though much smaller in scale, the breach at Bitstamp - and the subsequent service suspension - immediately drew comparisons to Mt. Gox, which collapsed last February after saying it lost 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins and more than 100,000 of its own coins, worth about $500 million at the time. Mt. Gox eventually filed for bankruptcy protection, alarming the virtual currency industry and calling into question the security of the Bitcoin system. Bitstamp is the third-biggest Bitcoin exchange, accounting for 5 percent of Bitcoin transactions, according to Bitcoin Charts, which provides data related to the Bitcoin network. Bitcoins were trading around $290 on Friday, according to CoinDesk, about where they had been trading all week. In his blog post on Friday, Mr. Kodric outlined the events that led to the suspension of Bitstamp's services and reaffirmed the exchange's commitment to its customers.  ""We can assure customers that any Bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on Jan. 5 at 9 a.m. U.T.C. are completely safe and will be fully honored,"" Mr. Kodric wrote. ""Our team has been working day and night to rebuild and restore security to the Bitstamp site so customers can resume transacting with us quickly, safely and confidently."" He also wrote that the exchange had managed to preserve evidence ""for a full forensic investigation of the crime."" Bitstamp said it had adopted new security measures and protocols, including BitGo multisignature technology, which provides more protection against theft, to prevent future breaches. The exchange said its systems were also running on ""100 percent new hardware deployed from a completely secure backup of our code and data.""  ""While this is a time of challenge for our company, we expect to emerge from this experience having set an even higher bar than before for trust and confidence in our services,"" Mr. Kodric wrote. The news that Bitstamp was back online prompted relief among some virtual currency supporters, who continue to fight the negative perception of Bitcoin. ""I see this as a win for Bitcoin,"" one Reddit user wrote. "
Trial Over a Man's Role in a Black Market Begins,"The trial of Ross W. Ulbricht, safe to say, will be like few that have ever taken place in Federal District Court. Mr. Ulbricht, 30, has been accused of running a worldwide online black-market bazaar under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, the name of a character from the book and movie ''The Princess Bride.'' The underground site was called Silk Road, where several thousand vendors sold drugs and other illicit goods anonymously and out of the reach of law enforcement, the government said. ''This is a case about a dark and secret part of the Internet that was home to an enormous marketplace for the sale of illegal drugs,'' Timothy T. Howard, a federal prosecutor, told the jury in Manhattan on Tuesday, in an opening statement.  The case is rich in high-tech intrigue and complexity, but amid its novel technological aspects -- Mr. Ulbricht faces charges that include narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering conspiracies -- is another set of more traditional allegations: He is accused of soliciting the murders of six people he believed were threats to his online business. Mr. Ulbricht ''was willing to use threats and violence to protect his turf,'' Mr. Howard told the jury, adding that the defendant's territory was not a city block or even a neighborhood but rather ''the entire world.'' Prosecutors have said their investigation found no evidence that any killings were carried out, or that anyone was harmed. Mr. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to the charges, some of them carrying a potential life sentence, and his lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, has denied that Mr. Ulbricht was the mysterious Dread Pirate Roberts, or that he sought to orchestrate any murders. Mr. Dratel did acknowledge in his opening statement that Silk Road was his client's idea -- ''a kind of experiment,'' Mr. Dratel said. ''He created it as a completely freewheeling, free-market site that could sell anything except a couple of items that were harmful,'' Mr. Dratel said. But after several months, the work became too stressful because of the site's popularity, and Mr. Ulbricht handed it off to others, Mr. Dratel said. Mr. Dratel said that Mr. Ulbricht was later ''lured back'' by those operators, who had learned they were under investigation, and became a ''perfect fall guy.'' Mr. Dratel suggested that someone else was Dread Pirate Roberts and had been the real puppet master behind the illegal operation and his client's arrest. Mr. Howard told the jury how the eBay-like enterprise was run on the so-called Tor network, a hidden part of the Internet where online activity can be kept anonymous. Transactions were conducted in Bitcoins, a form of electronic currency that is as anonymous as cash. ''His idea was to make illegal drug deals as quick and easy as ordinary online shopping,'' Mr. Howard said. He said Mr. Ulbricht took commissions on each sale, amounting to about $18 million in Bitcoins. Mr. Howard said the jury would also hear from an undercover agent who had infiltrated Silk Road and became ''a trusted member'' of its support staff. Supporters of Mr. Ulbricht, who is being held without bail, describe him as a principled idealist with libertarian leanings. In an interview recorded in 2012 through StoryCorps, the national oral history project, which appeared on YouTube, Mr. Ulbricht said he wanted to make ''a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity.'' Mr. Dratel and his co-counsel had sought unsuccessfully to preclude the government from introducing the murder-for-hire allegations, which were listed in the indictment as overt acts supporting the charge that Mr. Ulbricht ran a narcotics conspiracy. (Mr. Ulbricht was separately indicted in Baltimore on a murder-for-hire charge, a count that remains pending and is not part of the Manhattan indictment.) The government says Mr. Ulbricht solicited the murders ''to retaliate against a former staff member who he believed had stolen Bitcoins from the site and who he feared would provide information about the site to law enforcement, and to eliminate the threats posed by others who were threatening to publicly leak the names and addresses of Silk Road users and vendors.'' Prosecutors say that in 2013, for example, Mr. Ulbricht, as Dread Pirate Roberts, paid a user of the site, known as Redandwhite, to kill a Silk Road vendor who called himself FriendlyChemist and who had threatened to make public real names and addresses of Silk Road vendors and customers unless he received $500,000. ''What do u ... think will happen if thousands of usernames, ordr amounts, addresses get leaked?'' FriendlyChemist had written, adding that the vendors would be arrested and customers would leave the site, the government said. Mr. Ulbricht wrote to Redandwhite, called FriendlyChemist a liability and said, ''I wouldn't mind if he was executed,'' according to a government court filing. Ultimately, the filing says, Mr. Ulbricht paid Redandwhite $150,000 in Bitcoins and provided a name and location in White Rock, British Columbia, for FriendlyChemist, and Redandwhite later informed Mr. Ulbricht that ''the murder had been carried out.'' The criminal complaint noted that the Canadian authorities had no record of a homicide occurring near White Rock around that time. Mr. Ulbricht's mother, Lyn, in a recent appearance in New York with the filmmaker Alex Winter, who is making a documentary about the Ulbricht case and Silk Road, said her son was ''being smeared as some kind of thug all over the world, based on no evidence whatsoever.'' The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan has also said that the murder-for-hire evidence would help prove Mr. Ulbricht was Dread Pirate Roberts, because private messages from Dread Pirate Roberts that solicited the murders matched evidence recovered from Mr. Ulbricht's laptop. ''This evidence, therefore, connects Ulbricht in the real world with Dread Pirate Roberts in cyberspace,'' the office wrote to the judge, Katherine B. Forrest. Several times during the government's opening, as the prosecutor described Mr. Ulbricht's role in Silk Road, the defendant could be seen shaking his head. "
"The World Wide Web, the New Frontier in Fraud","Peter J. Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, is a co-author of ''Securities Crimes (2d edition).'' Twitter: @peterjhenning Welcome to the latest frontier in white-collar crime, where just finding the criminals is often the greatest challenge. Charges filed last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan in two seemingly unrelated cases give a small peek into the dark world of online crime, in which client information is swapped and the proceeds are sent over networks using new digital currency. As The New York Times reported, what may tie the cases together is a suspected link to the hacking of JPMorgan Chase's network in 2014. In that incident, contact information for 83 million customer and small-business accounts was obtained, although the bank says that no financial information such as account numbers was taken.    The security breach appears to have some connection to hackers operating in Russia. That makes it more challenging to find the perpetrators because of that nation's continuing political tensions with the United States. Who was behind the breach, and how the information might have been used, remains shrouded in mystery at this point.    The charges filed last week in the two cases make no mention of hacking into JPMorgan's network, and it is unclear whether any of the bank's client contact information was used or sold. But there are hints at how defendants in one case might have used the information from the breach.   The Justice Department charged three men with securities fraud, identity theft and money-laundering conspiracy related to manipulation of penny stocks in 2011 and 2012, in what are known as pump-and-dump schemes. Two of the defendants, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, are Israeli citizens. They were arrested there last week and are being held. The third defendant, Joshua Samuel Aaron, is an American citizen living in Israel who is thought to have been in Russia recently, but he has not yet been arrested.   The indictment is a bare-bones set of allegations that gives few details about how the shares were manipulated. A statement by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, asserts that the defendants funneled ''millions of dollars in unlawful proceeds through a web of international shell companies.'' But the indictment itself has nothing about how much money they made from the scheme or the amount of losses that investors suffered. The money-laundering conspiracy references transactions totaling about $1 million, but little else about any connection to the penny-stock fraud.   The government's filing is clearly a placeholder intended to allow the Justice Department to request the arrest of the three defendants by Israeli authorities and begin the extradition process. We can expect more details as the government supplies evidence to have Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein sent to the United States, but those proceedings can be slow if the defendants fight extradition.   It may seem far-fetched that the JPMorgan breach figures into a penny-stock fraud. But a pump-and-dump scheme is built on the axiom attributed to P.T. Barnum that ''there's a sucker born every minute.'' To make such a fraud work requires finding enough gullible investors to buy shares in thinly traded companies so that those who control the shares can sell their positions.   The indictment accuses the three defendants of sending out spam email that promoted the shares of various companies to generate buying interest. Because penny stocks are not followed by the major brokerage firms, it is easy to drive up the price through sham trading and false rumors and make the so-called suckers think that the price is escalating because of corporate developments. A price rise of just 50 cents from the pump can generate enormous profits when millions of shares are quickly dumped.   The lifeblood of this type of fraud is a fresh supply of potential customers, so gaining access to the JPMorgan customer contact information could be quite valuable. Prosecutors have not yet shown such a link between the security breach and the defendants. But it is a tantalizing possibility that customer information was used for something as prosaic as an old-fashioned penny-stock fraud.   The links between the pump-and-dump scheme and the JPMorgan attack grow with the second case filed last week in Manhattan against Anthony R. Murgio and Yuri Lebedev. That complaint accuses them of operating an illegal money-transfer firm called Coin.mx that converted Bitcoin, the digital currency, into cash for criminals. The Times described on Sunday how Bitcoin had become ''a new preferred method for hostage takers'' who seize computers and websites and then demand ransom payments in the form of the digital currency.   A memorandum from the Federal Bureau of Investigation written last year identified Mr. Murgio as having some link to the JPMorgan breach, although the details remain sketchy. In an interesting twist, Mr. Murgio and Mr. Levedev attended Florida State University with Mr. Aaron, the missing defendant in the penny-stock case who was last thought to be in Russia.   The penny-stock defendants are accused of using accounts for Cyprus-based shell companies to launder the profits from the stock sales. The complaint against the Bitcoin exchange defendants describes using accounts in Cyprus, Hong Kong and Eastern Europe for their transactions. Mr. Murgio is also accused of taking control of a credit union in New Jersey to process transactions, showing the vulnerability of domestic financial institutions to misuse.   This all may be just a grand coincidence, but it shows the web of connections in the world of online crime and the challenges that investigators face when they try to build cases. Digital currency can disappear in the blink of an eye and bounce through numerous accounts in places where there is little transparency. Penny-stock frauds can be conducted anywhere in the world as long as there is access to servers and email.   We have become accustomed to hearing about computer network attacks and identity theft involving a number of different companies. And the controversy about Bitcoin being involved for illegal transactions is nothing new.   Yet, unlike other types of white-collar crime such as insider trading, prosecutors are struggling to even identify suspects behind these attacks, let alone preventing them from being so profitable.   In the Old West, it was a matter of chasing down train robbers like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Today, it requires penetrating the layers of secrecy provided by the Internet and countries that encourage bank secrecy. It is easy to see that a crime has taken place, but getting the robbers is more difficult than ever.    "
Chief of Failed Exchange for Bitcoin Is Arrested,"TOKYO --  Since the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, the exchange that served as the largest hub for storing and trading the virtual currency Bitcoin, law enforcement officials and angry clients have been asking what happened to nearly half a billion dollars in Bitcoins that the company said had vanished from its computer systems. On Saturday, the Japanese police arrested Mark Karpeles, the head of the exchange, which was based in Tokyo, on suspicion that he had used the popular online financial platform, which he developed, to illicitly add $1 million to an account under his control.     But the arrest, and the small amount of information divulged by Japanese law enforcement officials, shed little light on the larger mystery of the missing Bitcoins.   Television news video showed officers from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department leading Mr. Karpeles, a 30-year-old French national, from his apartment early Saturday morning. In a statement, the police said they believed that Mr. Karpeles had ''unjustly inflated the balance'' of an account held under his name by manipulating transaction records on a system that Mt. Gox used to swap Bitcoins for dollars.   ''He created false information that $1 million had been transferred into the account, when in fact it had not been,'' the police said in a short statement.   The implosion of Mt. Gox, which Mr. Karpeles nurtured from humble beginnings as a platform for trading collectible cards from the game Magic: The Gathering, shook the still-developing world of virtual currencies. The sophisticated encryption that makes it possible to use Bitcoin conveniently and anonymously did not, the episode seemed to show, necessarily protect it against theft or security lapses at one's virtual bank.   Before it filed for bankruptcy in February of last year, Mt. Gox said 850,000 Bitcoins, mostly belonging to its clients, had been either lost or stolen by hackers, an amount worth more than $450 million at the time. The company also said it had lost $27 million in cash.   Mt. Gox later said it had recovered 200,000 of the missing Bitcoins from an overlooked part of its computer systems. With its accounting in disarray, however, it said it could not be sure what had happened to the rest, or even verify exactly how many Bitcoins it had actually held to begin with.   Mr. Karpeles has apologized for ''weaknesses in the system'' but denied that he had taken any of his clients' assets. On Friday night, in response to reports in the Japanese news media that he would soon be arrested, he sent instant messages to The Wall Street Journal saying the accusations made by the police were ''false'' and that he would ''of course deny'' them, The Journal reported.   Lawyers at an international law firm that has represented Mr. Karpeles did not respond to calls seeking comment. Mr. Karpeles has not been formally charged. The Japanese authorities can hold suspects for several weeks before deciding whether to bring charges.   The police did not say where they thought the $1 million that they claimed was falsely shown in Mr. Karpeles's account had come from or what he intended to do with it.   After the exchange's collapse, former employees came forward to accuse Mr. Karpeles of dipping into clients' accounts to cover the exchange's operating costs. The practice, they said, was common at Mt. Gox well before the mass disappearance of Bitcoins that ultimately sank it.   The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, citing unnamed police sources, said the money was suspected to have been siphoned from accounts held by Mt. Gox users.   In any case, the amount cited by the police represents only a tiny fraction of the value of the Bitcoins that went missing from Mt. Gox.    "
Man Charged in Bitcoin Scheme Appears in Court,"Anthony Murgio, a Florida man who was charged last month by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with running an illegal bitcoin money exchange firm and is thought to have information about last summer's hacking attack against JPMorgan Chase, seemed to be taking the unfolding criminal case against him in stride during a court appearance on Monday morning. Mr. Murgio, 31, made small talk with the two federal agents in the hallway of the federal court in Lower Manhattan, while waiting to appear on those charges before the United States magistrate judge, James C. Francis IV. At one point, he even rushed to see if a woman who had fallen in the hallway was hurt and needed help getting up.     But when he appeared in court, Mr. Murgio said nothing, letting his lawyer, Gregory W. Kehoe of the big law firm Greenberg Traurig, do the talking. The hearing was brief and the judge allowed Mr. Murgio, who has run a number of less-than-successful businesses since graduating from Florida State University, to remain free on $100,000 bond.   Mr. Murgio posted the bond a week ago after his arrest on July 21 in Tampa after spending a few nights in the Pinellas County jail while he and his family secured the money.   Both Mr. Murgio and his lawyer declined to comment after the proceeding in federal court.   Federal authorities contend that Mr. Murgio's company, Coin.mx, allowed online criminals to illegally exchange the digital currency bitcoin for cash as part of a money-laundering scheme. Mr. Murgio could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if convicted on the money-laundering charges.   The judge, at the request of Eun Young Choi, a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, ordered Mr. Murgio not to talk to anyone associated with his company and not to work for any other money-transfer firm.   Mr. Murgio's partner in running the small bitcoin firm, Yuri Lebedev, who also lives in Florida and was similarly charged by prosecutors, is out on $25,000 bond.   Neither man has been charged with any wrongdoing in connection with the hacking at JPMorgan that compromised the personal contact information of 83 million customer accounts at the bank.   But federal authorities are particularly interested in what Mr. Murgio may know about the attack, as his name surfaced early in the inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people briefed on the investigation have said. Joshua Aaron, a friend of Mr. Murgio and one of his college classmates from Florida State, also came to the attention of the F.B.I. early on.   Mr. Aaron was one of three men charged by prosecutors in Manhattan with operating a series of schemes to pump up the prices of otherwise worthless stocks who also is said to have some link to the JPMorgan attack. Two of those men were arrested in Israel on the day that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev were arrested in Florida.   Mr. Aaron, who moved to Israel several years ago, could not be arrested at his home in Tel Aviv because he was out of the country. Mr. Aaron, 31, is thought to be staying in Russia with his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, an Israeli citizen, based on social media posts from several weeks ago. The authorities have not formally declared him a fugitive, but people briefed on the matter said it was being considered.   On Monday, the two men arrested in Israel, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, appeared in a Jerusalem court and were ordered by a judge to remain in custody until at least Sept. 1. Both men have been detained by Israeli authorities at the request of federal prosecutors since their arrest on July 21.   Lawyers for Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein had asked for the men to be released from prison and confined to home arrest. Israeli prosecutors had wanted both men held for an additional 40 days.   Federal prosecutors are beginning to seek to extradite Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein to New York. But the process could take months.   As with Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev, neither Mr. Aaron nor his associates in Israel are facing any charges arising out of apparent theft of information from JPMorgan.   The authorities have declined to discuss what led them to conclude Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron might have some information about the JPMorgan attack. People briefed on the matter said that Mr. Aaron might have used information gathered in the breach, like purloined email addresses and customer home addresses, to put together a list of potential victims to pitch the stocks for their various schemes.   People familiar with stock manipulation schemes said a high-quality list of email addresses -- like the customer contact information taken from JPMorgan -- could sell for several million dollars on the black market.   Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron were known to have visited Russia in the last few years. The authorities suspect the actual hackers may be in Russia or another European country.   Federal authorities are under some pressure to develop information that could lead to the filing of charges related to the breach, especially against Mr. Aaron, Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein, now that charges have been filed against them with regards to the stock manipulation. Legal experts said once a defendant was extradited from a foreign country it was difficult to file new charges against that person, especially if the charges arose from a different offense.   The time constraint facing authorities then would seem to give leverage to anyone charged in either case but willing to take a plea and provide evidence linking the crimes to the attack.    "
Chinese Official Criticizes U.S. on Internet Security Policy,"HONG KONG --  Just days after China and the United States hailed a high-level agreement limiting cyberattacks, a former commander of one of the Chinese military's top hacking units lashed out at American Internet policy, in a sign of how far apart Beijing and Washington remain on technology issues.  In prepared remarks on Tuesday, Hao Yeli, the former deputy head of the Fourth Department of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department -- which is responsible for the Chinese military's offensive electronic warfare -- said that the United States had double standards with online surveillance and that the uncertainty behind the origin of digital attacks makes it difficult to apply traditional rules of engagement to the Internet.    Ms. Hao's speech punctured some of the cautious optimism analysts had expressed about last week's agreement between the United States and China, which was intended to rein in hacking theft of intellectual property and create international standards for ''appropriate conduct in cyberspace.'' Speaking at an Internet security conference in Beijing that also featured a former National Security Agency director, Keith B. Alexander, Ms. Hao challenged the position generally favored by American politicians.   Referring to the Arab Spring, Ms. Hao -- now the deputy director of the China Institute for Innovation and Development Strategy -- warned that taking away developing countries' ability to control public opinion through Internet controls and surveillance would result not in more openness, but instead in ''blood'' and ''hatred,'' according to an official transcript of her speech.   Though Ms. Hao ultimately called for greater communication between the world's two largest economies, she also said the United States should be less imperious in dictating how governments of other countries manage their own Internet, and in general behave online.   ''America spreads the ideas of democracy widely across the world, but in cyberspace, it's the opposite,'' she said. ''The United States continuously maintains a system to monitor the rest of the world but asks other countries to strictly control themselves and remain within bounds. This unsymmetrical line of thinking continues.''   Ms. Hao and Mr. Alexander, whose speech largely called for cooperation between the United States and China on the shared threat of online attacks, both spoke as part of the China Internet Security Conference sponsored by the Chinese online security and search firm Qihoo 360.   Likening China and the United States to strangers walking in the dark who mistake each other for ghosts, Ms. Hao said it was critical for each country to stop demonizing the other and instead begin a broader dialogue.   Ms. Hao also said any new rules of engagement for online attacks would probably be different from those used in other forms of warfare.   ''Because of the complexities and uncertainties of cyberspace, many of the rules of engagement applied normally would be difficult to directly follow,'' she said.    "
"Ashley Madison, a Website for Straying Spouses, Is Hit by an Online Attack","The company behind Ashley Madison, a popular online dating service marketed to people trying to cheat on their spouses, said on Monday that the site had been breached by hackers who may have obtained personal data about the service's millions of members. The group of hackers behind the attack, going by the name Impact Team, said they had stolen information on the 37 million members of Ashley Madison. To prevent the data from being released, the hackers said, the company needed to shut down the site entirely.     The hackers promised to release the real names, passwords and financial transactions of members if Ashley Madison did not meet that demand. The hackers have leaked some information online already, but that data did not appear to be the bulk of what was collected.   The corporate parent of Ashley Madison, Avid Life Media, said on Monday that it had adjusted its policy for deleting user data, an apparent complaint of the hackers, but the company gave no indication that it planned to close the site.   ''We immediately launched a thorough investigation,'' the company said, ''utilizing leading forensics experts and other security professionals to determine the origin, nature and scope of this incident.''   While nearly every dating website ends up facilitating its fair share of cheaters, Ashley Madison, based in Toronto, has made a name for itself by specifically catering to two-timers.   That business niche has angered not only some consumers, but other companies as well. Football stadiums and soccer teams have turned down sponsorship offers. Both NBC and FOX, after being approached about broadcasting Super Bowl spots, have rebuffed the website.   Nevertheless, since 2001, Ashley Madison has steadily grown to 37 million accounts, according to a figure advertised on the front page of the website. Anyone 18 or older can join the free site discreetly, using a pseudonym. There, the users can list turn-ons and sexual preferences. Only once users start chatting and trading photos do they begin racking up fees -- along with, potentially, some marital guilt.   The site has long told users that they can scrub their profiles from the site for $19. But the hackers say that the user information is never actually deleted -- knowledge, security experts said, that suggested the breach may have involved someone inside the company.   Ashley Madison said that when users delete accounts, all information is erased. Still, on Monday, the website waived its deletion fee for all members.   The breach, and the hackers complaints about the data policy, was first reported on Sunday by Brian Krebs, a reporter who covers online security.   Noel Biderman, chief executive of Avid Life Media, told Mr. Krebs that the hacker ''was definitely a person here that was not an employee but certainly had touched our technical services.'' The company would not respond to additional questions about who was behind the breach.   The hacking is one in a string aimed at corporations, such as one against Sony in 2014 and another against Target the year before -- a trend that security experts say is growing. In May, the sexual preferences of users of AdultFriendFinder, another dating website, were leaked online after a breach.   ''I think we're going to see more of it as people see how effective it is,'' said Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer for Resilient Systems, a security company, said of the Ashley Madison breach.    The breach comes at an inopportune time for Avid Life Media, which had expressed interest in pursuing an initial public offering this year. The company owns two other popular sites, Cougar Life and Established Men, that the hackers also breached.    For any dating website, much less one meant for extramarital romance, to continue to grow and be attractive to potential investors, consumers must be confident that their data will be protected.    Under American copyright law, Ashley Madison has the power to scrub away private user information leaked in the breach and posted to other websites. On Monday, the company said that it had been doing just that to protect the identities of those who have used Ashley Madison.   But that may be a race that it cannot win. Paul Ferguson, senior adviser for Trend Micro, a security software provider, said that information on Ashley Madison, deleted in one online forum, is beginning to bubble up in others.   ''Once something is published on the Internet,'' he said, ''it's there forever.''   That persistence has some marriage counselors predicting a boom in business -- even if names end up unpublished.   ''Oh, it'll be a huge uptick,'' said M. Gary Neuman, a marriage counselor in Miami Beach, Fla. and author of ''The Truth about Cheating.'' ''Just the news getting out will have some spouses asking each other, 'Are you one of the ones using this website?' ''    "
VTech Says Hacking Loss Includes Data of Children,"A maker of digital toys for children said it had been hacked, putting the personal information of five million people, including children, at risk. VTech, a Hong Kong company that sells tablets and other electronics as educational tools, said in a statement that its Learning Lodge database had been compromised on Nov. 14. Learning Lodge is an online store for VTech devices where users can download apps, games, e-books, videos and music, all geared toward children.     Hackers were able to retrieve adults' profile information, including names, email addresses and passwords. They also obtained secret questions and answers for password retrieval, I.P. addresses, mailing addresses and download histories.   The compromised database also contained the names, gender and birth dates of children, which was a bigger concern to security researchers.   Troy Hunt, an Internet security expert, wrote this weekend that while adults were becoming accustomed to data breaches, compromising the identities of children was jarring. The exposed data could allow someone to link a child to his or her parents and pinpoint the child's physical address.   ''I've got two little kids and as a father, this really made me think about the footprints I'll make for them online,'' he wrote.   Motherboard, a news site that first reported the breach on Friday, said hackers were also able to gain access to  photos of children and chat logs. That report could not be independently confirmed, and VTech did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   No credit card information was stored, the company said, and some of its websites were shut down as a precaution. Officials in Connecticut and Illinois said they planned to investigate the breach, according to Reuters.   The hacking at VTech joins a growing list of prominent data breaches in recent years, including at major retailers like Target, websites like Ashley Madison and corporations like Sony.    "
A Maven of Money Law,"Interview conducted and condensed by Patricia R. Olsen.  Obrea Poindexter is a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster in Washington. Q. What is your practice area?    A. I advise clients on regulatory matters related to credit, debit and prepaid cards. Now, with emerging technologies, I'm also involved with mobile payments and virtual currency. I counsel companies on things like privacy concerns, data security, electronic delivery of information and electronic signatures.    What other services do you provide?   When companies want to launch a new payment-related product, I educate them on what they need to know about laws and regulations. Or a company might want advice on developing agreements with partners. We also help with product design, especially for start-ups. They may want to know the best legal framework for structuring a product.   When did you decide to become a lawyer?   As a child I thought I wanted to be one, but I loved economics in college so I changed course. One summer in college I worked at the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant, but the job involved more number-crunching than I had expected. I was all ready to pursue a Ph.D. in economics and become an economist, but I applied to law school instead. After graduating, I became a law clerk in the Fed's legal division and helped write consumer financial laws involving debit, credit and prepaid cards.   How did you move to Morrison & Foerster?   After five years at the Fed, I was being recruited by various law firms and decided it was a good time to move. I enjoyed the rule-making part of my job but I was interested in pursuing a financial services practice from an industry standpoint. When a recruiter called about an opening here, I made the change.   Your work has changed significantly in the last 10 years.   A decade ago the hot areas in financial services were online banking and Internet commerce. Now the alternatives to traditional payment systems are hot, such as Apple Pay and Softcard. The mobile payments and virtual currency industries are still evolving, and I'm constantly learning. It takes hours to stay current in this area, but it's why I continue to enjoy what I do. I love learning.   Vocations asks people about their jobs.            "
Symantec Report Suggests Hackers' Motives Are Blurring,"PALO ALTO, Calif. -  A group of financially motivated hackers has been infiltrating major corporations and stealing valuable intellectual property, a sign that the motives and techniques of different types of online criminals are starting to blur, researchers at a computer security company will announce in a report on Wednesday. Typically, criminal hackers steal passwords and personal data from companies with poor security so that they can break into more valuable sites, or simply sell those passwords and Social Security numbers on the black market. But the report, by Symantec, the computer security company, suggests that a group it calls Morpho is after intellectual property, possibly to sell it to competitors or nation states.   Symantec said the group had attacked multibillion-dollar companies in the Internet, software, pharmaceutical, legal and commodities fields. Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft are among the companies that have publicly acknowledged attacks. Symantec's researchers said they did not believe the group was backed by any nation state because it was ""agnostic about the nationality of its targets.""  But the researchers said there were clues that the hackers might be English speakers - their malicious code is written in fluent English - and they named their encryption keys after memes in American pop culture and gaming. Researchers also said the attackers worked during United States working hours, though they conceded that might just be because that is when their targets are most active. The group has developed custom hacking tools and is able to break into both Windows and Apple computers, researchers say, which suggests that it has plenty of resources. In at least one case, researchers discovered that the hackers had used one so-called zero day vulnerability, a security flaw that has not been discovered by companies or security defenders. Such flaws are considered difficult to find and can be purchased on the black market, where, depending on the number of systems they expose and the probability that the flaw will be found, can fetch as much as six-figure sums from governments, or criminal groups eager to exploit them. Researchers believe the Morpho group is the same one that compromised Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Microsoft in 2013. Symantec's researchers said that was their first inkling that the group existed. When they dug further, they found evidence that the same group had been active since at least March 2013, and is still active today. To date, Symantec said it had discovered 49 different organizations in more than 20 countries that had been attacked by Morpho. Some of its earliest targets were in the legal field, but the group's list of victims has evolved, and it has targeted companies in technology, pharmaceuticals and, most recently, commodities. Researchers found evidence that the group's hackers did careful reconnaissance before grabbing valuable trade secrets. In some cases, the researchers had indications that they had succeeded in intercepting company emails, and business databases containing legal and policy documents, financial records, product descriptions and training documents. In one case, researchers found that the group managed to compromise a physical security system that monitors employee and visitor movements around some corporate buildings. Researchers said the hackers were incredibly careful to clean up evidence of a break-in before moving on to subsequent targets, and careful to scrub their tracks. Servers that the criminals used to orchestrate their attacks were rented using Bitcoin, the anonymous digital currency. ""We know that their 'op sec' is very, very good,"" said Vikram Thakur, a senior manager of the attack investigations team at Symantec, using the shorthand for ""operational security."" ""Who they are? We don't know. They are virtually impossible to track.""  "
LifeLock Agrees to Pay $100 Million Fine in Settlement With F.T.C.,"LifeLock, an identity protection service, agreed to a $100 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for failing to deliver on promises it would guard personal data and inform users when their information was breached.  The F.T.C. said Thursday that the size of the fine, one of the largest from the agency, reflected the egregiousness of LifeLock's actions. The settlement is the company's second with federal enforcement officials. In 2010, the F.T.C. charged the company with failing to provide strong security measures for personal data. ""The fact that consumers paid LifeLock for help in protecting their sensitive personal information makes the charges in this case particularly troubling,"" Edith Ramirez, the F.T.C. chairwoman, said in a statement. In July, the agency charged LifeLock with failing to put adequate data protections in place for Social Security numbers and for credit card and bank accounts. The agency said that LifeLock falsely claimed in advertisements that it had security systems that were as strong as those used by financial institutions. The company also failed to fulfill a promise that it would inform users when their data was breached, the agency said. Those actions violated promises made in a 2010 deal with the F.T.C. At that time, the chairman of the agency, Jon Leibowitz, said LifeLock's promises to guard data from identity thieves were woefully inadequate and its protection ""actually provided enough holes that you could drive a truck through it."" LifeLock, based in Tempe, Ariz., agreed then to a $12 million fine. The majority of the $100 million settlement will be used for redress to consumers harmed by the company, the agency said. "
U.S. Was Warned of System Open to Cyberattacks,"WASHINGTON --  The inspector general at the Office of Personnel Management, which keeps the records and security clearance information for millions of current and retired federal employees, issued a report in November that essentially described the agency's computer security system as a Chinese hacker's dream. But by the time the report was published, Chinese hackers had already cleaned out tens of thousands of files on sensitive security clearances, and were preparing for a much broader attack that ultimately obtained detailed personal information on at least four million current and former government employees. Even today, the agency is struggling to patch numerous vulnerabilities.     A number of administration officials on Friday painted a picture of a government office struggling to catch up, with the Chinese ahead of them at every step.    The agency did not possess an inventory of all the computer servers and devices with access to its networks, and did not require anyone gaining access to information from the outside to use the kind of basic authentication techniques that most Americans use for online banking. It did not regularly scan for vulnerabilities in the system, and found that 11 of the 47 computer systems that were supposed to be certified as safe for use last year were not ''operating with a valid authorization.''    The problems were so severe for two systems that hosted the databases used by the Federal Investigative Service, which is responsible for the background investigations for officials and contractors who are issued security clearances, that the inspector general argued for temporarily shutting them down because the security flaws ''could potentially have national security implications.''   Hackers in China apparently figured that out months before the report was published. Last summer a breach was detected that appeared aimed directly at the security clearance records -- information that could help a determined hacker gain access to email or other accounts belonging to those entrusted with the nation's secrets.    While upgrades were underway, a much broader attack occurred, apparently starting in December. Before it was detected, personal information on at least four million people was apparently downloaded by a patient, well-equipped adversary -- and the number is likely to grow.   As one senior former government official who once handled cyberissues for the administration, who would not speak on the record because it could endanger the person's role on key advisory committees, said on Friday, ''The mystery here is not how they got cleaned out by the Chinese. The mystery is what took the Chinese so long.''   Researchers and government officials have determined that the Chinese group that attacked the office was probably the same one that seized millions of records held by the health care firms Anthem and Primera. Based on the forensics, experts believe the attackers were not part of the People's Liberation Army, whose Third Department oversees much of the military's cyberintelligence gathering. Rather they believe the group is privately contracted, though the exact affiliation with the Chinese government is not known.   For the Obama administration, which came to office holding East Room events on cybersecurity and pressing Congress, for years, to pass legislation that would allow the private sector to share information with the government, what has happened at the Office of Personnel Management can only be described as a case study in bureaucratic lethargy and poor security practices.    In the most egregious case cited by the inspector general, outsiders entering the system were not subjected to ''multifactor authentication'' -- the systems that, for example, require a code that is sent to a cellphone to be entered before giving access to a user. Asked about that in an interview, Donna Seymour, the chief information officer at the Office of Personnel Management, said that installing such gear in the government's ''antiquated environment'' was difficult and very time consuming, and that her agency had to perform ''triage'' to determine how to close the worst vulnerabilities.   The agency now plans to install two-step authentication across its network, Ms. Seymour said. A longtime data security official, she also defended the decision to ignore the inspector general's advice to shut down two systems that contain the security clearance information. Ms. Seymour said that the investigators were using an outdated assessment of the security measures -- and that the agency was in the process of getting tighter controls when the intrusion happened. Another senior official said that with the agency under pressure to clear a huge backlog of security clearances, halting the process was ''a nonstarter'' with Congress.   During the installation of new security scanning software, officials said, they found evidence of the broad downloading of millions of files.    But administration officials said a lack of management focus on the problems contributed to the slow response -- combined with a lack of focus on protecting systems that are not part of the national security infrastructure but that contain large amounts of data. And a number of administration officials in interviews on Friday painted a picture of Chinese adversaries who appear to be building huge databases of information on American citizens, useful for intelligence gathering and other purposes.   ''They didn't go to sell the data, which is what criminal groups usually do,'' said James Lewis, an expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''It's biographic databases that really give an intelligence benefit -- and that get into an opponent's skin.'' Such databases indicate where a government official was posted, and security clearance information would list their foreign contacts -- useful if there was an effort to track down Chinese citizens in contact with Americans.   The chronology of attacks against American targets matches China's stated economic and strategic objectives, members of Congress were told in briefings held by the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. ''I'm angry and frustrated that we are at a place where this kind of attack can be successful,'' said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on both a subcommittee on cyberissues and the Armed Services Committee. The attackers, he said, ''could have been inside the systems for weeks or months.'' In fact, investigators believe they were there for at least three months, before being detected in April.   Government officials in the United States have been tracking several such privately contracted Chinese groups since 2008 and believe they operate at the behest of the state. One, based out of Guangzhou in southern China, has been tied to thousands of attacks on victims in the United States, Britain, Canada, Europe, Russia and Africa that develop missile, satellite, space and nuclear propulsion technology.    At the White House, officials were struggling to explain on Friday how the breach could have happened after warnings from the inspector general and others. Michael Daniel, the White House's top cyberofficial, declined to speak on the record about the attack, and Lisa Monaco, who has been handling cyberissues as one of Mr. Obama's top national security officials, declined to be interviewed.   ''The threat that we face is ever-evolving,'' said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ''We understand that there is this persistent risk out there. We take this very seriously.''    Mr. Earnest said Mr. Obama's efforts to push legislation would bolster the nation's data.   ''We need the United States Congress to come out of the Dark Ages and actually join us here in the 21st century to make sure that we have the kinds of defenses that are necessary to protect a modern computer system,'' he said.

"United Halts Flights for 2 Hours, Blaming Faulty Network Equipment","United Airlines grounded planes nationwide for nearly two hours Wednesday morning after a faulty computer network router disrupted its passenger reservations system. It was the second time in five weeks that United had to ground flights because of a computer issue. The latest problem prevented United from dispatching many of its domestic flights, causing 61 flights to be canceled and delaying more than 1,100 other flights by midafternoon.    Blaming ''network connectivity,'' United ordered a ground stop to its domestic flights, as well as those flown by its regional United Express partners, at 8 a.m. Eastern time.    It restored the United Express flights at 8:25 a.m. only to halt them again at 9 a.m. The ground stop was lifted for all of United's domestic operations at 9:49 a.m.   Of the 61 cancellations, four were United flights and 57 were United Express flights, said a United spokeswoman, Jennifer Dohm. She added that there were 615 United delays, with an average of one hour, and 547 United Express delays, with an average of 27 minutes.   Even after United restarted its operations, passengers still reported lingering problems.   Ryan Ver Berkmoes, a travel writer from Long Island City, N.Y., said he and his fiancée, Alexis Averbuck, a painter, could not get their boarding passes online until 3 p.m. for a flight to San Francisco on Thursday morning to plan their wedding.   Mr. Berkmoes, who flies enough to be in United's highest frequent-flier category, complained that ''snafus happen all the time'' with United, which merged with Continental Airlines in 2010 to form United Continental Holdings, based in Chicago.   ''Unfortunately for the places I fly, they are my one real option, and I'm not sure that competition in the oligarchy is that much better,'' he said.   On the same day, trading was suspended for a technical problem on the New York Stock Exchange.   Both United and the stock exchange confirmed that the malfunctions were unrelated internal technical issues and not a security episode.   At United, Ms. Dohm said a network router problem was the culprit. Security experts said the cause of such problems can take time to investigate, and some hypothesized that once forensics were complete, the issue could very well have been caused by a security incident.   Two weeks ago, a Polish state-owned airline grounded 1,400 travelers after hackers flooded the airline's computer system with web traffic, but the airline has yet to disclose who was responsible. At the time, Sebastian Mikosz, Polish LOT airline's chief executive, said the airline used the same state-of-the-art network equipment as others in the industry and warned that all airlines were vulnerable to a similar attack.   ''This is an industry problem, not a LOT problem but an industry problem on a much wider scale, and for sure we have to give it more attention, if it can be given more attention,'' he told Reuters.   The episode on Wednesday was the latest in a series recently for airlines. Early last month, 150 United flights were grounded because pilots could not gain access to their digital flight plans. And in April, American Airlines delayed some flights because a bug in its iPad software meant that pilots did not have accurate airport maps.   While the troubles were reminders of how damaging computer malfunctions can be, the United mishap on Wednesday came just a week after the Justice Department disclosed that United had been part of an investigation of possible collusion among the airlines to limit seating and prop up ticket prices.   After a series of mega-mergers, roughly 80 percent of the nation's air traffic is concentrated among four carriers: American Airlines, United, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines.   George Hoffer, a transportation economist at the University of Richmond, said the disruptions caused by United's router problem were ''a perfect example of where the mega-mergers added redundancy to the individual carrier, but really lessened redundancy for the airline system.''   ''The concentration, as predicted, makes a greater percentage of the system at risk if a glitch occurs,'' he added.   United's chief executive, Jeff Smisek, said in an interview in New York that the computer issue had prevented the airline from dispatching planes. He said it took about 90 minutes for United's computer technicians to correct the problem.   There will be residual flight delays, he said, but ''we're working hard to minimize them.''    "
Security Researchers Find a Way to Hack Cars,"Some cars can now be hacked. Over the last two years, two well-respected security researchers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, have been hacking away at various cars, trying to find a way to control them remotely. At the annual Black Hat and Def Con hacking conferences in Las Vegas in August, Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek plan to demonstrate how, after two years of research, they have discovered a way to control hundreds of thousands of vehicles remotely. From the Internet, they were able to track cars down by their location, see how fast they were going, turn their blinkers and lights on and off, mess with their windshield wipers, radios, navigation and, in some cases, control their brakes and steering. Their discovery is several years in the making. In 2013, they described how they were able to control a Ford and a Toyota by plugging into a diagnostic port that could control the vehicle's steering and speed. But the hack was of limited use to car manufacturers, who told them that anyone with physical access to the vehicle could just as easily cut the brakes.  So for the last year, Mr. Miller and Mr. Valasek have been tinkering with a Jeep, trying to find a way to control the car remotely. What they did not realize at the time was that their discovery would extend far beyond the Jeep and impact hundreds of thousands of other vehicles sold by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Their research is likely to be one of the first discoveries in a new chapter of vulnerabilities and attacks directed at the so-called Internet of Things, the billions of products, machinery and infrastructure expected to come online over the next five years. A report from Verizon found that 14 car manufacturers accounted for 80 percent of the worldwide auto market, and each one had a connected-car strategy. Last year, the researchers bought a Jeep that came with a car stereo head unit, which offers radio display, traffic and navigation system, and in this case, connected to the Internet through a hardware chip that provides a wireless and a cellular network connection. Mr. Miller and Mr. Valesek discovered a vulnerability in that chip that allowed them to scan the Internet for affected vehicles, hack into the car stereo head unit and run their own code. In the process, they were able change the radio station and adjust the air-conditioning but not too much more. It took another few months, but they found a way to crawl from the vulnerable wireless access chip to another chip within the same head unit that controlled the cars' electronics. Once they did that, they could control the car's locks, windshield wipers, speedometer, lights, blinkers and even engage and disengage the brakes and steering, so long as the car was driving at sufficiently slow speeds (around six miles an hour or less ) - all from the Internet. ""I have done a lot of research, but this is the first time I've been truly freaked out,"" Mr. Miller said in a phone interview. ""When I could hack into a car in Nebraska driving down the freeway, I had that feeling, 'I shouldn't be able to do this.'"" It was not just Jeeps they could access, but any car with the same head unit made by Fiat Chrysler. This included most newer models with the head unit, sold from late 2013 to 2015. The researchers scanned the Internet for vulnerable vehicles, took down their vehicle identification numbers and worked backward from there. Mr. Miller and Mr. Velasak have been short on details regarding the specific vulnerabilities they discovered in the head unit, or how exactly they were able to access the firmware - instructions that are coded into a computer's memory rather than its software - that allowed them to control the vehicles' electronics.  Mr. Miller and Mr. Velasak notified Fiat Chrysler, which developed and released a patch last week. Alyse Tadajewski, a spokeswoman for Fiat Chrysler, said that the company did not believe it was responsible for the researchers to disclose the vulnerability to the public. ""Under no circumstances does F.C.A. condone or believe it's appropriate to disclose 'how-to information' that would potentially encourage, or help enable hackers to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to vehicle systems,"" she said. Ms. Tadajewski said Fiat Chrysler routinely monitored and tests its systems to identify and eliminate security vulnerabilities and had an embedded system quality engineering team dedicated to developing and implementing cybersecurity standards for all its vehicles, including its on-board and remote services.  She said the company released a free software patch for the vulnerability. ""Customers can either download and install this particular update themselves or, if preferred, their dealer can complete this one-time update at no cost to customers.""  The end goal, Mr. Miller said, was to hack something tangible that most people could understand. ""I've been in security for more than 10 years, and I've worked on computers and phones. This time, I wanted to do something that my grandmother would understand. If I tell her, 'I can hack into your car,' she understands what that means. ""Also, I drive cars,"" Mr. Miller added. ""I would like them to be safe."" "
"In Davos, Executives Express Worries Over More Disruptive Cyberattacks","DAVOS, Switzerland - Executives from Target and Home Depot were not present at the World Economic Forum, where world leaders and corporate titans are rubbing shoulders and debating weighty issues. Yet the names of those two companies are being invoked several times a day here, held up as examples of early victims in the growing battle against cybercrime. Hackers stole credit card information from 40 million Target customers in late 2013. Last year, Home Depot was hit with a similar breach. And those are just two of a growing list of embattled businesses that includes JPMorgan Chase, Sony and others.  Executives were broadly pessimistic on the topic, believing that while last year had a number of prominent cyber attacks, this year would only be worse. ""The number of security incidents this year will be exponentially greater than last year,"" said John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, the big Silicon Valley technology company. And not only are such incidents becoming more common, they are getting more disruptive. ""We haven't sent he worst yet,"" said Vishal Sikka, chief executive of the Indian outsourcing giant Infosys. ""I think we'll see five times as many bad incidents as we did last year."" Though Infosys has so far escaped a major cyber attack, Mr. Sikka said his company was being more vigilant than ever before, and regularly fended off smaller, unsuccessful efforts to penetrate the company's network. ""You can never win,"" said Robert Smith, chief executive of Vista Equity Partners, a private equity firm that invests in enterprise technology companies. ""It's a constant battle to stay even or stay ahead."" Noting that the scale, scope and sensitivity of the data being stolen continued to become more problematic for companies, Mr. Smith also warned of a tough year ahead for fighting cybercrime. ""The security breaches that we had in the last 12 months are going to pale in comparison to these that we're going in the next 12 months,"" said Mr. Smith. The chief executive of Sony, the company at the center of the most disruptive recent hack, did attend the forum in Davos on Thursday. At a private lunch, Kazuo Hirai, chief executive of Sony, discussed the attack on Sony that briefly shut down the company's computers, exposed thousands of sensitive documents and emails, and scuttled the release of ""The Interview."" Details of his remarks were kept confidential, but according to people in attendance he did not say whether he believed that North Korea was behind the attacks, as the Obama administration has asserted. The Sony hack was particular alarming because it was aimed not at stealing data for a profit, but because it was apparently designed to humiliate and debilitate an entire company. ""The issue around Sony is a different issue,"" said Mr. Smith. ""We're not just going to take your data, we're going to use your data to embarrass you."" But as some companies grapple with the effects of hacking, others, sees the growing threat of cyber crime as a business opportunity. ""We're going to become the number one security company,"" said Mr. Chambers of Cisco. Already, Cisco has acquired one big security firm, Sourcefire, for $2.7 billion. And Mr. Chambers said more such acquisitions would follow.             Mr. Chambers sees the growing threat of cyber security as part and parcel with an increasingly digital world. ""Everything will become more digital,"" said Mr. Chambers. ""Every city, state, small business, large business, car, home, highway, and everything you wear."" And when that happens, there are more opportunities than ever for hackers to penetrate secure networks and steal sensitive data. In turn, Cisco is trying to create security products for public clouds, private clouds, wide area networks and devices. ""I don't focus a lot of the on the symptoms,"" said Mr. Chambers. ""I go back to the underlying issue and ask how do you fix the illness."" Yet for most big companies, simply staying ahead of the hackers remained the priority. ""The one thing that really scares me said that if someone wants to get into your system, they can get in,"" said Richard Gelfond, chief executive of Imax. ""Almost no amount of money will keep them out.  Not that he isn't trying. Mr. Gelfond said Imax had established a series of internal firewalls that prevent any one person from having access to too much of company's technology. ""For us there are two holy grail that we have to protect,"" said Mr. Gelfond. ""The first is movies, the second is intellectual property."" But he admitted that despite the company's best efforts, hackers would be trying to break into Imax's systems. ""Think of the value of an advance copy of the upcoming Star Wars movie,"" he said. The enhanced focus on cyber security was reflected in the event's official agenda. A panel titled ""Fighting Shadows"" will take place on Saturday, featuring the president of Estonia, Toomas Hendrick Ilves; Bradford Smith, the general counsel of Microsoft; and Eugene Kaspersky, a Russian internet security expert. ""Three years ago when you talked about security, you didn't get much interest,"" said Mr. Chambers. Jonathan Zittrain, a Harvard University professor of law and computer science who will also be on the panel, said he hoped industry professionals could come together and begin to make gradual fixes to the Internet that would make all companies more secure.  Small improvements, like software that detected unusual patters in Internet traffic, or suspicious attempts to access data, could help stop hackers before they caused too much damage. Such small, incremental steps could make the web gradually safer for individuals and companies, and less friendly to hackers, Mr. Zittrain said. ""This is a moon shot going one step at a time, rather than fling a missile and hoping it hits,"" Mr. Zittrain said. Mr. Zittrain and others acknowledge that a more holistic fix is a long ways off. In the meantime, tech executives like Mr. Chambers don't pretend that they can make the problem go away. ""There is no secure data center in the world; they have all been broken in to,"" said Mr. Chambers. ""We can help you prepare for it and minimize the damage when it does occur."" But the message to companies was clear: the hacks will continue to occur. ""You will get a data breach, period,"" said Mr. Smith. ""If you think you haven't been attacked, you're lying to yourself."" "
Britain: Suspect Arrested in Cyberattack,"LONDON -- A 23-year-old British man has been arrested over a cyberattack in which data was stolen from the United States Department of Defense, the police said on Friday.  The man was detained Wednesday morning by detectives from the National Crime Agency of Britain on suspicion of offenses linked to a hacking that took place in June, said a spokesman for the agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in line with official policy.    The man, who was arrested in Sutton Coldfield, close to Birmingham in the West Midlands, has not been identified and has not yet been charged, the spokesman said.   During the cyberattack, data was stolen from a messaging service used by Defense Department employees around the world, including contact details for about 800 people consisting of names, titles, email addresses and phone numbers, the British agency said in a statement.   ''It also included device information for approximately 34,400 devices including IMEI numbers, which are the unique codes used to identify a mobile device,'' the agency added. ''No sensitive data was obtained, and none of the data obtained could be used as personally identifiable information or compromise U.S. national security interests.''   The agency said that screenshots of the Defense Department system had been posted online, apparently to prove that the cyberattack had been successful.   A message on a website called Pastebin, believed to have been posted by the suspect, included claims like, ''We're in your bases, we control your satellites. The missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance, watch your heads,'' the agency said. Another read, ''Department of Defense has no defenses.''   In the statement from the British agency, Jeffrey Thorpe, special agent in charge at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Defense Department, said the arrest showed the ''commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cybercriminals in their tracks.''   ''D.C.I.S. special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those that attack the Department of Defense,'' he added, using an abbreviation for his unit.   Andy Archibald, deputy director of the British crime agency's National Cyber Crime Unit, said that the arrest was one of 57 this week across Britain for digital offenses, the result of a collaboration between ''law enforcement, industry and government, that is at the heart of fighting cybercrime.''   ''Criminals need to realize that committing crime online will not make them anonymous to law enforcement,'' Mr. Archibald said in a statement. ''We are continuously working to track down and apprehend those seeking to utilize computers for criminal ends, and to disrupt the technical networks and infrastructures supporting international cyber crime.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Penn State's College of Engineering Hit by Cyberattack,"Hackers from China infiltrated the computer systems of Pennsylvania State University's College of Engineering, gaining usernames and passwords in what investigators described as a sophisticated cyberattack that lasted more than two years. The university has pulled the College of Engineering's computer network offline and expects to keep the system down for several days as workers shore up security, the university said in a statement Friday. Penn State administrators were first alerted to the attack last November by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Penn State hired Mandiant, the incident response company owned by FireEye, the Milpitas, Calif.-based security firm, to investigate.  Mandiant discovered two sets of sophisticated attackers - at least one of which is a known group in China. They appeared to be after the college's intellectual property.  The Chinese group has been responsible for attacks on victims in industries like aerospace and defense, as well as other universities, said Nick Bennett, a senior manager from Mandiant. In this case, the group deployed various so-called back doors and attack tools starting in September 2012. The other group, which Mandiant has not yet identified, started its attack last year and appeared to be after usernames and passwords.  Investigators did not find any evidence that hackers had stolen personal information, like Social Security numbers or credit card numbers. But there is evidence that they may have gained access to such information, primarily Social Security numbers, for 18,000 people. The university said it would offer those individuals free credit monitoring. The university also said it was in the process of notifying more than 500 public and private research partners that have worked with the College of Engineering since the initial intrusion. In a statement issued Friday, Penn State said that it was a frequent target of cyberattacks. On an average day last year, the university said that Penn State alone blocked more than 20 million hostile cyberattacks from around the world. That stunning number is not unique to Penn State, Kevin Morooney, the vice provost for information technology at Penn State said in an interview. ""That is typical for a research university,"" Mr. Morooney said. ""We are having intense conversations with our colleagues in higher education.""  Mr. Morooney said Penn State was using a security measure called two-factor authentication, which requires a second, one-time password for anyone trying to access its networks remotely. The plan is to to roll out two-factor authentication across the College of Engineering, and eventually to the entire university.  Universities are a frequent target for hackers because they handle vast amounts of personal and financial information for students and employees, as well as  sensitive research. ""This new threat must be faced head-on, not just by Penn State but by every large university, business and government the world over. This is a new era in the digital age, one that will require even greater vigilance from everyone,"" Eric Barron, Penn State's president, wrote in a letter to members of the university. More recently, universities have become a target for hackers looking to cause disruptions. In April, Rutgers University was attacked by hackers who managed to successfully flood the university's computer systems with web traffic until they fell offline. The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are investigating the incident. The Penn State attack is another in a spate of cyberattacks that have led security experts have adopted the motto: There are only two types of companies left in the United States. Those that have been breached by China, and those that don't yet know they have been breached by China. Despite increases in security spending and more aggressive prosecutions of those suspected of stealing data on behalf of China, the United States has found the cyberthreat from China nearly impossible to contain. The F.B.I. now lists cybercrime, which includes trade secret theft, as a top priority, behind terrorism and counterintelligence. In April,  President Obama signed a new executive order establishing financial and travel sanctions against anyone launching cyberattacks that posed a threat national security or financial stability.

Hackers Say They Have Released Ashley Madison Files,"Hackers claim to have made good on their threat to release data they stole in a breach last month of the company behind Ashley Madison, the popular online dating website aimed at people hoping to cheat on their spouses. On Tuesday, the group of hackers who first claimed responsibility for the  attack last month dumped 9.7 gigabytes worth of stolen user account and payment information online. The data included login details, email addresses, payment transaction details and encrypted passwords for members of Ashley Madison and Established Men, another site that markets to women looking to date rich men. Both sites are owned by Avid Life Media, as is Cougar Life, a third site that was also breached but did not appear to be part of Tuesday's data dump. A group of hackers named Impact Team took responsibility for the breach last month and threatened to release names, passwords and financial transactions of Ashley Madison's members if Avid Life Media did not immediately shut the site down. The hackers also complained that the company charged a $19 fee to members to scrub their profiles from the site, but continued to keep their data on its servers.  Avid Life Media said last month that it had adjusted its policy for deleting user data, but continued to operate Ashley Madison, which maintained data on 40 million users, according to its website. Established Men and Cougar Life also continued to operate. To show they were serious last month, the hackers posted samples of data they had collected in the breach, including corporate financial documents and maps of Avid Life Media's internal network. The company said last month after the breach that it was taking steps to delete the stolen data, but it was too late. In an post published anonymously on Tuesday, captioned ""Time's Up!"", the hackers said they were releasing Avid Life Media's data because the company had not met their demands. ""We have explained the fraud, deceit and stupidity of A.L.M. and their members,"" hackers wrote. ""Now everyone gets to see their data."" The hackers accused the service of overstating the number of females on its site. ""Keep in mind the site is a scam with thousands of fake female profiles,"" they wrote. ""See Ashley Madison fake profile lawsuit; 90-95% of actual users are male. Chances are your man signed up on the world's biggest affair site, but never had one. He just tried to. If that distinction matters."" In a statement, Avid Life Media said that its investigation into the breach on its systems was continuing and that it was cooperating with law enforcement agencies in Canada and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States.  The company said it was still investigating the validity of any information posted online from its site and was working to remove any data posted unlawfully.  ""This event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality,"" the company said in its statement.  ""It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any free-thinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities. The criminal, or criminals, involved in this act have appointed themselves as the moral judge, juror, and executioner, seeing fit to impose a personal notion of virtue on all of society.""   They added, ""We will not sit idly by and allow these thieves to force their personal ideology on citizens around the world. We are continuing to fully cooperate with law enforcement to seek to hold the guilty parties accountable to the strictest measures of the law."" Avid Life Media is one of several sites containing sensitive user data to have been breached in recent months. In May, Adult Friend Finder, a sex website, was breached and data from 3.5 million users was dumped online.  "
Ashley Madison Chief Is Latest to Depart After a Data Breach,"In the last two years, online attacks have led to executive casualties at prominent companies like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Target. Now add to the list the chief executive of the company operating the adultery website Ashley Madison, a lesser known but far more salacious victim. Avid Life Media, the parent company of Ashley Madison, announced that its chief executive, Noel Biderman, stepped down on Friday, more than a month after hackers broke into the company's computer systems and released data and emails that suggested it engaged in questionable business practices.    The breach of Ashley Madison, an online service that facilitates extramarital affairs, resulted in the leak of personal information attached to more than 30 million accounts, including those of 10,000 American government officials, a handful of celebrities, a few clergymen and, apparently, very few real female profiles. Leaked emails also showed that the company may have hacked into the computer networks of its competitors.    Mr. Biderman is the latest executive to have left a company -- voluntarily or involuntarily -- after a network breach. Amy Pascal stepped down as Sony Pictures Entertainment's co-chairwoman in February after hackers released stolen data, including many embarrassing emails. In 2014, Target's chairman and chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, a 35-year veteran of the retailer, stepped down months after a huge breach resulted in the theft of 40 million customers' payment details.   Those ousters have made security a priority among executives. According to a survey by the Ponemon Institute, which tracks data breaches, only 13 percent of senior management said their concern about a data breach was extremely high before the breach at Target. That jumped to 55 percent after the incident.   ''There's less forgiveness,'' Larry Ponemon, the founder of the Ponemon Institute, said in an interview on Friday. ''The board is more concerned now than it has ever been with preserving the reputation of a company after a data breach. If the C.E.O. has to leave the company as a result, that's the cost of doing business.''   A statement from Avid Life Media said that Mr. Biderman was no longer with the company, effective Friday. ''This change is in the best interest of the company and allows us to continue to provide support to our members and dedicated employees,'' the statement said. ''We are actively adjusting to the attack on our business and members' privacy by criminals.''   Mr. Biderman also created the companion sites Established Men, which targeted women looking to meet wealthy men, and Cougar Life, a service for older women.   When hackers leaked Ashley Madison's data this month, they accused the company of fraudulent business practices, like overstating how many women actually used AshleyMadison.com. One analysis showed that of the site's roughly 34 million users, only 15 percent were female, and that only a small slice of those profiles were actually active.   That could constitute a deceptive trade practice that could open Avid Life Media to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. And if the F.T.C. can prove Mr. Biderman was aware of the fraudulent practice, participated in it and benefited from it, the commission could pursue him as well, said Marc Zwillinger, a founder of ZwillGen, a law firm that specializes in data breach cases.   Mr. Biderman did not respond to a request for comment. Avid Life Media said it would not help arrange any interviews as he is no longer with the company.   After releasing customer data, hackers last week dumped a second, 30-gigabyte data archive of Mr. Biderman's emails. Among the emails posted was a 2012 exchange with Raja Bhatia, who was the company's technology officer then but who has since departed, in which Mr. Bhatia said he had exploited a security hole in a competitor's website, nerve.com, that allowed him to download and potentially manipulate the site's user data. Emails show that Avid Life Media planned to offer $20 million to acquire nerve.com and flirt.com, a second website, but ultimately decided against the acquisition.   Mr. Bhatia's emails now seem prescient. ''There will be an eventual security crisis amongst one of your properties and the media will leap on it as they always do,'' he wrote in one leaked email.   Prosecutors could use information from the leaked emails to charge Avid Life Media's executives under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes it a crime to enter computers or take information from them without authorization, Mr. Zwillinger said. The operators of nerve.com and flirt.com could also sue for civil penalties, he said.   And then there are the class-action suits. The hackers accused the company of charging customers a $19 fee to delete their accounts, but the information posted by the hackers show that customers' data still lingered on the site. That could constitute breach of contract, said Randy V. Sabett, special counsel at the law firm Cooley in Washington.   At least four lawsuits have already been filed in the United States against Avid Life Media. In Canada, two law firms have filed a class-action suit against the company on behalf of a Canadian widower who is suing the company for $578 million. He said he briefly joined the site after his wife died of breast cancer.   Mr. Ponemon said his firm had found that the cost of mega-breaches now averages $23 to $25 per exposed record, which includes the costs of lawsuits. That means the cost of Avid Life Media's breach could rise as high as $850 million.   But in this case, ''The reputation effect alone is going to kill the company,'' Mr. Ponemon said. ''Their whole model is based on secrecy and the privacy of the individuals participating in this service. The reputational damage will be very difficult to overcome.''   The company said it was working with international law enforcement agencies to investigate the data breach, which Canadian police have also linked to two suicides.   Last week, Mr. Biderman hinted that the company knew who had breached its systems, but few leads have been made public. On Wednesday, Brian Krebs, a well-known security blogger, theorized that a Twitter user who posted a link to Avid Life Media's stolen code before the data leak was made public may at least know who is responsible for the breach.   Police in Toronto, where Avid Life Media is based, have said that employees first learned that their systems had been breached when they arrived at work on July 12 to find a menacing message on their computer screens accompanied by the rock band AC/DC's song ''Thunderstruck.''   Mr. Krebs said he had downloaded five years' worth of posts from the Twitter user and found boasts about web attacks and references to AC/DC's ''Thunderstruck.''    "
Daily Report: China Promises to Work With U.S. to Prevent Cybercrime,"In Seattle, the talk was of cooperation.  In a speech to American business leaders Tuesday night, China's president, Xi Jinping, pledged to work with the United States to prevent cybercrime. Mr. Xi's long-anticipated visit comes over increased tensions over what White House officials say has been a concerted effort by China to attack the computer networks of businesses and government agencies.  ""The Chinese government will not in whatever form engage in commercial theft, and hacking against government networks are crimes that must be punished in accordance with the law and relevant international treaties,"" Mr. Xi said. But in Washington, the talk was all about cybertheft. The Office of Personnel Management said on Wednesday that the hackers who stole a large amount of data from the agency also got the fingerprints of 5.6 million federal employees. Intelligence agencies have attributed the hacking to China. The agency had earlier said that 1.1 million fingerprints were stolen. The fear is that the stolen material could be used to create a reference database of intelligence agents or defense personnel. Even though some financial information was stolen, officials say there is so far no indication that it has been used in any thefts. Mr. Xi is expected to arrive in Washington on Thursday. "
The United Nations Targets Online Harassment,"Recent high-profile cases of online bullying and trolling, as well as a growing number of women speaking publicly about what they face online every day, have focused many Americans' attention on the issue of online harassment. Now a new report by a United Nations group makes it clear that online abuse is a global problem, one that threatens women's health, safety and economic participation in developing countries as well as in the United States.  The report, issued on Thursday by the U.N. Broadband Commission for Digital Development's working group on gender, lists six types of online violence against women: harassment, impersonation (for example, sending emails as someone else), surveillance (recording a victim's keystrokes or other behavior), hacking into a victim's accounts to steal information or control a device, using fake profiles or other means to lure someone into a dangerous situation, and sharing or threatening to share private media like nude photos. As Internet access, especially via mobile devices, spreads around the world, so do these forms of violence, the report notes. In many ways, the rise of mobile technology has been a boon to women around the world. They can use mobile devices to get health information in the privacy of their homes, noted Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the executive director of U.N. Women and co-chair of the working group that produced the report, or to operate their own businesses. And Internet access lets women in the developing world use many of the same sites and resources that people in wealthier countries can use. ""It is an equalizer,"" Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka said. But women won't see the full benefits of access if they remain at risk of threats and hate speech every time they use their mobile devices. To mitigate the problem, the report calls for a three-pronged approach combining education and outreach about online harassment, industry safeguards to protect users and enable them to report abuse, and laws to punish those who harm others online. Creating a safer and more equitable Internet won't just be about stopping bad behavior - as the report notes, it's also important to actively promote gender equality and women's participation. The report's authors praise groups like World Pulse that encourage women to speak out online, and call on tech companies to elevate more women to positions of power. Much of the report will be familiar to those who have followed the issue of online harassment, especially those who have suffered it themselves. But it's significant that the United Nations has chosen to take up the issue. One of the U.N.'s sustainable development goals for the next 15 years, the report notes, is gender equality, and that can't be achieved if women aren't safe online. Fighting harassment by an enormous number of often anonymous users across a variety of different platforms won't be easy. But acknowledging it as a serious problem requiring attention at a global scale is, at least, a step. "
Malaysia Arrests a Kosovo Hacker Linked to ISIS,"WASHINGTON --  The Malaysian authorities have arrested a 20-year-old man who the Justice Department said Thursday ran an Internet hacking ring in Kosovo that provided stolen personal information of more than 1,300 American service members to the Islamic State.  In a complaint unsealed in federal court in Northern Virginia on Thursday, the Justice Department alleged that the Kosovar, Ardit Ferizi, hacked into the server of a company based in the United States, stole the personal information and gave it to the Islamic State to use against the service members.     The complaint alleges that Mr. Ferizi gave the information to Junaid Hussain, a former leading member of the CyberCaliphate, an Islamic State unit that broke into the United States Central Command's Twitter and YouTube accounts this year. The Islamic State hoped that its supporters in the United States would use the information to attack service members, the complaint says.    Mr. Hussain was killed in an American drone strike in Syria in August. His unit has been credited with the Islamic State's adept use of social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda, and his activity was increasingly linked to plots carried out far from the battlefields in Syria and Iraq.    The United States is seeking to extradite Mr. Ferizi and charge him with providing material support to the Islamic State, the complaint said.     "
Document Reveals Growth of Cyberwarfare Between the U.S. and Iran,"WASHINGTON --  A newly disclosed National Security Agency document illustrates the striking acceleration of the use of cyberweapons by the United States and Iran against each other, both for spying and sabotage, even as Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart met in Geneva to try to break a stalemate in the talks over Iran's disputed nuclear program. The document, which was written in April 2013 for Gen. Keith B. Alexander, then the director of the National Security Agency, described how Iranian officials had discovered new evidence the year before that the United States was preparing computer surveillance or cyberattacks on their networks.    It detailed how the United States and Britain had worked together to contain the damage from ''Iran's discovery of computer network exploitation tools'' -- the building blocks of cyberweapons. That was more than two years after the Stuxnet worm attack by the United States and Israel severely damaged the computer networks at Tehran's nuclear enrichment plant.    The document, which was first reported this month by The Intercept, an online publication that grew out of the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, did not describe the targets. But for the first time, the surveillance agency acknowledged that its attacks on Iran's nuclear infrastructure, a George W. Bush administration program, kicked off the cycle of retaliation and escalation that has come to mark the computer competition between the United States and Iran.   The document suggested that even while the high-stakes nuclear negotiations played out in Europe, day-to-day hostilities between the United States and Iran had moved decisively into cyberspace.   ''The potential cost of using nuclear weapons was so high that no one felt they could afford to use them,'' said David J. Rothkopf, the author of ''National Insecurity,'' a new study of strategic decisions made by several American administrations. But the cost of using cyberweapons is seemingly so low, Mr. Rothkopf said, that ''we seem to feel we can't afford not to use them'' and that ''many may feel they can't afford ever to stop.''   The N.S.A.'s new director, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, has declared that his first task is to deter attacks by making it costly for countries like Russia, China and Iran to wage cyberwar. But a former senior intelligence official who looked at the two-page document prepared for General Alexander after it was published 10 days ago said it provided ''more evidence of how far behind we are in figuring out how to deter attacks, and how to retaliate when we figured out who was behind them.''    The document declares that American intercepts of voice or computer communications showed that three waves of attacks against American banks that began in August 2012 were launched by Iran ''in retaliation to Western activities against Iran's nuclear sector,'' and added that ''senior officials in the Iranian government are aware of these attacks.''    The main targets were the websites of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. By 2015 standards, those were relatively unsophisticated ''denial of service'' strikes that flooded the banks with data, so overloading them it was impossible for a time for customers to access their accounts. American officials -- with the exception of then-Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who was the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security committee -- never publicly identified Iran as the culprit, though it was widely reported as the prime suspect.   More recently, the Obama administration, in an effort to deter attacks, has grown less reticent about naming countries that the administration believes are responsible for such attacks. In May, five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were indicted on a charge of stealing intellectual property from American companies. And in December, President Obama said he had evidence that North Korea's leadership was behind an attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, though he did not provide details. The New York Times later reported that the N.S.A. had gathered the evidence from implants that it had placed in North Korean computers beginning in 2010.    But just as American officials woke up to North Korea's abilities last year, the newly disclosed document makes clear that by early 2012, American officials were increasingly alarmed by the successes of Iran's new ''cybercorps.''    The background briefing for General Alexander, who is now running his own cyberdefense firm, said flatly that Iran was responsible for the ''destructive cyberattack against Saudi Aramco in August 2012, during which data was destroyed on tens of thousands of computers,'' an attack that appeared to pave the way for a technically similar strike on Sony last year. The N.S.A. document suggests that the attack on Saudi Aramco was in response to ''a similar cyberattack'' against Iran's oil industry earlier that year; it did not indicate who launched that attack.    The document refers to a major program at the N.S.A. to prepare for traditional or cyberwar ''contingencies'' with Iran, including a ''planned battle rhythm'' that would allow it to feed data to the White House and the military's commands. That is fairly standard planning, but the document underscored that the plans depended on ''both our access and Iran's capabilities,'' meaning that there is a constant reassessment of how deeply the N.S.A. and its military partner, United States Cyber Command, have penetrated Iranian systems.   The core of the document urges General Alexander to tell his counterpart at the Government Communications Headquarters that the two organizations have ''worked multiple high-priority surges'' against Tehran. GCHQ, as it is known, is the British intelligence agency that is famous for breaking Germany's Enigma codes, recently portrayed in the movie ''The Imitation Game.''   But it hints at discord. GCHQ wanted to set up ''a trilateral arrangement to prosecute the Iranian target,'' the memo said. But the United States ''has been opposed to such a blanket arrangement,'' the document said, and hints that both the N.S.A. and GCHQ ''have agreed to continue to share information gleaned from the respective bilateral relationships'' with Israel's Unit 8200, also known as the Israeli Sigint National Unit. ''Sigint'' stands for ''signals intelligence.''    The relationship between the N.S.A. and its Israeli counterpart has always been testy. Both American and Israeli intelligence agencies spy on each other, even while working together. The joint development of Olympic Games was their proudest moment of collaboration, but it was also marked by disagreements about how, and how vigorously, to press cyberattacks on Iran.    "
Attack on GitHub Appears to Have Ended,"One of the world's great coding libraries is safe, for now. As of Tuesday, GitHub, a site that hosts code for programmers, said that a major attack that seemed to come from the Chinese government had subsided.  For the last week, GitHub had been overwhelmed by traffic that security experts said originated from China's Great Firewall. The attack marked a change in the behavior of the filters that block Chinese from viewing foreign websites deemed sensitive or destabilizing.  Instead of simply blocking sites, the Great Firewall began redirecting traffic heading for China, and beaming it at GitHub with the intention of overloading it. Known as a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), the attack specifically targeted sites hosted by GitHub that hosted links to sites blocked in China, including The New York Times.  Though it's unclear why the attacks stopped, the change in tack came just a day before President Obama authorized financial sanctions against malicious overseas hackers and companies that knowingly benefit from cyber-espionage.  Analysts said the attack marked a dangerous change in strategy, that threatens free speech online. Instead of simply blocking traffic entering China, the new approach aggressively goes after sites outside of China's borders deemed objectionable by Beijing.  Long in the works, the new policy move by President Obama was unlikely designed to address attacks like the one on GitHub. Nonetheless, the attacks could prove a new issue in an already fractious relationship between the United States and China over cyberattacks.  "
"When Computers Go Down, It's Not Always a Hack","In the immediate aftermath of terrorist attacks like the 2011 massacre in Oslo and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, many people mistakenly jump to the conclusion that the perpetrators are Islamic fundamentalists. Increasingly, something similar seems to be happening with technical failures: If an important computer system goes down somewhere, many people suspect that it was the result of a hacking attack that originated in China, Russia or North Korea.  This tendency was apparent earlier today after a series of high-profile computer problems temporarily disrupted United Airlines flights, trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the home page of The Wall Street Journal. Speculation that the three events might have been related and were caused by a cyber attack was rife online and even prompted unnamed federal officials to tell reporters that there was no evidence to suggest malicious activity. It is only natural that people jump to conclusions about the causes of computer failures, just as they do with terrorist attacks. After all, hackers have successfully broken into and stolen information from businesses like Sony and Target and government agencies like the Office of Personnel Management and the White House. But it bears repeating that our assumptions can be quite flawed, especially when they are based on a series of random observations. A recent tally by New America, a research organization, found that white supremacists, anti-government fanatics and other non-Muslim extremists carried out most of the lethal attacks in the 14 years since Al Qaeda attacked the United States in 2001. In the digital world, hacking certainly is a big problem. But large computer systems used by businesses, governments, universities and other organizations fail all the time because of programming errors and other technical problems. In fact, hackers often get access to computer networks through such vulnerabilities. If anything, recent technical failures are an important reminder that we are increasingly reliant on systems that can be quite unstable and insecure. "
U.S. and China Seek Arms Deal for Cyberspace,"WASHINGTON --  The United States and China are negotiating what could become the first arms control accord for cyberspace, embracing a commitment by each country that it will not be the first to use cyberweapons to cripple the other's critical infrastructure during peacetime, according to officials involved in the talks. While such an agreement could address attacks on power stations, banking systems, cellphone networks and hospitals, it would not, at least in its first version, protect against most of the attacks that China has been accused of conducting in the United States, including the widespread poaching of intellectual property and the theft of millions of government employees' personal data.    The negotiations have been conducted with urgency in recent weeks, with a goal to announce an agreement when President Xi Jinping of China arrives in Washington for a state visit on Thursday. President Obama hinted at the negotiations on Wednesday, when he told the Business Roundtable that the rising number of cyberattacks would ''probably be one of the biggest topics'' of the summit meeting, and that his goal was to see ''if we and the Chinese are able to coalesce around a process for negotiations'' that would ultimately ''bring a lot of other countries along.''    But a senior administration official involved in the discussions cautioned that an initial statement between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi may not contain ''a specific, detailed mention'' of a prohibition on attacking critical infrastructure. Rather, it would be a more ''generic embrace'' of a code of conduct adopted recently by a working group at the United Nations.    One of the key principles of the United Nations document on principles for cyberspace is that no state should allow activity ''that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public.'' The goal of the American negotiators is to have Chinese leaders embrace the principles of the United Nations code of conduct in a bilateral agreement with Washington.   But it seems unlikely that any deal coming out of the talks would directly address the most urgent problems with cyberattacks of Chinese origin, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe continuing negotiations.    Most of those attacks have focused on espionage and theft of intellectual property. The rules under discussion would have done nothing to stop the theft of 22 million personal security files from the Office of Personnel Management, which the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., recently told Congress did not constitute an ''attack'' because it was intelligence collection -- something the United States does, too.    The agreement being negotiated would also not appear to cover the use of tools to steal intellectual property, as the Chinese military does often to bolster state-owned industries, according to an indictment of five officers of the People's Liberation Army last year. And it is not clear that the rules would prohibit the kind of attack carried out last year against Sony Pictures Entertainment, for which the United States blamed North Korea. That attack melted down about 70 percent of Sony's computer systems.    Sony is not, by most definitions, part of the nation's ''critical infrastructure,'' although the Department of Homeland Security does include ''movie studios'' on its list of critical ''commercial facilities,'' along with stadiums, museums and convention centers.    Still, any agreement to limit cyberattacks in peacetime would be a start. ''It would be the first time that cyber is treated as a military capability that needs to be governed as nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are,'' said Vikram Singh, a former Pentagon and State Department official who is now vice president for international security at the Center for American Progress.    Within the Obama administration, the effort to design ''a set of norms of behavior'' to limit cyberattacks has been compared to President John F. Kennedy's first major nuclear treaty with the Soviet Union in 1963, which banned atmospheric nuclear tests. That accord did not stop the development of nuclear weapons or even halt underground tests, which continued for decades. But it was a first effort to prevent an environmental disaster, just as this would be a first effort by the world's two biggest economic powers to prevent the most catastrophic use of cyberweapons.    Joseph S. Nye, a Harvard professor known for his studies of American power, said the concept of a ''no first use'' doctrine for cyberattacks had been ''gestating for some time'' in a variety of international forums. ''It could create some self-restraint,'' Mr. Nye said, but he added that the problem was, ''how do you verify it, and what is its value if it can't be verified?''   That problem goes to the heart of why arms control agreements in the cyberspace arena are so much more complicated than better-known agreements covering nuclear weapons.    In the Cold War and still today, nuclear arms remain in the hands of states, meaning they can usually be counted and their movements observed. Cyberweapons, too, are often developed by countries -- the United States, Russia, China and Iran are among the most sophisticated -- but they can also be found in the hands of criminal groups and teenagers, neither of which negotiate treaties.   Moreover, it was usually clear where a conventional attack had originated; the trajectory of a missile could be tracked by radar or satellite. Mr. Obama himself noted last week the difficulty of tracing a cyberattack, and thus of deterring it -- or retaliating with confidence.   Earlier efforts to get Mr. Xi and other senior Chinese leaders to address cyberattacks have largely failed. Mr. Obama spent a considerable amount of time on the issue during a summit meeting with Mr. Xi at Sunnylands, a California estate, in 2013. But even after that session, the Chinese denied that their military was involved in attacks, and portrayed themselves as victims of attacks from the United States.    It was not an entirely spurious claim: Classified documents released by Edward J. Snowden showed a complex effort by the National Security Agency to get into the systems of a Chinese telecommunications giant, Huawei, though the United States maintained that the effort was for national security surveillance, not for the theft of intellectual property.    The recent Chinese movement on cybersecurity can be traced to several events, officials say.    The Office of Personnel Management breach, which went undetected for roughly a year, was traced to Chinese sources, and one official said evidence had been presented to Chinese officials. In August, Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, took a trip to Beijing to meet with Mr. Xi and other officials, and used it to increase pressure on China, suggesting that newly devised economic sanctions could be imposed. Mr. Obama referred to that possibility in two recent speeches, suggesting that he would hold off only if there was progress with Mr. Xi.   Last week, a high-level Communist Party envoy, Meng Jianzhu, who is responsible for state security, came to Washington and met with Ms. Rice, several American intelligence officials and the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey. That session focused on coming up with some kind of agreement, however vaguely worded, that Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi could announce on Friday.    For the United States, agreements limiting cyberweapons are also problematic. The country is spending billions of dollars on new generations of weapons, and in at least one famous case, the cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear enrichment site at Natanz, it has used them.   American cyberwarriors would be concerned about any rules that limited their ability in peacetime to place ''beacons'' or ''implants'' in foreign computer networks; these are pieces of code that monitor how foreign computer systems work, and they can be vital in determining how to launch a covert or wartime attack. The Chinese have littered American networks with similar technology, often to the consternation of the Pentagon and intelligence agencies.    ''One of the things to look for are any rules that bar 'preparing the battlefield,' '' said Robert K. Knake, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked in the White House cybersecurity office earlier in the Obama administration.   Mr. Obama, who has said little about the United States' development of cyberweapons during his presidency, has begun to talk about it in recent days. ''If we wanted to go on offense, a whole bunch of countries would have some significant problems,'' he told the Business Roundtable on Wednesday.    "
Report Stresses Importance of Agreement to Avoid Cyber Conflict,"As China president Xi Jinping begins a trip to the United States that could include the first arms control accord for cyberspace between the United States and China, a new RAND report that rates the cyber warfare capabilities of the world's two largest economies shows how important such an agreement could be.  The report, which rates the capabilities of both militaries over the course of two situations, a conflict over Taiwan and one over the Spratly Islands, dedicates an entire chapter to the respective cyber capabilities of both sides.  As it maps out the potential conflicts, and in turn the potential ways each country could attack the other's network, it becomes apparent why a first agreement between President Obama and Mr. Xi might focus on the rules of the road for attacks on core infrastructure instead of on better publicized Chinese attacks aimed at gaining advantages and intellectual property for companies. In particular, it argues unclassified networks for key infrastructure are more vulnerable than those of the military, and that broad attacks have a huge potential to cause unanticipated escalations. Even so, it says that the United States would probably do better than might be expected given the high-profile media coverage of Chinese cyberattacks.  The Chinese military ""has been heavily involved in large-scale cyber espionage since the mid-2000s, which has made it the subject of much media attention. Because the most common targets of these attacks have been lightly defended corporate and unclassified government systems, this activity may have created an exaggerated sense of the capabilities that China might bring to bear in an operational military context,"" it concludes.  Still, it adds that China's cyberattack capabilities have continued to improve, and judges that it has gained ground on the United States in recent years, downgrading the country from having a ""major advantage"" to having simply an ""advantage"" as of 2010.  Citing a 2013 document distributed throughout China's People's Liberation Army called ""The Science of Military Strategy,"" the report adds that the Chinese army recognizes the major advantages to being aggressive in cyberwar.  One danger of that, and also more broadly of employing cyberattacks in a situation of escalating conflict, is that of unintentional escalation. Using several hypothetical situations, the report shows how a cyberattack could deepen a conflict. For example, it points out that if China were to make a move for Taiwan, a cyberattack aimed at hurting the potential for the United States to intercede, could contradictorily force the U.S. to come into the conflict. Likewise it argues that in the case of some kind of regional conflict, United States attacks on Chinese infrastructure that in peace-time would be deemed mainly of civilian importance could take on deeper military implications. ""Weighed against their likely impact, cyber attacks against dual-use targets raise escalatory concerns. To be sure, this is true of many other forms of warfare, but there is particular danger in cyberwar, with its inchoate rules of engagement, lack of international consensus on the legitimacy of different types of targets, and lack of meaningful experience to underpin the understanding of collateral effects,"" the authors write in the report.  Even so, there are plenty of reasons that China and the U.S. would be unlikely to carry out a major attack aimed broadly at civilian populations. In particular, the report points out that close economic relations could mean an unintentional business fallout at home while the interconnectedness of the Internet makes the effects of broad attacks unpredictable (for example, Chinese data stored abroad could be inadvertently disrupted). Also likely to be on the front of Beijing's mind, the report argues, are a few larger concerns. In particular, during wartime issues surrounding control of potentially destabilizing information within China and tracking of dissident activity are also likely to ""loom large.""  Another issue, according to the report, is the fact that a huge proportion of China's computers run pirated versions of Windows that are likely to be vulnerable to attacks. Adding to that concern is overwhelming dominance by American companies in software. Many in the Chinese government believe ""that the United States has the ability to corrupt or disrupt the functioning of any device with U.S.-made software. Their appetite for a full-fledged cyberwar may be proportionately limited, and their receptivity to U.S. hints that it could unleash such a cyberwar itself may be heightened,"" the report added. Even if the United States continues to have an advantage, the uncertainties that come with a cyber confrontation are high, in particular if either side would resort to ""strategic cyberwarfare,"" a term it uses to describe broad attacks designed to impact the opposition's will to fight.  ""In view of the potential for escalation, it is uncertain whether either side will resort to strategic cyberwarfare,"" the report said. ""If they do, results may be highly unpredictable. The outcome will depend not only on each side's competence but also on chance factors (e.g., cascading affects), the defensive posture and resiliency of each side's organizations and infrastructure, how each side's public reacts, how political leaders factor public opinion into their strategic calculus, and whether and how one side or the other escalates as a result."" "
Online Attacks on Infrastructure Are Increasing at a Worrying Pace,"SAN FRANCISCO  - Over the last four years, foreign hackers have stolen source code and blueprints to the oil and water pipelines and power grid of the United States and have infiltrated the Department of Energy's networks 150 times. So what's stopping them from shutting us down? The phrase ""cyber-Pearl Harbor"" first appeared in the 1990s. For the last 20 years, policy makers have predicted catastrophic situations in which hackers blow up oil pipelines, contaminate the water supply, open the nation's floodgates and send airplanes on collision courses by hacking air traffic control systems. ""They could, for example, derail passenger trains or, even more dangerous, derail trains loaded with lethal chemicals,"" former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned in 2012. ""They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.""  It is getting harder to write off such predictions as fearmongering. The number of attacks against industrial control systems more than doubled to 675,186 in January 2014 from 163,228 in January 2013, according to Dell Security - most of those in the United States, Britain and Finland. And in many cases, outages at airports and financial exchanges - like a computer outage that took down computers at airports across the country late Wednesday, including Kennedy International Airport in New York and Logan Airport in Boston - are never tied to hacks. But it's clear hackers are trying.  The Department of Homeland Security last year announced that it was investigating an attack against 1,000 energy companies across Europe and North America. In 2012, 23 gas pipeline companies were hacked by online spies, according to a Homeland Security report. Private investigators later linked the attack to China. Last year, in a disclosure overshadowed by the news of the attack on Sony, a German federal agency said that in an attack at an unnamed steel mill, hackers had managed to jump from the company's corporate network to its production systems, causing significant damage to a blast furnace. And in an extensive attack at Telvent, an information technology and industrial automation company now owned by Schneider Electric, Chinese hackers made off with its product source code and blueprints to facilities operated by its customers, which include 60 percent of the pipeline operators in North America. For now, dire predictions of destructive online attacks on American targets ignore the fact that the actors with the ability to cause the gravest harm to America's critical infrastructure - China and Russia and allies like Israel and Britain - are sufficiently deterred from doing so by fear of retaliation or because of longstanding trade and diplomatic relationships. And attacks by those aggressively trying to get such a capability - Iran, North Korea and Islamic militant groups - are still several years off. ""Despite all the talks of a cyber-Pearl Harbor, I am not really worried about a state competitor like China doing catastrophic damage to infrastructure,"" said Michael V. Hayden, former head of the National Security Agency. ""It's the attack from renegade, lower-tier nation-states that have nothing to lose."" Just how far off are they? That is the question troubling policy makers at the National Security Council and intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Federal officials have repeatedly warned that Islamic State militants have been exploiting social media for recruitment, and are developing tools to break into their enemies' systems. Those capabilities were sufficient to prompt the assassination of Junaid Hussain, the chief of the Islamic State's cyberarmy, who was killed by an airstrike in Syria in August. But for now, federal officials say, the Islamic State does not have a significant ability to cause damage through online attacks. ""It's not easy to pull off a spectacular attack,"" said James A. Lewis, a security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""People are always saying in theory they can do something, but it's not at the level of a Pearl Harbor or a 9/11."" Mr. Lewis added: ""Could someone acquire the ability to cause a blackout? That's something to worry about, but the only people who could pull it off don't have any interest in doing so."" Most security experts point to the attacks last year at Sony - where hackers leaked internal documents and destroyed the company's servers - as an example of the destruction that is possible now, and a harbinger of what may come. There were warnings the year before the Sony hacking that such an incident was possible. In a carefully planned attack in 2013, North Korean hackers knocked out almost 50,000 computers and servers for several days at South Korean banks and media companies. Less sophisticated attackers are more likely to continue to pursue social media campaigns and isolated attacks, rather than take down parts of the power grid, said Ralph Langner, an independent security expert who was the first to attribute Stuxnet, a virtual weapon used against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, to the United States and Israel. But the attacks that have rattled American government officials the most were similar attacks at Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, and RasGas, the Qatari oil giant, in 2012. At Aramco, the hackers replaced the data on employees' hard drives with an image of a burning American flag. United States intelligence officials say Aramco's attackers were hackers in Iran, although they offered no specific evidence to support the claim. Mr. Panetta, then secretary of defense, called the Aramco sabotage ""a significant escalation of the cyberthreat."" Forensics specialists who were called in to analyze the Aramco attack said there was evidence the attackers probed the network that connects the company's pipelines but were never able to cross from Aramco's corporate network to its production systems. The same was true for a similar attack at RasGas two weeks later. Hackers tried and failed to hit the Qatari petroleum company's production systems, but successfully took its corporate networks and servers offline. But the attack on the German steel mill, disclosed last year, suggests that hackers are increasingly finding ways to cross that threshold. Just last week, it was announced that a group of hackers penetrated the Snohomish County Public Utility District in Washington State. The hackers, members of the Washington State National Guard, had been invited to test the utility's defenses, and the results were frightening. They were able to break in with an email in under 22 minutes. Joe Weiss, a crusader for industrial control security and founder of Applied Control Solutions, a consulting firm, is not surprised. He manages a database of 750 incidents that affected control systems and said he was most disturbed that most of them were not classified as attacks at all. ""What that tells you is that not only do we not have the mitigation, we don't even have any type of adequate forensics to know this is happening, and whether it was intentional or unintentional,"" he said. The Department of Homeland Security tweeted late Wednesday evening that the computer outages at airports were due to a ""brief outage that lasted 90 minutes"" on the United States Customs and Border Protection's computer processing systems. But Mr. Weiss said in most cases, forensics investigations were still not adequate enough to nail down the real source of such incidents. He said the same was true across the electric, water, oil, gas, and nuclear industries.  ""It's not like with weapons, where you know where it's coming from,"" Mr. Weiss said. ""With cyber- and control systems, you don't necessarily know."" ""Will there be a cyber-Pearl Harbor? Most likely,"" Mr. Weiss added. ""Will we know it's cyber? Most likely not."" "
"National Borders Dissolve, for Work and for Movies","Rod Drury, an entrepreneur in Auckland, New Zealand, regularly visits the United States. Sometimes there are multiple visits a day. ''People here can't get Netflix, so they get a VPN that gives them a U.S. I.P. address, and watch Netflix like they're in America,'' he said. ''If I want something off iTunes, I buy U.S. cards online.''    Decoding the jargon: Millions of people around the world now pay for virtual private computer networks -- a security method that uses encryption to hide Internet traffic -- and similar services to hook into a server in the United States. As far as the video and retail services can tell, Mr. Drury is one more American customer.    If the Internet breaks down national boundaries, it may happen from the comfort of our couches. VPNs were originally thought of as a way for companies to guarantee security or dissidents to avoid the prying eyes of their governments. Now they are part of a larger movement for people to work and play anywhere on the planet, at all times.   And if the software can't come to consumers, the customers use VPN to get to the software.   ''Unblock geo-restricted websites and web services like Netflix, Hulu, BBC iPlayer, Skype, and many more!'' says the webpage of PureVPN, which charges $45 a year to turn you into a virtual American. You might prefer being Canadian, since Netflix Canada has a bigger selection of films.   Unblock-us, a service Mr. Drury uses that is similar to a VPN, charges $50 annually. It offers easy access to scores of movie, television and sports videos that collectively would probably be impossible to obtain in most countries.   Uzair Gadit, the co-founder and director of PureVPN, says his company provides services to people in 90 countries who want to go virtually overseas unhindered.   Online gamers use PureVPN to avoid service slowdowns with local Internet providers, as well as cyberattacks by rival gamers. Online retailers in many countries, Mr. Gadit says, need a stealthy way to collect prices from Amazon, eBay and others, to make sure they are competitive. Globally, he figures, perhaps 20 million consumers use VPNs and similar services to reach more than 300 channels that are geographically blocked in some way.   ''You might be amazed how much people want to watch stuff,'' Mr. Gadit said. ''We had 100 percent growth for each of the last three years, and we're expecting that again this year. We hear Apple is creating a Netflix-like service -- that's great news for us.''   PureVPN is in Hong Kong, an odd place for a company that also keeps people invisible to state spies. ''China only spies on its own people,'' Mr. Gadit said. ''Most of the world worries about the U.S., the U.K., Australia and New Zealand -- they spy on everybody.''   Netflix's terms of service forbid customers from circumventing regional barriers to its content, though the company is aware this is not universally respected. ''There's not a lot we can do to track that since VPNs by their very nature are set up to be difficult to spot,'' Cliff Edwards, a Netflix spokesman, said in an email. Netflix also plans to offer service in New Zealand next month.   What drives this enthusiasm for VPNs, it could be argued, is the way media companies are not providing entertainment fast enough in a world where everyone can be hip to the newest movie and television show. New Zealand movie theaters are now showing ''Dumb and Dumber To,'' which was on screens in the United States in November.   ''There is a mismatch between the perception that you get what you want over the Internet and distribution doesn't matter anymore, and a copyright holder selling things by territory,'' said Tim Wu, a professor of media and copyright at Columbia Law School.   ''The industry is depending on 95 percent of the population thinking the technology is too complex for them to use,'' he said. ''If there is a simple device that does this for consumers, entertainment's easy assumption of territoriality will change.''   While it is diverting to consider what these copyright-beating services mean to entertainment, the end of borders and regions because of global networks has significant implications for the workplace.   Mr. Drury is founder and chief executive of Xero, which makes cloud-based accounting software. He has customers in 150 countries, 2014 revenue of $100 million and 1,100 employees spread over four nations. A substantial amount of Xero's revenue comes from accountants who make a living by doing the books of companies in countries on the other side of the world.   Xero built a basic accounting software model, then adapted it to a country's local accounting quirks. It relies on back-end computing that does not need to be near the work.   Elsewhere, individuals who toiled online via freelance sites like Elance and ODesk did $67 million worth of work outside their country of residence in January. That was an increase of more than 50 percent in two years. On the Indonesian island of Bali, a tropical paradise popular with foreigners, 100,000 online freelancers are registered with Elance and ODesk, which operate jointly.   ''Tech is globalizing everything, so anyone building just a regional strategy isn't thinking big enough,'' Mr. Drury said.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Morgan Stanley Fires Employee, Saying Data on 350,000 Clients Was Stolen","Morgan Stanley said it had fired an employee who stole data on 350,000 of the bank's clients.  The bank reported the case to authorities after discovering account names, numbers and transaction data for over 900 clients on the Internet. It first discovered the problem on Dec. 27 and alerted law enforcement officials, who have started an investigation, according to a person briefed on the matter. Over all, the bank said it believed that the employee illegally took information on 10 percent of the 3.5 million customers of Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm.  Morgan Stanley said it had not found any evidence that the data breach had resulted in any losses to customers. The bank said that passwords or Social Security numbers were not revealed. ""Morgan Stanley takes extremely seriously its responsibility to safeguard client data, and is working with the appropriate authorities to conduct and conclude a thorough investigation of this incident,"" the bank said in a statement. Wealth management has become an increasingly important part of Morgan Stanley's business since the financial crisis, as the bank has de-emphasized riskier trading.  The bank's stock was down more than 3 percent in early afternoon trading on Monday.  "
A Hacking Epidemic That Hits Few Consumers in the Wallet,"At Target, 40 million customers had their credit card information exposed to hackers. At JPMorgan Chase, personal details associated with 80 million accounts were leaked. Last month, a hacker gained access to 4.5 million records from the University of California, Los Angeles, health system. Enormous numbers like these can make it feel as if we're living through an epidemic of data breaches, in which no one's bank account or credit card is safe. But the actual effect on consumers is quite different from what the headlines suggest. Only a tiny number of people exposed by leaks end up paying any costs, and for the rare victims who do, the average cost has actually been falling steadily.     How could that be? For starters, several laws protect consumers from bearing almost any financial losses related to hackers (though not the headaches of having to enter new credit card numbers into Amazon and elsewhere). Instead, banks and merchants, like Target, must bear the cost. But even their losses have been dropping in recent years, as data security experts have learned new strategies to prevent intrusions from turning into theft.   ''The bad guys are getting good,'' said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report, a data provider for the card industry, ''and the good guys are getting even better.''   It's true that data breaches, particularly those in which Social Security numbers are compromised, can lead to a more devastating sort of identity theft, in which criminals open new financial accounts in a person's name and do damage that can take years and a lot of work to clean up. But consumers are almost never on the hook for financial losses in these sorts of episodes, which, by the way, have also been on the decline.   This relatively sanguine picture of the impact of data breaches is an example of a threat that looks worse than it turns out to be. The sheer size of hackings shocks and startles when the attacks are first reported, but it's rare that journalists check on the actual consequences.   Moreover, consumer fears can be stoked by the incentives of the people providing the data. Many of the statistics on identity fraud and online attacks come from security firms that want more people to buy their services. It's not so different from the soap company that advertises how many different types of bacteria are on a subway pole without mentioning how unlikely it is that any of those bacteria would make you sick.   One of the most memorable statistics on identity fraud comes from advertisements that say a new victim is created every two seconds. That figure, which comes from Javelin Strategy and Research, is largely attributable to standard credit card fraud, in which criminals use a stolen credit card number to buy goods -- not the sort of thing most people imagine when they think of identity fraud. The more troubling identity theft, in which new accounts are opened in an unsuspecting person's name, make up only 5 percent of the total figure given by Javelin.   These statistics do not mean that data security is not a real issue for authorities and consumers to think about. Even if the hackers don't use your credit cards, there are instances in which leaked data of other kinds can be damaging in itself, as was clear in the recent episodes at Sony Pictures and Ashley Madison, the website that connects prospective adulterers. There are also serious geopolitical concerns about foreign hackers compromising national security if they get a hold of military maps or staff lists from the C.I.A.   For the companies and banks that bear the cost of stolen credit card numbers, the expenses are very real. Criminals racked up $7.8 billion in fraudulent purchases last year, with banks paying 62 percent of that amount and merchants the rest, according to The Nilson Report.   The banks, though, have managed to curtail their costs as they have devised new methods to detect fraudulent purchases. The most prevalent strategy involves looking for patterns in card purchases, but some banks have even taken to buying stolen cards on the black market to identify breaches, security experts say.   In the aftermath of the Target breach, in late 2013, the American Bankers Association said that the biggest expense for the banks was not the fraud but rather the cost of reissuing the cards and dealing with concerned customers.   For JPMorgan, the costs after the 2014 intrusion were much more limited because the attackers took only email addresses and phone numbers, the type of information that is not hard to attain through other, legal channels.   Consumer advocates generally say that the most important thing to pay attention to after a data breach is the type of information stolen. Karen Barney, a program director at the Identity Theft Resource Center, said that to commit true identity theft, hackers generally need to get a hold of Social Security numbers.   ''Social Security numbers are the be-all and end-all for successful attempts at identity theft,'' Ms. Barney said.   While those nine-digit identifiers weren't made vulnerable in any of the big data leaks at retailers, they were exposed in this month's intrusion at U.C.L.A.'s health system and in the recent break-in at the federal government's Office of Personnel Management.   To prevent fraud in the first place, banks are currently introducing cards with so-called E.M.V. chips, which make counterfeiting cards -- currently the most prevalent sort of fraud -- much more difficult.   Though serious identity theft has been on the decline in recent years, many security experts are expecting that to change as dedicated criminals, whose easy counterfeiting is foiled by E.M.V. chips, start to focus on getting Social Security numbers and other data that enables them to open new accounts, said Mr. Robertson, of The Nilson Report.   ''For the bad guys, your five-year growth plan is not data breaches and stealing credit cards,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''It involves stealing all the info you can and opening legitimate accounts in people's names.''   Ultimately, the problem will still require businesses, and individuals, to stop the thefts from happening in the first place.

Preparing for Disaster: When Your Phone Is Gone,"Smartphones increasingly hold our lives - our contacts, messages, credit card data, health care information and the controls to our smart homes - within their sleek metallic finishes. So when we lose the devices, it's a problem.  Smart software means we can track, recover and - if it's clear the devices are gone for good - wipe the smartphones clean so that no one can steal the data.  My iPhone was stolen recently at a neighborhood bar. But with a few taps on a friend's laptop, I wiped the phone's data. Then I began saving up for a new device. Here is a primer on how to track and disable your smartphone if it goes missing.  1. FIRST, go into settings to enable the phone to back up your data and send you its location. If you have an iPhone, go to settings and tap iCoud. Turn on iCloud Backup, Find My iPhone and Send Last Location.  2. IF YOUR DEVICE GOES MISSING, you can then sign into iCloud.com or use the Find My iPhone app to see your device on a map, lock the device and place a message on the home screen with a contact number.  3. IF THE PHONE IS REALLY GONE, you can remotely protect the data by clicking the Erase iPhone button on iCloud or the Find My iPhone App. If you have backed up your phone in iCloud, you should be able to download all your information onto a replacement device.  4. FOR ANDROID PHONES, go into the device's settings and then into security to activate the Android Device manager to track and erase a misplaced phone. If you are logged into your Google account, you can also type ""find my phone"" into a Google search box and see your phone on a map and make it ring, though you can't lock or erase the phone. "
Avoiding Botnets With a Mac,"Avoiding  The Mac Botnet    Q. Is this just a Windows problem, or are there botnets made up of Macs all infested with bot programs? If there is such a thing, how can I protect my Mac from infection?   A. Windows-based PCs are the main targets of the malicious software that loops infected computers into a remote-controlled network called a botnet, but Macs are not immune. Last fall, the iWorm botnet snared more than 18,500 Macs and allowed hackers to remotely download files, relay Internet traffic and perform other tasks.   Apple built several security features into recent versions of OS X, including a malware-detection tool that checks a list of known malicious software and warns you about it; the company quickly updated the list last fall when iWorm was discovered. Apple also issues regular security updates for OS X, so be sure your Mac has the latest updates installed. If you do not have updates set to install automatically, you can manually check and install them as explained at  support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541.    Intego, one of the companies that offers antivirus software for Mac OS X, posted an extensive analysis of the iWorm Botnet on its security blog. All the company's posts on the topic (including how to check for infection) can be found by searching for ''iWorm'' at  www.intego.com/mac-security-blog. Intego, though, is just one of several Mac antivirus companies, and iWorm was just one of the Mac-based botnets.   Viruses and malware aimed at OS X are becoming more common as Macs continue to gain popularity. If you are worried about safety beyond what OS X provides, you can find several third-party security programs in the Mac App Store (under the Mac's Apple menu) or online from major antivirus companies.   Erasing    A Memory Card   Q. I have successfully downloaded photos from my camera to my computer but cannot find a command to delete them from the memory card. How do I remove the pictures?   A. When you import the photos to the computer, the program that copies the images may offer to erase them from the camera's memory card for you once they are safely on your hard drive; you may also see a ''Delete after import'' box to check. (Image Capture or iPhoto on the Mac, or the AutoPlay box that pops on in most versions of Windows can all do this.) Choosing this option removes the photos from the camera's memory card, but make sure everything copied over first.   The memory card is basically a storage device like a USB drive. After you import the pictures to a folder or program, you can also delete them from the card by dragging the files to the trash, as you would with a USB drive.   Your camera's manual should have instructions for deleting photos one at a time or all at once. Most cameras also have a menu command to format the memory card, which, in addition to erasing everything on the card, freshly creates the card's file system and helps its overall performance.   TIP OF THE WEEK Getting directions from your current location to a specific address with the Google Maps mobile app can help you get around in an unfamiliar area. Nevertheless, if you are unsure about which way to go first, you can have the app point you in the right direction.   Once you have entered your destination's address (or marked it with a pin on the map) and tapped the button for directions, tap the compass icon on the right side of the screen. The map then orients itself on the screen so you see it from your current point of view and you can start off going the correct direction. J.D.

Hackers Exploit 'Flash' Vulnerability in Yahoo Ads,"For seven days, hackers used Yahoo's ad network to send malicious bits of code to computers that visit Yahoo's collection of heavily trafficked websites, the company said on Monday.  The attack, which started on July 28, was the latest in a string that have exploited Internet advertising networks, which are designed to reach millions of people online. It also highlighted growing anxiety over a much-used graphics program called Adobe Flash, which has a history of security issues that have irked developers at Silicon Valley companies.  ""Right now, the bad guys are really enjoying this,"" said Jérôme Segura, a security researcher at Malwarebytes, the security company that uncovered the attack. ""Flash for them was a godsend."" The scheme, which Yahoo shut down on Monday, worked like this: A group of hackers bought ads across the Internet giant's sports, news and finance sites. When a computer - in this case, one running Windows - visited a Yahoo site, it downloaded malware code. From there, the malware hunted for an out-of-date version of Adobe Flash, which it could use to commandeer the computer - either holding it for ransom until the hackers were paid off or discreetly directing its browser to websites that paid the hackers for traffic. ""Attacking Yahoo's visitors would be enormously profitable for criminals,"" said Vadim Kotov, a malware researcher at Bromium Labs, a software company, who was not involved with uncovering this attack. ""So it makes sense that you'd see this particular type of attack there."" Attacks on advertising networks have been on the rise, Mr. Kotov and other researchers say. Hackers are able to use the advertising networks themselves, built for targeting specific demographics of Internet users, to find vulnerable machines. While Yahoo acknowledged the attack, the company said that it was not nearly as big as Malwarebytes had portrayed it to be. ""We take all potential security threats seriously,"" a Yahoo spokeswoman said in statement. ""With that said, the scale of the attack was grossly misrepresented in initial media reports, and we continue to investigate the issue."" ""In terms of how many people were served a malicious ad, only Yahoo would really know,"" Mr. Segura said. But he added: ""This is one of the largest attacks we've seen in recent months."" Neither company could say exactly how many people were affected. After news of the attack was revealed, Adobe asked users to update Flash so their computers would no longer be vulnerable. ""The majority of attacks we are seeing are exploiting software installations that are not up-to-date on the latest security updates,"" said Wiebke Lips, a spokeswoman for Adobe. "
Conquering Android's Stagefright Bug,"Conquering  Android's Stagefright    Q. What is this Android bug where your device can get hacked with a message? Is there security software to protect me?   A. The ''Stagefright bug'' was recently discovered by a researcher at the Zimperium security firm, who showed how a vulnerable Android device could be compromised by malicious code embedded in a video sent via Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). According to Zimperium, at least 950 million Android devices were at risk from the Stagefright bug, which affects versions of the software as far back as Android 2.2 (Froyo).   After the Exodus Intelligence research firm found problems with the original update, a patch for the patch was created and should be on the way from Google, Motorola and various wireless carriers. Install any update when you are notified one is ready for your phone or tablet. If you have not been notified about an update, check manually in the system's settings or contact your carrier to ask about Stagefright patches.    Free apps that test your device for vulnerability to the Stagefright bug are also available in the Google Play store. If you want to scan your device with such an app, it is a good idea to get one from a known mobile-security company like Lookout or Zimperium. While these apps do not fix the problem, they can tell whether you have the problem to begin with.   As for security software to protect your device from general threats, several companies offer apps designed to detect and thwart malware on mobile gadgets. Some of the more full-featured security apps include other tools like parental controls, call blockers and message filters. The AV-Test site has a roundup and ratings for current Android security products at www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/mobile-devices.   Stepping Out    With iOS 8   Q.  I now know how to turn off the iOS step counter on an iPhone, but where do I go to see the number of steps I have actually taken?   A. If your iPhone has the fitness-tracking setting enabled, you can see your daily step count in the iOS 8 Health app. The app is part of the system and should be somewhere on your iPhone Home screen; its icon shows a small red heart on a white background. The app works on the iPhone 4s (and later) or a fifth-generation iPod Touch running iOS 8.   Once you find the Health app, tap it open. The first screen you should see is the Dashboard, which displays the step count and other health-related data that the phone has collected on its own -- or through any other medical or fitness-related apps you install and configure to work with Health.   The Dashboard shows a chart of your step count by the day, week, month or year, and provides a daily average. Another chart shows your footwork as measured in the total walking or running distance for the various time periods, as well as the number of flights of stairs you have climbed.

"Hackers Go After Little Fish, Too, While Trawling for Credit Cards","Hackers are going local in their efforts to steal credit card information from United States customers, hitting small businesses with as much frequency as retail giants. Take Eataly, the operator of more than two dozen upscale food halls in New York, Chicago, Italy, Japan and elsewhere. The company disclosed last month that the systems at its store in the Flatiron district of Manhattan had been breached. The hackers unleashed malicious software into its payment processing system that enabled them to potentially steal customer credit card information for several months of this year.    Eataly said the breach affected only customers of its Flatiron food hall, which has seven Italian restaurants and sells imported Italian chocolate for $46 a pound, as well as other items. But the company said the hacking had taken a toll.    ''The disruption to our business, the extent of unanticipated costs and expenses, and the unwelcome frustration and concern caused upon our customers have all been, and continue to be, significant,'' Eataly said in a statement.   The breach at Eataly reflects a trend that security consultants and law enforcement officials have seen for several years: Bent on stealing credit card information, hackers are going after small retailers and restaurants as well as big national chains like Target and Home Depot.   The smaller businesses, which tend to have less sophisticated security defenses, are more vulnerable to hackers seeking to exploit weak spots in the point-of-sale systems used by companies to process credit card payments.   One frustration for the authorities investigating these cases is that many attacks against small companies go unreported because the businesses are not publicly traded and are bound by fewer disclosure requirements.   Still, half of 675 small businesses surveyed by the National Small Business Association reported being victims of hackers' attacks last year, up from 44 percent in 2013. And of those companies that reported being hacked last year, 68 percent said they had been victimized at least twice.   Many small businesses are lulled into thinking they are immune from hacking because they are too small to draw any attention, security consultants say.   ''Cybercrime traditionally has been more a scattershot approach,'' said Nart Villeneuve, a threat intelligence analyst with the security firm FireEye. ''But they are going after large and small retailers and restaurants and point-of-sale companies that service them.''   Ari Baranoff, an assistant special agent in charge with the Secret Service's criminal investigative division, said that for the most part the hackers going after retailers, both large and small, are ''Russian-speaking cybercriminals'' who are not in the United States.   Mr. Baranoff said that the Secret Service, which oversees the investigation of many point-of-sale attacks, had found that some criminals test out new disruptive malware programs on smaller businesses before unleashing them on bigger companies.   A recent investigation by FireEye found instances of criminals who operated on the Internet sending thousands of malicious emails to small, lesser-known businesses in the United States -- hotels, restaurants, pizza shops, cafes -- all in an apparent attempt to get unsuspecting employees at those business to download an intrusive malware program that can compromise the logon credentials for point-of-sale systems.   The FireEye investigation found that while many hackers are carrying out such ''spear phishing'' email campaigns broadly, some are aimed specifically at smaller retailers.   The hackers' interest in small businesses illustrates their insatiable appetite for credit card numbers that can either be used by the hackers themselves or sold to others on black-market websites.   In May, Harbortouch, a vendor of point-of-sale systems based in Allentown, Pa., disclosed that some of its merchants had been victims of a malware attack that might have compromised customer credit card information.   Nate Hirshberg, a company spokesman, said the ''malware targeted a small percentage of individual merchant locations that we support.'' He added that ''the threat was eliminated almost two months ago'' and that Harbortouch's network itself was never affected.   The number and identities of Harbortouch's affected merchant customers were not disclosed. Eataly is not a Harbortouch customer.   An indication of hacking's growing threat to small businesses can be seen in increased interest in insurance covering these attacks. Beazley Group, which underwrites such policies, say it has had an increase of roughly 62 percent in requests for quotes for such coverage from businesses with less than $35 million in revenues.   And the attacks come with a growing price tag. Last year, the average hacking cost the typical small business $20,752, up from $8,600 in 2013, said the National Small Business Association.   In the case of Eataly, the company has taken a number of steps to notify its customers and investigate the incident. On May 1, the company bought a legal notice in The New York Times to alert its customers of the breach -- along with posting the same notice on its website. Eataly also hired the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright and a forensic investigator to review the incident. And as retail giants often do when they are hacked, Eataly is offering complimentary identity protection services for any customers who were affected.   Alex Trautman, a lawyer with Norton Rose Fulbright, said Eataly was cooperating with law enforcement agencies investigating the matter. He declined to say who might be responsible for the breach. So far, the investigation has ruled out current or former employees of Eataly as being responsible, Mr. Trautman said.   Eataly, in its statement, said the ''learning curve has been quite steep.'' But it noted that it was now better prepared to deal with any future attempt to hack into its system.    "
A Lineup of Missteps,"Here's this week's grab bag of grammar, style and other lapses, compiled with help from readers and colleagues.  Ten innings later, the pitching matchup between Greinke and Jacob deGrom had not failed to disappoint.  A kind of double negative. Or is it a triple negative, when we wanted a double? In any case, this means the opposite of what we intended: The matchup did not disappoint.  The Thunder, a trawler wanted for illegal fishing, was chased for 110 days and more than 10,000 nautical miles across two seas and three oceans, until it sunk in April.   Use ""sank"" for the simple past tense.  The forces are struggling to maintain a stalemate: an at-least token government presence in the hundreds of district capitals handed over by departing NATO combat troops.  This approach to the modifier is unnatural (and in theory would need another hyphen); make it ""at least a token government presence.""  Along with Joseph Baratta, Bennett J. Goodman and Jonathan D. Gray, Mr. Tosi is among a core of influential young executives at the investment firm that have played a crucial role in transforming the firm from a deal-driven private equity shop to a diversified asset management company.  For people, say ""who have played,"" not ""that have played.""  Yet because of a clerical error in South Carolina and the confusion that caused the federal authorities who examined his record, he was not stopped from his making his purchase.  This sentence is hard to read because the use of ""that"" is ambiguous. We intended it as a demonstrative pronoun, referring to ""error,"" but it could easily be read as a relative pronoun referring to ""confusion."" Rephrase.  Ackquille Pollard, better known as the Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda, has been accused of having his girlfriend smuggle a knife into the prison where he is being held on gang conspiracy and gun charges, and then lying to a grand jury, prosecutors said.  He's at Rikers Island; make it ""jail,"" not ""prison.""  At other times, he talked dispassionately about policy issues, sounding much like he does in plenty of other countries.  Avoid using ""like"" as a conjunction in constructions like this. Make it ""as"" or ""the way.""   The breach, and the hackers complaints about the data policy, was first reported on Sunday by Brian Krebs, a reporter who covers online security.  Despite the commas, this is a compound subject that should have a plural verb, ""were first reported."" (And of course it should be ""hackers' complaints."")   The investigation, and a review of the corrections agency's policies and procedures at Clinton by the office of the state inspector general, Catherine Leahy Scott, is continuing.  Ditto. Make it ""are continuing.""    In 1993 he would lead the majors in strikeouts, with 308, and do so eight more times.  As the sentence is written, the introductory time element, ""In 1993,"" governs the entire sentence, because there is only one subject and a compound predicate. But he would not ""do so eight more times"" in 1993. Supply a second subject to create two separate clauses: ""In 1993, he would lead ... with 308, and he would do so eight more times.""  It was passed in February, signed by Gov. Chris Christie in March, and is scheduled to take effect next year.  For the three elements to be parallel, make it ""was signed.""  One faction that Mr. Segel and the filmmakers are unlikely to ever win over, though, is the David Foster Wallace Literary Trust, Wallace's widow, Karen Green, and his closest editors.  It's unclear how many elements are in this series. Are the widow and the others part of the trust? Rephrase.   The Bible of academic research on how colleges affect students is a book titled, plainly enough, ""How College Affects Students.""  As The Times's stylebook says, ""bible"" should be lowercase in a figurative use like this.  He was also charged with killing someone while obstructing religious freedom, which is eligible for the death penalty.  ""Eligible"" is the wrong word here. Perhaps ""which could carry the death penalty.""  As the Republican Party frets about how Donald Trump could affect it's first presidential debate, each of the 16 presidential campaigns on Wednesday received critical guidelines from Fox News, the cable channel that will host and broadcast the August 6 debate.  Ugh. ""Its,"" of course.  Donald Margulies, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright who wrote the screenplay, said the objections made everyone involved feel badly.  and  Mr. Ponsoldt would not address the trust's grievances, but a person close to him said he had not been aware of them until late in the process and felt terribly about them.  In constructions like this with the verb ""feel,"" we need adjectives, not adverbs. Make it ""feel bad"" and ""felt terrible.""  That was the year Barack Obama became the first African-American president of the United States, and we relaxed.  The reference was to 2008, but Obama did not become president till 2009. We could say ""the year Barack Obama was elected the first ...""  Two prison-based gangs, Familia do Norte (Family of the North) and First Capital Command, have been fighting for supremacy in Manaus' cocaine trade; officials said a faction of Familia do Norte had also been jockeying for power.  Make it ""Manaus's cocaine trade.""  With Cosby, the Charleston, S.C., eulogy with the rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" and the visit with felons in federal prison in Oklahoma to speak up for that unloved constituency, and say ""There but for the grace of God,"" the president who once tread gingerly on race has discovered a more gingery voice.  This long sentence is awfully hard to read. Also, make it ""trod."" "
"After Ashley Madison Hack, Police in Toronto Detail a Global Fallout","Canadian officials are bracing for long-term fallout from the unauthorized release of user data from the adultery website Ashley Madison, they said at a news conference on Monday. Bryce Evans, the acting staff superintendent of the Toronto Police Service, detailed the investigation into hackers' attack last week on Canada-based Avid Life Media, which owns Ashley Madison and Established Men, a website for wealthy men looking to date young women.    Mr. Evans characterized the hack, carried out by a group that calls itself the Impact Team, as ''one of the largest data breaches in the world.'' The 9.7 gigabytes of information released by the hackers included credit card information, names, billing details and home addresses. Mr. Evans said the hacking had already resulted in spinoff crimes, including attempts to extort Ashley Madison users whose identities had been leaked.    (1of2 tweets) Slides presented to media at Toronto Police press conference Aug24 on #AshleyMadisonHack #AMcaseTPS ^sm pic.twitter.com/vb3hQFbMtX -- Toronto Police (@TorontoPolice) August 24, 2015   ''If you would like to prevent me from sharing this dirt with all of your known friends and family (and perhaps even your employers too?) then you need to send exactly 1.05 bitcoins to the following address,'' read one of the threats, asking for about $230.   Mr. Evans also said that the police have received two unconfirmed reports of suicides related to the data breach. Security experts had warned the revelations contained in the breach could lead to suicide and violence.   ''Others might find the thought that their membership of the site -- even if they never met anyone in real life, and never had an affair -- too much to bear,'' Graham Cluley wrote on his security blog last week, ''and there could be genuine casualties as a result. And yes, I mean suicide.''   The warning contrasted with how casually the hackers characterized the breach: ''Embarrassing now, but you'll get over it,'' the group wrote in one general, public warning to those it might have exposed.   Soon after the hack, journalists worked to expose the activity of people who may have used the service.   Well-known conservative personalities were caught in the breach as well. Sam Rader, a religious YouTube user who operates a successful video blog with his wife, Nia, was found to have an account.   ''She has forgiven me for this mistake that I made in opening the account,'' Mr. Rader said of his wife over the weekend. ''I have sought forgiveness from God and he has forgiven me, so I have been completely cleansed of this sin.''   Josh Duggar, the reality TV star who made headlines this summer for admitting that as a teenager he had molested young girls including his sisters, was found to have paid at least $986.76 to use the service, according to Gawker.   ''I have been the biggest hypocrite ever,'' Mr. Duggar said in a statement last week, acknowledging his activity. ''Please pray for my precious wife Anna and our family during this time.''   In the news conference, the police detailed how users were targeted in an attack that began July 12, when employees of Avid Life Media arrived at work. When the employees opened their laptops, they were met with the song ''Thunderstruck'' by AC/DC, and an accompanying message demanding that Avid Life shutter both websites.   ''This event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality,'' the company said in a statement last week. The identities of Established Men users have not been leaked. Avid Life Media is offering a $500,000 award for information leading to the arrest of the people behind the hack, the police said on Monday.   And sites advertising services to allow the public to search the leaked database or to delete profiles are loaded with malware, officials warned.   Speaking directly to the hackers, Superintendent Evans said that Monday's news conference was ''your wake-up call,'' and that law enforcement organizations around the world were working together to stop hackers from engaging in ''reckless and illegal activity.'' The United States Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are involved in the investigation.   ''You just got to understand people, the social impact behind this leak,'' he said. ''We're talking about families, we're talking about their children, we're talking about their wives, we're talking about their male partners. That's going to have impacts on their lives, we now have hate crimes that are a result of this.''    "
U.S. Unseals Indictment in Big Case of Hacking,"Billing it as the largest hacking case ever uncovered, federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Tuesday described a global, multiyear scheme to steal information on 100 million customers of a dozen companies in the United States and use the data to advance stock manipulation activities, illicit online gambling and fraud. Prosecutors said they uncovered the complex scheme in their investigation of a computer hacking last year at JPMorgan Chase that involved the breach of contact information, such as emails, from 83 million customer accounts.     Before long, investigators had uncovered a trail of 75 shell companies and a hacking scheme in which the three defendants used 30 false passports from 17 different countries. The group's activity goes back as far as 2007, and it has reaped ''hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds,'' some of it hidden in Swiss accounts and other bank accounts, prosecutors said.   The data breaches ''were breathtaking in their scope and size,'' said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a news conference on Tuesday. The activity, described as a 21-century twist on tried-and-true criminal activity, unveiled the existence of ''a brave new world of hacking for profit,'' perhaps signaling the next frontier in securities fraud.   The accused -- two Israeli citizens and a United States citizen -- face 23 counts of fraud and other illegal activities, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday that added hacking to manipulation and fraud charges that were filed against the three in July. The charges are the first directly linked to the JPMorgan hack.   Two of the accused, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, remain in custody awaiting extradition from Israel after being arrested in July. A third defendant, Joshua Aaron, the American, is believed to be in Russia. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a ''wanted notice'' for him ''for his alleged involvement in a scheme to hack major American companies in order to acquire customer contact information.''   A separate indictment on Tuesday outlined seven charges against Anthony Murgio, a Florida man previously accused of running an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange. That exchange was owned by Mr. Shalon, whom prosecutors described Tuesday as the founder and leader of the sprawling criminal enterprise.   Lawyers for the four men could not immediately be reached.   Another man facing fraud charges, Yuri Lebedev, has not been charged with hacking. Mr. Bharara said on Tuesday ''there are discussions between the parties.''   Prosecutors charged that the group led by Mr. Shalon hacked seven financial institutions and two newspapers to get contact information with which they could advance their pump-and-dump stock manipulation scheme. They ''took the classic stock fraud scheme and brought it into the cyber age,'' Mr. Bharara said.   Prosecutors said the group was involved in a broad array of activities, including processing payments for illegal pharmaceutical suppliers, running illegal online casinos and owning an unlicensed Bitcoin exchange.   Nearly all the activities ''relied for their success on computer hacking and other cybercrimes,'' prosecutors said on Tuesday.   According to the indictment, the three used a rented computer server based in Egypt to try hacking into customer databases at the brokerage firms TD Ameritrade and Fidelity Investments as well as JPMorgan. The ring also gained access to a computer network at what was called ''Victim 8,'' or Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, containing up to 10 million customer email addresses, prosecutors said.   Separately, federal prosecutors in Atlanta on Tuesday announced charges against Mr. Shalon, Mr. Aaron and an unnamed defendant in the late-2013 attacks on E-Trade Financial Corporation and Scottrade Financial Services, both major online brokers. The 10 charges include aggravated identity theft, computer fraud and wire fraud.   Prosecutors in Atlanta said they had uncovered online chats in which Mr. Shalon and an unnamed hacker discussed their plans to use stolen customer contact information to build their own brokerage database for peddling stocks to investors.   The New York indictment also charges the three men with hacking two software development companies to obtain information to advance their online gambling activities, and they targeted a market intelligence firm to support their card-processing activities.   The men operated at least 12 unlawful Internet casinos and marketed them to customers in the United States through extensive email promotions. The casinos generated ''hundreds of millions of dollars in unlawful income,'' prosecutors said, at least $1 million in profits a month.   JPMorgan confirmed on Tuesday that it was identified as ''Victim 1'' in the superseding indictment.   ''We appreciate the strong partnership with law enforcement in bringing the criminals to justice,'' the bank said in a statement. ''As we did here, we continue to cooperate with law enforcement in fighting cybercrime.''   On Tuesday, E-Trade Financial, based in New York, said it was attacked in late 2013 and found no evidence that sensitive financial information had been compromised. It added that contact information for some 31,000 customers may have been exposed.   ''Security is a top priority, and we focus a significant amount of time and energy to help keep our customers' data and information safe and secure,'' E-Trade said in a statement.   Fidelity, based in Boston, said, ''We have confirmed with the F.B.I. that there is no indication that our customers were affected.''   In a statement, Scottrade said, ''We continue to work closely with the authorities by providing any and all information and resources we can to support their investigation and prosecution of the criminals.'' Scottrade, based in St. Louis, previously said 4.6 million client accounts were targeted.   Dow Jones said in a statement on Tuesday, ''The government's investigation is ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with law enforcement.''    "
Time for a Pause,"You could easily write a book, or, better yet, make a movie about the drama that engulfed Sony Pictures and ''The Interview,'' Sony's own movie about the fictionalized assassination of North Korea's real-life dictator. The whole saga reflects so many of the changes that are roiling and reshaping today's world before we've learned to adjust to them. Think about this: In November 2013, hackers stole 40 million credit and debit card numbers from Target's point-of-sale systems. Beginning in late August 2014, nude photos believed to have been stored by celebrities on Apple's iCloud were spilled onto the sidewalk. Thanksgiving brought us the Sony hack, when, as The Times reported: ''Everything and anything had been taken. Contracts. Salary lists. Film budgets. Medical records. Social Security numbers. Personal emails. Five entire movies.'' And, on Christmas, gaming networks for both the Sony PlayStation and the Microsoft Xbox were shut down by hackers. But rising cybercrime is only part of the story. Every day a public figure is apologizing for something crazy or foul that he or she muttered, uttered, tweeted or shouted that went viral -- including the rantings of an N.B.A. owner in his girlfriend's living room.  What's going on? We're in the midst of a Gutenberg-scale change in how information is generated, stored, shared, protected and turned into products and services. We are seeing individuals become superempowered to challenge governments and corporations. And we are seeing the rise of apps that are putting strangers into intimate proximity in each other's homes (think Airbnb) and into each other's cars (think Uber) and into each other's heads (think Facebook, Twitter and Instagram). Thanks to the integration of networks, smartphones, banks and markets, the world has never been more tightly wired. As they say: ''Lost there, felt here.'' Whispered there, heard here. And it's now hit a tipping point. ''The world is not just rapidly changing; it is being dramatically reshaped,'' Dov Seidman, author of the book ''How'' and C.E.O. of LRN, which advises global businesses on ethics and leadership, argued to me in a recent conversation. ''It operates differently. It's not just interconnected; it's interdependent. More than ever before, we rise and fall together. So few can now so easily and so profoundly affect so many so far away.'' But, he added, ''it's all happened faster than we've reshaped ourselves and developed the necessary norms, behaviors, laws and institutions to adapt.'' The implications for leading and operating are enormous. For starters, our privacy walls are proving no match for the new technologies. ''Now, we're not only getting X-ray vision into the behavior of others,'' said Seidman. ''We're getting fine-grained M.R.I.'s into the inner workings of palaces, boardrooms and organizations and into the mind-sets of those who lead them.'' So how does anyone adapt? Just disconnect? ''Trying to disconnect to avoid exposure in a connected world is a misguided strategy,'' argued Seidman. ''If you do that, how will you create value and get anything done?'' The right strategy is ''to deepen and strengthen all these connections.'' But how? ''If we're in an interdependent world, then the only strategy for countries, companies and individuals is to build healthy interdependencies so we rise, and not fall, together,'' Seidman added. ''This comes down to behavior. It means being guided by sustainable values like humility, integrity and respect in how we work with others: values that build healthy interdependencies.'' It means shunning ''situational 'values,' just doing whatever the situation allows.'' The American-Canadian relationship is a healthy interdependency. The relationship between police forces and black youths today is an unhealthy interdependency. The relationship between Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and his police force is an unhealthy interdependency. But there is another critical part. It's how we learn to respond to all the secrets being revealed: the C.E.O.'s email that makes him or her look foolish, but also reveals that women are being paid less than men in the same jobs; the video of a suspect being killed by police; the elevator footage of a football player knocking out his fiancée; and private photos of movie stars. They all have different moral and societal significance. We need to deal with them differently. ''We need to pause more to make sense of all the M.R.I.'s we're being exposed to,'' argued Seidman. In the pause, ''we reflect and imagine a better way.'' In some cases, that could mean showing empathy for the fact that humans are imperfect. In others, it could mean ''taking principled stands'' toward those whose behaviors ''make this interdependent world unsafe, unstable or unfree.'' In short, there's never been a time when we need more people living by the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Because, in today's world, more people can see into you and do unto you than ever before. Otherwise, we're going to end up with a ''gotcha'' society, lurching from outrage to outrage, where in order to survive you'll either have to disconnect or constantly censor yourself because every careless act or utterance could ruin your life. Who wants to live that way? (For 2015, I will just be writing on Wednesdays while I work on a book.) "
Cyberattack in Germany Shuts Down Official Sites,"BERLIN -- At least three official German websites, including Chancellor Angela Merkel's page, were inaccessible on Wednesday after an apparent cyberattack. A group demanding that Germany sever ties with Ukraine and halt financial and political support for the government in the capital, Kiev, claimed responsibility for shutting down at least two sites, the chancellor's and the website of the Bundestag, or lower house of Parliament.  A Foreign Ministry official later said that the ministry's site was also inaccessible. The sites were at least periodically inaccessible after about 10 a.m., according to Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Seven hours later, a government spokesman, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the attack was still being analyzed and that no comment could be made on the identity of the attackers. Mr. Seibert earlier told reporters at a regular government news conference that ''our service provider's data center is under a severe attack that has apparently been caused by a variety of external systems.'' In a Russian-language statement on its website, a group identifying itself as CyberBerkut -- using the slogan ''We Won't Forget. We Won't Forgive.'' -- noted the support of Ms. Merkel's government for Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of Ukraine. The statement said the prime minister was seeking more money from the West to prop up his country, which is faltering economically, as a way to allow what the group called Ukraine's ''criminal government'' to continue to wage war against pro-Russian forces, primarily in the eastern part of the country. ''Berkut'' in the group's name is a reference to the special troops who supported Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former president who fled last February after weeks of antigovernment unrest. Last March, the CyberBerkut group claimed responsibility for taking down three NATO websites in a series of distributed denial of service attacks, in which servers are flooded with traffic until they collapse.

Arrest in Britain in Hacking of Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation Networks,"LONDON - An 18-year-old British man was arrested on Friday in connection with a hacking attack that temporarily shut down the computer networks for Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 4 video game consoles on Christmas Day.  The man, who was not identified, was  arrested in the north of England for potentially providing false information to law enforcement agencies in the United States, according to a statement by the British police, which was working on the case with the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States. He was arrested on charges of unauthorized access to computer material, the British police said.  British police said those activities included so-called swatting, in which someone informs the American police of false threats that lead to tactical S.W.A.T. units being deployed. The attack against the computer networks run by Microsoft and Sony, for which the hacker activist group known as Lizard Squad had claimed responsibility, led to many gamers' complaining worldwide on Dec. 25 that they could not access their accounts. The online hacks came on the same day that Sony Pictures began streaming ""The Interview,"" a film at the center of a separate online attack against Sony's computer network linked to North Korea, through online portals like Microsoft's Xbox service.It is unclear what the man's role may have been in the cyberattack against Microsoft and Sony's video gaming services. The attacks included a denial of service attack, in which servers are flooded with Internet traffic until they collapse under the load. ""We are still at the early stages of the investigation, and there is still much work to be done,"" said Craig Jones, head of cybercrime at the South East Regional Organized Crime Unit in Britain. ""Cybercrime is an issue which has no boundaries and affects people on a local, regional and global level."" A spokeswoman for the British police declined to comment on how long the country's enforcement agencies had been working with the F.B.I. on the case. "
Pascal Lands in Sony's Outbox,"LOS ANGELES --  Amy Pascal, an old-style studio chief who was undercut by new Hollywood economics and bruised by the airing of private emails in a devastating cyberattack, said on Thursday that she would resign her post as the top film executive at Sony Pictures Entertainment. Ms. Pascal had been in contract renewal talks for months, well before hackers in December made available private correspondence in which she made denigrating remarks about President Obama's presumed preference for black-themed movies.     She profusely apologized, and top studio executives stood behind her in the aftermath. But the pressures of the hacking crisis, coupled with structural changes at the studio, made alternatives to renewing her contract more attractive.   She will leave her positions as co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment and chairwoman of Sony's motion picture group in May, the studio said, and accept a four-year production deal that will involve her making some of Sony's biggest planned films.     For the moment, her resignation consolidates power over Sony's film operation under Michael Lynton, chief executive of Sony Entertainment. He is expected to decide in the next few months whether any successor will precisely match Ms. Pascal's role, or will function differently at a studio that has been cutting costs and shifting focus toward both television and global crowd pleasers driven by special effects.   She was neither pushed to leave nor begged to stay, and Ms. Pascal's decision to move on crystallized over the last two weeks, said people briefed on the matter, as Sony offered the producing deal as an option. She also came to a realization, perhaps long overdue, that her romantic notion of the movie industry -- built around stars and stories -- no longer fit with new realities.   Ms. Pascal also went through a draining month of turmoil within Sony as studio leaders struggled to cope with a hacking that crippled the company's computers and exposed personal data about its employees. Known to be a fiery counterpart to the more reserved Mr. Lynton, Ms. Pascal was particularly distressed by the assault, exhibiting both anger and tearful regret before Sony employees.    Often identified as the film industry's top female executive, Ms. Pascal is the only senior Sony manager to leave her position since the hacking attack. Though she received a lucrative and prestigious next job, her departure may invite further scrutiny of an industry often criticized for a dearth of women in leading positions.    Ms. Pascal, 56, has been with Sony continuously since 1996, when she became president of its Columbia Pictures unit after serving as production president of Turner Pictures. Before joining Turner, she had worked at Sony since 1988.   ''I have spent almost my entire professional life at Sony Pictures, and I am energized to be starting this new chapter based at the company I call home,'' she said in a statement. Mr. Lynton and Ms. Pascal declined to elaborate on the announcement.   Stephen G. Ujlaki, dean of the film school at Loyola Marymount University, noted that Ms. Pascal had proved herself a nimble survivor over the years. ''She did a great pivot early on,'' he said, adding that Ms. Pascal had once focused on women's films but turned sharply toward popular hits like the ''Spider-Man'' series as she chased bigger audiences.   While some details are unclear, the broad terms of her new deal are breathtaking. Several people briefed on Ms. Pascal's exit said it involved a four-year guarantee of $30 million to $40 million. Her package additionally includes a percentage of profits on movies she produces and millions of dollars for annual office costs and discretionary acquisition of scripts.    In a drive to enhance profitability, Mr. Lynton has been cutting staff and shuffling executives, squeezing Ms. Pascal, who for years had governed Sony's film unit without serious challenge. He recently promoted Doug Belgrad to the presidency of Sony's film operation -- in effect giving Mr. Lynton a lieutenant with film expertise, should he choose to supervise filmmaking without Ms. Pascal.   Ms. Pascal joined Mr. Lynton in mentoring executives who may now stand in line for her duties, including the former DreamWorks executive Michael De Luca; Thomas E. Rothman, the former chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment who is now in charge of Sony's TriStar division; and the former Warner studio chief Jeff Robinov, who came to Sony as a producer with substantial outside funding.   At the same time, she was pressed by strategic changes that came with the retirement of a strong supporter, Howard Stringer, as the chief executive of Sony Corporation. With Mr. Stringer's exit, the studio tightened costs and looked to focus even more heavily on the franchise and fantasy films that have sustained competitors like Warner and Disney.   Then in November came the devastating hacking attack that over the course of several weeks made public huge amounts of data and information about Sony and its employees, including personal emails.    Of those, Ms. Pascal's were the most embarrassing, including a disparaging back-and-forth with the producer Scott Rudin about Angelina Jolie and a Steve Jobs biopic, and another exchange with Mr. Rudin about Mr. Obama's supposed movie preferences.    Both exchanges became fodder for gossip sites, trade publications and mainstream news organizations, and for a time made Ms. Pascal the public face of a company dealing with a humiliating crisis.   Eventually, North Korea was identified by the United States government as having precipitated the attack, in an attempt to stop the release of Sony's provocative comedy ''The Interview,'' which lampooned the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. Through it all, Ms. Pascal pushed for the movie to be released.    In fact, ''The Interview,'' which featured one of her favorite stars, Seth Rogen, was of a piece with her penchant for ambitious and inventive movies that traded on relationships with stars and filmmakers like Will Smith, Adam McKay and Adam Sandler. When those stars and moviemakers were hot, so was Ms. Pascal.   In 2006, Sony topped the domestic box office, with hits like Mr. Sandler's ''Click.'' In 2012, Sony was on top again, with matching blockbusters from its two principal film franchises: ''The Amazing Spider-Man,'' and ''Skyfall,'' from a James Bond series that it shared with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.   But Sony faltered when Ms. Pascal's favorites slipped. In 2013, the studio ranked fourth at the domestic box office, and suffered a particular embarrassment as Mr. Smith, the most reliable star in its stable, took in just $60.5 million in domestic ticket sales with ''After Earth,'' an expensive science-fiction thriller.   Last year was again wobbly, thanks to the relatively soft performance of ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2,'' which underperformed its predecessors.   For more than a year, talk in Hollywood buzzed with speculation about the fate of Ms. Pascal, whose output has included Oscar contenders like ''The Social Network'' and ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' and who is popular with writers, directors, stars and their agents.    But she has been under pressure to spend less, make fewer films and deliver more consistently at the box office.   The talk reached fever pitch in 2013, when the investor Daniel S. Loeb took an investment stake in the Sony Corporation, and began pressing, among other positions, for an overhaul of its film operation.   While Mr. Loeb eventually backed off, Mr. Lynton joined Ms. Pascal in a retooling that eventually saw the departure of executives including the studio's vice chairman Jeff Blake, who had overseen the marketing and distribution of films.

"Hackers Attack GreatFire.org, a Workaround for Websites Censored in China","For years, a group of anonymous activists known as GreatFire.org has monitored online censorship in China, provided access to blocked websites and collected messages deleted by censors. This week, unidentified hackers have tried to put an end to those activists' efforts with an unprecedented attack. In a post to its blog Thursday, GreatFire.org said it has experienced a massive so-called denial of service attack. The method is one that hackers frequently use to foil websites by flooding them with multiple requests - so many that they go offline and viewers see a blank page. GreatFire.org creates encrypted versions of 12 websites that are blocked in China. These are known as mirrored websites and grant users within China access to the content.   On Thursday, GreatFire.org said it was receiving 2.6 billion requests an hour for its mirrored websites. On Friday, access to the mirrored websites was inconsistent in China.  Meanwhile, the Reuters news agency reported that its website was inaccessible in China on Friday. The websites of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg have previously been blocked in China. ""We are under attack and we need help,"" GreatFire.org said. ""This kind of attack is aggressive and is an exhibition of censorship by brute force. Attackers resort to tactics like this when they are left with no other options."" GreatFire.org's name is inspired by the Great Firewall, the term often used to describe China's Internet censorship. About two million people in China access GreatFire's websites each month, a co-founder of the group who uses the pseudonym Charlie Smith, wrote in an email exchange. It was unclear who was responsible for the attack, which began Tuesday  from inside and outside China, Mr. Smith wrote. GreatFire.org noted in its blog post that its tactics were the recent subject of a report in The Wall Street Journal, which appeared online Monday. The timing for the attack was a mystery. ""Maybe that WSJ story,"" Mr. Smith wrote. ""Maybe because there have been some excellent Chinese-language news pieces and perhaps somebody who supports the authorities took issue with them. In the past there has rarely been rhyme or reason on the timing of such attacks."" GreatFire.org's mirroring services provide unrestricted access within China to a range of websites, including itself and the Chinese language version of The New York Times, which has been regularly blocked in China. Some of the others are Deutsche Welle, BBC News, China Digital Times, Google.com, and Boxun, a Chinese-language news website. GreatFire.org says it does not mirror The Wall Street Journal.  GreatFire.org works directly with some, but not all, of the websites it mirrors. GreatFire.org is partly funded by Open Technology Fund, a United States government-financed initiative under Radio Free Asia. Last year it provided $114,000 in funding, according to its website. Mr. Smith declined to comment on any financial backing. The Chinese government has in the last year ramped up efforts to prevent its citizens from accessing critical news coverage from abroad and from communicating on social media platforms that the government cannot directly censor. China has long disrupted many of Google's services. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remain blocked. LinkedIn agreed to censor its content to operate in the Chinese market last year. GreatFire's mirroring websites circumvent the Great Firewall by channeling Internet traffic through cloud services, such as one available from Amazon.  The difficulty for the Chinese government is that it can't just shut off Amazon's service, because it is used broadly by many major Chinese corporations. An email to the Chinese Embassy in Washington went unanswered. The Associated Press quoted Zhu Haiquan, a spokesman for the embassy, as saying: ''As we have always stated, Chinese laws prohibit cybercrimes of all forms. The Chinese government is making great efforts to combat cybercrimes and safeguard cybersecurity. Jumping to conclusions and making unfounded accusations is not responsible and is counterproductive.'' The hacking is costing GreatFire up to $30,000 per day in additional charges, Mr. Smith wrote. However, he wrote that he was confident that the group's services would not be disrupted for good. ""The authorities will not cut off access to the world's Internet infrastructure because they know that it is valuable,"" Mr. Smith wrote. ""If anything, this should accelerate the development and deployment of collateral freedom as a strategy to achieve freedom of access to information in countries like China."" "
It's a Whole New Paranoid World,"Deila Ephron is the author, most recently, of ''Sister Mother Husband Dog (etc.),'' a memoir. THERE is probably nothing about me that is not in the hands of hackers. First, JPMorgan Chase, where I have a bank account, got hacked, then Sony, where I have worked as a screenwriter, then Morgan Stanley, where I have a brokerage account, then Anthem Blue Cross, which has my medical information.    When Sony's computer system was breached last Thanksgiving and hackers stole not only the data of its employees but also personal emails, Sony offered ''victims'' a year's security protection with an A-plus-rated security company, AllClear ID Alert Network.    To get the service I had to register. I called. No one answered. I left a message. A day later, when I hadn't received a return call, I phoned again. This violates a rule I live by -- people begin as they mean to continue -- which was useful in predicting bad boyfriends but which I now apply to all new relationships, even with companies. To wit, if your A-plus-rated security company doesn't call back, perhaps it is not A-plus. On the second try, however, I got a helpful representative who signed me up, and in a spylike arrangement, I recorded a secret sentence. If they called me, they would play the sentence, and I would know it was them and not hackers. Although, if they were hacked, wouldn't the hackers have the recording, too? Still, it made sense at the time.   I did not write down the sentence. I didn't put it in my computer, where I could find it in an instant. That didn't seem smart, hack-wise. I have no idea what it is. A few days after I made this arrangement with AllClear, I got a call from them around dinnertime. ''Did you leave a message?'' the man asked. ''Yes,'' I said. He asked me to verify some information. I said, ''You said you were going to play a secret sentence,'' and hung up the phone. I would like to say I slammed down the phone, but pushing a button on the phone does not translate as slamming, just one of the many emotional experiences technology is depriving us of.   The truth is, the thing that freaked me out most about the Sony hacking was not the theft of my Social Security number but the capture and exposure of personal email. Apparently I would rather lose all my money than be humiliated. I use email instead of the phone, to stay in intimate touch with friends many time zones away and to do a certain amount of, how to put this, gossiping.    Exposure of my emails would reveal not only deep fears and worries, but also my shallow personality.   Since the Sony hacking, I say less in personal emails, and much less in professional ones. If I refer to someone who has a high profile I use initials, which is sort of like hiding your valuables in your underwear drawer and assuming a robber would never think to look there. If I'm writing to someone whose cloud a hacker might fancy, I am less cozy, which is a bit like downgrading a close friend to an acquaintance.    I am certain this caution is temporary, and not only because privacy as an illusion is hard to accept.   A couple of times a year, I give up sugar. After three weeks, I brag to everyone about how much better I feel, and the week after that I take a nibble of chocolate, and the next day wolf an entire candy bar. I love email as much as sugar. I'm addicted to it. Soon I'll be confiding my anxieties, and the next thing you know I'll be gossiping again. Although I should say that, as a writer, I think of gossip as the serious dissecting of other people's psychology and necessary to my art. But suppose my iPhone is hacked, as my new security company so helpfully predicts is inevitable for us all. What if someone takes over my account and tweets that I don't love America? Or that I hate dogs?    You know what? I need a Valium.   It occurs to me that who is really going to benefit from all this hacking is the drug companies. How ironic is that?    "
China Appears to Divert Traffic to Attack a Site,"HONG KONG --  The Chinese government has long used a sophisticated set of Internet filters known as the Great Firewall as a barrier to prevent its citizens from obtaining access to foreign websites with information it deems threatening. But in a recent series of attacks on websites that try to help Internet users in China circumvent this censorship, the Great Firewall appears to have been used instead as a weapon, diverting a portion of the torrents of Internet traffic that flow through it to overload targeted websites.    In doing so, the Chinese government is taking advantage of and damaging one of China's own Internet companies: Baidu. The attacks appear to hijack advertising and analytics traffic intended for Baidu, China's largest search company, and then send that traffic to smaller websites in what is known as a distributed denial of service or DDoS attack. The huge flow of traffic has the effect of crashing the sites.    The aggressive new strategy shows vividly how Beijing is struggling to balance its desire to control the flow of information online with the aim of encouraging the growth of its tech sector.   The main target of the recent barrage is GitHub, a popular website that acts as a library of code for programmers. While it is indispensable for tech companies in China, it also hosts several pages that enable users to view sites blocked in the country.   Because GitHub is fully encrypted, China's domestic web filters cannot distinguish between pages that host code useful to programmers and code that circumvents censorship. In 2013, when the government fully blocked GitHub, it caused an outcry among China's many computer engineers, leading to the site's subsequent unblocking.   The new attacks take more of a siege approach, hitting the site with a costly and difficult-to-manage barrage of traffic in the hopes it will remove two pages, one with code from GreatFire.org -- a nonprofit organization that runs mirrors of blocked sites including Google, the BBC and The New York Times -- and another that hosts links to mirror sites of the Chinese version of The Times.   Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, declined to comment on the attacks.   ''This is a huge problem for free expression,'' said Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He added that these attacks could lead sites like GitHub to decide it is too much trouble to host content deemed problematic by China.   ''This is a message to the people who maintain GitHub: Either you kick out GreatFire and The New York Times, or we'll keep this up,'' said Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer at the security firm F-Secure.   The new attacks come as Beijing has increased censorship in China, and grown more vocal about how the Internet should be governed globally. In a number of recent public appearances, China's Internet czar, Lu Wei, has called for respect for China's Internet sovereignty, meaning that China should have the right to manage the Internet within its borders as it wants.   But the GreatFire.org material on GitHub, which is based in San Francisco, offers an unusual exception. By offering code that unblocks sites within China, it is assumed to be violating Chinese laws from abroad. James Andrew Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the attack was an attempt to deal with extraterritoriality on the Internet.   ''China is trying to redefine the rules of the Internet and they're feeling their way forward as they do it,'' he said. ''This is one of another set of actions to say China will have a bigger voice in how the Internet works.''   He added that the United States had reacted strongly to distributed denial of service attacks by Iran in the past, and in this case the Obama administration could increase pressure and enact stiffer penalties against China if these types of attacks continue.   If the style of the most recent wave of attacks is well known, novel elements present major difficulties for those seeking to keep the site up, according to a number of security experts. In particular, because the traffic comes from real users scattered across the globe, instead of a concentrated network of infected computers, it is hard to sort the real traffic from the fake.   Experts said they could not be certain who was behind the attacks. But it appears that signals to or from Baidu ads and analytics tools are being redirected toward the targeted sites when users outside China visit a site inside China. Because the signals seem to be diverted at the gateway between China and the rest of the world, analysts suspect the government and the Great Firewall.   In a post on a security website run by Insight Labs, an analyst wrote that ''a certain device at the border of China's inner network and the Internet has hijacked'' connections going into China.   ''In other words,'' the post continued, ''even people outside China are being weaponized to target things the Chinese government does not like, for example, freedom of speech.''   Mr. Hypponen said the on-again off-again waves of attack traffic acted similarly to the way the Great Firewall filters, and that the capabilities and motivations also pointed to Beijing.   In a statement Friday, GitHub said the attack was the largest of its type to have targeted the site, and that the attack featured ''some sophisticated new techniques that use the web browsers of unsuspecting, uninvolved people to flood GitHub.com with high levels of traffic.''   ''Based on reports we've received,'' the company said, ''we believe the intent of this attack is to convince us to remove a specific class of content.''   As of Monday GitHub said services were operating normally, but attack traffic continued.   The attacks put Baidu in a difficult position. Calling it the price of doing business in China, Mr. Tsui said the company was ''being used'' and pointed out that the attack was directly hitting the company's bottom line by interrupting advertising traffic.   In a statement, Kaiser Kuo, a Baidu spokesman, said the company found no security breaches and was working with other organizations to get to the bottom of the attack.    "
Regular Programming Interrupted,"No one knows for sure who hacked the French television network TV5 Monde on April 8, and that is part of the problem. The attack appears to have been well planned, and the hackers had probably infiltrated the network's firewall-protected servers weeks before they struck at about 10 p.m. Paris time, hijacking 11 of the network's television channels as well as TV5 Monde's website, Facebook page and Twitter account simultaneously.  TV5 Monde's director, Yves Bigot, said the network's systems had been ''severely damaged'' in what he called an ''unprecedented attack.''     The hackers posted black banners proclaiming  ''Je suIS IS'' or ''I am ISIS,'' in a mocking reference to  the solidarity slogan ''Je suis Charlie'' coined in response to the terrorist attacks in Paris in January. On TV5 Monde's Facebook page, they ominously posted images of ID cards they claimed belonged to relatives of French soldiers combating ISIS, warning: ''You have the chance to save your families, take advantage of it.''    Responsibility was claimed by a group calling itself the CyberCaliphate, the same name used by hackers who took over social media accounts of the United States Central Command in January and Newsweek's Twitter feed in February. Hopefully, the investigation launched by the French government will reveal whether the attackers are part of the Islamic State's hacking operation or another solo attack by a jihadist offshoot.    Efforts in France to foil the Islamic State's cyberpresence have focused on taking down offending websites and social media accounts. But hijacking a network can require little more than a couple of people with computers.  France's minister of culture, Fleur Pellerin, called an emergency meeting of French media groups to discuss security steps. TV5 Monde's experience is a warning that media networks everywhere must redouble efforts to protect their systems.     "
"Russian Hackers Read Obama's Unclassified Emails, Officials Say","WASHINGTON --  Some of President Obama's email correspondence was swept up by Russian hackers last year in a breach of the White House's unclassified computer system that was far more intrusive and worrisome than has been publicly acknowledged, according to senior American officials briefed on the investigation. The hackers, who also got deeply into the State Department's unclassified system, do not appear to have penetrated closely guarded servers that control the message traffic from Mr. Obama's BlackBerry, which he or an aide carries constantly.    But they obtained access to the email archives of people inside the White House, and perhaps some outside, with whom Mr. Obama regularly communicated. From those accounts, they reached emails that the president had sent and received, according to officials briefed on the investigation.     White House officials said that no classified networks had been compromised, and that the hackers had collected no classified information. Many senior officials have two computers in their offices, one operating on a highly secure classified network and another connected to the outside world for unclassified communications.   But officials have conceded that the unclassified system routinely contains much information that is considered highly sensitive: schedules, email exchanges with ambassadors and diplomats, discussions of pending personnel moves and legislation, and, inevitably, some debate about policy.    Officials did not disclose the number of Mr. Obama's emails that were harvested by hackers, nor the sensitivity of their content. The president's email account itself does not appear to have been hacked. Aides say that most of Mr. Obama's classified briefings -- such as the morning Presidential Daily Brief -- are delivered orally or on paper (sometimes supplemented by an iPad system connected to classified networks) and that they are usually confined to the Oval Office or the Situation Room.   Still, the fact that Mr. Obama's communications were among those hit by the hackers -- who are presumed to be linked to the Russian government, if not working for it -- has been one of the most closely held findings of the inquiry. Senior White House officials have known for months about the depth of the intrusion.   ''This has been one of the most sophisticated actors we've seen,'' said one senior American official briefed on the investigation.    Others confirmed that the White House intrusion was viewed as so serious that officials met on a nearly daily basis for several weeks after it was discovered. ''It's the Russian angle to this that's particularly worrisome,'' another senior official said.   While Chinese hacking groups are known for sweeping up vast amounts of commercial and design information, the best Russian hackers tend to hide their tracks better and focus on specific, often political targets. And the hacking happened at a moment of renewed tension with Russia -- over its annexation of Crimea, the presence of its forces in Ukraine and its renewed military patrols in Europe, reminiscent of the Cold War.   Inside the White House, the intrusion has raised a new debate about whether it is possible to protect a president's electronic presence, especially when it reaches out from behind the presumably secure firewalls of the executive branch.   Mr. Obama is no stranger to computer-network attacks: His 2008 campaign was hit by Chinese hackers. Nonetheless, he has long been a frequent user of email, and publicly fought the Secret Service in 2009 to retain his BlackBerry, a topic he has joked about in public. He was issued a special smartphone, and the list of those he can exchange emails with is highly restricted.   When asked about the investigation's findings, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, said, ''We'll decline to comment.'' The White House has also declined to provide any explanations about how the breach was handled, though the State Department has been more candid about what kind of systems were hit and what it has done since to improve security. A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment.   Officials who discussed the investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the hacking. While the White House has refused to identify the nationality of the hackers, others familiar with the investigation said that in both the White House and State Department cases, all signs pointed to Russians.   On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter revealed for the first time that Russian hackers had attacked the Pentagon's unclassified systems, but said they had been identified and ''kicked off.'' Defense Department officials declined to say if the signatures of the attacks on the Pentagon appeared related to the White House and State Department attacks.   The discovery of the hacking in October led to a partial shutdown of the White House email system. The hackers appear to have been evicted from the White House systems by the end of October. But they continued to plague the State Department, whose system is much more far-flung. The disruptions were so severe that during the Iranian nuclear negotiations in Vienna in November, officials needed to distribute personal email accounts, to one another and to some reporters, to maintain contact.   Earlier this month, officials at the White House said that the hacking had not damaged its systems and that, while elements had been shut down to mitigate the effects of the attack, everything had been restored.   One of the curiosities of the White House and State Department attacks is that the administration, which recently has been looking to name and punish state and nonstate hackers in an effort to deter attacks, has refused to reveal its conclusions about who was responsible for this complex and artful intrusion into the government. That is in sharp contrast to Mr. Obama's decision, after considerable internal debate in December, to name North Korea for ordering the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, and to the director of national intelligence's decision to name Iranian hackers as the source of a destructive attack on the Sands Casino.   This month, after CNN reported that hackers had gained access to sensitive areas of the White House computer network, including sections that contained the president's schedule, the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said the administration had not publicly named who was behind the hack because federal investigators had concluded that ''it's not in our best interests.''   By contrast, in the North Korea case, he said, investigators concluded that ''we're more likely to be successful in terms of holding them accountable by naming them publicly.''   But the breach of the president's emails appeared to be a major factor in the government secrecy. ''All of this is very tightly held,'' one senior American official said, adding that the content of what had been breached was being kept secret to avoid tipping off the Russians about what had been learned from the investigation.   Mr. Obama's friends and associates say that he is a committed user of his BlackBerry, but that he is careful when emailing outside the White House system.   ''The frequency has dropped off in the last six months or so,'' one of his close associates said, though this person added that he did not know if the drop was related to the hacking.    Mr. Obama is known to send emails to aides late at night from his residence, providing them with his feedback on speeches or, at times, entirely new drafts. Others say he has emailed on topics as diverse as his golf game and the struggle with Congress over the Iranian nuclear negotiations.   George W. Bush gave up emailing for the course of his presidency and did not carry a smartphone. But after Mr. Bush left office, his sister's email account was hacked, and several photos -- including some of his paintings -- were made public.   The White House is bombarded with cyberattacks daily, not only from Russia and China. Most are easily deflected.   The White House, the State Department, the Pentagon and intelligence agencies put their most classified material into a system called Jwics, for Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System. That is where top-secret and ''secret compartmentalized information'' traverses within the government, to officials cleared for it -- and it includes imagery, data and graphics. There is no evidence, senior officials said, that this hacking pierced it.    "
White House Weighs Sanctions After Second Breach of a Computer System,"WASHINGTON --  The White House on Friday revealed that hackers had breached a second computer system at the Office of Personnel Management, and said that President Obama was considering financial sanctions against the attackers who gained access to the files of millions of federal workers. Investigators had already said that Chinese hackers appeared to have obtained personal data from more than four million current and former federal employees in one of the boldest invasions into a government network.     But on Friday, officials said they believed that a separate computer system at the agency was breached by the same hackers, putting at risk not only data about the federal employees, but also information about friends, family members and associates that could number millions more. Officials said that the second system contained files related to intelligence officials working for the F.B.I., defense contractors and other government agencies.    Sam Schumach, a spokesman for the personnel office, said that the F.B.I.'s incident response team had concluded ''with a high degree of confidence'' that systems containing information related to background investigations of current, former and prospective federal employees were compromised.   A senior government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that investigators became aware of the second intrusion while assessing the damage from the first breach. The official said the information apparently taken in the second breach appeared not to be limited to federal employees.   The database contains copies of what is known as Standard Form 86, a questionnaire filled out by applicants for national security positions. The 127-page form can include medical data, including information on treatment or hospitalization for ''an emotional or mental health condition.''   In addition, the form asks for detailed information on close relatives and ''people who know you well.'' The form has spaces for each contact's home or work address, email address, phone number and other information.   The personnel office has said that the number of federal employees and applicants affected could rise beyond the four million already reported. If the relatives and close contacts are included, the total number of people affected could be several times as high, officials said.   At the White House, officials said that Mr. Obama was weighing the use of an executive order he signed in April that allows the Treasury secretary to impose sanctions on individuals or groups that engage in malicious cyberattacks, or people who benefit from them.   ''This newly available option is one that is on the table,'' said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.   Mr. Obama signed the executive order after the attack on Sony Pictures' computer network, an intrusion that American officials believe was carried out by the government of North Korea. The order gives the administration the ability to freeze assets in the United States, bar Americans from doing business with groups that sponsor cyberattacks, and cut the groups off from American goods and technology. But the use of the sanctions authority could be more significant if Mr. Obama wielded it against China, which officials believe has continued to sponsor cyberattacks even as the two nations warily seek a working relationship in other areas.   Mr. Earnest declined to say whether investigators had concluded that the attacks at the personnel office affected many millions more people than the four million already announced. And he declined to say whether officials at the United States Embassy in China were being relocated out of a fear that the hackers retrieved information about their contacts in that country.   ''We have acknowledged that potentially sensitive data about a substantial number of federal employees was breached or is at least now at risk,'' Mr. Earnest said. ''But we haven't talked publicly about the details of that.''    Security experts say the forensic evidence from the attacks suggests that they were the work of a sophisticated Chinese group that for the past three years has targeted a number of government agencies and defense contractors.    More recently, however, the group appears to have been looking for inroads into the personal lives of government workers, military and intelligence personnel, and defense contractors, and it has been gathering the personal data and medical histories of its targets. Though experts say it is not clear what the attackers plan to use the information for, they note that it is the sort of delicate medical data that could be used for blackmail.   While the group is not a unit of the People's Liberation Army's Third Department, which oversees the Chinese military's cyberintelligence gathering, the chronology of its attacks matches Beijing's stated economic and strategic objectives.   It is unclear what exactly the relationship is between the attackers and the Chinese state, but for years security researchers have found evidence of a freelance market for Chinese hackers. Previous attacks against targets that would be of interest to the Chinese government have been tied to students and educators at Chinese universities and employees at Chinese Internet firms.   The impact of the breach of personnel files is continuing to ripple across other federal agencies. On Friday, for example, the Office of Management and Budget announced new steps that agencies must take to secure their networks as part of a ''30-Day Cybersecurity Sprint'' ordered by the government's chief information officer.   Those steps include continuous, real-time monitoring of computer networks and the use of multifactor authentication, in which users are required to go beyond user names and passwords to verify their identity when logging on. Neither of those security features was in place at the personnel office before the attack last month.    "
Baseball Team Is Said to Breach Rival's Database,"WASHINGTON --  Front-office personnel for the St. Louis Cardinals, one of the most successful teams in baseball over the past two decades, are under investigation by the F.B.I. and Justice Department prosecutors, accused of hacking into an internal network of the Houston Astros to steal closely guarded information about players. Investigators have uncovered evidence that Cardinals employees broke into a network of the Astros that housed special databases the team had built, law enforcement officials said. Internal discussions about trades, proprietary statistics and scouting reports were compromised, said the officials, who were not authorized to discuss a continuing investigation.     The officials did not say which employees were the focus of the investigation or whether the team's highest-ranking officials were aware of the hacking or authorized it. The investigation is being led by the F.B.I.'s Houston field office and has progressed to the point that subpoenas have been served on the Cardinals and Major League Baseball for electronic correspondence.   Law enforcement officials believe the hacking was executed by vengeful front-office employees for the Cardinals hoping to wreak havoc on the work of Jeff Luhnow, the Astros' general manager, who had been a successful and polarizing executive with the Cardinals until 2011.   The attack would represent the first known case of corporate espionage in which a professional sports team hacked the network of another team. Illegal intrusions into companies' networks have become commonplace, but they are generally conducted by hackers operating in foreign countries, like Russia and China, who steal large amounts of data or trade secrets for military equipment and electronics.   Major League Baseball ''has been aware of and has fully cooperated with the federal investigation into the illegal breach of the Astros' baseball operations database,'' a spokesman for Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a written statement.   The Cardinals personnel under investigation have not been put on leave, suspended or fired. The commissioner's office will probably wait until the conclusion of the government's investigation to determine whether to take disciplinary action against the employees or the team.   ''The St. Louis Cardinals are aware of the investigation into the security breach of the Houston Astros' database,'' the team said in a statement. ''The team has fully cooperated with the investigation and will continue to do so. Given that this is an ongoing federal investigation, it is not appropriate for us to comment further.''   The case is a rare mark of ignominy for the Cardinals, one of the sport's most revered and popular organizations. The team has the best record in the majors this season (43-21), regularly commands outsize television ratings and has reached the National League Championship Series nine times since 2000. The Cardinals, who last won the World Series in 2011, have 11 titles over all, second only to the Yankees.   From 1994 to 2012, the Astros and the Cardinals were division rivals in the N.L. For a part of that time, Mr. Luhnow was a Cardinals executive, primarily handling scouting and player development. One of many innovative thinkers drawn to the sport by the statistics-based ''Moneyball'' phenomenon, he was credited with building baseball's best minor league system, and with drafting several players who would become linchpins of that 2011 Cardinals team.   The Astros hired Mr. Luhnow as general manager in December 2011, and he quickly began applying his unconventional approach to running a baseball team. In an exploration of the team's radical transformation, Bloomberg Business called it ''a project unlike anything baseball has seen before.''   Under Mr. Luhnow, the Astros have accomplished a striking turnaround; they are in first place in the American League West division. But in 2013, before their revival at the major league level, their internal deliberations about statistics and players were compromised, the law enforcement officials said.   The intrusion did not appear to be sophisticated, the law enforcement officials said. When Mr. Luhnow was with the Cardinals, the team built a computer network, called Redbird, to house all of its baseball operations information -- including scouting reports and player information. After he left to join the Astros, and took some front-office personnel with him from the Cardinals, Houston created a similar program known as Ground Control.   It contained the Astros' ''collective baseball knowledge,'' according to a Bloomberg Business article published last year. The program took a series of variables and weighted them ''according to the values determined by the team's statisticians, physicist, doctors, scouts and coaches,'' the article said.   Investigators believe that Cardinals personnel, concerned that Mr. Luhnow had taken their idea and proprietary baseball information to the Astros, examined a master list of passwords used by Mr. Luhnow and the other officials when they worked for the Cardinals. The Cardinals employees are believed to have used those passwords to gain access to the Astros' network, law enforcement officials said.   That tactic is often used by cybercriminals, who sell passwords from one breach on the underground market, where others buy them and test them on other websites, including banking and brokerage services. The breach on the Astros would be one of the first known instances of a corporate competitor using the tactic against a rival. It is also, security experts say, just one more reason people are advised not to use the same passwords across different sites and services.   Last year, some of the information from the Astros' computers was posted anonymously online, according to an article on the website Deadspin. Among the details that were exposed were trade discussions that the Astros had with other teams. Mr. Luhnow was asked at the time whether the breach would affect how he dealt with other teams. ''Today I used a pencil and paper in all my conversations,'' he said.   Believing that the Astros' network had been compromised by a rogue hacker, Major League Baseball notified the F.B.I., and the authorities in Houston opened an investigation. Agents soon found that the Astros' network had been entered from a computer at a home that some Cardinals employees had lived in. The agents then turned their attention to the team's front office.   ''The F.B.I. aggressively investigates all potential threats to public- and private-sector systems,'' an F.B.I. spokeswoman said. ''Once our investigations are complete, we pursue all appropriate avenues to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.''    "
Traces of Hacking Found Despite Efforts at Secrecy,"The F.B.I.'s route to the St. Louis Cardinals' front office in pursuit of an apparent hacker, or hackers, involved a trip through a shrouded corner of the Internet.  The website Deadspin pointed out last June that internal documents from the Houston Astros had been posted anonymously on a site called Anonbin. Alarmed, the Major League Baseball commissioner's office notified law enforcement officials. From the Anonbin posting, those officials worked backward to find the perpetrator, who had tried to leave no tracks.    The person or people who penetrated the Astros' network apparently used a network of servers called Tor to hide the source of the documents that found their way to the site.   ''Tor is among the best anonymizing services out there, but it is not a silver bullet,'' said Sascha Meinrath, director of X-Lab, a technology policy organization in Washington. Tor is most effective in the hands of an experienced hacker, Mr. Meinrath said. The hacking, though, seems to have left traces somewhere in the welter of Tor servers.   ''What this tells me is that whoever leaked this is not very tech savvy,'' he said.   The Tor network functions as a sort of Internet maze to throw off anyone who tries to trace the origin of an electronic message, Mr. Meinrath said. When the network receives a message, it bounces from server to server. The ordinary Internet pastes a series of addresses onto a message, allowing it to be traced back to the sender. In contrast, the Tor network strips that information out.   When the message emerges from the network, the source is, in theory, untraceable. Even so, it has long been known that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have made extensive efforts to infiltrate the Tor network and trace those who use it.   Many of the servers on the Tor network are run by volunteers. Mr. Meinrath said that if the F.B.I. explored the network, it was possible that investigators were not able to infiltrate enough servers on their own to trace the origin of the documents.   ''Probably the F.B.I. had some of that information but not all of it,'' Mr. Meinrath said.   Another possibility, he said, was that the volunteer was not operating a server properly and kept information about the routes taken by the messages passing through it.   A skilled hacker, Mr. Meinrath said, would take into account all of these possibilities and add one or two additional layers of security to the communication -- for example, using software to cloak the identity of the computer that sent the message and connecting to the Internet somewhere that could not be linked to its source. Those measures seem to have eluded those who did the hacking.    "
Attack Gave Chinese Hackers Privileged Access to U.S. Systems,"WASHINGTON --  For more than five years, American intelligence agencies followed several groups of Chinese hackers who were systematically draining information from defense contractors, energy firms and electronics makers, their targets shifting to fit Beijing's latest economic priorities. But last summer, officials lost the trail as some of the hackers changed focus again, burrowing deep into United States government computer systems that contain vast troves of personnel data, according to American officials briefed on a federal investigation into the attack and private security experts.     Undetected for nearly a year, the Chinese intruders executed a sophisticated attack that gave them ''administrator privileges'' into the computer networks at the Office of Personnel Management, mimicking the credentials of people who run the agency's systems, two senior administration officials said. The hackers began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings.    Much of the personnel data had been stored in the lightly protected systems of the Department of the Interior, because it had cheap, available space for digital data storage. The hackers' ultimate target: the one million or so federal employees and contractors who have filled out a form known as SF-86, which is stored in a different computer bank and details personal, financial and medical histories for anyone seeking a security clearance.    ''This was classic espionage, just on a scale we've never seen before from a traditional adversary,'' one senior administration official said. ''And it's not a satisfactory answer to say, 'We found it and stopped it,' when we should have seen it coming years ago.''    The administration is urgently working to determine what other agencies are storing similarly sensitive information with weak protections. Officials would not identify their top concerns, but an audit issued early last year, before the Chinese attacks, harshly criticized lax security at the Internal Revenue Service, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Energy Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission -- and the Department of Homeland Security, which has responsibility for securing the nation's critical networks.   At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates nuclear facilities, information about crucial components was left on unsecured network drives, and the agency lost track of laptops with critical data.    Computers at the I.R.S. allowed employees to use weak passwords like ''password.'' One report detailed 7,329 ''potential vulnerabilities'' because software patches had not been installed. Auditors at the Department of Education, which stores information from millions of student loan applicants, were able to connect ''rogue'' computers and hardware to the network without being noticed. And at the Securities and Exchange Commission, part of the network had no firewall or intrusion protection for months.   ''We are not where we need to be in terms of federal cybersecurity,'' said Lisa Monaco, President Obama's homeland security adviser. At an Aspen Institute conference in Washington on Tuesday, she blamed out-of-date ''legacy systems'' that have not been updated for a modern, networked world where remote access is routine. The systems are not continuously monitored to know who is online, and what kind of data they are shipping out.    In congressional testimony and in interviews, officials investigating the breach at the personnel office have struggled to explain why the defenses were so poor for so long. Last week, the office's director, Katherine Archuleta, stumbled through a two-hour congressional hearing. She was unable to say why the agency did not follow through on inspector general reports, dating back to 2010, that found severe security lapses and recommended shutting down systems with security clearance data.   When she failed to explain why much of the information in the system was not encrypted -- something that is standard today on iPhones, for example -- Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat who usually supports Mr. Obama's initiatives, snapped at her. ''I wish that you were as strenuous and hardworking at keeping information out of the hands of hackers,'' he said, ''as you are keeping information out of the hands of Congress and federal employees.''   Her performance in classified briefings also frustrated several lawmakers. ''I don't get the sense at all they understand the problem,'' said Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, who called for Ms. Archuleta's resignation. ''They seem like deer in the headlights.''    Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said on Wednesday that Mr. Obama remained confident that Ms. Archuleta ''is the right person for the job.'' Ms. Archuleta, who took office in November 2013, did not respond to a request for an interview.   But even some White House aides say a lack of focus by managers contributed to the security problems. It was not until early last year, as computer attacks began on United States Investigations Services, a private contractor that conducts security clearance interviews for the personnel office, that serious efforts to develop a strategic plan to seal up the agency's many vulnerabilities started.   The attacks on the contractor ''should have been a huge red flag,'' said one senior military official who has reviewed the evidence of China's involvement. ''But it didn't set off the alarms it should have.''   Federal and private investigators piecing together the attacks now say they believe the same groups responsible for the attacks on the personnel office and the contractor had previously intruded on computer networks at health insurance companies, notably Anthem Inc. and Premera Blue Cross.    What those attacks had in common was the theft of millions of pieces of valuable personal data -- including Social Security numbers -- that have never shown up on black markets, where such information can fetch a high price. That could be an indicator of state sponsorship, according to James A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   But federal investigators, who like other officials would not speak on the record about a continuing inquiry, said the exact affiliation between the hackers and the Chinese government was not fully understood. Their tools and techniques, though, were easily identifiable to intelligence analysts and the security researchers who have been analyzing the breaches at the insurers and the Office of Personnel Management. Federal officials believe several groups were involved, though some security experts only detected one.   ''Since mid-2014, we have observed a threat group target valuable 'personally identifiable information' from multiple organizations in the health care insurance and travel industries,'' said Mike Oppenheim, the manager of threat intelligence at FireEye, a cybersecurity company. ''We believe this group is behind the O.P.M. breach and have tracked this group's activities since early 2013.''   But he argued that ''unlike other actors operating from China who conduct industrial espionage, take intellectual property or steal defense technology, this group has primarily targeted information that would enable it to build a database of Americans, with a likely focus on diplomats, intelligence operatives and those with business in China.''    While Mr. Obama publicly named North Korea as the country that attacked Sony Pictures Entertainment last year, he and his aides have described the Chinese hackers in the government records case only to members of Congress in classified hearings. Blaming the Chinese in public could affect cooperation on limiting the Iranian nuclear program and tensions with China's Asian neighbors. But the subject is bound to come up this week when senior Chinese officials meet in Washington for an annual strategic and economic dialogue.   Though their targets have changed over time, the hackers' digital fingerprints stayed much the same. That allowed analysts at the National Security Agency and the F.B.I. to periodically catch glimpses of their movements as they breached an ever more diverse array of computer networks.   Yet there is no indication that the personnel office realized that it had become a Chinese target for almost a year. Donna K. Seymour, the chief information officer, said the agency put together last year ''a very progressive, proactive plan that allowed us to see the adversarial activity,'' and argued that ''had we not been on that path, we may never have seen anything'' this spring. She cautioned, ''There is no one security tool that is a panacea.''   A congressional report issued in February 2014 by the Republican staff of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, concluded that multiple federal agencies with responsibility for critical infrastructure and holding vast amounts of information ''continue to leave themselves vulnerable, often by failing to take the most basic steps towards securing their systems and information.''   The report reserves its harshest criticism for the repeated failures of agency officials to take steps -- some of them very basic -- that would help thwart cyberattacks.   Computers at the Department of Homeland Security, which is charged with protecting the nation's public infrastructure, contained hundreds of vulnerabilities as recently as 2010, according to authors of the report. They said computer security failures remained across agencies even though the government has spent ''at least $65 billion'' since 2006 on protective measures.    At the personnel office, a set of new intrusion tools used on the system set off an alarm in March, Ms. Seymour said. The F.B.I. and the United States Computer Emergency Response Team, which works on network intrusions, found evidence that the hackers had obtained the credentials used by people who run the computer systems. Ms. Seymour would say only that the hackers got ''privileged user access.'' The administration is still trying to determine how many of the SF-86 national security forms -- which include information that could be useful for anyone seeking to identify or recruit an American intelligence agent, nuclear weapons engineer or vulnerable diplomat -- had been stolen.   ''They are casting a very wide net,'' John Hultquist, a senior manager of cyberespionage threat intelligence at iSight Partners, said of the hackers targeting of Americans' personal data. ''We're in a new space here and we don't entirely know what they're trying to do with it.''     "
F.B.I. Struggles to Pinpoint Fingers Behind a Hacking,"WASHINGTON --  As F.B.I. agents try to build a case against personnel in the St. Louis Cardinals' front office who are accused of breaking  into the network that housed the Houston Astros' closely guarded baseball intelligence, they are struggling with one particular aspect of the investigation: determining who, specifically, had his hands on the keyboard. The investigation is focused on a small group of Cardinals employees who specialize in statistical analysis and computer programming and had access to a computer in a residence near the team's complex in Jupiter, Fla., during spring training in 2014.     Despite efforts by the intruder or intruders to mask their location, the agents were able to trace at least one of the breaches directly back to that computer. At least four members of the team's baseball operations staff have hired criminal defense lawyers, according to people briefed on the investigation.   As part of the government's efforts to determine who might have been operating the computer, federal prosecutors have subpoenaed a wide range of computer information from the Astros, the Cardinals and Major League Baseball. In a sign that the government was still building its case, the Astros received a subpoena in recent months for more information from their network.   If four or five men were working in the residence at one time, electronic forensics alone may not be able to establish whose fingers were on the keyboard.   ''To put it simply, investigators are trying to match up the intrusions with the different times that different Cardinals front-office personnel were on the computer,'' said one person briefed on the case. ''It has been very difficult.''   Another person briefed on the investigation added, ''The F.B.I. has some sense of how long different guys were on the computer, but it hasn't been easy.''   Whoever gained access to the Astros' network tried to take some measures used by experienced hackers to disguise their location. But, law enforcement officials said, the intruders were not adept.   ''They tried to mask themselves like an experienced hacker and failed,'' said a person briefed on the investigation. ''It's clear they weren't very good at what they were trying to do.''   The inability to properly cover tracks proved to be a significant break for the F.B.I. When the bureau opened an investigation into the breach last year, agents followed the trail of the intrusion directly to the computer that had been used at the residence in Jupiter.   Whoever gained access to the network is believed to have done so by logging in as Jeff Luhnow, the Astros' general manager, or Sig Mejdal, whose title is director of decision sciences. Both officials joined the Astros from the Cardinals. The intruder or intruders examined the Cardinals' network and determined the passwords that Mr. Luhnow and Mr. Mejdal had used when they were with the Cardinals. Using those passwords, they gained access to the Astros' network.   The slip-up in masking the location was similar to one that hackers made last year when they broke into Sony Pictures' networks before the premiere of the film ''The Interview,'' a comedy about a plot to kill North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. The hackers posted many of Sony's emails and other internal communications online, embarrassing the company's executives. While the hackers took many steps to cover their tracks, American cybersecurity officials were able to find an instance in which they did not properly mask their location, enabling President Obama to publicly identify the North Korean government as the culprit and impose sanctions.   ''The North Koreans knew what they were doing but made a mistake; the guys under investigation just weren't very competent,'' said one of the people briefed on the investigation.   As baseball has experienced revolutions in technology and statistics in many ways, it remains relatively unsophisticated in others. Franchises have tried to develop elaborate information-sharing platforms in recent years, but they have increasingly relied on young and inexperienced programmers and analysts, like the ones now under investigation in the Cardinals' front office.   While paying players exorbitant salaries, teams maintain small budgets for their front offices, often leading to the hiring of analysts and programmers right out of college. Those workers, who are paid significantly less than what they could make at a technology company or a start-up, are often enticed by the opportunity to work in baseball in a front-office position.   Because the technology skills of many scouts, coaches and executives are limited, the analysts and programmers have been given significant leeway in building programs, and until now there has been little pressure to put tight security in place. One team executive said he had not changed his password for his team's network in three years.   The Cardinals, the Astros and Major League Baseball have said they will not discuss the specifics of the case until the federal investigation is finished.   The revelation that the Cardinals are under investigation has created one of the first significant challenges faced by Commissioner Rob Manfred since he took office in January.   So far, none of the Cardinals personnel have been put on leave or fired. Mr. Manfred is waiting to see whether the federal government brings charges before he decides whether to discipline the Cardinals. Along with suspending or banishing the front-office personnel who may have been behind the intrusion, he would most likely seek to punish the team and could order it to provide financial compensation to the Astros.

Reasons to Be Paranoid,"Occupy Wall Street, the protest movement that erupted in 2011, didn't do much to curb the financial industry. It didn't die out, though. It went Hollywood. ''Mr. Robot,'' an intriguing new series that debuts on Wednesday on the USA Network, is a case in point: a cyber-age thriller infused with a dark, almost nihilistic pessimism about the Internet, capitalism and income inequality. And that makes it kind of fun.    The show pits a vigilante hacker, Elliot (Rami Malek), against a ruthless multinational conglomerate, E Corp, run by, as Elliot puts it, ''the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent who play God without permission.'' Elliot visualizes the corporate logo as Evil Corp.    This is not the first television series to hack the hackers, so to speak. There are digital dissidents all over the place, including a gifted but deeply weird hacker who befriends one of the heroes of ''American Odyssey,'' an underrated NBC thriller whose season ends on Sunday, and a transgender blogger and reformed hacker who calls herself a ''hacktavist'' on the Netflix series ''Sense8.''  ''The Good Wife,'' on CBS, features a hip billionaire who made his fortune with ChumHum, an Internet search engine. The CBS series ''Person of Interest'' is a paean to surveillance paranoia, pairing a handsome former C.I.A. operative with an eccentric billionaire software nerd to fight shadowy high-level conspirators. And the name of the latest ''CSI'' spinoff says it all: ''CSI: Cyber.''   ''Mr. Robot,'' however, takes the topic even further: The lonely, alienated computer whiz is the hero, not a secondary character, and his solitary battle against, among other things, corporate greed and corruption is at the core of the show. (He also hates debt of all kinds -- credit card, third world and college.)   Millennial bohemians are a familiar cultural type, but Mr. Malek, who was in the ''Night at the Museum'' movies and the HBO mini-series ''The Pacific,'' is both touching and unnerving as a brilliant misanthrope in a hoodie. Elliot is a little like a computer-age version of Travis Bickle from ''Taxi Driver,'' a loner who is paranoid -- even about his own sanity -- and can barely speak to strangers or even friends. Mostly, he vents his darker thoughts in one-way conversations to an imaginary friend.   When his therapist, Krista (Gloria Reuben), asks him why he feels so alienated, Elliot remains mute, but in his head, he gives her a long, sardonic answer. ''Oh, I don't know, is it that we collectively thought that Steve Jobs was a great man even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?'' His mind flashes on an image of young Chinese women on an assembly line, then he moves on to rant about the inane conformity of social media and the illusion of democracy in a system enslaved by money and materialism.   By day, Elliot works as a programmer at a cybersecurity company whose major client is E Corp; it's a job that he found through a childhood friend, Angela (Portia Doubleday). Elliot has a thing for Angela, but she has a handsome, ordinary boyfriend, Ollie (Ben Rappaport), who says things like ''I don't need this kind of negativity in my life.''   In his off hours, Elliot has some scary vices, including hacking into and searching the emails and caches of strangers and even his friends.   Elliot's technical prowess leads him to strange coded evidence of dueling conspiracies: an off-the-grid secret cell of anarchist hackers (led by Christian Slater) who want to recruit Elliot to their cause, and a cabal of powerful business tycoons who seem in control of the global flow of information. One E Corp executive, in particular, seems to understand how computers actually work: Tyrell (Martin Wallstrom), a young, icy-eyed nemesis.   On the other hand, it could all be a figment of Elliot's imagination.   USA has a habit of teaming two handsome but disparate male characters to infiltrate and subvert an affluent milieu. Its ''Royal Pains'' is about a doctor who falls afoul of the medical establishment and ends up working as a concierge doctor in the Hamptons, alongside his irresponsible, sybaritic brother. Similarly, ''Suits,'' set in a cutthroat law firm, has a hero, a suave hotshot, who recruits a brainy legal savant without a law degree to help him win cases and climb the career ladder.   ''Mr. Robot'' adapts the formula for a more cynical, anti-establishment moment. Elliot doesn't have a buddy, and he doesn't want conventional success; he wants conventions to fail. When a female friend asks him why he doesn't do social media Elliot explains, ''I'm not on Facebook because I hate Facebook.''   She looks aghast and replies, ''That's crazy.''   Elliot could be crazy or the sanest person in the room.    "
Protecting Cars From Hackers,"The recent revelation that hackers have found ways to remotely take control of cars made by Fiat Chrysler and Tesla is alarming. This is a danger that most drivers had not even imagined. And it comes on the heels of the recalls of millions of cars for dangerous defects.  Automakers are primarily responsibile for securing the technology systems they put into their cars. But these hacking attacks also underscore the need for government to play a more active role in making sure that the software for new entertainment, communications and safety systems being added to cars meets basic standards of security.    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates auto safety, insists that it is closely monitoring these new technologies, and is running tests on car software. The agency has also encouraged the industry to create an information-sharing center through which companies can exchange information on security threats.   That's good news. But N.H.T.S.A. should also start writing basic security standards that require automakers to test the software and make sure a car's wireless system cannot be used to control the engine and brakes. The agency's regulations on airbags, seatbelts and crash testing have helped save countless lives. New rules for software that operate cars could prove just as important.   As car technology advances, driving will become safer and more enjoyable. One system being developed jointly by industry and government would let cars communicate with one another using wireless frequencies. The Department of Transportation says this could reduce accidents by as much as 80 percent by warning drivers when they are getting close to other cars.   But these new systems will fail at times and hackers will try to find ways to subvert them. That's why it's important that regulators develop security rules for cars, which are becoming computers on wheels. A bill introduced by two Democratic senators, Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, would require the N.H.T.S.A. to do that and also require the Federal Trade Commission to come up with rules protecting consumer privacy as more cars are able to collect data on where they are driven. Automakers have access to this data, but it is unclear how they are using it.   The recent recalls by General Motors, Takata and other companies have weakened public trust in the industry and N.H.T.S.A. Automakers hid information about defects or took too long to act, while the agency was slow to piece together evidence that would have helped it identify problems sooner. Aggressively addressing concerns about the security of car software would help win back public confidence.   Meanwhile, Congress should give the agency more resources. Its 2015 budget of $268.5 million for safety research and operations has barely kept up with inflation in the last decade.

The Manic World of Hackers,"There's a scene during the sixth episode of USA's ''Mr. Robot'' in which the lead character, a painfully anxious computer hacker named Elliot, pulls off an extraordinary feat. He cripples a prison's security system to free a single inmate: a drug dealer whose thugs have been holding Elliot's girlfriend captive. After he frees the bad guy, he is handed the keys to the car he's been riding around in all day. In the trunk lies his girlfriend, dead. The hand-held camera pivots around Elliot's face. With his jaw clenched and bulbous eyes downcast, the reaction of the actor Rami Malek is so minimalist as to be disturbing. Sam Esmail, the creator and show runner of ''Mr. Robot,'' said that there had been a question about how to approach the moment. ''Finding this person that you really deeply cared about dead in the trunk and you're not exploding in tears?'' Mr. Esmail said by telephone from Los Angeles. But, he continued, ''We were never worried about getting the audience to like Elliot.''     It is that sort of stubbornly confident storytellingthat has made ''Mr. Robot,'' which has its first-season finale Wednesday night, one of the most acclaimed shows of the summer. Critics have praised Mr. Malek's performance, the show's hacker-world verisimilitude and its visual aesthetic. And even though the show's ratings (which started at 2.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen's live-plus-three-days data, and have declined to 2.3 million) still fall below USA stalwarts like ''Suits,'' the network was enthusiastic enough about the show to order for a second season even before its debut.   Mr. Esmail, who released ''Comet,'' his first film, in 2014, conceived ''Mr. Robot'' out of a passion for socioeconomic causes -- and tech. He cites the 2008 financial crisis, the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring demonstrations as sources of both frustration and inspiration. ''I'm Egyptian,'' said Mr. Esmail, who was born in New Jersey. ''And to see my cousins over there in their late teens and early 20s channel their anger for this really positive change using technology, that was incredibly moving to me.''   Mr. Esmail wrote an overlong screenplay about a gifted hacker with debilitating social anxiety who falls in with a loose cadre of radical hackers intent on destroying the world's largest corporation, E Corp. He eventually decided the spiraling narrative would be better served as a television series.   ''Mr. Robot'' features a largish ensemble, but the show hinges on Mr. Malek's Elliot, who is both its delusional protagonist and grim, unreliable narrator. Remembering how he prepared to audition for the role, Mr. Malek, 34, said, ''I watched De Niro in 'Taxi Driver' many times over.''   Sitting in the Bowery Hotel lobby, wearing a backward baseball cap and sneakers, Mr. Malek, probably best known for his role in the 2010 HBO mini-series ''The Pacific,'' gives off nothing of the tightly wound, cornered-animal vibe to which viewers have become accustomed. The raspy voice, though, is unmistakable. ''I had my hair in a way that was reflective of that -- not a mohawk, but a high and tight fade. I came into the audition with that and Sam was like, 'Keep it.' '' (For the record, Mr. Esmail doesn't remember it that way. Also, ''Rami did not know his lines in that first audition,'' he says. ''Did he tell you that part?'')   Like Mr. Esmail, Mr. Malek is of Egyptian heritage. His father was a tour guide in Cairo, who, after moving to the United States and selling insurance door to door, began emphasizing to his son that he do something ''special'' with his life. For Mr. Malek, special has always meant more than seeing his face on billboards looming over the town where he grew up. It's meant ''looking at the world and seeing how I can affect it,'' Mr. Malek said.   For the show's creator, when he looks at the world, it's one in which technology is an alienating force. ''There is a loneliness associated with the modern lifestyle,'' Mr. Esmail said. ''There is a paranoia around technology and that's palpable. You can connect. You can see old high school friends on Facebook. Then that loneliness creeps up. Where is it coming from? Are all of these tools at your disposal somehow making it feel worse? Whatever that inexplicable feeling is, that's the thing that I think is resonating with people.''   But while ''Mr. Robot'' may have tapped into millennial angst, the show has not wallowed in it. Over nine episodes, it has been relentless, sensational and unabashedly suspenseful. The musical score is pure, distilled paranoia. The cinematography often pushes characters to the edge of the screen, leaving swaths of empty space around their heads. And the plot twists, even the predictable ones, have ratcheted up the action. ''I wanted every episode to be a 10,'' Mr. Esmail said.   Comparisons have been drawn to films by David Fincher, particularly ''Fight Club.'' (Viewers caught up with the show know exactly how apt that comparison is.) To that, Mr. Esmail adds other late-90s thrillers like ''The Game'' and ''The Usual Suspects'' and such high-wire '70s fare as ''The Parallax View,'' ''Three Days of the Condor'' and, of course, ''Taxi Driver.'' (''The best film about a character that I have ever seen,'' Mr. Esmail said. ''You got inside the head of this guy in such an intimate way.'')   Mr. Esmail, a staunch advocate of voice-over, has not only allowed the audience into Elliot's head but also vice versa. The character repeatedly breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience -- sometimes conspiratorially, sometimes antagonistically -- creating an uneasy sense of intimacy with the viewer. ''The spin I've taken is that we're his friend,'' Mr. Esmail said. ''We can betray him. We can believe in him. We can be complicit in his actions.''   To maintain that delicate connection, potentially over multiple seasons during which Mr. Esmail plans to explore Elliot's mental health in depth, the show's creator and star decided that the actor would typically internalize even the character's strongest emotions rather than ''going big.''   ''When things leak out of your eyes or your facial expressions,'' Mr. Malek said, ''it's so much more effective than spilling it all.'' Hence, Elliot's response to his girlfriend's murder. But while Mr. Esmail maintains that the reaction was firmly predetermined before shooting, his star's version of the story differs slightly.   ''He goes, 'How are you going to play that moment?' '' Mr. Malek said. ''And I'm like, 'Do you want to know or do you want me to surprise you?' ''    "
"Chinese Hackers Breached LoopPay, Whose Tech Is Central to Samsung Pay","WASHINGTON -- Months before its technology became the centerpiece of Samsung's new mobile payment system, LoopPay, a small Massachusetts subsidiary of the South Korean electronics giant, was the target of a sophisticated attack by a group of government-affiliated Chinese hackers. As early as March, the hackers -- alternatively known as the Codoso Group or Sunshock Group by those who track them -- had breached the computer network of LoopPay, a start-up in Burlington, Mass., that was acquired by Samsung in February for more than $250 million, according to several people briefed on the still-unfolding investigation, as well as Samsung and LoopPay executives.     LoopPay executives said the Codoso hackers appeared to have been after the company's technology, known as magnetic secure transmission, or MST, which is a key part of the Samsung Pay mobile payment wallet that made its public debut in the United States last week.   Like similar mobile payment systems from Apple and Google, Samsung Pay allows consumers to pay for goods using their Samsung smartphones with so-called near-field communications technology, which uses a wireless signal to send payment information from a phone to newer cash registers. But LoopPay's MST technology has an advantage: It also works with older payment systems by emulating a commonly used magnetic stripe card.   The attackers are believed to have broken into LoopPay's corporate network, but not the production system that helps manage payments, said Will Graylin, LoopPay's chief executive and co-general manager of Samsung Pay. Mr. Graylin said that security experts were still looking through LoopPay's systems, but that there had been no indication that the hackers infiltrated Samsung's systems or that consumer data had been exposed.   LoopPay did not learn of the breach until late August, when an organization came across LoopPay's data while tracking the Codoso Group in a separate investigation.   Both LoopPay and Samsung executives said they were confident that they had removed infected machines, and that customer payment information and personal devices were not affected. They added that there was no need to delay the introduction of Samsung Pay, which had its debut in the United States last week after executing more than $30 million worth of purchases in South Korea.   ''Samsung Pay was not impacted and at no point was any personal payment information at risk,'' Darlene Cedres, Samsung's chief privacy officer, said in a statement. ''This was an isolated incident that targeted the LoopPay corporate network, which is a physically separate network. The LoopPay corporate network issue was resolved immediately and had nothing to do with Samsung Pay.''   But two people briefed on the investigation, as well as security experts who have been tracking the Codoso hackers as they have targeted hundreds of victims around the world, said it would be premature to say what the hackers did and did not accomplish since they were discovered in August.   To start, the hackers were inside LoopPay's network for five months before they were discovered. And the Codoso Group is known for maintaining a hidden foothold in its victims' systems. Security experts say the group's modus operandi is to plant hidden back doors across victims' systems so that they continue to infiltrate their networks long after the initial breach.   In a multistage Codoso attack of Forbes in February, for example, the group infected the website of Forbes.com with malicious code that infected the site's visitors. But that was just the start. From there, other members of the group used that foothold in visitors' machines to search for valuable targets in the defense sector.   After a similar attack by another Chinese state-affiliated hacking group on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2011, the chamber believed it had rid hackers from its network only to discover months later that an office printer and even a thermometer in one of its corporate apartments were still sending information back to computers in China.   Samsung introduced Samsung Pay in the United States just 38 days after LoopPay learned it had been breached. On average, it takes 46 days before an attack by hackers can be fully resolved, according to the Ponemon Institute, a nonprofit that tracks breaches. But the time to fix the damage is typically much longer in cases of sophisticated Chinese hackings like the one at LoopPay.   ''Once Codoso compromises their targets -- which range from dissidents to C-level executives in the U.S. -- they tend to stay there for quite a long time, building out their access points so they can easily get back in,'' said John Hultquist, the head of intelligence on cyberespionage at iSight Partners, a security firm. ''They'll come back to a previous organization of interest again and again.''   LoopPay hired two private forensics teams to investigate the breach on Aug. 21, just a month before it was set to bring Samsung Pay to the United States, according to Mr. Graylin. Both are still working the case.   But the investigation has been unusual from the start. LoopPay told the teams to look at different portions of its network. One of the firms, Sotoria, which is based in Charleston, S.C., was given a backup of LoopPay's data and asked to leave the company's headquarters after just three days.   Mr. Graylin said that was because the team was looking at LoopPay systems that he said fell outside the scope of the initial contract, in what Mr. Graylin described as an attempt to extract more fees. Even so, he said, LoopPay was still working with the company to resolve the breach.   Sotoria executives said they could not comment on the investigation. Mr. Graylin would not name the second computer forensics firm looking into the attack.   LoopPay has not notified law enforcement about the breach, Mr. Graylin said, because his firm believed no customer data or financial information had been stolen.   He also played down concerns that hackers might try to use the information they stole about his company's technology in order to infiltrate Samsung Pay or create a copycat product. He said if such a thing emerged, LoopPay could file a patent lawsuit. What's more, he said, it would be viable only if major banks, credit card companies and carriers were willing to team up with the copycat.   News of the breach at LoopPay comes at a particularly inopportune time for Samsung, which is locked in a bitter war for smartphone supremacy against Apple and its immensely popular iPhone, as well as a newer crop of less expensive devices from manufacturers like China's Xiaomi.

Infrastructure Armageddon,"SAN FRANCISCO  -- Over the last four years, foreign hackers have stolen source code and blueprints to the oil and water pipelines and power grid of the United States and have infiltrated the Department of Energy's networks 150 times. So what's stopping them from shutting us down?    The phrase ''cyber-Pearl Harbor'' first appeared in the 1990s. For the last 20 years, policy makers have predicted catastrophic situations in which hackers blow up oil pipelines, contaminate the water supply, open the nation's floodgates and send airplanes on collision courses by hacking air traffic control systems.   ''They could, for example, derail passenger trains or, even more dangerous, derail trains loaded with lethal chemicals,'' former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned in 2012. ''They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.''    It is getting harder to write off such predictions as fearmongering. The number of attacks against industrial control systems more than doubled to 675,186 in January 2014 from 163,228 in January 2013, according to Dell Security -- most of those in the United States, Britain and Finland.   And in many cases, outages at airports and financial exchanges -- like a computer outage that took down computers at airports across the country late Wednesday, including Kennedy International Airport in New York and Logan Airport in Boston -- are never tied to hacks.   But it's clear hackers are trying.    The Department of Homeland Security last year announced that it was investigating an attack against 1,000 energy companies across Europe and North America. In 2012, 23 gas pipeline companies were hacked by online spies, according to a Homeland Security report. Private investigators later linked the attack to China.   Last year, in a disclosure overshadowed by the news of the attack on Sony, a German federal agency said that in an attack at an unnamed steel mill, hackers had managed to jump from the company's corporate network to its production systems, causing significant damage to a blast furnace.   And in an extensive attack at Telvent, an information technology and industrial automation company now owned by Schneider Electric, Chinese hackers made off with its product source code and blueprints to facilities operated by its customers, which include 60 percent of the pipeline operators in North America.   For now, dire predictions of destructive online attacks on American targets ignore the fact that the actors with the ability to cause the gravest harm to America's critical infrastructure -- China and Russia and allies like Israel and Britain -- are sufficiently deterred from doing so by fear of retaliation or because of longstanding trade and diplomatic relationships. And attacks by those aggressively trying to get such a capability -- Iran, North Korea and Islamic militant groups -- are still several years off.   ''Despite all the talks of a cyber-Pearl Harbor, I am not really worried about a state competitor like China doing catastrophic damage to infrastructure,'' said Michael V. Hayden, former head of the National Security Agency. ''It's the attack from renegade, lower-tier nation-states that have nothing to lose.''   Just how far off are they? That is the question troubling policy makers at the National Security Council and intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Federal officials have repeatedly warned that Islamic State militants have been exploiting social media for recruitment, and are developing tools to break into their enemies' systems.   Those capabilities were sufficient to prompt the assassination of Junaid Hussain, the chief of the Islamic State's cyberarmy, who was killed by an airstrike in Syria in August. But for now, federal officials say, the Islamic State does not have a significant ability to cause damage through online attacks.   ''It's not easy to pull off a spectacular attack,'' said James A. Lewis, a security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''People are always saying in theory they can do something, but it's not at the level of a Pearl Harbor or a 9/11.''   Mr. Lewis added: ''Could someone acquire the ability to cause a blackout? That's something to worry about, but the only people who could pull it off don't have any interest in doing so.''   Most security experts point to the attacks last year at Sony -- where hackers leaked internal documents and destroyed the company's servers -- as an example of the destruction that is possible now, and a harbinger of what may come.   There were warnings the year before the Sony hacking that such an incident was possible. In a carefully planned attack in 2013, North Korean hackers knocked out almost 50,000 computers and servers for several days at South Korean banks and media companies.   Less sophisticated attackers are more likely to continue to pursue social media campaigns and isolated attacks, rather than take down parts of the power grid, said Ralph Langner, an independent security expert who was the first to attribute Stuxnet, a virtual weapon used against Iranian nuclear centrifuges, to the United States and Israel.   But the attacks that have rattled American government officials the most were similar attacks at Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, and RasGas, the Qatari oil giant, in 2012.   At Aramco, the hackers replaced the data on employees' hard drives with an image of a burning American flag. United States intelligence officials say Aramco's attackers were hackers in Iran, although they offered no specific evidence to support the claim. Mr. Panetta, then secretary of defense, called the Aramco sabotage ''a significant escalation of the cyberthreat.''   Forensics specialists who were called in to analyze the Aramco attack said there was evidence the attackers probed the network that connects the company's pipelines but were never able to cross from Aramco's corporate network to its production systems. The same was true for a similar attack at RasGas two weeks later. Hackers tried and failed to hit the Qatari petroleum company's production systems, but successfully took its corporate networks and servers offline.   But the attack on the German steel mill, disclosed last year, suggests that hackers are increasingly finding ways to cross that threshold. Just last week, it was announced that a group of hackers penetrated the Snohomish County Public Utility District in Washington State. The hackers, members of the Washington State National Guard, had been invited to test the utility's defenses, and the results were frightening. They were able to break in with an email in under 22 minutes.   Joe Weiss, a crusader for industrial control security and founder of Applied Control Solutions, a consulting firm, is not surprised. He manages a database of 750 incidents that affected control systems and said he was most disturbed that most of them were not classified as attacks at all.   ''What that tells you is that not only do we not have the mitigation, we don't even have any type of adequate forensics to know this is happening, and whether it was intentional or unintentional,'' he said.   The Department of Homeland Security tweeted late Wednesday evening that the computer outages at airports were due to a ''brief outage that lasted 90 minutes'' on the United States Customs and Border Protection's computer processing systems.   But Mr. Weiss said in most cases, forensics investigations were still not adequate enough to nail down the real source of such incidents. He said the same was true across the electric, water, oil, gas, and nuclear industries.    ''It's not like with weapons, where you know where it's coming from,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''With cyber- and control systems, you don't necessarily know.''   ''Will there be a cyber-Pearl Harbor? Most likely,'' Mr. Weiss added. ''Will we know it's cyber? Most likely not.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"UltraDNS Server Problem Pulls Down Websites, Including Netflix, for 90 Minutes","SAN FRANCISCO -- UltraDNS, a web content delivery service, went down Thursday afternoon, taking with it a number of popular websites, including Netflix and Expedia. The cause of the 90-minute failure was an internal issue in a server on the East Coast and was not the result of an attack by hackers, said Lara Wyss, an UltraDNS spokeswoman.     Initially, members of the UltraDNS support team indicated the issue stemmed from a DDoS or Denial of Service attack in which hackers flood a service with traffic until it collapses under the load. But after further investigation, the company's chief information officer said that the issue was not caused by a DDoS assault but by a technical malfunction, Ms. Wyss said in an interview.   The system failure was quickly resolved but had a ripple effect across the Internet, as many companies depend on the company's cloud service to run their websites. Several frustrated customers, and administrators, broadcast their complaints on Twitter.   UltraDNS is considered one of the top providers in the web content delivery space. It and competitors like Akamai and CloudFlare play a key role in directing and managing web traffic for businesses that depend on the service for website speeds and protection against DDoS attacks. The company was acquired in 2006 by Neustar, an information services company based in Sterling, Va.   The failure on Thursday was the second time in two years the service has gone down, according to Dotcom Monitor, a company in Minneapolis that monitors web speeds and performance. In January 2013, UltraDNS suffered a similar failure that affected customers around the world.   The assumption that UltraDNS was under attack was not unreasonable given an increase -- over the past 18 months -- in high-volume DDoS attacks that exploit the Internet's switchboard system, called the Domain Name System, or DNS, to amplify the attacks. Many of those attacks have come from China against China-specific websites, said Matthew Prince, the chief executive at CloudFlare.   Attackers are now sending forged traffic requests that appear legitimate, making it difficult to root them out. These attacks come at such a high rate -- in some cases 500 million requests per second -- that only the toughest websites can fend them off, Mr. Prince said.    "
Famed for Tango and Hackers,"BUENOS AIRES --  Want to learn how to break into the computerized heart of a medical device or an electronic voting machine? Maybe a smartphone or even a car? Thanks to the legacy of military rule and a culture of breaking rules of all sorts, Argentina has become one of the best places on earth to find people who could show you how. As Silicon Valley's talent war has gone global, particularly for those skilled at breaking into things, this Latin American nation has become a rich recruiting ground for corporations and foreign governments. Companies need hackers to help defend against online criminals and state-sponsored spies. And as the world's critical infrastructure moves online and the threat of war moves into cyberspace, governments are desperate to acquire hackers' tools.    ''Cheating the system is part of the Argentine mentality,'' said Cesar Cerrudo, an Argentine security researcher who taught himself to hack as a young teenager living in Paraná, a small town in the northeastern part of the country. Mr. Cerrudo recently gained attention for successfully hacking into traffic light systems in cities across the United States.    ''Unless you are rich, you grow up without a computer or reading books. To access new software, you have to hack it, and you have to teach yourself everything from the ground up,'' he said.   Within Latin America, Brazil has become known in recent years as the world leader in Internet banking fraud. But Argentina's hackers have a reputation for creativity. In particular, they are known for their ability to find so-called zero-day flaws, which are unpatched holes in widely used technology that can be used to spy on or even destroy adversaries' computer networks.   Technology companies like Apple, Facebook and Google have encrypted their products and services so that in many cases the only way to monitor a target's communications is to hack directly into its device. As a result, there is a new urgency among governments in acquiring zero-day exploits.   A mix of executives from around the world, government officials, contractors and -- or so it was rumored -- spies gathered here in October in an industrial building converted into a cultural center to watch hacking done the Argentine way at the 11th annual EkoParty, the largest hacking conference in Latin America.   It is impossible to say how many hackers live in Argentina, since breaking into computers is not generally a skill that Argentines like to advertise. But EkoParty, which drew 1,600 people this year, is widely known as the best place to find them.   ''Argentina put itself on the map as the country to produce the best hackers,'' said Sinan Eren, an executive at Avast Software, a security company based in Prague, who has been attending the conference for years.   Long before foreign companies came calling, hacking things was a life skill in Argentina, a way to get by through decades of repressive military rule and a volatile economy.   Argentines have a saying, ''atado con alambre,'' which translates roughly as ''held together with wire,'' to describe the inventive nature of so many here who learned to do much with little.   ''Those of us who came of age under a military junta -- who were told which books to read, which movies to watch, which God to worship -- had to learn to move around the laws,'' Norma Morandini, a senator from Córdoba province, told a crowd at the conference. ''For us, hacking became a way of life.''   The country still has one foot in the tech industry's past because of stringent import rules. Amazon will not ship to your door here. BlackBerry has more market share here than Apple. A new iPhone costs $2,000 or more on MercadoLibre, an online auction site, but many iPhone owners said they had been able to persuade a friend traveling from abroad to sneak one through customs.   To get their hands on the latest, greatest devices, Argentines often have to think like a hacker -- or even become one.   ''You make do without resources, without high-end technology, with poor Wi-Fi connections,'' said Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst. ''We improvise creative solutions, for lack of other options, and many have applied these same procedures to the technical industry.''   EkoParty began as a small gathering of Argentine hackers who exchanged their discoveries over the web. Today, hundreds of Argentine hackers, ranging from 14 to 45 years old, line up around the block to show off their skills to executives from Silicon Valley start-ups like Synack, a security company, as well as more established consulting firms like Deloitte, and a growing list of government officials and contractors looking to acquire zero-days for their arsenals.   Among EkoParty's panelists were hackers like Alfredo Ortega, a sweet-natured man from rural Patagonia and professed ''cybergaucho'' and was able to break into a new e-voting system in 20 minutes. Later, over tea and cookies, he demonstrated how to hide malicious code in computer chips.   Mr. Ortega, who now works for Avast Software, is best known for breaking into a computer operating system thought to be invulnerable. His latest work in progress is an X-ray-emitting device that can break into systems that are not even online.   ''Almost anything you give him, he will break,'' said Federico Kirschbaum, who started the EkoParty conference with a fellow Argentine, Francisco Amato. They are also the co-founders of the security company Infobyte.   Other presenters included Juliano Rizzo, an Argentine security researcher who demonstrated a zero-day flaw onstage that some here estimated would have sold for six figures on the black market.   Mr. Rizzo is among many Argentine security researchers who got their start at Core Security, a company founded 20 years ago by six hackers.   In 1996, Core started working with companies and government agencies to find security holes in their networks. Later, they created one of the first automated attack tools designed to penetrate clients' systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities.   ''It was a bold proposition, especially coming from 'some guys in Argentina,''' said Ivan Arce, one of Core's founders. Analysts initially said the tool was unethical, but one of Core's first customers, NASA, helped change minds.   As Core grew, its founders trained the next generation of exploit coders. But those hackers now have far more lucrative options than their predecessors did back in 1996.   Exploits that 20 years ago were discovered out of curiosity, or to defend against criminals, are valuable to an increasing number of governments -- 40 at last count -- that are developing offensive digital weapon programs.   Governments have already started repurposing Argentine exploit tools as spy tools. Last December, two researchers discovered that an Iranian hacking group was using Core's penetration testing tool against Iranian dissidents.   ''This started out as hobbyists sharing exploits as a game,'' Mr. Arce said. ''Now exploits are hoarded for profit.''   Sale of a single exploit can make some hackers rich. Zerodium, a zero-day-exploit broker that sells to governments, said it paid hackers $1 million for an Apple exploit in October. In mid-November, the brokerage firm said it would pay hackers $50,000 for an attack that could take over a victim's machine through a Safari or Internet Explorer browser, and $80,000 for a similar attack through Google's Chrome browser.   Those dollars go a long way in Buenos Aires, where a high-end apartment in Palermo Soho -- a hip neighborhood with a concentration of tech start-ups -- rents for $1,000 a month.   But Argentina's days as the outsourcing capital for hackers may be numbered, Mr. Eren of Avast warns, particularly as the world goes mobile and governments start zeroing in on ways to break into smartphones.   ''Argentina may be hitting a peak,'' Mr. Eren said. ''There's new competition.'' And when it comes to breaking into phone software, he said, ''China is the country now making a mark.''    "
Europe's Digital Regulator Vows to Intervene on Technology Abuses,"BARCELONA, Spain - For many American technology companies, it often feels as if Europe is out to get them. At the Mobile World Congress this week, Andrus Ansip, the digital chief at the European Commission,  reaffirmed the region's tough stance on anticompetitive practices, data protection and tax avoidance. But he tried to play down those concerns by firms in the United States. Many of the top Silicon Valley tech companies, including Google and Apple, have faced regulatory challenges in Europe. They have been accused of taking advantage of their market dominance and using complicated tax arrangements to limit local tax exposure, accusations they have contested.  In an interview at the industry gathering here, Mr. Ansip noted on Tuesday that ""it's acceptable that some companies have dominant positions."" But, Mr. Ansip, the former prime minister of Estonia, added that ""if there are doubts that they are abusing their dominant position, of course, the European Commission will be there to intervene."" His comments come as Europe's antitrust chiefs continue what has been a four-year competition investigation into Google's dominance of the region's online search market, of which the company controls roughly 85 percent. Rivals - including Microsoft, itself the target of a long-running antitrust case in Europe - have complained that Google has used its dominance to give preferential treatment to its other online services. The search giant has denied these accusations. Some European telecommunications operators have called for increased regulation of services like online search and social networking. Industry executives say that these services often compete with those of traditional European carriers, which must comply with more onerous rules than their counterparts in the United States. ""We can't live in a world where we compete, but we have one arm tied behind our backs, and they don't,"" Pierre Louette, deputy chief executive at the French telecom operator Orange, said at the conference. ""When it comes to search, you have a limited choice."" As Europe tries to reignite its sputtering economy, Mr. Ansip is set to introduce a number of regulatory proposals in May aimed at creating a so-called single digital market across the 28-country bloc. Currently, services like movie streaming, as well as online copyright and data protection, are all regulated at the national level. The European Commission hopes that by creating a single digital market across Europe, local and non-European tech businesses will be able to flourish. ""The online market is really fragmented,"" Mr. Ansip said on Tuesday. ""I wish that everything that is possible in the offline world can be allowed to happen online."" Europe's attempt to reposition its digital economy, however, faces a number of challenges. The European Union is working on finalizing so-called open Internet rules - similar to what was approved by the United States Federal Communications Commission last week - that would forbid carriers from blocking or throttling online traffic. Operators also would not be able to charge for pay-to-play access to their networks, which allow some tech and media companies to pay for better access than what is offered to other customers. These proposals, known collectively as net neutrality, have angered many in the industry who say they must be allowed to prioritize some Internet traffic to manage their networks efficiently. Europe also plans to revamp its data protection rules, already some of the most stringent in the world. The new rules would provide for fines of up to $125 million, or 5 percent of a company's revenue, whichever was greater, if an individual's online information was misused. Many Europeans favor such proposals, although some American tech companies, which often move individuals' personal data between Europe and the United States, have said that the rules could hamper how they manage their operations. ""Trust is the basis for all digital services,"" Mr. Ansip said when asked about the role of data protection in Europe's pending regulatory overhaul. ""Trust is an absolute must."" "
Bain Buys Blue Coat,"The private equity firm Bain Capital is poised to acquire Blue Coat Systems for $2.4 billion, in a nod to the fast-growing cybersecurity market. Thoma Bravo, the buyout firm, agreed to sell Blue Coat in an all-cash deal after taking it private in 2012 for $1.3 billion. Based in California, Blue Coat provides security solutions for more than three-quarters of the Fortune 500 companies.     In the three years since Thoma Bravo took the company private, it has acquired a series of companies to help it bolster its security offerings in areas like security analytics.   ''We are very impressed with the profitable growth the company has demonstrated and believe strongly in the future growth of the cyber security market and Blue Coat's position in this important sector,'' David Humphrey, a managing director at Bain Capital, said in a statement.   Bain Capital could look to take the company back to the public markets, according to someone familiar with the company's thinking but not authorized to speak publicly.   Gregory S. Clark, chief executive of Blue Coat, said the deal with Bain Capital would help to set the company ''on the trajectory to further grow our portfolio, better serve our customers and help us prepare to return to the public markets.''   The deal has not been finalized but both parties have entered a definitive agreement.   Goldman Sachs advised Blue Coat, while the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is acting as legal adviser. Jefferies Finance is providing the financing commitments, and Jefferies is acting as sole financial adviser to Bain Capital. Ropes & Gray is acting as legal counsel, and PricewaterhouseCoopers is serving as accounting adviser to Bain Capital.

Fed Deflects Outside Aid to Investigate Data Leaks,"A review of the Federal Reserve's response to recent leaks about its bond-buying plans raises new questions about the central bank's efforts to police interactions with investors who can profit handsomely from inside information. In January 2011, the Fed adopted new rules for dealing with breaches, after a private research firm published an account of the central bank's deliberations. Under the policy, an internal watchdog -- the agency's inspector general -- was responsible for conducting investigations.    But the next year, when a different research firm revealed details to its clients about a new round of bond-buying, Fed officials did not tell the inspector general or law enforcement about the breach. They spent nearly six months conducting their own investigation; they didn't find the source of the leak.   Then, in 2014, the Fed rewrote the rules, increasing the importance of such internal reviews and playing down the inspector general's role.    The leak, and the Fed's response, are now in the spotlight. They are the subject of investigations by the Justice Department, the House Financial Services Committee and the Fed's inspector general. Members of both political parties have demanded a full accounting of the matter.   But less attention has been focused on the Fed's reliance on internal investigations to police the leaks.   The issue of leaks has cropped up intermittently almost since the Fed's creation in 1913, as investors endlessly chase after the central bank's valuable secrets. Investors can make a lot of money by gleaning confidential details about the direction of monetary policy.   Andrew Levin, a former Fed economist who played a key role in creating the 2011 policy, said senior officials concluded at the time that the central bank did not have the resources to conduct its own investigations. He said he did not understand why the Fed deviated from that judgment in 2012, or why it later changed the policy.   ''It was a carefully considered decision, which reflected the fact that the inspector general's office was the only part of the Fed that had any investigative capabilities at that time,'' said Mr. Levin, who left the Fed in September 2012 and now works at the International Monetary Fund.   Laurence M. Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who has criticized the Fed for an overly cozy relationship with the financial industry, says the central bank has an obligation to explain more clearly what happened in 2012, and how it plans to prevent leaks.   Mr. Ball compared the episode to an analyst publishing advance details of Microsoft's earnings. ''Only this is the U.S. Treasury market,'' Mr. Ball said. ''It's a much bigger deal.''   A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment on the record about the 2011 policy, the investigation of the 2012 leak or the changes made in 2014.   Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, has told Congress the Fed takes the matter seriously and is awaiting results of the various investigations.   ''We recognize in particular the importance of safeguarding confidential information that could advantage individuals who gain access to it,'' Ms. Yellen wrote in a letter last month addressed to Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.   At the time of the 2012 leak, investors were eager for information about the Fed's plans.   In September 2012, the Fed had announced a new phase in its bond-buying campaign: It would accumulate mortgage bonds until job growth improved substantially.   On Oct. 3, one day before the Fed released an account of its deliberations, Medley Global Advisors sent a note to clients offering two pieces of valuable information. Come December, the Fed would start buying Treasuries, too. And instead of merely aiming at job growth, it would specify a target level for unemployment.   The author, Regina Schleiger, also included a juicy tidbit. Some of the Fed's staff, she said, had stayed up past midnight preparing for the meeting.   Medley sells access to investors. The company's website says it seeks information ''by cultivating relationships with senior policy makers around the globe.''   In March 2009, a day after a meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee, Ms. Schleiger participated in a conference call for investors. The Fed was in a ''blackout period'' after the meeting, during which its officials were not supposed to talk about policy. But Ms. Schleiger said she had spoken with some of those officials ''since they broke from yesterday's meeting,'' according to a transcript.   She also shared a colorful detail. When Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke had spoken earlier that month in his hometown, Dillon, S.C., ''They had to buy him a blazer for the appearance,'' Ms. Schleiger said. That did not appear in any published account of his appearance.   The information in the Fed's minutes often produces large movements in financial markets, according to a 2013 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On the day Ms. Schleiger published her memo, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was 1.61 percent. After the minutes were published the next day, it rose to 1.74 percent on the day. Investors who saw the memo -- titled ''Fed: December Bound'' -- could have profited by anticipating that movement.   No clear evidence has emerged that anyone did. But J. W. Verret, a law professor at George Mason University, said the Fed should have referred the matter to law enforcement immediately because of the possibility that the leak amounted to insider trading. Mr. Verret, previously senior counsel for the House Financial Services Committee, initiated the committee's investigation of the leak when he first learned about it from media reports in December 2013.   ''Presented with this clear of a possibility of insider trading, to me it's a no-brainer that you should contact the F.B.I.,'' Mr. Verret said.   Instead, the day after Ms. Schleiger sent her research note, Mr. Bernanke informed members of the policy-making committee that he had asked two Fed officials to ''look closely'' into the leak, according to a summary of the resulting investigation that the Fed released in March 2015.   The review was conducted by William B. English, an economist who ran the Fed's powerful monetary affairs division and served as the committee's secretary, and Scott G. Alvarez, the Fed's general counsel. The Fed's 2011 policy for investigating leaks -- formulated by a committee headed by Ms. Yellen, then the Fed's vice chairwoman -- had called for those two officials to conduct an ''initial review'' and then determine whether to request a full investigation. The results of that investigation would be reported to the Federal Open Market Committee, which consisted of the Fed chairman and other top monetary officials.   Instead, in March 2013, Mr. Alvarez and Mr. English reported to the committee that they had not been able to identify the source.   By then, the inspector general had received a tip about the leak, eliminating the need for Mr. Alvarez to request a full investigation.   Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who previously served as a senior adviser to Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, said that the Fed benefited from conversations with investors, particularly as the Fed has pursued a series of experiments in monetary policy to revive the economy.   ''Markets often behave in ways that surprise the policy makers,'' Mr. Faust said. ''It's useful to hear what those folks are thinking.''   Members of both political parties, however, say the Fed must do more to make sure investors are not taking advantage of that access. The Fed continues to adjust the way it deals with those interactions. In January 2014, the Fed made what it described at the time as ''minor changes'' to its rules for leak investigations. In the new policy, the internal review process is no longer described as an ''initial review,'' and its results can now be reported to the F.O.M.C. -- just as the Fed had done in March 2013.   The inspector general's office was part of the discussions that led to adoption of the 2011 policy. But John Manibusan, a spokesman for the office, said it was not consulted about the 2014 changes. He added that the inspector general's office retained its ability to initiate investigations, as it has done in the case of the 2012 leak.    "
What You Need to Know About China's Draft Cybersecurity Law,"China, which has some of the world's tightest Internet restrictions, has released a draft of a new cybersecurity law, which authorizes broad powers to control the flow of online information. The bill, which has been translated into English on the China Law Translate website, comes after the recent passage of a law on national security and with the expected approval of bills on nongovernmental organizations and counterterrorism.  Here's a look at some of the main provisions of the cybersecurity bill, and what it tells us about the structure of China's Internet control apparatus:  Most of the provisions are not new. China has long taken steps to restrict many types of online content, from pornography to political discussions. Many foreign sites are blocked, and domestic sites use automated censorship mechanisms as well as staff members to remove posts on restricted topics.  Even the most aggressive measures discussed in the draft, restricting Internet access in a particular region to ""safeguard the national security, social stability or handle a sudden major incident of concern for social safety,"" have been used. In 2009, China shut off nearly all Internet access and international calls in the far western region of Xinjiang for months, after deadly riots in the city of Urumqi. But often such powers were defined in lower-level regulations or even Internet companies' contracts. By elevating them to a national law, Chinese authorities are signaling that they are placing a high priority on compliance and that they want to ""make it harder for Internet companies to avoid or drag feet on implementation,"" said Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch based in Hong Kong. ""The law is meant to say the party is serious about controlling the Internet,"" she said.  A warning to global companies. China has long been a difficult place for foreign technology companies to thrive. Many sites, including Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube, are partly or completely blocked. Some clauses, such as a requirement for the development of safeguards on ""critical information infrastructure,"" could further curtail the activities of foreign companies, but the details are still unclear. ""The foreign business community will be reading the law closely, trying to determine how the cybersecurity standards and procurement provisions will be implemented,"" Adam Segal, an expert on China and digital policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote. ""The past few months will not give them great comfort, as Beijing has adopted a national security law and other provisions to make technology used in China 'secure and controllable.' ""  The Cyberspace Administration of China has a crucial role. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the bill is not the powers that it spells out, but who holds them. Analysts say the draft shows clear signs that the Cyberspace Administration and its director, Lu Wei, drive Internet policy and that it gives the body great powers to guide research and education. "
Data Acquistion,"A consortium of investors led by the private equity firm the Carlyle Group has agreed to acquire the data storage company Veritas Technologies from Symantec for $8 billion in cash.  Carlyle said on Tuesday that it would acquire the company with the Singapore sovereign wealth fund G.I.C. and other investors.    ''Veritas is a market innovator with global scale, an iconic brand and significant growth potential,'' Patrick R. McCarter, a managing director at the Carlyle Group, said in a news release.   The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close near the end of the year.   Veritas, which was founded in 1983 and is based in Mountain View, Calif., provides data storage and server management software. It generated $2.6 billion in revenue in the 2015 fiscal year, which ended in March.   The deal came after Symantec, which specializes in security software, announced plans in October to divide its operations into two businesses: one focused on computer security software for businesses and consumers, and the other on information management, the Veritas line of business.   Symantec said the deal would allow it to focus on its computer security software business.   ''Taking this decisive step forward will enable each business to maximize its potential,'' Michael A. Brown, the president and chief executive of Symantec, said in a news release. ''Both businesses will have substantial operational and financial scale to thrive.''   Symantec agreed to acquire Veritas in 2004 for $13.5 billion in stock.   If the deal is completed, William T. Coleman III, the founder of the software companies BEA Systems and Cassatt, would serve as chief executive of Veritas. For the past five years, he has been a partner with Alsop Louie Partners, a venture capital firm in San Francisco.   L. William Krause, a Carlyle executive and the former chief executive of 3Com, would serve as the chairman of Veritas.   ''Bill Coleman is a proven leader whose strategic vision and strong execution skills will leverage Veritas's newfound position as a private, stand-alone company to grow the firm and provide customers an integrated information management solution,'' Mr. McCarter said.   Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS Investment Bank are advising Carlyle and G.I.C. The law firms Alston & Bird, Latham & Watkins, Allen & Overy and Covington & Burling are also advising Carlyle, while the law firms Ropes & Gray and Sidley Austin are advising G.I.C.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Bernie Sanders Campaign Is Disciplined for Breaching Hillary Clinton Data,"The Democratic National Committee has told the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that it was suspending its access to its voter database after a software error enabled at least one of his staff members to review Hillary Clinton's private campaign data. The decision by the party committee is a major blow to Mr. Sanders's campaign. The database includes information from voters across the nation and is used by campaigns to set strategy, especially in the early voting states.  The breach occurred after a software problem at the technology company NGP VAN, which gives campaigns access to the voter data. The problem inadvertently made proprietary voter data of Mrs. Clinton's campaign visible to others, according to party committee officials. The Sanders campaign said that it had fired a staff member who breached Mrs. Clinton's data. But according to three people with direct knowledge of the breach, there were four user accounts associated with the Sanders campaign that ran searches while the security of Mrs. Clinton's data was compromised. The Washington Post first reported the issue. The suspension comes as Mr. Sanders prepares to face Mrs. Clinton at the Democratic debate on Saturday, and as he received the endorsement of a major union, the Communications Workers of America, and a liberal group on Thursday. The Democratic committee blamed NGP VAN for the software glitch. ""This was an isolated incident, and we're conducting a full audit to ensure the integrity of the system and reporting the findings to the D.N.C.,"" Stu Trevelyan, NGP VAN's chief executive, said. ""The D.N.C. was notified on Wednesday by its data systems vendor NGP VAN that as a result of a software patch, all users on the system across Democratic campaigns were inadvertently able to access some data belonging to other campaigns for a brief window,"" said the committee's communications director, Luis Miranda. ""The D.N.C. immediately directed NGP VAN,"" he said, ""to conduct a thorough analysis to identify any users who accessed the data, what actions they took in the system, and to report on the findings to the party and any affected campaign."" He added: ""We have also instructed NGP VAN to conduct a full audit of the system to ensure the integrity of the data and the security of the system for the campaigns that use it, and to begin a review process with every campaign and user to ensure they understand and abide by the rules governing the use of the system. ""The D.N.C. places a high priority on maintaining the security of our system and protecting the data on it,"" he continued. ""We are working with our campaigns and the vendor to have full clarity on the extent of the breach, ensure that this isolated incident does not happen again, and to enable our campaigns to continue engaging voters on the issues that matter most to them and their families."" In a statement, Mr. Sanders's campaign spokesman, Michael Briggs, blamed the vendor for continuing to ""make serious errors."" ""On more than one occasion, the vendor has dropped the firewall between the data of different Democratic campaigns,"" he said. ""Our campaign months ago alerted the D.N.C. to the fact that campaign data was being made available to other campaigns. At that time our campaign did not run to the media, relying instead on assurances from the vendor."" ""Unfortunately, yesterday, the vendor once again dropped the firewall between the campaigns for some data,"" Mr. Briggs said. ""After discussion with the D.N.C., it became clear that one of our staffers accessed some modeling data from another campaign. That behavior is unacceptable and that staffer was immediately fired."" He added that the errors had also ""made our records vulnerable."" Despite repeated requests, the Sanders campaign did not provide information about the other user accounts that were involved.

Democrats and Sanders Clash Over Data Breach,"A fight between the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders and the Democratic leadership went public on Friday as the party punished the campaign over a data breach and the Sanders camp sued the party and accused it of actively trying to help Hillary Clinton. The dispute came after members of Mr. Sanders's data team were found to have gotten access to, searched and stored proprietary information from Mrs. Clinton's team during a software glitch with an important voter database. The Democratic National Committee acted swiftly to deny the Sanders campaign future access to the party's 50-state voter file, which contains information about millions of Democrats and is invaluable to campaigns on a daily basis.    Late Friday night, the national committee and the Sanders campaign said they had come to an agreement to restore the campaign's access to the voter file by Saturday morning. The D.N.C., however, will continue to investigate the breach, according to a statement from the chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.   The committee wants to ''ensure that the data that was inappropriately accessed has been deleted and is no longer in possession of the Sanders campaign,'' the statement said. ''The Sanders campaign has agreed to fully cooperate with the continuing D.N.C. investigation of this breach.''    The Sanders campaign said it was pleased that the committee had reversed what it called an ''outrageous decision.''   ''Now what we need to restore confidence in the D.N.C.'s ability to secure data is an independent audit that encompasses the D.N.C.'s record this entire campaign,'' according to a statement from Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager. ''Transparency at the D.N.C. is essential. We trust they have nothing to hide.''   Earlier in the day, Mr. Weaver accused the party committee of stacking the scales to help Mrs. Clinton, claiming that the Sanders campaign was being unfairly penalized for the data breach. At a news conference, Mr. Weaver insisted that the campaign had dealt with the situation by firing its national data director. Later Friday, the campaign filed a federal lawsuit seeking, among other things, to have its access to the file restored.   The Democratic committee is ''actively'' working to ''undermine'' the Sanders campaign, Mr. Weaver said, reflecting its longstanding frustration that the party apparatus, which is supposed to be neutral, is lining up behind Mrs. Clinton.   Beyond the question of whether the punishment fit the act, the flare-up came as the committee has already been accused of staging the party's debates at times of low television viewership -- like the one being held Saturday night -- to diminish the chances that Mrs. Clinton's two rivals, Mr. Sanders and Martin O'Malley, will be able to raise their profiles.   While Mr. Sanders's aides sought to show themselves as insurgents being unfairly penalized by the establishment, Mrs. Clinton's team and its allies used the issue Friday to try to puncture Mr. Sanders's reputation as a different kind of politician.   ''Think if one company accessed and stole another's customer data. This is no small thing,'' wrote a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, the former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, on Twitter. Mr. Sanders's camp ''should be careful playing the victim.''   Ms. Wasserman Schultz said it was indisputable that the Sanders campaign had gained access to information that it knew it was not entitled to. If the situation were reversed, she told CNN, the Sanders campaign would expect the same type of discipline of the Clinton campaign.   ''The Sanders campaign doesn't have anything other than bluster at the moment that they can put out there,'' she said. ''It's like if you found the front door of a house unlocked and someone decided to go into the house and take things that didn't belong to them.''   At issue is a database of voter information, with millions of records, that the party makes available to campaigns for a fee, and is ''heart and soul'' of modern presidential campaigns, as the Sanders campaign put it. State parties feed the list with information including names, addresses, ethnicity if available, and voting history. Usually, public election records show which elections a person has voted in, though who they voted for is secret.   The Democratic Party then adds data from commercially available lists that track such information as television habits and magazine subscriptions. They match voter names to donor lists created by both political and nonpolitical organizations.   Each campaign then inputs data gathered by its own staff, gleaned from door knocks, phone calls, emails and other sources. With the data, they can assign each voter their own ''score'' signifying how likely they are to vote for a candidate. The scores inform everything from decisions about whose doors to knock on to which voters might donate.   It is this use of the massive combination of data that drives modern campaigns, mastered by the Obama operations in 2008 and 2012, which had a team of more than 50 people poring over the information to best target their fund-raising, persuasion and voter turnout efforts.   The breach occurred Wednesday when the firm that handles the list, NGP VAN, was making a tweak to its system and inadvertently dropped the firewall between the campaigns for approximately four hours, according to the court filing by the Sanders campaign. That meant that the campaigns could see each other's information. But only the Sanders campaign gained access to data that was proprietary.   According to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing review, four different user names associated with the Sanders campaign conducted 25 separate searches of the Clinton data. Audit trails of the logs show that people with the Sanders campaign searched and saved multiple files, creating new lists of their own.   On a conference call with reporters, Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said that the Sanders team was intentionally playing down what had happened, suggesting it ''may have been a violation of the law.'' He was upset that the Sanders campaign was sending out fund-raising appeals accusing the party of unfair treatment.   ''Our data was stolen,'' Mr. Mook said. ''This was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data. This was not, as the Sanders campaign described it, a mistake.'' Stu Trevelyan, the chief executive of NGP VAN, said that by Friday morning he was confident that no other campaigns have had ''access to or have retained any voter file data of any other clients.''   In its lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, the Sanders campaign argued that the party had no right to terminate the licensing agreement that allowed the campaign access to the voter file. The campaign estimated that the loss of access would cost it $600,000 in contributions, a serious blow because it has ''been financed primarily with contributions from individual donors rather than Political Action Committees.''   ''However, the damage to the campaign's political viability, as a result of being unable to communicate with constituents and voters, is far more severe, and incapable of measurement,'' the suit said. Party representatives said they had not seen the suit and thus could not comment.   One show of support for Mr. Sanders's case came from David Axelrod, a senior adviser for President Obama's campaigns. He called the penalty ''harsh,'' saying on Twitter that, without evidence that the campaign hierarchy knew about data poaching, it appeared that the ''DNC is putting finger on scale.''   Josh Uretsky, the fired national data director from the Sanders campaign, also called the punishment ''an overreaction'' and insisted that he had merely been trying to verify the data breach, adding: ''We did so in a way that we know would create a record that the D.N.C. and NGP VAN would have access to. We deliberately did not download or take custodianship of the records.'' Mr. Uretsky and Mr. Sanders's aides did not address why multiple users from the campaign searched the Clinton data.   Mr. Uretsky acknowledged that Clinton data was being looked at, but said his intent was to see whether the Sanders campaign's data might also be vulnerable.

Authorities Closing In on Hackers at Chase,"It has become a familiar pattern: The computer system of a big American company is breached, the personal information of tens of millions of customers is stolen and a public outcry ensues. Rarely are the thieves caught. But last summer's attack on JPMorgan Chase -- which resulted in hackers gaining access to email addresses and phone numbers for 83 million households and small businesses -- may break that pattern of investigative dead ends in large corporate breaches.    Federal authorities investigating the attack at JPMorgan are increasingly confident that a criminal case will be filed against the hackers in the coming months, said people briefed on the investigation. Law enforcement officials believe that several of the suspects are ''gettable,'' meaning that they live in a country with which the United States has an extradition treaty. That would not include countries like Russia.   Indictments and arrests would be a notable victory for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. In contrast, there have been no criminal charges in a December 2013 breach at Target, where payment card data for 40 million customers was stolen, along with the personal information of 70 million customers, or in the major attacks against eBay and Home Depot involving hundreds of millions more customers last year.     Although the breach at JPMorgan did not result in the loss of customer money or the theft of personal information, it was one of the largest such attacks against a bank and a warning sign that the American financial system was vulnerable.   Officials with the F.B.I. and Mr. Bharara's office declined to comment on the investigation.    The JPMorgan case is advancing quickly partly because the attack was not nearly as sophisticated as initially believed, and law enforcement authorities were able to identify at least some suspects early on, said the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition they not be named because they were not authorized to discuss the case. Law enforcement officials also made the investigation a top priority given that the Department of Homeland Security has declared the banking system critical infrastructure, requiring additional protection from digital attacks.    The JPMorgan investigation is being handled at the highest levels of law enforcement, with the F.B.I. in New York assigning several senior agents to the matter along with a top prosecutor with the computer crimes division of Mr. Bharara's office, the people briefed on the matter said.   Thomas Brown, a senior managing director with FTI Consulting and a former chief of the computer and intellectual property crime unit for Mr. Bharara, said law enforcement tends to aggressively pursue cases where it has a better chance of sending a message of deterrence.    ''The government has finite resources to deal with cybercrime and as a result tends to look for cases which can create maximum impact,'' Mr. Brown said.    The intensifying hunt for the JPMorgan hackers comes as the bank, which has said it spends about $250 million a year on digital security and plans on doubling that in the future, wrestles every day with securing its vast global network.   An internal assessment of the bank's security found that by the end of 2014 the bank had made ''significant progress'' in reducing ''severe patch issues'' in its digital network, but still had critical issues to address. The January report to the bank's cybersecurity business control committee -- a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times -- also noted that one server did not have the latest antivirus protection, but that it was being upgraded.   Patching holes in the bank's network is critical because hackers exploited such vulnerabilities to gain access to JPMorgan in the first place. Attackers breached a server that had not been upgraded with so-called two-factor authentication, The Times previously reported. Double authentication schemes, which are now considered industry standard, require a second, one-time password for employees to gain access to a secure system. Without that second password requirement, hackers were able to breach a server using the stolen login credentials for a bank employee.   Once inside, hackers gained high-level access to more than 90 servers, but they were stopped before they could move customers' financial information to their servers abroad.   The internal review also noted that JPMorgan recently increased its requirements for giving people the highest level of access to the bank's network. It did so, according to the review, to minimize the risk of ''catastrophic technical or reputational damage to the firm.'' JPMorgan now limits so-called ''high security access'' to bank employees who must submit to annual credit screenings and criminal background checks. The bank now also conducts a ''routine review'' to make sure that high security access is justified for a particular person.   A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.   Federal authorities said the lack of prosecutions in big breach cases is often a reflection of the fact that the attackers are cloistered away in countries where the ability to make arrests is limited.    In May, the Justice Department indicted five members of China's People's Liberation Army in connection with hacking attacks. None have been apprehended. And in December, the White House took the unusual step of identifying, and pledging retaliation against, North Korea for a destructive attack at Sony Pictures, without filing a criminal case.   ''The bad news is that many of these folks are located overseas, and they are using encryption and servers all over the world,'' said Leslie R. Caldwell, the assistant attorney general for the criminal division at the Justice Department. ''But the good news is if we are able to jump on the breach early enough, we have an electronic trail and can get that evidence.''   In many cases, hackers also wait before they use the data they steal to evade detection.    ''We've seen them steal and then store or secrete the data for long periods of time,'' said Joseph M. Demarest, the assistant director of the F.B.I.'s cyber division. ''We see them evolve their skills and trade craft and monetizing.''   Federal authorities have had some successes. One of the more notable was the successful prosecution of Albert Gonzalez for a string of hackings that netted more than 90 million credit and debit card numbers from TJ Maxx, Heartland Payment Systems and other companies between 2005 and 2008. Mr. Gonzalez was convicted and sentenced to more than 20 years in prison.   Still, Mr. Gonzalez was living in the United States, while many digital crimes are orchestrated by criminals abroad.   The authorities are sometimes forced to wait until suspects travel to places where an arrest can be made more easily. It took federal prosecutors five years to extradite Vladimir Drinkman, a Russian national who was charged with working with Mr. Gonzalez.   Mr. Drinkman was arrested in 2012 while on vacation in Amsterdam, but his extradition was delayed after the Russian government tried to intervene by filing its own extradition request with the Dutch courts. In February, Mr. Drinkman arrived in the United States to stand trial in federal court in Newark after a Dutch judge approved the United States government's extradition request.   Other Russian nationals charged with hacking have avoided trial altogether. Aleksandr Kalinin, a Russian national indicted by federal prosecutors in New York in 2013 in an attack on the Nasdaq stock market and in other hackings, remains at large.   ''Some of the data breaches may have fallen off the radar, but they aren't off our radar,'' Ms. Caldwell said. ''We have a number of cases where we have indictments under seal.''    Edward W. Lowery, the head of the Secret Service's criminal investigations unit, said international cooperation in hacking cases had increased in recent years, particularly in Western Europe.    But there are still blind spots, said Mr. Lowery, citing ''Eastern European countries, where law enforcement looks the other way.''     "
Green Dot's Decision to Stop Selling MoneyPak Cards Will Take a Toll,"The decision by Green Dot to stop selling MoneyPak, its popular prepaid card, will take a bite out of the company's projected revenue and bottom line this year, and that has taken a toll on the company's share price over the last several days.  Green Dot, the nation's largest seller of prepaid debit cards, has estimated that its decision last year to discontinue MoneyPak, partly because it had become a popular method of payment for online swindlers, could shrink operating revenue by $10 million to $40 million. The company, based in Pasadena, Calif., has also estimated its operating cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, may be $2 million to $10 million lower without sales of MoneyPak this year. Green Dot discussed the potential ramifications when it announced fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. On Tuesday, the company filed an investor presentation as part of a regulatory filing that provided more detail about its 2015 earnings. The company also posted the filing on its website. Green Dot's shares have fallen 30 percent, to just $14, since the company reported earnings that missed Wall Street expectations and it offered a less optimistic outlook for 2015, in part because of the loss of MoneyPak sales. The company said last week that it would stop shipping MoneyPak cards to stores that sell them this month. It anticipates that most MoneyPak cards will be gone from store shelves by the end of March. Last summer, Green Dot announced it intended to stop selling MoneyPak as it moved to a newer technology. It is replacing MoneyPak with a product that will enable customers to add money to existing prepaid cards by swiping them at a special machine at the registers of stores that used to sell MoneyPak. The company said its decision to discontinue the paper MoneyPak card was also prompted by growing concern about the ease with which swindlers were using MoneyPak to conduct both online and telephone scams. Scams involving prepaid debit cards have been on the rise for the last few years and have resulted in dozens of warnings to consumers from the F.B.I., state law enforcement agencies and even a congressional committee. The cards allow for quick and easy money transfers, often done with a great deal of anonymity, a feature that has attracted scam artists.  In July, The New York Times reported that such scamsare thought to cost consumers tens of millions of dollars each year and have become more numerous as the prepaid debt card industry has grown into an $80 billion a year business. The scams involving MoneyPak have continued even after Green Dot announced its intention to stop selling it.  MoneyPak cards have a unique numerical code, or PIN, on the back of each paper card. Anyone with that code has access to the money stored on the card. Scam artists who use MoneyPak as a method of payment persuade unsuspecting victims - often the elderly - to voluntarily give them the code. Until now, Green Dot has been quiet about commenting on the financial effect that its decision to stop selling MoneyPak would have on its earnings. But the company's estimate seemed to catch investors and Wall Street analysts who cover the company by surprise. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase who follow the company published a research note on Jan. 30 that said Green Dot's earnings guidance suffered from a ""larger than expected MoneyPak impact."" "
To Catch a Hacker,"One reason American businesses and the government remain vulnerable to foreign hackers is that it is incredibly hard to arrest and prosecute those criminals. Responding to that difficulty, President Obama is giving the Treasury Department the power to issue financial sanctions against hackers and the people and businesses that hire them to conduct cyber attacks.  The president's executive order effectively treats people who engage in what the administration calls ""malicious cyber-enabled activities"" in the same way it does terrorists and drug cartels. It tries to cut off their access to the American financial system and prohibits them from getting visas to come to the United States. The president's order could be a good step if it ends up freezing the American bank accounts of the shadowy hackers in places like North Korea, Russia and China who regularly mount attacks on American businesses and government agencies. But it is unclear if American investigators can reliably identify those bad guys and whether the criminals even have any assets in the United States that can be frozen. In a call with reporters earlier today administration officials declined to discuss if they have any targets they are pursing under the order. They also wouldn't say how they may have used such authority in past high-profile cases like the hacking of Sony Pictures late last year and the attacks on the computer systems of American banks in 2012. One big question about the order is whether the administration will be willing to use it to sanction big foreign businesses that it suspects of buying stolen trade secrets from hackers. What if such a business happens to be owned by, say, the Chinese government? Would the government risk its diplomatic relationship with the country by freezing the American bank accounts of that business? To its credit, the Obama administration indicted five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army last year for hacking into the systems of American businesses. Another concern that civil liberties groups will probably have is that the administration could end up sanctioning innocent people who get incorrectly identified by American officials as hackers because of their online activism or because their computers were taken over by sophisticated criminals. Administration officials said they would be judicious in their use of their authority. They also said they would publicly disclose the unclassified evidence used to issue sanctions under this order. People who are sanctioned can appeal to the Treasury Department or file a case in any federal district court. Imposing sanctions is now one tool available to the government in dealing with cyber attacks. But in many situations, it may not be a particularly useful tool. "
"Among Snowden Leaks, Details of Chinese Cyberespionage","Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency whose revelations of American cyberspying were widely praised in China's state media, may have lost a little of his shine among Chinese leaders after his latest revelations gave details of Beijing's own cyberespionage. Many in China lauded Mr. Snowden when he exposed a widespread N.S.A. spying program, Prism, in 2013. Among other disclosures was the fact that the United States had been spying on key allies, leading to a series of diplomatic tangles for the United States and not a little schadenfreude in China.  Praised as ""a bright idealistic young man"" in one state media commentary, Mr. Snowden offered China the opportunity, enthusiastically seized upon, to expose what it sees as American hypocrisy over cyberspying issues. Chinese officials have also been using the Snowden revelations as a defensive retort when American officials press China to end state-sponsored hacking. But Beijing has not been so quick to embrace the latest batch of leaked N.S.A. materials. On Saturday, the German magazine Der Spiegel published the latest cache of documents leaked by Mr. Snowden. Among them: a United States government presentation that says China had stolen data on a stealth jet, the F-35 Lightning II. The document, marked top secret, said that China stole ""many terabytes of data,"" including details of the stealth jet's engine schematics and radar design. United States defense experts have long pointed to striking similarities between Chinese stealth jets and the F-35, but the government has yet to directly accuse China of copying the plane. Mr. Snowden's revelation appears to be the first public confirmation that China had sought classified information on the aircraft. The United States' regional allies Japan and Australia are set to adopt the fifth-generation stealth jet as a crucial component of their fleets. However, it is understood that the main data breach, targeting the primary contractor, Lockheed Martin, took place in 2007 before Japan and Australia placed their orders, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry on Monday denied China had stolen data on the plane. The ""complexity"" of cyberattacks ""means that it is extremely difficult to identify the source,"" the spokesman Hong Lei said. ""I wonder if they can produce evidence to prop up such accusation and groundless attack."" Mr. Hong added that the documents released by Mr. Snowden ""showed that some countries do not have good records to talk about when it comes to cyberattacks."" The Chinese government was much faster to believe Mr. Snowden's revelations when they initially surfaced in 2013. At the time, Xinhua, the state-run Chinese news agency, published a commentary praising Mr. Snowden. The Prism program revealed American hypocrisy about ""Internet freedom"" and was the ""bleakest moment yet in the history of the Internet,"" it said. The commentary also said that China, ""despite the fact that it does not have a good reputation as far as Internet governance is concerned, should move boldly and grant Snowden asylum."" People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese government, wrote in a front-page commentary in 2013 that Mr. Snowden had torn off Washington's ""sanctimonious mask.""  In addition to targeting the F-35 jet, the documents released this weekend also show that Chinese hackers sought data on other jets including the F-22 fighter, nuclear submarines and other defense projects. The United States Defense Department spent more than $100 million to repair the damage caused by the Chinese cyberespionage operations, which constituted the ""estimated equivalent of five libraries of congress (50 terabytes),"" the presentation said. The Chinese government has yet to comment on another disclosure that the N.S.A. succeeded in hacking into the computer of a high-ranking Chinese military official, as Der Spiegel reported. "
Everyone in the Private Sector Wants to Talk About Hacking,"It is not too hard to get a crowd of corporate security executives to come together to talk about cyberattacks and what to do when one happens, given the spate of recent big data breaches at Anthem, Sony, Staples and JPMorgan Chase.  So it did not take much for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Secret Service to quickly pull together an all-day conference in New York on Friday that was attended by more than 200 people,  including information technology specialists from companies as diverse as Citigroup, Deloitte, IBM, Bloomberg, First Data, IAC Interactive and Mohegan Sun Casino, as well as a number of attorneys from big law firms. More than two dozen local agents with the F.B.I. and Secret Service who are dedicated to investigating cybercrime also attended the daylong event.  The impetus for the Friday conference held at IAC's corporate offices, a sleek modern building designed by Frank Gehry, was President Obama's speech at Stanford University on the need for greater private sector participation in thwarting cyberattacks. Mr. Obama's speech, delivered before an audience of Silicon Valley corporate executives, was streamed live on a giant wall at the conference site. But Mr. Obama was not the star at this event, which was one of 18 ""open houses"" sponsored by the F.B.I. and Secret Service in cities across the United States. The other events, like the one in New York, were intended as an opportunity for corporate executives to get to know some of the law enforcement authorities in their cities specializing in cyberattacks. In short, the events are intended to break down some of the mistrust companies might have about law enforcement, and the fear that disclosing information about a breach would be used against them by regulators or civil litigants. It's all part of a message that federal officials, including Mr. Obama, have been preaching for several months now, which is that the best way for companies to beat back the hackers is to quickly cooperate with law enforcement. Tate Jarrow, a special agent with the Secret Service, suggested that companies begin developing a rapport with law enforcement before a breach occurs. He said it was easier to develop a working relationship before an incident happened. Serrin Turner, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan who specializes in cybercrime, said his office was looking to pursue cases that will send a message to the hacking world. ""We pursue impact litigation,"" said Mr. Turner, who just secured the conviction of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a notorious online marketplace for drugs and other illegal products. Also joining in the panel discussion was an F.B.I. special agent, Joe Lawlor as well as Evan Norris, a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn and Elizabeth Roper, a cybercrime prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Austin Berglas, assistant special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s cyberbranch in New York, who moderated the law enforcement panel, encouraged the corporate executives in attendance to introduce themselves to the agents and prosecutors. He said it was a rare opportunity for security specialists from the corporate world to get to meet some of the top law enforcement authorities in the field in the same place. ""This is the best panel,"" Mr. Berglas said. "
"U.S. Must Step Up Capacity for Cyberattacks, Chief Argues","WASHINGTON --  The admiral who directs American cyberforces told a Senate committee on Thursday that the United States was ''at a tipping point'' where it needed to increase its ability to conduct cyberattacks, to create a deterrent against other countries that are attacking it. The growing American capabilities in cyberweapons are hardly a secret: They were critical to a yearslong American and Israeli cyberattack on Iran's nuclear facilities, and descriptions of the placement of ''implants'' in foreign computer systems -- for surveillance and potential offensive action -- run through thousands of pages of documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor.      But the willingness of Adm. Michael S. Rogers to discuss purely offensive cyberweapons in his appearance before the Armed Services Committee comes at a moment when the Obama administration is reluctantly experimenting with how to discuss the subject in public, much as it gradually began to talk about drone strikes a few years ago.    Admiral Rogers, who heads both the National Security Agency and its military cousin, United States Cyber Command, was answering questions about how the United States could deter attacks like the kind that struck Sony Pictures Entertainment. President Obama has said publicly that the attack originated in North Korea.    When pressed, Admiral Rogers said that erecting ever-higher digital fences would never be enough, and that ''we have got to broaden our capabilities to provide policy makers and operational commanders with a broader range of options. Because in the end, a purely defensive reactive strategy will be both late'' and would become ''incredibly resource-intense.''    ''So, I have been an advocate of, we also need to think about how can we increase our capacity on the offensive side here, to get to that point of deterrence.''    In interviews as he came into office last year, Admiral Rogers identified creating some form of deterrence as his highest priority. At the time, he said, Chinese and other attackers who steal data from American companies ''pay no price.''    In the case of North Korea, the United States imposed some modest economic sanctions, and it is unclear whether an attack that slowed the North's Internet connections was the result of American action or some other kind of action. In any event, the response was weak enough that many in the Obama administration question whether the North paid a high enough price.   But as Admiral Rogers attempted to describe to the committee, deterrence in the digital realm is a complex business; most comparisons to the nuclear age fail. There are so many different kinds of cyberattackers -- states, businesses, hackers, teenagers, angry ideologues -- that it would be nearly impossible to deter them with traditional means, most experts say.    Admiral Rogers himself seemed to be struggling with the analogies at times, comparing the decisions that national leaders will have to make with those faced by the Bush administration on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. At that time the question was whether the United States would be willing to make ''the decision that we were going to shoot down, potentially, a civilian airliner that we thought had potentially become a weapon.''   ''I think we need to have that same discussion now,'' Admiral Rogers said. ''We've got to increase our decision makers' comfort and level of knowledge with what capabilities we have and what we can do.''    The committee chairman, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has argued for a robust offensive cybercapability, jumped in to say, ''But right now, the level of deterrence is not deterring.   ''That is true,'' Admiral Rogers responded.    "
"U.S. Urges Openness From Hedge Funds, an Industry Not Used to Sharing","LAS VEGAS -- When John P. Carlin, the head of the Justice Department's national security division, appealed on Friday to the hedge fund industry to share more information with the government, it was a tough sell.  ''I encourage you to come in and talk to the F.B.I. and prosecutors,'' Mr. Carlin told an audience of financial advisers and hedge fund managers at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference. But, he quickly assured the audience, ''You will not leave the office with handcuffs.''    After years of close regulatory scrutiny after the financial crisis -- and indictments and prosecutions of insider trading -- there is no shortage of hedge fund managers who complain that the financial industry has become a punching bag for government regulators.   Mr. Carlin and his department want the industry to engage in a dialogue with the government to help prevent the proliferation of what he called cyberweapons of mass destruction.   ''What they are stealing is what you have,'' Mr. Carlin said of online criminals the department has monitored. ''They are stealing economic information. They are stealing your negotiating strategies, and they are stealing your algorithms.''   Emboldened by a series of recent government measures to focus more on such crimes, the Justice Department has been sounding the warning bell across the country. Speaking at conferences like SALT and in private meetings with the heads of companies in sectors like the entertainment industry, utilities and finance, Mr. Carlin's team has been urging the prompt reporting of online attacks.   It has met with large institutional investors and warned them to think twice before investing in a hedge fund that doesn't have the proper security systems set up against such attacks, Mr. Carlin added.   Last month, President Obama gave the government new power to impose financial sanctions on overseas hackers who seek to benefit from stolen corporate information. Speaking at the time, Mr. Obama said that online threats posed ''one of the most serious economic and national security challenges to the United States.''   On Friday, Mr. Carlin raised the specter of a new Cold War era, pointing to nations like China, North Korea and Russia as states that sponsor online attacks, both for commercial gain and to disrupt United States national security.   ''You are being targeted by the same spies as those in the Cold War,'' he said, recalling the recent attack on Sony Pictures, which United States officials have attributed to North Korea.   During a closed-door session moderated by a KPMG executive and attended by a small group of hedge fund managers, advisers and general counsels on Thursday afternoon, some expressed hesitation about coming forward to the government with information and questioned whether that would open the door to other scrutiny, according to two people who were at the meeting.   On Friday, Mr. Carlin spoke after Marc D. Powers, a former Securities and Exchange Commission investigator who is now a private sector lawyer, told the audience what to do when investigators come knocking at their doors.   ''The S.E.C. is not your friend,'' Mr. Powers said.   It was a tough act to follow.    "
Obama Talk With Troops Covers Syria and China,"FORT MEADE, Md. --  President Obama said Friday that the presence of Russian military advisers and equipment in Syria would not change American military strategy in the region, but that Russian support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, could make political reconciliation impossible. ''As long as Assad is there, he has alienated so much of the Syrian population that it will not be possible to arrive at a peaceful cease-fire and political settlement, and you'll continue to have this vacuum that's filled by extremists,'' Mr. Obama said.     The president's remarks came during a town hall-style meeting at the military base here, a center for military intelligence and cyberwarfare just outside Washington. Mr. Obama held the meeting on the 14th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.   He also spoke about how the United States would deal with cyberthreats from China, efforts to deal with the flood of refugees in Europe, his handling of harsh criticism and how he balances the demands of family and work.   He complained about Congress, its deadlock over a spending bill for next year, and restrictions on spending levels called sequestration.   ''I hope Congress is paying attention to how you operate and how you do your job,'' the president said to about 150 service members in the audience, ''because if they were as conscientious about it and selfless about it, then that sequester would be lifted, and we would end up being in a position where we could make the investments we need to stay strong, militarily and economically.''   Asked about the refugee crisis, Mr. Obama said there were no quick fixes.   ''Unfortunately, we can anticipate that refugees will be an ongoing problem for decades to come,'' he said, citing failed states, the proliferation of media that allows people to envision better lives elsewhere, and even climate change. He said a new international system was needed to handle the flood, and he promised to begin discussions about creating such a system at the United Nations General Assembly meeting next week.   ''No one country can solve these problems alone,'' he said.   He said he intended to speak with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about China's cyberattacks during Mr. Xi's visit to the White House this month. The administration has determined that China was behind the theft of the personal information of more than 20 million Americans from the databases of the Office of Personnel Management, but it is still struggling to formulate a response that does not prompt an escalating cyberconflict.   ''We've made very clear to the Chinese that there are certain practices that they're engaging in that we know are emanating from China and are not acceptable,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And we can choose to make this an area of competition -- which I guarantee you we'll win if we have to -- or, alternatively, we can come to an agreement in which we say, this isn't helping anybody; let's instead try to have some basic rules of the road in terms of how we operate.''   The president said that the United States would have to respond more rapidly to cyberattacks, which would require a coordinated response from the military, intelligence agencies and the private sector.   On a more personal note, a service member asked how the president handled all the people ''talking smack about you and what you do.''   ''You know, the truth is that not everyone is talking smack about me. But there is a sizable percentage in Congress that talks smack about me, no doubt about it,'' he said to laughter.   But he said that he had not entered public service simply to be popular, and he pointed to his decision to bail out the auto industry during the economic crisis as an example of a policy that he would never have followed if he had just followed the polls. The auto industry is now thriving and has become the core of a rebound in American manufacturing, he said.   ''So the longer I'm in this office, the more committed I am to making those calls,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And part of the challenge in this job is, is that if it's an easy question, it doesn't get to my desk.''   Similarly, he said that he and his wife, Michelle, raised their daughters with tough rules and high expectations, telling them ''I'm your parent, I'm not your best friend'' when they complained.    He said he was looking forward to doing many things after leaving the White House, such as getting out of the security bubble and not shaving on the weekends.   ''And I can't just on a Saturday morning go down to Starbucks or something, not shave,'' he said. And when he leaves, ''I probably won't wear a tie for at least a month.''     "
Obama Won't Seek Door to Encrypted User Data,"CUPERTINO, Calif. --  The Obama administration has backed down in its bitter dispute with Silicon Valley over the encryption of data on iPhones and other digital devices, concluding that it is not possible to give American law enforcement and intelligence agencies access to that information without also creating an opening that China, Russia, cybercriminals and terrorists could exploit. With its decision, which angered the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies, the administration essentially agreed with Apple, Google, Microsoft and a group of the nation's top cryptographers and computer scientists that millions of Americans would be vulnerable to hacking if technology firms and smartphone manufacturers were required to provide the government with ''back doors,'' or access to their source code and encryption keys.     That would enable the government to see messages, photographs and other data now routinely encrypted on smartphones. Current technology puts the keys for access to the information in the hands of the individual user, not the companies.    The first indication of the retreat came on Thursday, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that the administration would not seek legislation to compel the companies to create such a portal.   But the decision, made at the White House a week ago, goes considerably beyond that.   While the administration said it would continue to try to persuade companies like Apple and Google to assist in criminal and national security investigations, it determined that the government should not force them to breach the security of their products. In essence, investigators will have to hope they find other ways to get what they need, from data stored in the cloud in unencrypted form or transmitted over phone lines, which are covered by a law that affects telecommunications providers but not the technology giants.   Mr. Comey had expressed alarm a year ago after Apple introduced an operating system that encrypted virtually everything contained in an iPhone. What frustrated him was that Apple had designed the system to ensure that the company never held on to the keys, putting them entirely in the hands of users through the codes or fingerprints they use to get into their phones. As a result, if Apple is handed a court order for data -- until recently, it received hundreds every year -- it could not open the coded information.   Mr. Comey compared that system to the creation of a door no law officers could enter, or a car trunk they could not unlock. His concern about what the F.B.I. calls the ''going dark'' problem received support from the director of the National Security Agency and other intelligence officials.   But after a year of study and extensive White House debate, President Obama and his advisers have reached a broad conclusion that an effort to compel the companies to give the government access would fail, both politically and technologically.   ''This looks promising, but there's still going to be tremendous pressure from law enforcement,'' said Peter G. Neumann, one of the nation's leading computer scientists and a co-author of a paper that examined the government's proposal for special access. ''The N.S.A. is capable of dealing with the cryptography for now, but law enforcement is going to have real difficulty with this. This is never a done deal.''   In the paper, released in July, Mr. Neumann and other top cryptographers and computer scientists argued that there was no way for the government to have a back door into encrypted communications without creating an opening that would be exploited by Chinese and Russian intelligence agents, cybercriminals and terrorist groups.   Inside the White House, the Office of Science and Technology Policy came largely to the same conclusion. Those determinations surprised the F.B.I. and local law enforcement officials, who had believed just months ago that the White House would ultimately embrace their efforts.   The intelligence agencies were less vocal, which may reflect their greater capability to search for and gather information. The National Security Agency spends vast sums to get around digital encryption, and it has tools and resources that local law enforcement officials still do not have and most likely never will.   Disclosures by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden showed the extent of the agency's focus on cracking and circumventing the encryption of digital communications, including those of Apple, Facebook, Google and Yahoo users.   There were other motivations for the administration's decision. Mr. Obama and his aides had come to fear that the United States could set a precedent that China and other nations would emulate, requiring Apple, Google and the rest of America's technology giants to provide them with the same access, officials said.   Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, sat at the head table with Mr. Obama and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at a state dinner at the White House last month. According to government officials and industry executives, Mr. Cook told Mr. Obama that the Chinese were waiting for an opportunity to seize on administration action to insist that Apple devices, which are also encrypted in China, be open to Beijing's agents.   In January, three months after Mr. Comey began pressing companies for special government access, Chinese officials had threatened to do just that: They considered submitting foreign companies to invasive audits and requiring them to build back doors into their hardware and software. Those rules have not been put into effect.   The Obama administration's position was also undercut by officials' inability to keep their own data safe from Chinese hackers, as shown by the extensive cyberattack at the Office of Personnel Management discovered this year. That breach, and its aftermath, called into question whether the government could keep the keys to the world's communications safe from its adversaries in cyberspace.   White House officials said they would continue trying to persuade technology companies to help them in investigations, but they did not specify how.   ''As the president has said, the United States will work to ensure that malicious actors can be held to account, without weakening our commitment to strong encryption,'' said Mark Stroh, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ''As part of those efforts, we are actively engaged with private companies to ensure they understand the public safety and national security risks that result from malicious actors' use of their encrypted products and services. However, the administration is not seeking legislation at this time.''   But here in Silicon Valley, executives did not think the government's announcement went far enough.   According to administration officials and technology executives, Mr. Cook of Apple has pressed the White House for a clear statement that it will never seek a back door in any form, legislative or technical -- a statement he hoped to take to Beijing, Moscow and even London. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has threatened to ban encrypted devices and services, like the iPhone and Facebook's popular WhatsApp messaging service, but has done nothing so far to make good on that threat.   Technology executives are determined to reassure customers abroad that American intelligence agencies are not reading their digital communications. It is an effort driven by economics: 64 percent of Apple's revenue originates overseas.   Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft argue that people put not only their conversations but their entire digital lives -- medical records, tax returns, bank accounts -- into a device that slips into their pocket. While Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he is sympathetic to the concerns of law enforcement officials, he made clear during a visit to Silicon Valley in February that he was also aware of privacy concerns and that he sought to balance both interests.   Technologists responded that, with regard to encryption, no such balance existed. ''The real problem is, I don't see any middle ground for dumbing down everything to make special access possible and having the secure systems we need for commerce, government and everything else,'' Mr. Neumann said.    "
Hackers Use Old Web Lure to Help Assad,"WASHINGTON -- To the young Syrian rebel fighter, the Skype message in early December 2013 appeared to come from a woman in Lebanon, named Iman Almasri, interested in his cause. Her picture, in a small icon alongside her name, showed a fair-skinned 20-something in a black head covering, wearing sunglasses. They chatted online for nearly two hours, seemingly united in their opposition to the rule of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian leader still in power after a civil war that has taken more than 200,000 lives. Eventually saying she worked ''in a programing company in Beirut,'' the woman asked the fighter whether he was talking from his computer or his smartphone. He sent her a photo of himself and asked for another of her in return. She sent one immediately, apologizing that it was a few years old.    ''Angel like,'' he responded. ''You drive me crazy.''    What the fighter did not know was that buried in the code of the second photo was a particularly potent piece of malware that copied files from his computer, including tactical battle plans and troves of information about him, his friends and fellow fighters. The woman was not a friendly chat partner, but a pro-Assad hacker -- the photos all appear to have been plucked from the web.   The Syrian conflict has been marked by a very active, if only sporadically visible, cyberbattle that has engulfed all sides, one that is less dramatic than the barrel bombs, snipers and chemical weapons -- but perhaps just as effective. The United States had deeply penetrated the web and phone systems in Syria a year before the Arab Spring uprisings spread throughout the country. And once it began, Mr. Assad's digital warriors have been out in force, looking for any advantage that could keep him in power.   In this case, the fighter had fallen for the oldest scam on the Internet, one that helped Mr. Assad's allies. The chat is drawn from a new study by the intelligence-gathering division of FireEye, a computer security firm, which has delved into the hidden corners of the Syrian conflict -- one in which even a low-tech fighting force has figured out a way to use cyberespionage to its advantage. FireEye researchers found a collection of chats and documents while researching malware hidden in PDF documents, which are commonly used to share letters, books or other images. That quickly took them to the servers where the stolen data was stored.   Like the hackers who the United States says were working for North Korea when they attacked Sony Pictures in November, the assailants aiding Mr. Assad's forces in this case took steps to hide their true identities.   The report says the pro-Assad hackers stole large caches of critical documents revealing the Syrian opposition's strategy, tactical battle plans, supply requirements and data about the forces themselves -- which could be used to track them down. But it is not evident how or whether this battlefield information was used.   ''You've got a conflict with a lot of young, male fighters who keep their contacts and their operations on phones in their back pockets,'' said one senior American intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss espionage matters. ''And it's clear Assad's forces have the capability to drain all that out.''   Mr. Assad was also the victim of cyberattacks, but of a far more advanced nature.   A National Security Agency document dated June 2010, written by the agency's chief of ''Access and Target Development,'' describes how the shipment of ''computer network devices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are intercepted'' by the agency. The document, published recently by Der Spiegel, the German magazine, came from the huge trove taken by Edward J. Snowden; this one shows a photograph of N.S.A. workers slicing open a box of equipment from Cisco Systems, a major manufacturer of network equipment.   After being opened, electronic ''beacon implants'' were placed in the circuitry. One set of devices was ''bound for the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment to be used as part of their Internet backbone,'' the document reveals. To the delight of American intelligence agencies, they soon discovered they had access to the country's cellphone network -- enabling American officials to figure out who was calling whom, and from where.   Such interceptions are still highly classified; the United States government has never discussed its access to the Assad communications network. But the FireEye report, which will be released on Monday, makes it clear that such ''network exploitation'' is now a routine part of even the most low-tech if brutal civil wars, and available to those operating on a shoestring budget.   And that is a new development. The theft of the rebel battle plans stands in contrast to the cybervandalism carried out in recent years by the Syrian Electronic Army, which American intelligence officials suspect is actually Iranian, and has conducted strikes against targets in the United States, including the website of The New York Times. But mostly these have been denial-of-service attacks, which are annoying but not potential game-changers on the battlefield.   Exactly who conducted the hacking on behalf of Mr. Assad's forces remains a mystery, as does whether the stolen data was ever used by the Syrian military. One of the authors of the report, Nart Villeneuve, a threat intelligence analyst for the company, said that it was likely that the hackers were based in Lebanon -- which would be the only true statement in the chat with the Syrian fighter. They used a computer server in Germany, where FireEye found many of their chats in unprotected directories. A handful of the targets of the Syrian operation were contacted in recent months by FireEye researchers. ''They really didn't understand what had happened,'' Mr. Villeneuve said. ''They didn't know their computers and phones had been compromised.''   But if information was forwarded to Mr. Assad's forces, it would have provided his troops or their allies with important intelligence and a critical battlefield advantage, according to analysts and Syrian military specialists.   ''This activity, which takes place in the heat of a conflict, provides actionable military intelligence for an immediate battlefield advantage,'' the FireEye report concluded. ''It provides the type of insight that can thwart a vital supply route, reveal a planned ambush, and identify and track key individuals.''   By mid-2013, according to the information that FireEye recovered, 10 rebel groups fighting Mr. Assad's regime were planning a major operation intended to reclaim from Syrian government forces a key portion of territory along a strategic north-south highway linking Damascus, the capital, with Jordan.   The plans called for retaking the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, a strategic gateway to the major city of Daraa. In May 2013, Syrian troops had seized control of the town near the highway.   ''The Assad regime's biggest vulnerabilities over the last year have been in south Syria, so disrupting that operation would be key to the regime fending off an attack on Damascus from the south -- the traditional route for invading armies,'' said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria specialist at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Mr. Tabler said he was not aware of the stolen information.   According to FireEye, which merged last year with the Mandiant Corporation, the company that has tracked Unit 61398, the Chinese Army's hacking operation, the rebels shared photocopied battle plans, and in red ballpoint pen added defensive embankments, storing their plans electronically as pictures taken with their cellphones. They prepared for a battle involving 700 to 800 men, who were divided into groups to launch separate attacks, including an ambush. They used Google Earth to map their defensive lines and communicate grid coordinates.   They mapped locations for reserve fighters, staging areas and support personnel; settled on a field operations area; and planned supply routes for their forces, according to FireEye. Commanders received stern instructions not to make any ''individual'' decisions without approval from rebel superiors.   The battle details that the security service recovered are impressive. The rebels, who are not identified, would begin the attack with 120-millimeter mortar fire, followed by an assault against key Syrian Army locations. They drew up lists of men from each unit, with names, birth dates and other identifying information. But they stored them on their phones and laptops, and they were vulnerable to slightly customized versions of commercially available malware.   ''It's the democratization of intelligence,'' said Laura Galante, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst who now works for FireEye and oversaw the Syria work. ''We in the private sector can see some of this, and adversaries can steal it in a wholesale way and understand the full picture of an operation.''   And perhaps they can even stop an operation. The retaking of Khirbet Ghazaleh never materialized, Syria analysts say. It is unclear whether Syrian authorities thwarted the plot before it could be carried out, or if the rebels aborted the plan, perhaps suspecting the hacking or for some other reason.    "
Jitters After Bitcoin Exchange Suspends Services,"One of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges suspended services on Tuesday, prompting unease in a virtual currency industry already scarred by the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, once its most prominent exchange. On Tuesday morning, Bitstamp, based in London, posted a message on its website saying it had ""temporarily suspended Bitstamp services"" and urged its customers not to make deposits to previously issued Bitcoin deposit addresses. The exchange said that some of its virtual wallets were compromised on Sunday and that it had lost roughly 19,000 Bitcoins, worth about $5 million. In its message, Bitstamp sought to reassure customers and prevent the sort of panic that ensued last February, when news of a major theft at Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, roiled the Bitcoin world. ""Bitstamp customers can rest assured that their Bitcoins held with us prior to temporary suspension of services on January 5th (at 9 a.m. UTC) are completely safe and will be honored in full,"" Bitstamp wrote.  ""This breach represents a small fraction of Bitstamp's total Bitcoin reserves, the overwhelming majority of which are held in secure offline cold storage systems,"" the exchange added. ""We would like to reassure all Bitstamp customers that their balances held prior to our temporary suspension of services will not be affected and will be honored in full."" On Monday, after Bitstamp issued the first message on its website that it was temporarily suspending services ""in an excess of caution,"" Nejc Kodric, the exchange's chief executive, issued an apology on Twitter. ""My sincerest apologies to those who are affected by our service being temporary suspended,"" he wrote. Later, he added, ""Thank you all for your patience, we are working diligently to restore service and hope to have an E.T.A. later today.""  Bitstamp's lost Bitcoins are only a tiny percentage of the nearly 14 million Bitcoins in circulation. But the breach provided a stark reminder that the Bitcoin industry is still grappling with its image as a plaything of hackers and ne'er-do-wells intent on exploiting the digital currency and the places where it is traded and stored.  ""Bitstamp has become a key part of the Bitcoin ecosystem as one of the most trusted and liquid exchanges,"" Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email. ""Many market participants have accounts at Bitstamp and rely on its listed prices for their operations. The issues at Bitstamp are hampering activity for the Bitcoin market as it works through these issues."" ""I believe this is yet another sign of the need for regulated, secure, liquid U.S.-based exchanges to create a more robust infrastructure for Bitcoin trading,"" he added. Last February, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection after going dark some days earlier. At the time, the exchange said it had lost 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins and more than 100,000 of its own coins, worth about $500 million at the time.  The event pushed many government agencies to take the regulation of Bitcoin more seriously. Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of New York State's Department of Financial Services, for instance, has cited the collapse of Mt. Gox as a driving force behind his office's proposed virtual currency regulations, which were introduced in July. Since Mt. Gox closed, the price of Bitcoin has dropped by about half. It is now trading around $270, according to CoinDesk. News that Bitstamp had suspended services did not appear to have significantly affected the currency's price. Bitstamp is far from the biggest Bitcoin exchange, representing 6 percent of Bitcoin transactions, according to Bitcoin Charts, which provides data related to the Bitcoin network.  Still, Reddit users on Monday posted a flurry of warnings that Bitstamp was down and speculated that the cause was theft. One user posted that he had foreseen problems at Bitstamp five months ago. ""I have nightmares of Mt. Gox all over again,"" the user wrote. "
Breach Puts Morgan Data Up for Sale,"In mid-December, a posting appeared on the Internet site Pastebin offering six million account records, including passwords and login data for clients of Morgan Stanley. Two weeks later, a new posting on the information-sharing site offered a teaser of actual records from 1,200 accounts, and provided a link for people interested in purchasing more, according to a person briefed on the matter. The link pointed to a website that sells digital files for virtual currencies like Bitcoin. In this case, the files were being sold for a more obscure currency, Speedcoin. The offer was quickly taken down the same day, Dec. 27, after Morgan Stanley discovered the leak. In short order, the bank traced the breach to a financial adviser working out of its New York offices, a 30-year-old named Galen Marsh, according to a person involved in the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  Mr. Marsh, who had been with Morgan Stanley since 2008, was quickly fired and is currently the subject of a criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a person briefed on the investigation said. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is also examining the matter. Morgan Stanley said on Monday that it had determined that Mr. Marsh took data on about 10 percent of its 3.5 million wealth management customers, including transactional information from customer statements. The bank said that Mr. Marsh did not take any sensitive passwords or Social Security numbers, and that it had not found any evidence that the breach resulted in any losses to customers. A lawyer for Mr. Marsh, Robert C. Gottlieb, acknowledged on Monday that his client did take the information in question but said that he did not post it online, share it or try to sell it. The case, though, points to the variety of threats banks face as they try to safeguard sensitive customer data. While foreign hackers have been responsible for attacks on JPMorgan Chase and Nasdaq, among others, the vulnerability at Morgan Stanley was an employee at the firm. Financial firms have struggled to deal with inside threats because it can be hard to differentiate between employees pulling data for legitimate purposes and those using it for nefarious reasons. The case could be damaging for Morgan Stanley because the firm has become increasingly reliant on the success of its wealth management division as it has de-emphasized riskier trading. The company's stock ended down more than 3 percent on Monday. Morgan Stanley worked back to Mr. Marsh from the information that was posted publicly on Pastebin, a site that allows for the easy and anonymous publication of large amounts of data. The first advertisement of Morgan Stanley data was on Dec. 15, and it directed people interested in buying the data to two email addresses, neither of which appear to be related to Mr. Marsh. The Dec. 15 posting did not reveal any actual client data, but boasted of the array of information available, including ''account records and other data.'' Twelve days later, a different item provided a sample of the information that was available, giving details from 1,200 accounts that Morgan Stanley said were tied to 900 clients. The item directed interested buyers to gourl.io, a website that advertises itself as a ''crypto-currency payment gateway,'' allowing digital files to be sold anonymously. The Morgan Stanley documents were offered for 78,000 Speedcoins, a relatively new virtual currency that is not yet big enough to have a readily available exchange rate. Mr. Marsh, who attended Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania, was hired by Morgan Stanley as a sales assistant in 2008, after brief stints at Bear Stearns and the hedge fund manager Paulson & Company, according to regulatory filings. Working out of Morgan Stanley's offices on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, Mr. Marsh rose to become a full financial adviser in March 2014. Mr. Marsh was fired last week, according to a person at the firm. Mr. Gottlieb said that Mr. Marsh had acknowledged ''that he should not have obtained the account information and has been cooperating with Morgan Stanley to protect the firm and its customers.'' Mr. Gottlieb added: ''To be clear, Mr. Marsh did not sell or ever intend to sell any account information to anyone. He did not post the information online; he did not share any account information with anyone or use it for any personal financial gain. He is devastated by what has occurred and is extremely sorry for his conduct.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. "
Winklevoss Twins Aim to Take Bitcoin Mainstream With a Regulated Exchange,"Bitcoin, the virtual currency that was once the talk of the financial world, has been taking a beating over the last year with the price tumbling downward. Now two of the biggest boosters of the virtual currency, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are trying to firm up support by creating the first regulated Bitcoin exchange for American customers - what they are calling the Nasdaq of Bitcoin. The brothers, who received $65 million in Facebook shares and cash in 2008 after jousting with its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, have hired engineers from top hedge funds, enlisted a bank and engaged regulators with the aim of opening their exchange - named Gemini, Latin for twins - in the coming months. The exchange, which the twins have financed themselves, is a risky bet, given that the virtual currency industry has been a target of hackers and has faced existential questions about its legitimacy. But the brothers are betting that the currency will be able to rise again if it follows the same playbook as the more established financial industry.  ""Right now we have to build the infrastructure,"" Tyler Winklevoss said. ""You have to walk before you run."" Since being brought into existence in 2009, by a creator going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a technology and financial industry phenomenon. Many major Bitcoin companies, however, were founded by people with little previous financial experience. Bitcoins themselves are stored on a decentralized database run by the currency's users, and can be bought and sold by anybody. The twins have a personal interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed. They amassed a small fortune of Bitcoins, starting in 2012, which has declined in value recently. They also have been working with regulators since 2013 to create the first exchange-traded fund holding Bitcoins, for which they are awaiting approval. They are part of a broader group of wealthy investors and entrepreneurs who have been staking their reputation on the belief that the Bitcoin technology will rise to become more than just a speculative bubble, and will provide new ways of transferring and holding money. This week, an American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, a kind of retail brokerage firm, announced a $75 million financing round - the biggest ever for a Bitcoin start-up - with backing from the New York Stock Exchange and the Spanish bank BBVA. But exchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars and euros, have proved to be the biggest vulnerability for Bitcoin. The first major Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox in Japan, lost hundreds of millions of dollars and went bankrupt last year. Earlier this month, a security breach at another prominent exchange in Europe, Bitstamp, was the latest reminder of the risks, and helped push the price of a Bitcoin below $200 from a peak above $1,200 in late 2013. The Winklevosses themselves were swept up in the scandals when the chief executive of a Bitcoin company they had invested in was arrested on charges related to money laundering in early 2014 - a result of activities that happened before they invested. The twins say none of this has dented their faith in the promise of the technology - they say they continue to hold every Bitcoin they ever purchased - and underscores why a reliable, regulated exchange is needed. ""The A Team wasn't there,"" Tyler Winklevoss said. ""There was a problem here and it needs to be solved."" The Gemini staff is working at a few rows of desks in the Winklevoss Capital offices near Madison Square Park in Manhattan, which has dry-erase boards on the walls covered in math equations and strategic scribbles, and the requisite bean bag chair. Their chief compliance officer, Michael Breu, was previously at the hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates, where he was head of information security in the research department. At Gemini, Mr. Breu works closely with the chief security officer, Cem Paya, who previously held the same position at the apartment rental site Airbnb. They and a staff of a dozen others have been creating Gemini's security infrastructure and trading engine from scratch, and already have a test model of the exchange running. They are planning to be ready to open the exchange as soon as they win regulatory approval from New York state's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of the state's Department of Financial Services. His office has been leading the effort to regulate virtual currencies in the United States, and is introducing what Mr. Lawsky has referred to as a BitLicense for virtual currency companies. He said recently that he hoped to approve the first companies early this year. A person briefed on the matter confirmed that the office was holding discussions on the Winklevoss effort. The twins have brought on a leading law firm on financial regulations, Katten Muchin Rosenman, to help win regulatory approval. Their close cooperation with regulators has also helped them win the thing that has proved the most elusive for Bitcoin companies - a bank account with an American bank. According to documents viewed by The New York Times, on condition that only their general outline be described in this article, the Winklevosses have an agreement with a bank chartered in New York to handle the dollars moving in and out of customer accounts. Cooperation with regulators has divided the virtual currency world. Bitcoin was founded, in part, with the intention of creating a currency outside the control of governments. The twins have placed themselves firmly in the camp of those who believe that Bitcoin will survive only if it has regulatory oversight. ""Our philosophy is to ask for permission, not forgiveness,"" Cameron Winklevoss said. The biggest Bitcoin exchanges today are all overseas, in China, Hong Kong, London and Eastern Europe, which has not helped instill confidence in some American users. Most of the exchanges were started at an earlier point in Bitcoin's development when there was less focus on security and regulations. Bitcoins are particularly vulnerable to hackers because all that someone needs to spend the money in a Bitcoin account is the password, or private key. The security experts hired by the Winklevoss twins have, like many Bitcoin companies, been focusing on ways to keep the private keys - a mix of letters and numbers - in multiple locations where they are offline and physically guarded. For the actual trading software, the twins brought on a programmer from the hedge fund Two Sigma, who is building a system that can be used by both small investors and institutional firms that want direct access to the trading system. The twins are also still moving forward with their exchange-traded fund, set to trade on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker COIN when approved. All of these ventures could amount to nothing if the recent decline in confidence continues. The last major Bitcoin start-up the brothers backed, BitInstant, collapsed in the summer of 2013 before the founder was arrested. After seeing the mistakes made by others, the twins said they wanted to do things on their own. ""This time around we are betting on ourselves,"" Tyler Winklevoss said.

Hong Kong Issues Warning About Bitcoin,"HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's central bank has warned against investing in virtual currencies, amid local media reports that a Bitcoin exchange may have run off with $387 million in client funds in what could be the biggest Bitcoin scandal after last year's bankruptcy at the Mt. Gox exchange, based in Tokyo.  The South China Morning Post reported on Monday that clients of the MyCoin exchange, based in Hong Kong, had approached a local lawmaker, saying the company had absconded with their money. An assistant for Legislative Council member Leung Yiu-chung said that Mr. Leung had received more than 15 complaints from MyCoin clients regarding the allegations and that these would be passed on to the police on Wednesday.    The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a statement late Monday that the case ''may involve fraud or pyramid schemes,'' adding: ''Given the highly speculative nature of Bitcoin, we have all along urged the public to exercise extra caution when considering making transactions or investments with Bitcoin.''   Calls to MyCoin in Hong Kong could not be connected. Calls to the company's China customer service line were not answered.   Bitcoins are created through a ''mining'' process in which a computer's resources are used to perform millions of calculations.   Advocates say the virtual currency is revolutionary because it is not controlled by a central bank and has potential as an alternative means of online payment. But the rise of Bitcoin, which is unregulated in many places, including Hong Kong, has stoked concerns that it can be used to launder money and finance extremist groups.   Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy a year ago after it claimed to have lost about $500 million worth of customer Bitcoins in a hacking attack.   On its website, MyCoin says it is a ''leading global Bitcoin trading platform and application service provider,'' with a research and development team based in China.   MyCoin promised clients a return of one million Hong Kong dollars, or $128,976, over a four-month period based on a 400,000-dollar investment that would produce 90 bitcoins on maturity, the South China Morning Post reported.   The report added that MyCoin claimed to have 3,000 customers, each investing an average of one million dollars.   The price of a Bitcoin has slumped from a late-2013 high of more than $1,000 to about $220, according to CoinDesk's price index.    "
Lenovo's Chief Technology Officer Discusses the Superfish Adware Fiasco,"For Lenovo, now comes the apologies. Consumer trust in the world's largest PC manufacturer plummeted last week after users discovered the company had been shipping its PCs with spyware - what the industry calls adware - buried deep in its operating system, precisely where consumers and antivirus products would have difficulty finding it. Then things got worse. The adware was intended to serve Lenovo users targeted ads, but the company Lenovo partnered with to do this, Superfish, did so by hijacking the trusted certificates that websites use to connect securely to web browsers. And Superfish was doing so in such a way that made it possible for the company, and hackers, to take complete control of their machines. The company Superfish used to hijack those certificates, Komodia, specializes in hijacking encrypted communications.  Superfish has not responded to requests for comment.  Lenovo claims it eradicated all traces of Superfish and Komodia from its systems last week, but customers and security researchers say that is not enough. Many have asked why anyone would trust the company in the future. In an interview on Tuesday, Peter Hortensius, Lenovo's chief technology officer, tried to explain how this could have happened and what the company planned to do next. The interview has been edited for length:  Q.  How did Superfish even get onto Lenovo machines in the first place?  A.  The original motivation for this was that the product team was being asked, ""Can we do something to improve our consumer experience?"" Someone had the idea to improve their shopping experience in a novel way - not to own their experience, but just, if the consumer is looking at a desk, can we suggest an alternative product that looks like that desk? The motivation was to enhance the experience. Obviously, in retrospect, if we had known what that meant in terms of how it was implemented, we would have never done it.  Q.  Peter Horne, the technologist that first alerted me to this issue, said he alerted Lenovo about the security issue through your customer service channels in mid-January, and nothing was done until now. When did you first learn that this practice was unacceptable to your customers? When did you take action?  A.  We first got complaints in December, but they were more about web compatibility. Customers were saying ""Hey, I did this and I got that back, what's going on?"" In January, we concluded [Superfish] was not going to deliver the experience we had wanted. At that point, we had Superfish shut down, and shut down the servers on their end. Unfortunately that's not what the security exposure was motivated by. That was motivated by the certificate that was created. That we really did not know until last Thursday, midday.  Q.  I have to press you on that. Mr. Horne brought the security issue to Lenovo's attention in mid-January, more than six weeks earlier.  A.   At that time, we were responding to this issue from a web compatibility perspective, not a security perspective. You can argue whether that was right or wrong, but that's how it was looked at. We thought turning off the servers at that point would address that problem and that was what was done. At that point, we concluded [Superfish] was not very useful and that is why we started to remove it from the preloads.  Q.  Why wasn't this issue picked up in the quality assurance process? What is the quality assurance process for installing this kind of adware on Lenovo machines?  A.  At a high level, the team that defines what is in these products will encounter stuff in the market, then they will say, ""Here is something we want to do,"" and they will engage an engineering team. Then we will go through this thing and make sure it adheres to our policies and practices. We make sure it doesn't know who the individual is. We make sure it's opt-in. But what was completely missed in this was the security exposure caused by the design of the certificate authority they used.  Q.  There was nothing about this experience that was opt-in.  A.   When you buy a Lenovo machine and turn it on, this was one of the programs that was presented to you. At that point, you could click a button that says, ""I don't want to use this.""  Q.   I have to press you on that. What did the opt-in prose look like? Nobody recalls anything about this being opt-in.  A.   I don't have it in front of me, but I will get it to you. We want to make this right going forward. Part of this is what we are doing to fix the problem and what are we doing to make this right going forward. To that end, we're trying to present - in much more plain English - a view of what these programs do.  Q.  How did you miss the fact that Superfish was hijacking the certificates?  A.  We did not do a thorough enough job understanding how Superfish would find and provide their info. That's on us. That's a mistake that we made.  Q.  By simply unplugging the Superfish servers, you did not address that issue.  A.  That's exactly correct. In January, we turned off the servers to respond to the compatibility concern. But unfortunately that did nothing to solve the security problem, which is that someone could hijack the certificate. The actions we took on Thursday and Friday to remove the certificate, and remove all traces of the application, that is what solved the security problem.  Q.  Were you aware that Superfish was using Komodia to serve its certificates?  A.  We were told by Superfish that they were using Komodia but we never looked into it. In December, there was no reason for us to be suspicious. Superfish had a good reputation. But we should have dug in more. I won't debate that.   Q.  What does a visual search company like Superfish actually do? It seems that logically to perform a ""visual search,"" they would have to log everything I'm looking at to know what I might be searching for.  A.  For lack of a better term, they take a signature of what you're looking at. So if you have a mouse hovering over an image, they send the signature back to their servers. That is then used to match against things that are close to what you're looking at and put that back [into the web page]. This is the magic of their software.  Q.  So if I'm understanding this correctly, Superfish was pulling the metadata from everything that I saw online, then hijacking the certificate of the website I was on, to insert an image of something I might be inclined to click on and buy?  A.  That is my understanding. The idea was that if I'm looking at something, Superfish can serve me an alternative. ""Here's a vase. Here's a vase that's similar to it. Or here's the same vase from a different place."" That was the idea at least.  Q.  The engineering community is up in arms about this. What was the reaction on your team when you learned Superfish was essentially leaving your users susceptible to hackers?  A.  We were incredibly disappointed. That's probably the polite way to say it.  Q.  Have you communicated with Superfish since?  A.  When this broke, we made sure they knew about it. I have not personally talked to them. I can't speak to what the team has said to them.  Q.  Why would anyone trust a Lenovo product ever again, knowing that this program was buried so deep in your operating system, and nobody remembers having opted in to this?  A.  All we can say is we made a mistake and we apologize. That's not nearly enough. So our plan is to release, by the end of this week, the beginning of our plan to rebuild that trust. We are not confused as to the depth that this has caused people not to trust us. We will do our best to make this right. In the process of that, I think we will come out stronger. But we have a long way to go to make this right. We are not trying to pretend Superfish delivered on what it aimed to do. We're not trying to pretend it did it the right way. And we're not trying to pretend we should have shipped something that delivered the way it did. We made mistakes on all accounts.  Q.  Is there any evidence that hackers were able to hijack these certificates to attack your customers?  A.  We are not aware of this actually being used in a malevolent way.  Q.  Do we have your assurances that there are no other cases of similar adware buried in Lenovo products?  A.  We are digging through. By the end of the week you will get an absolute statement on that. I do not believe there is any. But I want to be 1,000 percent sure. Our first action was to remove this thing, to eradicate it. This week we begin the plan to make sure this never happens again. We'll release that plan by the end of the week. "
"For Digital Privacy, Borders Still Matter","Andrew Keane Woods is an assistant professor of law at the University of Kentucky. LEXINGTON, Ky. -- The Internet is routinely described as borderless, and that is often how it feels. Tweet a photo or post a comment, and it is instantly viewable in nearly every country in the world. But a global Internet unbounded by territorial limits is pure fantasy. Down where the cables lie and the servers spin, territory still matters.     Take user data. While 90 percent of the Internet's users are outside the United States, the web is dominated by American firms. As a result, a great deal of non-American data is held on American servers. This was tolerable when trust in the United States was high. But after Edward J. Snowden peeled back the curtain on the National Security Agency's Internet surveillance efforts, that trust withered.   In response, other nations are increasingly exercising their territorial control over the Internet, often in ways that mimic America's worst practices.   Earlier this month, the British Home Secretary introduced a bill known as the Snoopers' Charter that would broadly expand the government's ability to collect user data -- from authorizing the police to hack into phones and computers, to mandating that Internet companies decrypt encrypted communications. The bill goes too far and privacy advocates are right to oppose it.   But governments do have legitimate reasons to seek user data beyond their territorial reach, and privacy advocates ignore that need at their peril.   Ask a police officer anywhere outside of the United States and he'll tell you that evidence for routine crimes -- murder, theft, burglary -- is very often stored in the cloud, typically in another jurisdiction. Last year alone, British law enforcement agents made nearly 54,000 requests for data from just five American firms: Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo.   These requests often go nowhere because America's 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act only allows technology firms to release American-held data in response to orders from an American judge. So if a British cop is investigating a murder in London, and he has good reason to believe that Google or Facebook has evidence about the crime, he must satisfy an American judge using an American constitutional standard to obtain the evidence. This cross-border process is notoriously slow. Requests take an average of 10 months -- an eon in a criminal investigation -- and many languish for years.   Exasperation with this process was a key motivation behind the Snoopers' Charter, and Britain is hardly alone.   Because American law has made it nearly impossible to obtain digital evidence through legitimate channels, foreign police are turning to illegitimate ones. I recently attended a conference for purveyors of surveillance software -- an event unofficially known as the ''Wiretappers' Ball.'' I asked one vendor if he was aware of law enforcement's frustrations with American tech firms. The salesman grinned and told me that police departments now buy his malware precisely because they're tired of waiting for evidence through established diplomatic channels. This is alarming: Making it harder for the police to get criminal evidence lawfully may actually incentivize them to seek that data by snooping.   To surveil the Internet, it helps to have control over the physical nodes in the network. Indeed, wherever our data passes through cables or servers that are bolted to a particular country's territory, it is vulnerable to that government's control. Just last week, The Times revealed that the American military is concerned about Russian ships ''aggressively'' conducting military exercises near undersea fiber cables, an irony that wasn't lost on those aware of the N.S.A.'s own efforts at tapping the Internet backbone.   Territorial control over the Internet matters so much that when countries don't have access to any physical infrastructure within their borders, they often mandate it by fiat. A number of nations have passed data localization bills, which require foreign Internet companies to store some of their users' data on local servers. Politically, this plays very well -- ''Keep Brazilian data out of the N.S.A.'s hands!'' -- but it doesn't necessarily keep users' data safe.   The threat of data localization was initially considered mere saber rattling, but no more. Last month, the European Court of Justice invalidated a 15-year-old Safe Harbor framework that enabled American technology firms to move data between Europe and America to optimize their services. Without such a framework, radical restructuring of many companies' networks may be required. Indeed, within weeks of the court's decision, Microsoft announced that much of its European customer data will be held in Germany by Deutsche Telekom. This is good news for the N.S.A. and German intelligence agencies -- and a subsidy for the German cloud storage industry -- but it is bad for user privacy and a dangerous precedent for the future of the cloud.   If the global Internet is going to be warped to suit governments' interests, we must ensure that it isn't broken up into cantonized national networks with less privacy, less efficiency, less commerce and less speech. That means making it easier for foreign governments to get data when that access is justified and harder when it is not.   International agreements are one solution, and America and Britain are rumored to be negotiating such a deal. In the meantime, American technology companies should be free to comply directly with foreign government requests for data, as long as that access is warranted and meets international standards of due process and human rights. If America fails to allow such access, it will happen anyway in a brute and extralegal manner -- and the result will be a less secure, less efficient Internet.

Twist in Morgan Inquiry,"There's been little dispute that a former Morgan Stanley broker, Galen Marsh, violated the firm's rules when he downloaded information about 350,000 customers onto his personal computer. But Mr. Marsh may not be responsible for posting that information online late last year and trying to sell it, people familiar with the investigation said on Thursday.  Federal authorities are looking into the possibility that hackers, potentially from overseas, broke into Mr. Marsh's laptop and took the customer information that was offered for sale online in December, said the people, who did not want to be identified because the investigation was not completed.    Ever since  Mr. Marsh was fired by Morgan Stanley  in early January, his lawyer has insisted Mr. Marsh was not responsible for the online posting of personal information about some of the Wall Street bank's wealth management customers. The lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, said on Thursday that he was increasingly confident that federal authorities were coming to that same conclusion.   ''Based on the facts as they are unfolding, there really is no longer a reason to consider Mr. Marsh as being responsible for the information being posted on the Internet,'' Mr. Gottlieb said.   Mr. Gottlieb said he had been in contact with federal prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan, but declined to comment on those conversations.   The Wall Street Journal first reported that federal authorities were looking into the possibility that Mr. Marsh's personal laptop could have been hacked.   Mr. Marsh was fired by Morgan Stanley after he acknowledged taking the customer information, which did not include sensitive information like passwords or Social Security numbers. On Dec. 27, Morgan Stanley discovered that some of its customer information had been placed on Pastebin, a website for posting documents, and then traced the information back to Mr. Marsh, 30, a broker who had worked for the firm since 2008.   Federal authorities began to suspect a hacker may have been responsible for the online posting after some of the information downloaded by Mr. Marsh continued to appear on other websites and advertised for sale on Twitter even after he had been fired, the people familiar with the matter said.   Mr. Marsh's personal laptop on which he downloaded the customer information has not been returned to him by federal authorities.   A representative for Morgan Stanley said the firm did not know who uploaded the information to the Internet. The representative said the firm had taken steps to tighten its internal security and protect customer accounts after discovering that Mr. Marsh had taken the information and loaded it onto his computer.   Morgan Stanley said it had yet to see any evidence of fraud involving the information of its customers. The firm is offering free identity theft protection to its customers.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
I.R.S. Breach Demonstrates the Need to Guard Personal Data,"The Internal Revenue Service has been added to a long list of companies and government agencies that hackers have breached in the last year. And so, if there is any advice security experts have for those trying to keep their personal information safe, it is simply: You can't.    ''Your information has already been out there for years, available to anyone who wants to pay a couple dollars,'' Brian Krebs, a security blogger who has been a frequent target of hackers, said Wednesday.    The attack on the I.R.S. is just the latest evidence that hackers already have all the information necessary to steal your identity. The agency said Tuesday that hackers used information stolen from previous breaches -- including Social Security numbers, birth dates, street addresses and passwords -- to complete a multistep authentication process and request tax returns and other filings.   But consumers can make things harder for criminals. There may be a trade-off in convenience, but experts say the alternative is a lot worse.   1. TURN ON MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION If a service offers added security features like multifactor authentication, turn them on. When you enter your password, you will receive a message, usually via text, with a one-time code that you must enter before you can log in.   Most banking sites and popular sites like Google, Apple, Twitter and Facebook offer two-factor authentication, and will ask for a second one-time code anytime you log in from a new computer.   2. CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS AGAIN Yes, you need to change passwords again and they have to be passwords you have never used before. They need to be long and not words you would find in a dictionary. The first thing hackers do when trying to break into a site is use computer programs that can test every word in the dictionary.   Password managers like LastPass or Password Safe create long, unique passwords for the websites you visit and store them in a database that is protected by a master password you have memorized.   It may sound counterintuitive, but the truly paranoid write down their passwords.   Security experts advise creating anagrams based on song lyrics, movie quotations or sayings, and using symbols or numbers and alternating lower and upper cases to make the password more difficult. For instance, the ''Casablanca'' movie quotation ''Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine'' becomes OaTgJ,iAtT,iAtW,sWiM.   Use stronger, longer passwords for sites that contain the most critical information, like bank or email accounts.   3. FORGET ABOUT SECURITY QUESTIONS Sites will often use security questions such as ''What was the name of your first school?'' or ''What is your mother's maiden name?'' to recover a user's account if the password is forgotten.   These questions are problematic because the Internet has made public record searches a snap and the answers are usually easy to guess.   In a recent study, security researchers at Google found that with a single guess, an attacker would have a 19.7 percent chance of duplicating an English-speaking user's answer to the question, ''What is your favorite food?'' (It was pizza.)   With 10 tries, an attacker would have a 39 percent chance of guessing a Korean-speaking user's answer to the question, ''What is your city of birth?'' and a 43 percent chance of guessing the favorite food.   Jonathan Zdziarski, a computer forensics expert, said he often answers these questions with an alternate password. If a site offers only multiple choice answers, or only requires short passwords, he won't use it.   ''You can tell a lot about the security of a site just by looking at the questions they'll ask you,'' he said.   4. MONITOR YOUR CREDIT Typically a service will offer one year of free credit monitoring if it has been breached. But be aware that attackers do not dispose of your Social Security number, birth date or password a year after they acquire it.   It is better to monitor your credit aggressively at all times through free services like AnnualCreditReport.com.   5. FREEZE YOUR CREDIT In the attack at the I.R.S., a credit freeze may not have thwarted thieves from filing for false tax refunds, but it could have stopped them from pulling tax transcripts or opening other accounts.   To freeze your credit, call Equifax, Experian or TransUnion and ask to have your account frozen. The credit agency will mail a one-time PIN or password to unfreeze your account later.   The fee to freeze and refreeze credit varies by state. If you plan on applying for a new job, renting an apartment or buying insurance, you will have to thaw a freeze temporarily and pay a fee to refreeze the account.   But if you have been a victim of identity theft, and can show a police report proving as much, most states will waive the freeze fee.    "
Hackers Prove They Can 'Pwn' the Lives of Those Not Hyperconnected,"It took the hackers less than two hours to take over Patsy Walsh's life. On a recent Friday, Mrs. Walsh, a grandmother of six, volunteered to allow two hackers to take a crack at hacking her home. How bad could it be? Mrs. Walsh did not consider herself a digital person. As far as she knew, her home was not equipped with any ""smart devices,"" physical objects like refrigerators and thermometers that transmit information to the Internet. Sure, she has a Facebook account, which she uses to keep up on friends' lives, but rarely does she post about her own.  ""I don't post things about myself and don't really understand why other people do,"" Mrs. Walsh said. ""The fact you can go from one friend's profile to their friends' profiles is creepy. I guess you could find out a lot of information about somebody if you really wanted to."" Indeed. Days before hackers even set foot in Mrs. Walsh's home overlooking Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, Calif., they found her Facebook account and - though it was comparatively locked down - uncovered just enough to begin to take over her digital life. The New York Times was invited to witness the hacking, on the condition that Mrs. Walsh's town not be named. The twist was that once the hackers found their way in, they discovered someone else had already been there. The hackers could see that Mrs. Walsh had liked a page organized by Change­.org. That was all they needed to construct some convincing click bait. Within 10 minutes, they composed a fake email from Change­.org asking her to sign a fake petition about land use in Marin County. When that link led her to a page that asked her to enter her email address and password, she complied. To spare Mrs. Walsh any actual harm, the hackers used a service called Phish5, which does not actually store passwords and is often used by employers to test employees' ability to spot malicious phishing cons. Had the two been actual attackers, they would have had all the information they needed to ""pwn"" Mrs. Walsh - hacker speak for taking over someone's digital life - from afar, particularly because, Mrs. Walsh confessed, she was guilty of using the same password across many accounts. All this before they had even set foot in Mrs. Walsh's home. The hackers, Reed Loden, the 27-year-old director of security of HackerOne, a San Francisco security start-up, and Michiel Prins, the 25-year-old co-founder of HackerOne, were greeted warmly when they arrived at her home. ""Welcome Hackers"" was scrawled on a heart-shaped chalkboard on the front door, and deviled eggs, tuna sandwiches and fresh iced tea were waiting. Mrs. Walsh said she expected the hackers would wear black, but Mr. Loden and Mr. Prins did not fit that stereotype. Mr. Loden, who hails from Mississippi, ended his sentences with a warm ""thank you, ma'am"" - his manners intact even while explaining that he had just hacked Mrs. Walsh's power of attorney form. ""They're very polite,"" Mrs. Walsh noted. (Later, she invited both to Thanksgiving dinner.) Over an hour and a half, they discovered a way to open the Walshes' garage door. It was simply a matter of using a ""brute force attack"" against an older door opener. The process entailed testing thousands of code combinations until hitting the correct one. Earlier this year, the hacker Samy Kamkar demonstrated how to do this in less than 10 seconds using a Mattel toy. Mr. Loden and Mr. Prins also found a way to intercept Mrs. Walsh's television. A service worker had not installed her DirecTV securely, with a password, which meant anyone with knowledge of the device's I.P. address could control the television remotely. In this case, the hackers used their access to purchase a three-hour pass to an array of adult channels - the names of which would not be suitable for print here. Still, Mrs. Walsh was not impressed. ""What's so wrong about getting into my TV?"" When Mr. Loden pointed out that someone could blast pornography in her living room in the middle of a dinner party, Mrs. Walsh conceded, ""I can see how that would be a little shocking to guests."" From there, the hackers made their way to the back of Mrs. Walsh's house, where her PC was waiting. With her passwords posted on the nearby router, their task was easy. Within minutes, they had not only broken into Mrs. Walsh's email account, but also that of her daughter - who at some point had allowed the computer's browser to auto-fill her password. (As a courtesy, the hackers made sure to send Mrs. Walsh's daughter an email from her own account with the subject line: ""Reminder: Change my password."") They searched Mrs. Walsh's email for the term ""SSN"" and within seconds had access to her Social Security number, her PayPal account, her air miles account and her insurance information. They had even gotten their hands on her power of attorney form. What's worse, they weren't the only ones with access to all of the above. Mr. Loden and Mr. Prins ran a scan for malicious programs running on Mrs. Walsh's machine and found roughly 20, including InstallBrain, an installer that can download malicious programs on demand, like one that helps attackers mine for Bitcoin. And others like DefaultTab, FunWebProducts, SearchProtect, SlimCleaner and Supreme Savings that can change a victim's home page, spy on search and browsing histories, or replace ads on websites like Facebook and Google with intrusive programs. After they were through ""pwning"" Mrs. Walsh, the two hackers sat down with their victim for a debriefing. Critical points were that Mrs. Walsh needed a new garage door opener, a password for her television and a password manager to help her set unique and far more complicated passwords for each of her accounts. The hackers advised her to turn on two-step authentication, a service that sends a second, one-time password to users' phones when they try to log in from an unrecognized machine. They also gave her a quick lesson in phishing attacks and a lecture on the importance of installing software updates. Best to switch on automatic updates, they said, for core services like Apple's iOS operating system, Google's Chrome browser and Windows. And, they said, her PC needed to be completely wiped. The good news was they promised to return to do this for her, possibly when they visit for Thanksgiving dinner. "
Report Sees Weak Security in Cars' Wireless Systems,"WASHINGTON --  Serious gaps in security and customer privacy affect nearly every vehicle that uses wireless technology, according to a report set to be released on Monday by a senator's office. The report concludes that security measures to prevent hackers from gaining control of a vehicle's electronics are ''inconsistent and haphazard,'' and that the majority of automakers do not have systems that can detect breaches or quickly respond to them.    ''Drivers have come to rely on these new technologies, but unfortunately the automakers haven't done their part to protect us from cyberattacks or privacy invasions,'' said the senator, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose office published the report after obtaining detailed information from 16 automakers.    In addition to finding ''a clear lack of appropriate security measures to protect drivers against hackers who may be able to take control of a vehicle'' or hackers who wish to ''collect and use personal driver information,'' the report expressed concerns over how automakers track drivers' behavior and collect, transmit and store that information.   The report found that large amounts of data on driving histories are harvested, frequently without consumers being explicitly aware that the information is being collected or how it will be used. At least nine automakers use third-party companies to collect vehicle data, which can make consumers even more vulnerable, and some transmit that data to third-party data centers too.    ''This reveals that a majority of vehicle manufacturers offer features that not only record but also transmit driving history wirelessly to themselves or to third parties,'' the report said.    The information collected includes where drivers have been, like physical location recorded at regular intervals, the last location they were parked, distances and times traveled, and previous destinations entered into navigation systems. A host of diagnostic data on the car is also captured.    The findings in the report are based on information received from BMW, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Porsche, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Tesla did not respond to the requests.   Technological innovations for vehicles are expanding rapidly: Safety features powered by radars, lasers and cameras are available in some vehicles and coming to more, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication -- in which cars can share information -- is expected to be available in the near future.    At the same time, connecting cars to the Internet means that more vehicles have smartphonelike interfaces that allow for new possibilities, but also carry inherent risks.    In November, two auto industry trade groups -- the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers -- tried to address consumer concerns by publishing a set of voluntary privacy principles aimed at limiting the use of vehicle data for marketing purposes. The principles called on automakers to collect information ''only as needed for legitimate business purposes.''    The report says the phrase ''legitimate business purposes'' is vague enough to allow for all kinds of collection, and asserts that clear federal rules should be established for what are permissible and appropriate uses of drivers' data.    Ford and Toyota declined to comment on the report. Fiat Chrysler and General Motors referred questions to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.   Wade Newton, a spokesman for the trade group, said ''automakers believe that strong consumer data privacy protections and strong vehicle security are essential to maintaining the continued trust of our customers'' and cited the November principles as a way that the industry was taking proactive steps.   ''Auto engineers incorporate security solutions into vehicles from the very first stages of design and production -- and security testing never stops,'' he said.   Auto companies post privacy policies in their owner's manuals and on corporate websites, he said, and they ''pledge to provide heightened protections to the most sensitive types of consumer information -- protections that go beyond similar principles in other industry sectors.''    "
Prosecutors Urge Prison for Private Detective Who Hacked Email,"In the end, the amount of money a New York private investigator made from people who paid him to illegally pilfer the emails of possibly dozens of people he was investigating was small -- just $5,000. But the privacy violation was so great that federal prosecutors are asking a judge on Friday to sentence the investigator, Eric Saldarriaga, 41, to serve as much as six months in prison to send a stern message about the wrongness of illegal hacking.    At least one of the people who had their email accounts hacked by Mr. Saldarriaga was a journalist who has written articles about the Church of Scientology and suspects that the investigator was hired to look into his work, according to a letter from the victim that prosecutors filed with the court on Thursday.   Prosecutors are seeking prison time for Mr. Saldarriaga, who lives in Queens, even though the court's own probation department has recommended six months of home detention plus three years of supervised probation. The request for the stiffer sentence shows how seriously the authorities are taking the hacking of emails and social media accounts.    ''Unlike defendants in a gun or drug case, who often act without reflection, there is reason to believe that individuals who engage in hacking and other forms of cybercrime can be deterred by a substantial threat of penalties,'' said Daniel S. Noble, a prosecutor working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan, in a pre-sentencing memorandum submitted this week.   Mr. Saldarriaga, who pleaded guilty on March 6 to one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking, paid an unidentified overseas firm to secure the login credentials and passwords for the email accounts he wanted access to without permission. Mr. Saldarriaga's use of a so-called hacker-for-hire firm surfaced during a broad investigation into the illicit activity conducted by federal authorities in Los Angeles several years ago.   When federal authorities in New York approached Mr. Saldarriaga in March 2014 about his activities, they found him to be cooperative and willing to acknowledge that he had taken money from clients to break into private email accounts, according to a court filing. But to date, no one else has been charged in the matter.   Law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about hackers breaking into email accounts at law firms, large companies and investor-relations firms to gather information about business strategies and potential corporate deals.   In December, FireEye, a computer security consulting firm, released a report about a sophisticated hacking group it called Fin4 that was taking aim at corporate email accounts at large pharmaceutical companies and financial services firms to get information about potential merger negotiations.   Before the release of the report, FireEye officials gave a private briefing to Securities and Exchange Commission officials and others in law enforcement, alerting them that the information obtained by the hackers might be used by some to make potentially profitable trades, said a person briefed on that meeting but not authorized to speak publicly.   Soon after that briefing, the S.E.C. began an investigation. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that securities regulators had requested information from at least eight companies whose data had been breached, largely in response to FireEye's report on Fin4.   In Mr. Saldarriaga's case, it appears that the prosecutorial trail ends with him even though some of those who hired him appear to have been aware of what he was doing. Mr. Saldarriaga's clients are known to have included lawyers, wealthy people and even other private investigators, some of whom referred cases to him because he had a reputation for gaining access to email accounts, said people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.   Tony Ortega, a former editor of The Village Voice who has written about Scientology and its practices for nearly two decades, was told in late May that he had been a victim of Mr. Saldarriaga's email hacking. In a letter to prosecutors, Mr. Ortega said that he and other journalists who have written about Scientology have been targets of private investigators and that he believed Mr. Saldarriaga was hired by the church to gather information about him.   He said it would be a ''miscarriage of justice'' to sentence Mr. Saldarriaga ''without pressing him'' for information about who he was working for and who hired him.   Michael Rinder, a former spokesman for the Church of Scientology, also submitted a victim impact statement to prosecutors on Thursday.   Another victim, one of the roughly 50 people whose emails may have been reviewed by Mr. Saldarriaga, said he planned to address the judge at the sentencing.   That person, a man who lives in Southern California, requested permission to address Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Manhattan through a videoconferencing system and planned to tell the judge that prosecutors should let the victims know who hired the investigator. The man, a professional gambler who said he anonymously contributes some of his winnings to charitable causes, says prosecutors have told him that he will not have to disclose his identity in court. He said he was concerned about information in his emails falling into the wrong hands.   ''For this one guy, to be sentenced today for a crime he did for other people would be a miscarriage of justice,'' the man said in an email statement on Thursday. ''Clearly everyone that was involved in this crime, including the people that hired him or had any part in this, need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.   Under federal law, crime victims are entitled to submit a statement or address a judge before the sentencing.   Identifying the victims of hacking by Mr. Saldarriaga has not been easy. To locate some, prosecutors issued subpoenas to Google and other email providers, asking them to pass on the contact information for the people suspected of having had their emails rummaged through.   In his pre-sentencing memorandum, Peter Brill, a lawyer for Mr. Saldarriaga, asked Judge Sullivan to sentence his client to a three-year probationary sentence. Mr. Brill said that Mr. Saldarriaga was remorseful for his actions and knows that he did something wrong.   ''He didn't make a lot of money ever,'' Mr. Brill said. ''A lot of his email intrusions were for personal use, not for his business.''   Mr. Saldarriaga, in a letter to Judge Sullivan, said that while his actions were wrong, he was often motivated by a desire to do the right thing.   In one case, he said, he reviewed the emails of a woman whom a potential client had wanted investigated in order to see if the client was being truthful about claims he made about the woman. Mr. Saldarriaga said that in reviewing the woman's emails, he learned that the man was not telling the truth and might have been stalking her.   He said he declined the assignment and sent an anonymous letter to the woman, warning her about the man's intentions.   ''Despite the illegality of my actions, I take solace in the fact that I may have protected a potential victim from serious harm,'' Mr. Saldarriaga said in his letter to the judge.   Prosecutors said it was true that some of Mr. Saldarriaga's email intrusions had nothing to do with his business as a private investigator and were motivated by his personal interests. But authorities said none of that diminishes the seriousness of the invasion of privacy.   ''It goes without saying that email accounts oftentimes contain individual's most personal communications, including correspondence about one's personal relationships, finances, business affairs and medical information,'' Mr. Noble, the prosecutor, said in the pre-sentencing memorandum. ''Through his email hacking activities, the defendant repeatedly intruded into these intimate discussions.''    "
F.B.I. Says Little Doubt North Korea Hit Sony,"WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I.'s director, James B. Comey, said on Wednesday that the United States had concluded that North Korea was behind the destructive attacks on Sony Pictures partly because the hackers failed to mask their location when they broke into the company's servers. Mr. Comey said that instead of routing some of the attacks and messages through decoy servers, the hackers had sent them directly from known North Korean Internet addresses.  Though Mr. Comey did not offer more details about the government's evidence in a speech in New York, senior government officials said that F.B.I.'s analysts discovered that the hackers made a critical error by logging into both their Facebook account and Sony's servers from North Korean Internet addresses. It was clear, the officials said, that hackers quickly recognized their mistake. In several cases, after mistakenly logging in directly, they quickly backtracked and rerouted their attacks and messages through decoy computers abroad. Before the attacks in November, Sony Pictures was threatened in a series of messages posted to a Facebook account set up by a group calling itself ''Guardians of Peace.'' After Facebook closed that account in November, the group changed its messaging platform and began sending threats in emails to Sony and on the anonymous posting site Pastebin. As far back as last June, North Korean officials wrote in a letter to the United Nations that ''The Interview,'' a Sony comedy about two journalists hired to assassinate its leader, Kim Jong-un, was an act of terrorism. Responding to critics who have questioned why the United States thinks North Korea was the source of the attacks, Mr. Comey said on Wednesday that the hackers became ''sloppy'' as they tried to cover their tracks. He acknowledged that the North Koreans had used decoys but did not elaborate about the specific mistakes the hackers made that gave him ''high confidence'' the country was behind the attack. Mr. Comey urged the United States intelligence community to declassify all the information that showed that the hackers had used such servers, something that could take months Mr. Comey's remarks came a little more than three weeks after President Obama took the unusual step of publicly naming the North Koreans as the culprit. Last week, American officials imposed a series of sanctions on senior North Korean officials as retaliation for the attack. The slip-up by the North Koreans was similar to one two years ago that led American officials to conclude that hackers inside the Chinese military's Unit 61398 was behind attacks on thousands of companies and government agencies abroad. In that case, the Chinese hackers logged into their Facebook and Twitter accounts from the same infrastructure they used for their attacks. Facebook closed the Guardians of Peace Facebook account in November. A Facebook spokesman said the company could not comment on specific accounts or law enforcement requests. In the past, the F.B.I. has compelled companies like Facebook to provide it with specific information about user accounts, including logs of user activity and Internet protocol addresses, through court orders. The Sony breach has become a focal point for the F.B.I. and other officials because it was one of the rare attacks on a big corporation that the United States has attributed to a foreign government. Mr. Comey made his remarks about the Sony breach in a speech at the International Conference on Cyber Security in New York. The four-day event, coordinated by the F.B.I., brings together law enforcement officials and Internet security experts from around the world to discuss and analyze techniques hackers use to breach corporate computer networks. Shortly after the F.B.I. blamed the North Korean government for the Sony attack, some digital security experts began to raise doubts about the government's claim. Working off a sliver of the digital evidence from the attack -- samples of malware that were distributed to security researchers -- several security researchers said they were skeptical of government claims that the attackers were North Korean. Critics noted that an extortion letter posted by the attackers suggested that they may have been criminals or embittered employees, not a nation state. They suggested that the fact that the attackers coded malware off computers with Korean language settings could have been faked, and they said that the I.P. addresses used in the attack were also used in other attacks. Some at Taia Global, a organizer of cybersecurity conferences, said a linguistic analysis of 2,000 words that the attackers had posted online persuaded them that the attackers could have been North Korean but were more likely Russian. But the F.B.I. and other security experts say those critics have had access to only some of the evidence from the attack. They say the accumulation of the evidence collected by the F.B.I., Sony and Mandiant, a security firm hired by Sony, makes clear that North Korea was the culprit. Just before Mr. Comey made his statements, a leading cybersecurity expert took those critics to task. ''One of the joys of the Internet is that anyone with a keyboard and a connection can be an expert,'' James A. Lewis, a director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in an essay posted online on Wednesday. ''Opinion substitutes for research. The uninformed debate over the Sony cyberincident is the most recent example of the Internet's limitations.'' Mr. Lewis said a close reading of classified documents leaked last year by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, made clear that American intelligence officials maintained deep access in North Korea's networks. The real debate, Mr. Lewis said, was one of government mistrust by the cybersecurity community, particularly after the revelations by Mr. Snowden. On Wednesday, some skeptics of the government's claims, like Sean Sullivan, a cybersecurity adviser at F-Secure, a security firm based in Helsinki, said the government should release evidence it collected from the Facebook account of Sony's attackers. ''Revealing what Facebook knows about that account and how it was used can't be something the F.B.I. needs to keep classified. Just can't,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''It is a very simple request to ask what was discovered when investigated. Very.'' But some of the most vocal critics of the government's claims, like Marc Rogers, a security researcher at CloudFlare, said they were still not convinced. ''If the government had laid out its attribution in the beginning, that may have quelled the criticism, but the evidence that's been put before me and many of my colleagues is flimsy.'' "
U.S. Military Social Media Feeds Are Seized by ISIS Sympathizers,"WASHINGTON -- Hackers claiming to be working on behalf of the Sunni militant group known as the Islamic State took over the Twitter and YouTube accounts of the United States Central Command on Monday, sending out a series of posts far different from the American military's standard fare. ''In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the CyberCaliphate continues its CyberJihad,'' one post on Twitter said. ''American soldiers, we are coming, watch your back,'' said another.  The Defense Department scrambled against the attack. By early Monday afternoon, Central Command had taken down its Twitter account and suspended its YouTube feed. A defense official said that no classified material had been breached and that the military was taking steps to address the matter. The F.B.I. was also investigating. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the government was monitoring the extent of the hacking. He played down any comparisons between the hacking of Sony Pictures and the one of Central Command. ''There's a pretty significant difference between what is a large data breach and the hacking of a Twitter account,'' Mr. Earnest said. But for the Defense Department, the hacking was, at the very least, embarrassing. A black-and-white banner with the image of a hooded militant and ''I love you ISIS'' replaced Central Command's usual banner on Twitter. Some posts listed purported names and phone numbers of American military personnel, while another said the so-called cybercaliphate is ''already here, we are in your PCs, in each military base.'' Two posts carried links to slides depicting ''scenarios'' for conflicts with North Korea and China. Central Command, which had about 113,000 followers on Twitter on Monday, oversees the American-led war against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and has been spearheading hundreds of airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Officials at Central Command could not immediately be reached for comment. Many of the documents posted by the hackers appeared to be public documents, including transcripts of congressional testimony. Some documents, such as a summary of the costs of major Pentagon weapons systems, are on the Defense Department's website. Security experts questioned Central Command's control of its Twitter and YouTube accounts in light of the security breach. Both Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, offer users an additional layer of security known as two-factor authentication, which requires a second, one-time password if the user logs into the account from an unrecognized computer. It was unclear whether Central Command social media accounts included the additional security. ''While strong multi-factor login controls exist, it is normal for shared P.R. accounts like this to lack that additional layer of security, making them an easier target,'' said Trey Ford, a global security strategist at Rapid7, a Boston security firm. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called the cyberattack ''severely disturbing.'' It occurred at the start of a week in which President Obama is expected to focus on cybersecurity. On Monday, Mr. Obama called for federal legislation to force American companies to be more forthcoming when credit card data and other consumer information are lost in an online breach like the kinds that hit Sony Pictures, Target and Home Depot last year. "
Stolen Documents That Cast a Spotlight on Surveillance,"In the age of encryption, computer hacking, WikiLeaks and Edward J. Snowden, the theft of typewritten government documents from an unlocked file cabinet 44 years ago by ordinary citizens may seem quaint.  But on the evening of March 8, 1971, while much of America was distracted by the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight, burglars broke into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's office in Media, Pa., and stole files that revealed the bureau's unlawful surveillance of antiwar activists. Photocopies were mailed anonymously to three major newspapers, including The New York Times, but only The Washington Post published anything from the files.     The uproar that followed was enormous. The F.B.I. director, J. Edgar Hoover, then so powerful that even presidents feared him, was apoplectic. He was behind Cointelpro, short for Counterintelligence Program, which was later revealed to have secretly collected information on civil rights activists and any group the F.B.I. deemed potentially subversive, with the intent to intimidate and disrupt them. The illegal program had been operating since 1956.   F.B.I. agents combed neighborhoods in eastern Pennsylvania seeking the culprits, who were never found. If caught and convicted, the group of eight, calling themselves the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the F.B.I., could have faced long prison sentences. Their names became public in 2014 with the release of Johanna Hamilton's documentary ''1971'' and a book, ''The Burglary: The Discovery of J. Edgar Hoover's Secret FBI,'' by the reporter who initially covered the story.    Ms. Hamilton's straightforward documentary skillfully interweaves reminiscences by members of the group with re-enactments of the burglary. The F.B.I.'s frantic reaction sounds almost like a Keystone Kops comedy in which 150 agents, many poorly disguised as hippies, saturated the Philadelphia suburbs and went knocking on doors.    It is theorized that the manhunt ended only after the arrest of the Camden 28, a group of antiwar activists who raided a draft board in Camden, N.J., later that same year. Since at least two of those 28, who were all acquitted, belonged to the Citizens' Commission, it is presumed that the F.B.I. believed it had solved the case.    The actions of the Citizens' Commission led directly to the Church Committee hearings, the country's first Congressional investigation of American intelligence agencies. The principal talking heads in the film include Keith Forsyth, the lock picker for the Citizens' Commission; Bob Williamson, who was also a member of the Camden 28; Bonnie and John Raines, who had three children at the time of the burglary and risked destroying their family for their principles; and Betty Medsger, the reporter and the author of ''The Burglary.''    To a person, they are a thoughtful and articulate group. At the end of the movie, Mr. Williamson, when asked about the unintended consequences of the break-in, reflects sadly that it ''raised the level of cynicism in the country.''   1971   Opens on Friday   Directed by Johanna Hamilton; written by Ms. Hamilton and Gabriel Rhodes; directors of photography, Kirsten Johnson and Andreas Burgess; edited by Mr. Rhodes; music by Philip Sheppard; produced by Ms. Hamilton, Marilyn Ness and Katy Chevigny; released by Maximum Pictures and Fork Films. Running time: 1 hour 19 minutes. This film is not rated.    "
What Anthem Customers Should Do Next After Data Breach,"Consumers' first worry in a major security breach is usually about their financial and credit accounts. But cyberthieves can do some serious damage with medical information as well. Anthem Health said this week that hackers obtained names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdays, email and employment information on up to 80 million current and former customers and Anthem employees. Although Anthem says the attackers did not get any medical records, they did get access to medical identification numbers found on insurance cards. Anthem offers several Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance plans across the country.    ''You don't need a complete medical record to commit medical identity theft if you have the correct name and Social Security number,'' said Pam Dixon, executive director of World Privacy Forum. ''The chief harm for medical identity theft is that your medical record will change without your knowledge.''    And in this case, the hackers have enough information to do exactly that. Here's what you need to know:   THEFT TYPES In large-scale breaches like the one at Anthem, experts said the criminals could pose as medical billers and fraudulently charge consumers' insurance companies for medical services and drugs. Not only is your insurer paying for something that you didn't ask for, but the fraudsters can also alter your medical record, Ms. Dixon said.   With an insurance ID number in hand, it can be easier for criminals to attempt to acquire medical records or insurance codes to help guide them on what to bill for, she explained. ''Searches through the data for cancer survivors or even those in current cancer treatment would allow for fake billing to be piggybacked onto the real billing. This makes it extremely difficult for the health plan to detect the fake billing, and the thieves then will get a stream of payouts over time. It adds up to a lot of money quickly.''   Anthem has said that it does not believe medical information like insurance claims or test results were compromised. Hospital and doctor information is also believed to have been spared.   WHAT TO DO Consumers should try to create their own copy of their medical file so they have an accurate version of their history should a fraudster make any changes, said Ms. Dixon, who has worked with many medical identity theft victims. Think about any significant or chronic medical conditions, surgeries or accidents -- particularly for the last few years -- and get a record from your doctors' offices, hospital or other provider. Also get a record of your blood type and any drug allergies. If you have access to an online patient portal, try to print out or save a copy of those files elsewhere.   ''You want to print a baseline record so that if it is altered without your knowledge by fraudulent activity,'' Ms. Dixon said, ''you have something that is really clean.'' That will help prove your case, she said, and rebuild an accurate history.   WHAT TO MONITOR If you have online access to any of your medical records through a patient portal, keep a watchful eye for any suspicious activity. And closely monitor your explanation of benefit statements to be sure they do not include any services you did not receive (and if you suspect you are not receiving your statements, report that to your insurer as well). Credit-monitoring services may help pick up medical debt collections in your name that you do not owe, and calls from collectors may be another warning signal.   Also remember this is a long-term crime. Fraudulent activity may not show up for six months to a year, experts said, so a heightened sense of awareness and vigilance needs to become routine.   WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW Scam artists have already started sending emails that appear to be from Anthem's insurers in an attempt to trick people into sharing personal data. The company said there was no indication that the scams were being conducted by the same thieves who conducted the cyberattack.   Anthem said it would contact current and former members via mail delivered by the United States Postal Service about the breach with specifics on how to enroll in free credit monitoring and ID protection services, which will be provided for a year. It cautioned not to click on any links in emails that appear to be from the company, and said not to open attachments, reply to senders or supply any information.   Anthem created a website, www.AnthemFacts.com, and a toll-free number, 1-877-263-7995, to respond to questions.    "
Inquiry Into Hacking Delves Into Private Investigators,"Private investigators may be the newest front for federal prosecutors in cracking down on the hacker-for-hire business. In the coming weeks, a private investigator in New York is expected to plead guilty to charges of paying a so-called hacker-for-hire firm to steal email passwords and credentials, said three people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly because no charges have been filed yet. The guilty plea would wrap up a nearly yearlong investigation by the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors in  New York. The identity of the private investigator, who works for a small firm, could not be determined.   Law enforcement authorities focused on the investigator because of the clients he has worked for, including some lawyers, the people briefed on the matter said. The investigation is loosely related to another one that led to a New York City police officer's  guilty plea in federal court in 2013 to charges that he paid a company to hack into the email accounts of some colleagues. In that case, Edwin Vargas, who was a detective at the time, was accused of paying $4,000 to an unidentified firm to hack the email accounts of 43 people, including current and former New York police officers. Mr. Vargas, who was sentenced last year to four months in prison, said he had been motivated by jealousy and wanted to determine whether any of his colleagues were dating a former girlfriend who is the mother of his son. The investigation into Mr. Vargas was prompted by information developed by the federal authorities in Los Angeles during a two-year investigation into the hacker-for-hire business that led to the filing of charges against more than a dozen people nationwide involved in either breaking into email accounts or soliciting a hacker for the job. The investigation in Los Angeles, dubbed Operation Firehack by the F.B.I., uncovered a cottage industry of firms that contend they can gain access to email accounts in exchange for fees of $50 to $250, depending on the complexity of the job. These firms, several of which were shut down by the F.B.I., typically are paid either through PayPal or another online payment processor. It is thought that the private investigator in New York used one of these firms, the people briefed on the matter said. It's not clear whether the private investigator has cooperated with the federal authorities or intends to plead guilty to simply avoid a potential trial. The investigation, however, has the potential to shed light on a less-than-savory activity that has been the subject of speculation in the legal community: the hiring of private investigators by lawyers to hack into email accounts to learn more about potential witnesses and gather evidence for trial strategies. The notion that lawyers would countenance the hacking of emails appears to flout the legal profession's most basic ethical standards. But security experts and former prosecutors said that investigations over the years had unearthed evidence that some lawyers hire private investigators to obtain information for cases without delving too deeply into how it has been gathered. In effect, these lawyers are seeking to hire a private investigator willing to skirt the law but do so in a way that gives them plausible deniability  of any potentially illegal activity. ""Any firm operating with ethics, governance and integrity that is concerned about breaking the law will not do that kind of work as it could be illegal without authorization from the email account owner,"" said Rocco Grillo, a managing director and leader of the global incident response and forensics investigation practice for Protiviti, a global risk consulting firm. ""But does it go on? Sure, in some cases."" Daniel B. Garrie, executive managing partner with Law and Forensics, a computer security consulting firm that specializes in working with law firms, said that because some private investigation firms are known to sometimes engage hackers, lawyers needed to be careful about hiring outside investigators for an assignment. ""A law firm is well advised to create a written record with the private investigator so there is no misunderstanding later on,"" said Mr. Garrie, who  is a lawyer. ""A lawyer should never hire an individual to hack except in a very narrow and limited circumstance where the side being hacked has consented to the action or there is a court order permitting the hacking."" In London, a private investigator played a chief role in the criminal prosecution of the former editor of the News of the World, which had a practice of hacking into voice mail messages left on mobile phones. The investigation found that some editors of the tabloid, which is now defunct, had paid an investigator to hack into voice mail messages as a source of leads for articles. In the United States, the hacking that some private investigators are involved with is far different from the cyberattacks on companies like Anthem, Target, Sony and JPMorgan Chase that have dominated the headlines recently. In those cases, cybercriminals or hackers, often working with the blessing of foreign governments, have initiated large scale assaults to obtain internal emails of executives or sensitive personal information about customers or employees.  Much of the hacking done by private investigators is much narrower in scope, usually limited to obtaining email login credentials or unearthing information from social media accounts, security experts said. It is similar to many of the dubiously legal jobs now being advertised on Hacker's List, a four-month-old online forum where hackers can anonymously bid for a job posted by person looking to conduct their own espionage. A representative for Hacker's List, which warns customers not to post jobs that involve breaking the law, said of the 1,942 active projects posted on the website, 181 have been completed by a hacker.

Premera Blue Cross Says Data Breach Exposed Medical Data,"BOSTON --  Health insurer Premera Blue Cross said on Tuesday it was a victim of a cyberattack that may have exposed medical data and financial information of 11 million customers in the latest serious breach disclosed by a health-care company.  It said the attackers may have gained access to claims data, including clinical information, along with banking account numbers, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data in an attack that began in May 2014.    It is the largest breach reported to date involving patient medical information, according to Dave Kennedy, an expert in health care security who is chief executive of TrustedSEC.   About six million of the people whose accounts were affected are residents of Washington state, where customers include employees of Amazon.com, Microsoft and Starbucks, according to Premera. The rest are scattered across the United States.   The breach at Anthem and another large one disclosed last year by hospital operator Community Health Systems involved larger numbers of records than the attack on Premera. Yet those companies said they believed the attackers did not access medical information.   Medical records are highly valuable on underground criminal exchanges where stolen data is sold because the information is not only highly confidential, it can also be used to engage in insurance fraud.   ''Medical records paint a really personal picture of somebody's life and medical procedures,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''They allow you to perpetrate really in-depth medical fraud.''   The insurer said it has so far uncovered no evidence to show that member data was ''used inappropriately.''   The breach was uncovered on Jan. 29, the day that insurer Anthem disclosed a cyberattack involving records of some 79 million members in Blue Cross Blue Shield plans across the country.   A Premera spokesman, Eric Earling, said the two attacks were unrelated and that his company independently identified its breach.   Experts expect that other health-care companies will uncover that they have been breached as the latest attack prompts them to look for intrusions.   ''I think other insurance providers are compromised today and we still don't know it,'' Mr. Kennedy said.   Premera hired FireEye to investigate the matter and is also working with the F.B.I.   The attack affected Premera Blue Cross, Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska, and affiliated brands Vivacity and Connexion Insurance Solutions.     "
"Naming U.S. Service Members, ISIS Asks They Be Killed","WASHINGTON --  In a new online threat to American military personnel, the Islamic State has called on its members and sympathizers in the United States to kill 100 service members whose names, photos and purported addresses it posted on a website.  The group said that the personnel had participated in efforts to defeat it in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere.    Defense Department and F.B.I. officials said that they were aware of the website and were investigating the posting.   It does not appear that the information had been hacked from government servers. One Defense Department official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that most of the information could be found in public records, residential address search sites and social media.   The officials said the list appears to be drawn from personnel who have appeared in news articles about airstrikes on the militant group.    Some of the names also appear to be drawn from the Defense Department's own official reports on the campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.   But the list also included armed services personnel and others in the United States or elsewhere who have had nothing to do with the bombing campaigns, officials said.   For instance, the list includes B-52 crew members stationed in Louisiana and North Dakota, but the air campaign is not using those bombers, the Defense Department official said. Several women are included on the list, but their faces in the photos were blurred. One of the photos appears to be at an official meeting with President Obama.   American officials have grudgingly acknowledged the cleverness with which the Islamic State has used the Internet, in particular social media. The posting of military personnel includes names, photographs and other information neatly formatted.   ''With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers in America can deal with you,'' the Islamic State's so-called Hacking Division said in the web posting.   It added: ''And now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for?''   The disclosure by the Islamic State highlights some of the challenges facing the military in balancing how it performs two essential functions: protecting its personnel while providing the American public with information.   Unlike other parts of the United States government, in particular other agencies dealing with national security affairs, the American military allows members of the media to spend time embedded with its personnel in the field, granting permission to identify and quote them in reports.

Sony Studio Renews Warning After WikiLeaks Posts Stolen Data,"LOS ANGELES -- David Boies, a lawyer for Sony Pictures Entertainment, began warning news media outlets on Friday that WikiLeaks's posting of emails and documents stolen from Sony does not, in the media giant's view, make them fair game.  ''WikiLeaks is incorrect that this Stolen Information belongs in the public domain, and it is, in many jurisdictions, unlawful to place it there or otherwise access or distribute it,'' Mr. Boies wrote in a letter that was prepared for distribution to outlets that post or publish the material.    On Thursday, WikiLeaks renewed interest in last November's cyberattack on Sony by posting an indexed, searchable archive of material taken in the hack. WikiLeaks said it was justified in posting the material because it chronicles the inner workings of an international corporation with extensive business and government connections.   Mr. Boies had warned news organizations about possessing or reproducing the stolen material; but he appears so far not to have filed lawsuits against those who ignored his warnings.   In his new letter, Mr. Boies cited federal copyright and computer fraud laws in warning against use of the material, now posted by WikiLeaks. ''Many other countries have similar, if not more stringent, laws applicable to this situation,'' the letter added.   Since the WikiLeaks post, Gawker, The Wrap and others have posted accounts of material freshly culled from the Sony files.    "
The Spy Who Wasn't,"On Monday, Oct. 20, 2014, Sherry Chen drove, as usual, to her office at the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio, where she forecast flood threats along the Ohio River. She was a bit jet-lagged, having returned a few days earlier from a visit to China. But as she headed to her desk, she says, she had no reason to think it was anything other than an ordinary day. Then her boss summoned her. Once inside his office, a back door opened and in walked six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.     The agents accused Mrs. Chen, a hydrologist born in China and now a naturalized American citizen, of using a stolen password to download information about the nation's dams and of lying about meeting with a high-ranking Chinese official.     Mrs. Chen, 59, an adoptive Midwesterner who had received awards for her government service, was now suspected of being a Chinese spy. She was arrested and led in handcuffs past her co-workers to a federal courthouse 40 miles away in Dayton, where she was told she faced 25 years in prison and $1 million in fines.    Her life went into a tailspin. She was suspended without pay from her job, and her family in China had to scramble for money to pay for her legal defense. Friends and co-workers said they were afraid to visit. Television news trucks parked outside her house, waiting to spot a foreign spy hiding in plain sight in suburban Wilmington, population 12,500.    ''I could not sleep,'' Mrs. Chen said in a recent interview. ''I could not eat. I did nothing but cry for days.''   Then, five months later, the ordeal abruptly ended. In March, just a week before she was scheduled to go on trial, prosecutors dropped all charges against Mrs. Chen without explanation.   ''We are exercising our prosecutorial discretion,'' said Jennifer Thornton, the spokeswoman for the United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. She added that last year the Justice Department filed 400 indictments and ''criminal informations'' -- charges filed in connection with plea agreements -- and dismissed 13 of them, including Mrs. Chen's. The United States attorney would not comment on the investigation, but there is little question that law enforcement is facing new pressure to pursue any lead that could be related to trade-secret theft.    For the last few years, government officials have noted with growing alarm that Chinese hackers and paid insiders were spiriting trade secrets and other confidential information out of the United States. The mantra, these days, is that there are only two types of companies left in this country: those that have been hacked by China, and those that do not know they have been hacked by China.   In 2013, President Obama announced a new strategy to fight back. The cornerstone was more aggressive investigations and prosecutions, and Justice Department prosecutions under the Economic Espionage Act jumped more than 30 percent from the year before. During the first nine months of 2014, the total increased an additional 33 percent. Notably, more than half of the economic espionage indictments since 2013 have had a China connection, public documents show.   It was in this climate that prosecutors zeroed in on Mrs. Chen.    ''They came across a person of Chinese descent and a little bit of evidence that they may have been trying to benefit the Chinese government, but it's clear there was a little bit of Red Scare and racism involved,'' said Peter J. Toren, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in computer crimes and industrial espionage. He is now a partner at Weisbrod Matteis & Copley in Washington, and the author of ''Intellectual Property and Computer Crimes.''   Interviews with Mrs. Chen and her former colleagues and a review of court filings, which include a year's worth of Mrs. Chen's work and personal emails, suggest that prosecutors hunted for evidence of espionage, failed and settled on lesser charges that they eventually dropped.   ''The government thought they had struck gold with this case,'' said Mark D. Rasch, a former Justice Department espionage and computer-crimes prosecutor who reviewed the case. ''The problem was the facts didn't quite meet the law here.''   A Favor Gone Wrong   Mrs. Chen, whose given name is Xiafen, was born in Beijing. From an early age, she was an engineering type. An uncle encouraged her to pursue a career in building design, but she says she was more interested in the abstract nature of water and air. ''You can't see them with your own two eyes,'' she said, growing animated. ''It's so much more complex than that. I found it fascinating.''   She earned advanced degrees in hydrology in Beijing, married and moved to the United States to pursue a degree in water resources and climatology at the University of Nebraska. She became an American citizen in 1997. After 11 years working for the state of Missouri, she took the job at the weather service in Ohio in 2007.   In Wilmington, she and her husband, an electronics specialist, moved into a ranch-style house a short drive from her office, settling into a life of comfortable routine.   Ask Mrs. Chen about her home or hobbies and you may get a word or two. Ask her about water flow or the Ohio River and she will talk for hours. Some 25 million people live along the Ohio River basin, which runs more than 900 miles from Pittsburgh to Cairo, Ill., where it joins the Mississippi River. Along the way, it flows through locks and dams operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Mrs. Chen developed a forecasting model for predicting floods along the Ohio and its tributaries. The model involves constant data-gathering about water levels and rainfall, as well as how dam and lock operators respond to water flow.    Mrs. Chen was known to be tenacious in her pursuit of data for her predictions. She developed carpal-tunnel syndrome in her right hand from eight years of repetitive mouse clicks. Thomas Adams, who hired Mrs. Chen at the National Weather Service in 2007, said her fascination with data made her perfect for the job.   ''Sherry is and was dedicated to getting the details right -- and that matters significantly,'' Mr. Adams said, noting that one inch of water could make the difference between a levee holding or failing.    Mrs. Chen would return to Beijing every year to visit her parents, which is how her troubles began. During her 2012 trip, a nephew said that his future father-in-law was in a payment dispute with provincial officials over a water pipeline.   The nephew knew that one of Mrs. Chen's former hydrology classmates, Jiao Yong, had become vice minister of China's Ministry of Water Resources, which oversees much of China's water infrastructure. As Mrs. Chen tells it, her nephew asked her to reach out to Mr. Jiao, hoping he might be able to help his future wife's father. Mrs. Chen said she was reluctant to do so since she had not seen Mr. Jiao in many years, but ultimately contacted him.   Mr. Jiao's secretary set up a 15-minute chat in his office in downtown Beijing, and Mr. Jiao said he would try to intercede. As their conversation wound down, he also mentioned that he was in the process of funding repairs for China's aging reservoir systems and was curious how such projects were funded in the United States.   It was a casual question, Mrs. Chen said, but she was embarrassed not to know the answer. As a young hydrology student in China, she had been well versed in water project finance. It was not until that moment, she said, that she realized how little she knew about financing of such projects in her new home country.    Always a master of details, she said her ignorance in this case gnawed at her.   When she returned to Ohio, she set out to find an answer. She eventually sent Mr. Jiao an email with links to websites, but nothing directly relevant to his question.   She also asked for help from Deborah H. Lee, then the chief of the water management division at the Army Corps of Engineers, with whom Mrs. Chen had worked on projects over the years.    Copies of emails included in court documents show that Ms. Lee directed Mrs. Chen to her agency's website and told her that if her former classmate had further questions, he could contact her directly. Mrs. Chen then sent a second, final email to Mr. Jiao instructing him to call Ms. Lee directly with any additional questions.    Shortly after her email exchange with Mrs. Chen, Ms. Lee reported their correspondence to security staff at the Department of Commerce, the agency over the National Weather Service. ''I'm concerned that an effort is being made to collect a comprehensive collection of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers water control manuals on behalf of a foreign interest,'' Ms. Lee wrote.   Ms. Lee would not comment on her motivations for sending the email. Last September, she left the Army Corps of Engineers for a job at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. A spokeswoman for N.O.A.A. said neither Ms. Lee nor the agency would comment on what they deemed a ''personnel matter.''    If Mr. Jiao was trying to recruit Mrs. Chen, he was awfully lackadaisical about it. It took a week to respond to her first email. ''Hi Xiafen: Your email received,'' he wrote, in English. ''Thanks for information you forward me. I will go through it.'' His second email was briefer: ''Thanks a lot.''    That was the extent of their correspondence, according to findings of a search warrant for Mrs. Chen's work and personal email records.   Mrs. Chen said she never did find out whether Mr. Jiao had helped her nephew's father-in-law, and has not heard from him since. Mr. Jiao did not respond to requests for comment.    But in her search for an answer to Mr. Jiao's question, Mrs. Chen had gone through the National Inventory of Dams database. That database, which is maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, is available to government workers and members of the public who request login credentials. A small subset of the data on the site -- six of 70 data fields -- is available only to government workers.    As a government employee, Mrs. Chen would have had full access to the database. But she didn't have a password; the government began requiring passwords in 2009, after the last time Mrs. Chen had used it. So she asked a colleague, Ray Davis, in the adjacent cubicle, for help. Mr. Davis, who had already provided the password and login instructions to the whole office, emailed the password to her.    Mrs. Chen didn't find much useful information for Mr. Jiao, but did download data about Ohio dams that she thought could be relevant to her forecasting model. For Mr. Jiao, she included a link to the database in her second email and noted that ''this database is only for government users, and nongovernment users are not able to download any data from this site.'' If he had any questions, or needed information, she told him, he should contact Ms. Lee -- who had just reported Mrs. Chen as a possible spy.    When Mr. Davis was later questioned by Commerce officials, he said he did not remember giving Mrs. Chen a password. Mrs. Chen said she did not remember receiving one. And neither believed they had done anything wrong, according to reports of their interviews.    The password, however, would come to haunt her. Nearly a year after Ms. Lee's tip, Mrs. Chen was visited at her office by two special agents from the Commerce Department. They interrogated her for seven hours about the password, and her 15-minute meeting with the Chinese official.    Asked when she last met with Mr. Jiao, she responded, ''It was the last time I visited my parents, I think 2011, May 2011.''    That was June 2013. Mrs. Chen did not hear from the government for another three months, when she and her husband returned from a four-week trip to see her parents. Her father, who had been ill, died during the visit. The day after she returned, the Commerce Department agents showed up at her office.   A slow-motion investigation was gathering momentum. An F.B.I. memo regarding Mrs. Chen, dated July 11, 2014, listed the Army Corps of Engineers as ''victim -- economic espionage -- PRC,'' short for People's Republic of China.    In September 2014, Mrs. Chen and her husband were stopped while boarding a United Airlines flight to Beijing from Newark. Their baggage was pulled and searched. Ms. Chen said they were ultimately allowed to return to the plane, which had been held for over an hour.    It was after returning from that trip, in October, that she was arrested. At the Dayton courthouse, she was charged with four felonies, including that she had illegally downloaded data about ''critical national infrastructure'' from a restricted government database -- the National Inventory of Dams -- and made false statements.    The false statement referred to telling the agents that she had last seen Mr. Jiao in 2011, not 2012. Four other charges were added later.   She was released the same day and placed on unpaid administrative leave.    'Why Would You Do That?'   After the arrest, Mrs. Chen's name was all over the Internet. The case was picked up by local media and The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news website, which played up Mrs. Chen's meeting with a ''senior Chinese official.''    Mrs. Chen says she was living a nightmare. Peter R. Zeidenberg, a partner at Arent Fox in Washington who represented Mrs. Chen, said he believed it was telling that the government went after Mrs. Chen for using a colleague's password, but not after the colleague who gave it to her -- and to the entire office. (Neither Mr. Davis nor anyone else currently employed at the National Weather Service would comment for this article.)   Mr. Adams, her former colleague, said he thought that Mrs. Chen's Chinese background played a role. ''If this had been you or me or someone of European descent who borrowed someone else's password,'' he said, ''they would have said, 'Don't do this again.' '' He added: ''This is the gratitude the government has shown for her hard work and dedication as a federal public servant. It's shameful.''   A week before trial was to begin, Mr. Zeidenberg requested a meeting with Carter M. Stewart and Mark T. D'Alessandro, two United States attorneys for the Southern District of Ohio.    ''Why,'' Mr. Zeidenberg said he asked, ''if she's a spy, is she coming back from China and telling her colleagues that 'I met this guy in China and this is what he wants to know'? Why is she telling the guy in China, 'Here's my boss's phone number'? Why is she asking for a password over email? Why would you do that?''   Mr. Zeidenberg says the prosecutors listened. On March 10, the day after their meeting, they dismissed the charges.    ''Thank God,'' Mr. Zeidenberg added.   Looking Everywhere for Spies   Mrs. Chen was caught in a much broader dragnet aimed at combating Chinese industrial espionage. Law enforcement investigations into trade-secret theft are now at record levels, jumping 60 percent between 2009 and 2013, according to an F.B.I. report last year.   In 2013, Eric H. Holder Jr., then the attorney general, said the Justice Department would bring more economic espionage cases, and in 2014 it secured the first ever indictment of foreign actors when it charged five Chinese military officers with trade-secret theft. (The chances of arrests, however, are slim.)    Inside the United States, prosecutors recently invoked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the case of a Chinese citizen living in this country accused of stealing hybrid seeds from an Iowa cornfield. In addition to physical surveillance, the government used a secret FISA warrant to intercept the defendant's mail, email and phone calls and install location-tracking and listening devices in his car.    In another case, in Philadelphia, an American resident with Chinese citizenship stands accused of damaging a server to cover up trade-secret theft. He's been held in a federal detention center for over two years; his trial is set for November.    ''If you're looking everywhere for spies, you will find spies everywhere, even where they don't exist,'' said Mr. Rasch, the former computer-crimes prosecutor.    The case against Mrs. Chen has made her wary. After I had interviewed her several times but did not contact her for some days, she said she had convinced herself that I was not a reporter at all, but an undercover agent.    Mrs. Chen says she recalls becoming an American citizen as her proudest moment. She told me about all the positive performance reviews she received and began to cry when she remembered the way she was handcuffed in front of co-workers and put into the back of an F.B.I. car.   Still, she says, she wants her job back. ''I know they treated me unfairly, but I'm proud of my service,'' she said. ''The forecasting model is very important. I miss my colleagues. I miss my work. It's my life.''   Mrs. Chen's benefits and pay have been restored, but she is waiting to hear whether the Commerce Department will allow her to return to work. Sara Ryan, the department lawyer handling Mrs. Chen's case, said she would not discuss it. Representatives for the department did not return requests for comment.   Asked whether he thought Mrs. Chen should get her job back, Mr. Adams, her former colleague, said he was torn. ''I want her to get her job back as soon as possible,'' he said. ''But on the other hand, I also hope she never goes back there again. After the way she was treated, she should be concerned that the government hasn't given up the ghost.''    "
Up to 1.1 Million Customers Could be Affected in Data Breach at Insurer CareFirst,"CareFirst, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, on Wednesday became the third major health insurer in the United States to disclose this year that hackers had breached its computer systems and potentially compromised some customer information. The attack could affect as many as 1.1 million of its customers, but CareFirst said that although the hackers gained access to customer names, email addresses and birthdates, they did not obtain sensitive financial or medical information like Social Security numbers, credit card information and medical claims. The company, which has headquarters in Maryland and serves the Washington area, said the attack occurred in June and described it as ''sophisticated.''    Chet Burrell, CareFirst's chief executive, said the company contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating attacks against the insurers Anthem and Premera. ''They are looking into it,'' he said.    While it was not clear whether the attacks were related, he said the company was under constant assault by criminals seeking access to its systems.    Federal officials have yet to label the breaches at Anthem and Premera Blue Cross as state-sponsored hackings, but the F.B.I. is effectively treating them as such, and China is believed to be the main culprit, according to several people who were briefed on the investigations but spoke on the condition of anonymity. There are indications the attacks on Anthem, Premera and now CareFirst may have some common links.   Charles Carmakal, a managing director at Mandiant, a security firm retained by all three insurers, said in an emailed statement that the hacking at CareFirst ''was orchestrated by a sophisticated threat actor that we have seen specifically target the health care industry over the past year.''    The Breaches at Anthem, which is one of the nation's largest health insurers and operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, and Premera Blue Cross, based in Washington State, were much larger. The one at Anthem may have compromised the personal information of 79 million customers and the one at Premera up to 11 million customers.    Anthem has said the hackers may have stolen Social Security numbers but did not get access to any medical information. Premera said it was possible that some medical and bank account information may have been pilfered.   CareFirst said it was aware of one attack last year that it did not believe was successful. But after the attacks on other insurers, Mr. Burrell said he created a task force to scrutinize the company's vulnerabilities and asked Mandiant, a division of FireEye, to perform a forensic review of its systems. Last month, Mandiant determined a breach had occurred in June 2014.    Health insurance firms are seen as prime targets for hackers because they maintain a wealth of personal information on consumers, including medical claims records and information about credit card and bank accounts.    In recent years, the attacks have escalated, said Dr. Larry Ponemon, the chairman of Ponemon Institute, which studies security breaches in health care. He said the health care industry was particularly vulnerable and that the information it had was attractive to criminals who use the data to steal the identity of consumers.   ''A lot of health care organizations have been historically laggards for security,'' he said.    Insurers say they are now on guard against these attacks. But Dr. Ponemon said they had taken only small steps, not ''huge leaps,'' in safeguarding their systems.   The motivation of the hackers in these cases, however, is unclear -- whether they are traditional criminals or groups bent on intelligence-gathering for a foreign government.   In the retail and banking industries, the hackers have been determined to get access to customer credit card information or financial data to sell on the black market to other online criminals, who then can use it to make charges or create false identities.    So far, there is scant evidence that any of the customer information that might have been taken from Anthem and Premera has made its way onto the black market. The longer that remains the case, the less likely that profit was a motive for taking the information, consultants said. That suggests that the hackers targeting the health care industry may be more interested in gathering information.   ''It's such an attractive target and it's a soft target and one not traditionally well protected,'' said Austin Berglas, head of online investigations in the United States and incident response for K2 Intelligence and a former top agent with the F.B.I. in New York. ''A nation state might be looking at pulling out medical information or simply looking to get a foothold, which they can use as a testing ground for tools to infiltrate other sectors,'' he said.   Paul Luehr, a managing director at Stroz Friedberg, a security consulting firm, said the health care breaches could be an entry point into other systems. ''It could serve as a conduit to valuable information in other sectors because everyone is connected to health information,'' he said.   Or the breaches could simply be crimes of opportunity. The hackers could be making off with information and waiting to determine what to do with it.    ''We want to jump to the conclusion that there is an organized chain and command,'' said Laura Galante, threat intelligence manager for FireEye, who was not commenting specifically on any particular breach. ''But what could be happening here is much more chaotic. It's simply, 'Get whatever data you can get and figure out what to do with it later.' ''    "
I.R.S. Breach Exposes Data of Taxpayers,"WASHINGTON --  Criminals used stolen data to gain access to past tax returns of more than 100,000 people through an application on the Internal Revenue Service's website, the agency said on Tuesday. Using Social Security numbers, birth dates, street addresses and other personal information obtained elsewhere, the criminals completed a multistep authentication process and requested the tax returns and other filings, the I.R.S. said. Information from those forms was used to file fraudulent returns, the I.R.S. said, and the agency sent nearly $50 million in refunds before it detected the scheme.    ''We're confident that these are not amateurs,'' John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, said. ''These actually are organized crime syndicates that not only we but everybody in the financial industry are dealing with.''    The agency has opened an investigation into the breach and has temporarily shut down the Get Transcript application, which was used to gain access to the information. Old tax returns are sometimes needed to apply for college loans or mortgages, and taxpayers can still request the records by mail.   More than 200,000 attempts to view the past returns using stolen information were made from February to mid-May, and about half were successful. It is unclear whether the criminals were operating inside or outside the United States.    Dealing with fraudulent tax claims has been a challenge for the I.R.S. as online crime has grown more sophisticated in recent years. The agency paid $5.8 billion in falsely claimed refunds in 2013.   ''Eighty percent of the identity theft we're dealing with and refund fraud is related to organized crime here and around the world,'' Mr. Koskinen said at a news conference on Tuesday. ''These are extremely sophisticated criminals with access to a tremendous amount of data.''   The I.R.S. said the attackers exploited data, like email addresses and passwords gleaned from other breaches, to answer basic authentication questions about subjects like birth dates or the names of family members. After recent breaches at the health insurer Anthem and Home Depot, security experts note that users' personal information is now widely available to hackers, who can buy it from criminal websites.   ''This is a wake-up call that breaches have a compounding effect and the stakes are getting higher,'' said Eric Chiu, a security expert who is the president of HyTrust, a cloud computing security company. ''Attackers are on the hunt for our personal and financial information using data stolen from other breaches to gain a larger amount of information on those same individuals.''   The consequence, Mr. Chiu said, ''could be devastating to consumers -- attacks can potentially open new accounts, siphon off funds and ultimately steal identities of victims.''   After the I.R.S. disclosed the breach, security experts criticized the agency for not adding more context to the authentication questions, or using a so-called multifactor system that sends users a second password via their mobile phone. Experts also criticized the agency for not deploying technology that looks for suspicious activity, such as multiple sign-in attempts from the same device, or encrypting sensitive information.    But Mr. Koskinen said that the I.R.S. had stopped almost three million suspicious returns this year, and officials say that new computer filters that look for anomalies have helped prevent identity theft.   Senate Finance Committee aides said Mr. Koskinen called the committee's chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, late last week to notify him of the breach. The committee kept it quiet while law enforcement officials opened the investigation.   Word of the breach prompted Republicans to increase their attacks on the tax collection agency, which has faced criticism since revelations that the I.R.S. had intentionally targeted political organizations for extra scrutiny of their tax-exempt applications.   ''That the I.R.S. -- home to highly sensitive information on every single American and every single company doing business here at home -- was vulnerable to this attack is simply unacceptable,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''What's more, this agency has been repeatedly warned by top government watchdogs that its data security systems are inadequate against the growing threat of international hackers and data thieves.''   But the breach is also likely to prompt the Obama administration to redouble its efforts to increase the I.R.S.'s budget, which has been cut 18 percent since 2010, adjusting for inflation. Since 2010, the agency has shed more than 13,000 employees, or 14 percent of the work force, with nearly 10,000 lost jobs coming from the enforcement staff, which is down 20 percent since 2010.   Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he had spoken with Mr. Koskinen, who assured him that the I.R.S. was getting to the bottom of the problem. ''It is important that members of Congress work together to ensure that the I.R.S. has adequate resources to carry out the vital priority of protecting confidential taxpayer information,'' Mr. Levin said.   The agency sent letters to the taxpayers whose accounts had been compromised, and it will offer them free credit monitoring. The I.R.S. said its main computer system, which handles tax filings, had not been breached.    ''During this filing season, taxpayers successfully and safely downloaded a total of approximately 23 million transcripts,'' the agency said.    "
"Chinese Hackers Behind Breach at Insurers Are Also Responsible for Government Attack, Researchers Say","SAN FRANCISCO -- The Chinese attackers who breached two major health insurers this year were also responsible for the intrusion at the Office of Personnel Management, which handles government security clearances and records for federal employees, researchers say. The attacks signal a new chapter in online espionage, according to security experts. Researchers say the motivation behind the attacks at the insurers, Anthem and Primera, as well as the Office of Personnel Management was digital espionage, not cybercrime.    Theft of personal information has typically been the realm of online criminals, who sell the information on the underground market, where it can be used to break into someone's email, bank or trading account, or typically for identity theft. In this case, however, researchers say the group that stole the personal information was known for digital espionage and suggests spies are no longer just stealing American corporate and military trade secrets, but personal information for some later purpose.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was working with other agencies to investigate the latest breaches. ''We take all potential threats to public and private sector systems seriously, and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,'' the agency said in a statement.   Just what the attackers plan to do with Social Security numbers and other personal information for four million current and former government workers, and millions more insured by Anthem and Primera, is not yet clear.   ''We believe they are creating a tremendous database of P.I.I.'' -- personally identifiable information -- ''that they can reach back to for further activity,'' said John Hultquist, the senior manager of online espionage threat intelligence at iSight, a security firm. ''It looks like they are casting a very wide net, possibly for followon operations or identifying persons of interest, but we're in a new space here and we don't entirely know what they're trying to do with it.''   Mr. Hultquist and his team had been investigating the attacks at Anthem and Primera, in which hackers started naming their web domains after their targets. They named one of those domains after WellPoint, only with one ''l,'' to mimic the Anthem site, and soon iSight's researchers saw them creating new infrastructure for other attacks, and new domains, including two named for the Office of Personnel Management, before they breached the agency. In every case, the group sought personal information.   ISight stopped short of pinning the attacks on China, but other researchers say there is widespread evidence that all three attacks were the work of actors in China, though they said the hackers used different tools than those employed by China's People's Liberation Army, whose 3rd Department oversees the gathering of online intelligence.   Beyond that, it is still unclear who, exactly, is behind the attacks.   The attack at the Office of Personnel Management was first detected in April, the office said, but started at least late last year. It is one of the largest breaches of federal employees' data. It is also the third major intrusion of a federal agency in the last year. In 2014, both the White House and State Department were attacked by hackers whom government officials believe are Russian.   It is unclear why American government agencies were vulnerable to such an extent, or why those agencies left critical data unencrypted. A report from the Government Accountability Office last year found that government agencies have inadequately responded to security incidents. The report found that 24 major federal agencies had been hit by hackers, and that in about 65 percent of cases, the agencies did not completely document their response to those incidents.   American officials are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts at an annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue this month, and government officials have vowed to make the topic of digital intrusions a priority.   In an attempt to deter the kinds of attacks that have left federal agencies reeling, President Obama signed a new executive order in April that established the first sanctions aimed at curbing foreign cyberespionage.   The order authorized financial and travel sanctions against anyone participating in online attacks that posed a threat to the ''national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States.''    "
I.R.S. Adds New Guards to Thwart ID Theft,"Follow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYT Reeling from an online attack that allowed criminals to steal personal information and divert tax refunds from tens of thousands of taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service announced on Thursday a sweeping effort to step up protections against identity theft and fraud. The actions are expected to be completed by early next year, well before the April 15 filing deadline. Collaborating with tax preparation firms and state officials, the I.R.S. promised to require a more rigorous authentication process before releasing information and refunds and to broaden efforts to pinpoint patterns of fraud.     ''For the first time, everyone in the software industry will share aggregated details about their filings to help us all identify fraud,'' John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, said at a news conference in Washington. He added that the ''changes are being built into the D.N.A. of the entire tax system.''   The new measures are the result of a security meeting in March involving private industry representatives and government officials.   Added security filters include crosschecking returns filed electronically with Internet addresses and computer devices, and scanning for mechanized fraud by checking the time it takes to complete a return, the agency said. Tax preparers will have to transmit this information on all returns filed with federal and state governments.   At the same time, the agency will provide monthly, anonymous data reports to the tax preparation industry summarizing the latest tactics used by criminals.   Brad Smith, chief executive of the software company Intuit, which makes TurboTax, the most popular tax program in the country, said in a statement that new uniform rules requiring all industry players to report suspicious activity ''will be instrumental in helping to protect and serve legitimate taxpayers and safeguard their privacy.''   Both the meeting and the agreement are signs that the agency is coming to grips with the growing threat of data breaches and fraud.   ''We have come to realize we are now dealing with a much more sophisticated enemy than in the past,'' Mr. Koskinen said. ''It's clear that criminals have been able to gather increasing amounts of personal data as the result of ongoing data breaches at various sources outside the tax system.''   Last month, the commissioner revealed that criminals had used taxpayers' personal information to gain access through the agency's website to tax returns while bilking the agency out of at least $39 million in fraudulent refunds.   Mr. Koskinen said that the group was considering creating a more formal center ''to more aggressively share information between our organizations.'' The commissioner, who has previously complained that years of congressional budget-cutting had hamstrung the agency's ability to combat fraud, also called on Congress to require employers and others to send out tax information like W-2s earlier to aid the agency in spotting fraud.   Stephen M. Ryan, of the American Coalition for Taxpayer Rights, a trade association representing some of the largest tax preparation firms, emphasized that the data shared would be anonymous and in large batches ''that do not include personally identifiable information.''   Several participants in the security meeting said the degree of collaboration between the private sector and tax officials went far beyond previous efforts. Mark Steber, chief tax officer of Jackson Hewitt, a tax preparation company, added that Thursday's announcement was only the beginning, saying that the organizations planned to form a tactical group to identify ''new threats and risks that we hadn't even thought about.''   Gary Davis, a security analyst at Intel Security who was not involved with the initiative, called the latest measures ''great first steps towards creating more awareness for taxpayers to understand how their personal information can easily be stolen online.''   He added: ''What people don't realize is that the information used to steal tax refunds is, for the most part, freely available online. Taxpayers should watch what they share on social media, secure their online accounts and check their credit reports annually to keep them tuned into any suspicious activity before it's too late. Last year, someone actually filed as my daughter and it was a massive headache to get her identified as herself as she went to file this year.''   Frank AbagnaleJr., a security expert whose life as a conman was detailed in the book and movie ''Catch Me if You Can,'' said that both the I.R.S. and other government agencies had been ''easy targets,'' because they had been so slow to adopt sophisticated security protections and that ''there's no reason the federal government shouldn't have that technology in place.''

"Rogue Traders, Brazen Hackers and a Wave of Arrests","It was a symbiotic relationship that brought together the underbelly of Wall Street and the dark reaches of the online world. From their suburban homes in the United States, dozens of rogue stock traders would send overseas hackers a shopping list of corporate news releases they wanted to get a sneak peek at before they were made public. The hackers, working from Ukraine, would then deliver how-to videos by email with instructions for gaining access to the pilfered earnings releases.    In all, 32 traders and hackers reaped more than $100 million in illegal proceeds in a sophisticated and brazen scheme that is the biggest to marry the wizardry of computer hacking to old-fashioned insider trading, according to court filings made public on Tuesday. One of the men, Vitaly Korchevsky, a hedge fund manager and former Morgan Stanley employee living in a Philadelphia suburb, made $17 million in illegal profits, the indictment said.    But the five-year scheme came undone Tuesday when federal prosecutors from Brooklyn and New Jersey, joined by regulators from the Securities and Exchange Commission and other law enforcement agencies, announced a series of arrests, the filing of indictments and a lawsuit against what the indictments described as a loose network of business confederates.    Early Tuesday, the authorities arrested Mr. Korchevsky, 50, at his home in Glen Mills, Pa., and four other men, in Georgia and in Brooklyn. Arrest warrants were issued for four other men. Three of them were related and had ties to Ukraine.   ''This is the intersection of hacking and securities fraud,'' Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney for the district of New Jersey, said at a news conference in Newark. ''The hackers were relentless and patient.''    In one indictment, federal prosecutors in New Jersey said five of the men broke into companies like Business Wire and PR Newswire over five years to steal more than 150,000 news releases being prepared by publicly traded corporations before the information was released to the public. Another company whose releases were stolen before they were made public was Marketwired.    Mr. Fishman did not fault the wire services and said they had cooperated with the investigation.   The stolen news releases gave the rogue traders -- four of whom were charged in a separate indictment unsealed on Tuesday by prosecutors in Brooklyn -- a big advantage over others in the stock market by allowing them to trade on news before it hit the wires, the authorities said. The men who used the stolen information to trade the stocks paid the hackers a flat fee or a percentage of the profits gained from the illegal trading, the S.E.C. said in a separate complaint.    The authorities said the traders seeking an illegal edge provided ''shopping lists'' to hackers for the kinds of news releases they wanted and the companies they wanted to trade on. The men obtained information from more than 30 companies, including Bank of America, Clorox, Caterpillar and Honeywell, the authorities said.   But the traders were also deliberate. The authorities said they traded ahead of the information contained in only about 800 of the hundreds of thousands of releases they got a sneak peek at -- indicating a methodical and well-timed approach to concealing their activities.   In multiple instances, the men communicated via email and online chat messages, boldly stating what they were doing, the authorities said. At one point in 2012, for example, one of the defendants wrote in Russian in an online chat message, ''I'm hacking prnewswire.com.'' In another instance, a defendant sent 96 stolen news releases to someone with a subject, in Russian, that read ''fresh stuff.'' The email said, ''If he says he does not know what this is about, tell him 'quarterly report,' '' according to the indictment.   The authorities monitored some of the defendants for years, the indictment said. In November 2012, it said, they seized the laptop of one of the hackers and found about 200 nonpublic news releases from PR Newswire.   The people charged in the New Jersey indictment with breaking into the newswire networks were Ivan Turchynov, 27; Oleksandr Ieremenko, 24; Arkadiy Dubovoy, 51; Igor Dubovoy, 28; and Pavel Dubovoy, 28.   Brooklyn prosecutors, in addition to Mr. Korchevsky, also charged Vladislav Khalupsky, 45; Leonid Momotok, 47; and Alexander Garkusha 47, all United States residents, who had personal brokerage accounts at some of the biggest investment banks in the United States, including JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Jefferies. Two of the four men were once registered with the S.E.C., including Mr. Korchevsky. Authorities said in court papers the independent traders and overseas hackers ''shared login and password information for brokerage accounts they controlled'' making it easier for them to trade and transfer payments.   Kelly Currie, the United States attorney for Brooklyn, called the network of hackers and traders an ''unholy alliance.''   The authorities said tens of millions of illegal trading profits had been recovered from bank accounts maintained by the traders and hackers. The authorities also seized some homes, a boat and even an apartment complex that was bought with some of the proceeds.   The charges against the men demonstrate the various ways in which computer hackers can profit richly from illegally obtained information.   ''When we think of hackers who try to profit from their crimes, we usually think about people who steal bank account information or sell sensitive personally identifying information,'' said Matthew L. Schwartz, a lawyer at Boies, Schiller & Flexner and a former prosecutor in Manhattan who worked on cases involving digital crime.   ''The reality, as exemplified by today's charges, is that hackers can obtain access to all sorts of valuable information and can and will profit off of it in every way imaginable,'' he added.   Last month, prosecutors in Manhattan filed charges against five people, some of whom are suspected of having played a role in a breach at JPMorgan Chase that resulted in the theft of customer data for 83 million accounts. The authorities said they suspect that group wanted to use the tens of millions of email addresses stolen in the hacking to further stock manipulation schemes involving spam emails to pump up the price of otherwise worthless penny stocks.   In fact, the scheme announced on Tuesday was similar to one in 2005, when the S.E.C. charged a group of traders in Estonia with hacking into Business Wire to obtain news releases to inform their trades. Hacking or stealing corporate news releases is a strategy traders looking for an illegal edge have used over the years.   But the group uncovered on Tuesday went further than the Estonian hackers, and its scheme was much broader than anything previously uncovered by the authorities. It may be the first of many cases in which hackers use purloined corporate data to commit securities fraud.   Last year the computer consulting firm FireEye said that it had uncovered a sophisticated group of hackers, called Fin4, that was aiming at the email networks of large pharmaceutical and financial companies to gain market-sensitive information about deals. The revelation was outlined in a report that FireEye, based in California, shared with the S.E.C. and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   A few months ago, the S.E.C. asked a handful of companies to provide information about data taken in breaches of their computer networks. The authorities took similar steps recently with several large public relations firms, said another person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Jen Weedon, a threat intelligence manager with FireEye who worked on the Fin4 report, said she saw some similarities and differences between the way the group she observed operated and the one busted up by federal authorities.   ''There's targeting overlap in that these actors seemed to deliberately pursue market-moving information, like FIN4, to benefit financially on the stock trade. Unlike FIN4 it seems this group had a narrower scope in choosing to get their data from a consolidated place,'' Ms. Weedon said by email.    But the end goal is the same, she added, noting the hackers were infiltrating networks to gain private information to gain an edge in the markets.    "
"Weakening Yet Still Aggressive, China Poses Test for U.S. Presidential Candidates","For two decades, American politicians have been escalating their rhetoric about how to confront a rising China, one that grabs territory in the South China Sea, vacuums up American jobs and mounts cyber attacks on the United States. But now both Republicans and Democrats face a different challenge: how to deal with a weakening China, whose behavior may be as aggressive as always, but whose faltering market poses an entirely different threat to American investors, companies and workers -- one that cannot be solved by sanctions, military buildups in the Pacific and threats of retaliation.    China-bashing is not as simple as it used to be.   Republican candidates -- led by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who on Friday described China as ''a rising threat to our economic interests'' and ''a growing danger to our national security'' -- see a chance to cast President Obama as weak and untroubled by the possibility that a new power could gradually displace American influence. They see his lack of response to the theft of data of about 22 million Americans from the federal Office of Personnel Management, which government officials have concluded to have originated in China, as the latest evidence of that.    But if crafting a workable approach to China has been difficult for Mr. Obama, who once erupted in the Situation Room because he had no leverage to change Chinese behavior, it is as tricky for the candidates who wish to succeed him. It is one thing to describe the rising-power problem, and another to find a convincing approach to addressing it.   Most have not tried. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin recently called for the cancellation of next month's state visit by President Xi Jinping. But in 2013, he did what most governors do: He traveled to China, promoted Wisconsin products there, hailed the importance of the Chinese market for American firms and had his photo taken with Chinese leaders. Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was there last September advertising his state as a business-friendly climate for Chinese investors.   Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's son, has been put in charge of new investments for the Trump hotel empire, including, according to the group's website, deals in mainland China. When his father suggested the other day that the state dinner for Mr. Xi should be replaced by a McDonald's hamburger, the Chinese must have been tempted to point out that they need no introduction to such American fare. There are more than 2,000 McDonald's in China, including some a very short walk from Mr. Xi's official residence.   In a speech in South Carolina on Friday, Mr. Rubio presented a familiar list of grievances with Mr. Xi's government: a ''campaign to push America out of Asia''; the development of ''weapons that threaten our bases and naval assets'' (the Chinese say the same about the United States.); and an effort ''to make the 21st century a Chinese Century'' (though American politicians have no compunctions about calling it an ''American Century'').   He talked at length about Chinese efforts to round up human rights activists, oppress Christians, detain dissidents and control the Internet. ''This is a disgrace,'' he concluded. ''And we must stand against it.''   But his problem was also familiar: As Hillary Rodham Clinton put it early in her time as secretary of state, in a confidential conversation later published by WikiLeaks, ''How do you talk toughly to your banker?''   Mr. Rubio struggled with answers. He said engagement, yet his solutions sounded a bit like Mr. Obama's. He called for ending sequestration on the Pentagon budget so more planes and ships could be devoted to Asia. Specifically he promised to build two Virginia-class submarines per year, deploy ''new long-range precision strike systems,'' deploy more missile defenses and protect satellites and other space-based systems from Chinese attack. He will find many of those in the current Pentagon long-range plan.   Mr. Rubio stepped carefully when it came to calling for ''aggressive retaliation, which would hurt us as much as them.'' Instead he said the United States should reinforce ''our insistence on free markets and free trade. This means immediately moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements that strengthen strategic ties with our partners in Asia.'' Mr. Obama would argue that is exactly what he is attempting.   Mr. Rubio seemed to sense the dilemma of figuring out whether a strong China or a weak one is the harder problem for the next decade.   ''We tend to exaggerate their capacities in both directions,'' said Kurt M. Campbell, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asia under Mrs. Clinton and who still advises her on Asia and foreign policy. ''There was the 10-foot-tall-ism, where we focused too much on their strengths,'' said Mr. Campbell, who now runs the Asia Group, a consultancy. ''Now we have to avoid spending too much time on their weaknesses.''   Rightly or wrongly, Mrs. Clinton is considered to be more confrontational with the Chinese than Mr. Obama, after a famous flare-up with her Chinese counterpart over the country's territorial claims.   As a result, the Republicans know that if Mrs. Clinton emerges as the Democratic nominee, it will be difficult to cast her as soft on China. A bigger problem may be in their own party. The American opening to China was a Republican president's project. It is considered one of the greatest accomplishments of Richard M. Nixon's checkered presidency, and today's mainline Republican foreign policy establishment takes a very nuanced view of balancing Chinese power.   Whoever emerges from the scrum of 17 Republican candidates will seek the wisdom -- and the endorsement -- of Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Nixon's national security adviser and secretary of state, and at 92 still the party's greatest foreign policy mind. The architect of the American relationship with Beijing, who four years ago published a book on America's dealings with China, is not one to call for cutting off relationships with Beijing.   Neither is former President George W. Bush. Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, he traveled to Beijing and got the Chinese to support his counterterrorism agenda -- which the Chinese immediately exploited as a justification for crackdowns on the ethnic Uighur population, which is largely Muslim. But Mr. Bush viewed the visits of Chinese leaders to his Texas ranch as critical to his effort to contain North Korea, and always described the relationship between China and the United States as ''complicated.''   It is a tricky moment for the Obama administration as well. Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, is in Beijing to meet Mr. Xi and sort through the agenda for his state visit to Washington next month. Ms. Rice's agenda is to figure out how to find common ground -- on the Iran nuclear agreement, climate change and renewed threats from North Korea -- while not appearing to back down on the territorial claims or the cyberattacks on the United States from China.   The dynamic will become more complicated when Mr. Xi arrives in the United States. Battered by an economic crisis he did not see coming, Mr. Xi ''is likely to want to show he is not vulnerable, and not weak,'' Mr. Campbell said.   ''He comes to Washington wanting respect, and I do not believe we will see particular lines of easing on maritime issues and cyberintrusions,'' he added. But with global economic stability at stake, Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi have a strong interest in demonstrating to the markets that they can work together and ignore the din of a campaign.

Police Focus on Fraud Involving Credit Cards,"The undercover investigators arranged to meet at a hotel near Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan around the lunchtime rush on Wednesday. They were looking for men they believed had used stolen credit card information to go on a shopping spree, spending about $18,000 on 16 transactions -- mostly on luxury designer shoes. A courier arrived with what the police say the men expected to be their latest purchase.     Instead, officers at the Grand Hyatt Hotel on East 42nd Street arrested two men, both British citizens who were in New York on student visas. During the episode, a plainclothes officer also slammed another man to the ground. It turned out he was not involved in the scheme. Rather, he was James Blake, a retired professional tennis player in the city for the United States Open.   The highly publicized instance of mistaken identity -- which led to public apologies from city leaders and put the police officer who detained him on desk duty -- has also highlighted, however accidentally, the New York Police Department's considerable efforts to thwart the growing issue of credit card fraud.   ''This action yesterday is part of a much larger problem,'' the police commissioner, William J. Bratton, told reporters during a news conference on Thursday.   In an age when consumers rely more on cards than on cash, and security breaches have made personal data vulnerable to nefarious hands, law enforcement officials and security experts described such fraud as widespread and growing.   This month, The Nilson Report, a trade publication covering the credit card and mobile payment industry, found that fraud with credit, debit and prepaid cards led to more than $16 billion in losses worldwide in 2014, and nearly half of that was in the United States.   The issue is more acute in the United States because of the delay in adapting technology more common in places like Europe, which make counterfeiting cards more difficult, said Al Pascual, director of fraud and security for Javelin Strategy and Research, which advises financial institutions. The transition toward cards with a smart chip inside them is expensive, he said, because the cards cost more to produce and require merchants to have compatible equipment.   These days, Mr. Pascual said, fraud is driven less by criminals digging through garbage cans looking for information or from stolen pocket books than from the vast caches of information available on the Internet.   These crimes are so prevalent, he said, because ''it's so easy.''   To combat these trends, Mr. Bratton said on Thursday that his department had dedicated some 250 people in a financial crimes unit to investigating such cases. It was a move, he said, that was ''reflective of the growing cybercrime problem, financial fraud, identity theft problem that we're experiencing in this city and indeed the country is experiencing.''   ''We spend a lot of time and effort on it because it constitutes so much of the felony crime being committed, not just in Manhattan,'' Mr. Bratton said, noting that he had met earlier in the day with the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to discuss cybercrime. He added that 30 percent of the felony crime reported in Manhattan ''involves financial fraud, theft, of this type.''   Even with the influx of manpower, the investigators have been ''swamped'' with cases, said a police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss these efforts publicly. ''They've got their hands full,'' he said.   Mr. Bratton said that such frauds increasingly involve criminal street gangs, which have been ''migrating from selling drugs to the lucrative and less dangerous world of larceny, particularly by fraud, credit cards.'' Those gangs brought the tactics they had relied on in hustling narcotics to their dealings with stolen credit card data.   ''It is driving shootings, no question,'' said Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives.   The conflicts arise from disputes over control of the illicit marketplace, police officials said. ''We have homicides over credit cards,'' Chief Boyce said. ''So, it is a problem.''   In the case in which Mr. Blake was mistakenly arrested, the police began investigating the two British citizens later charged in the case after a concierge service that makes purchases for clients and delivers to them reported transactions that raised their suspicions. The investigators then found the 16 charges made with American Express cards.   ''Just think of it, that in the space of a couple days, these characters come in from Britain and basically they are here supposedly on student activity,'' Mr. Bratton said. ''Well, they're basically engaging every day in this type of crime.''    "
Some Settle in a Trading Case Linked to Hacking,"Jaspen Capital Partners and its chief executive, Andriy Supranonok, have agreed to pay $30 million to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that they illegally profited from stolen corporate information that was stolen from newswire services.  They were part of a group of 34 traders and hackers charged last month with reaping more than $100 million in illegal proceeds by using nonpublic corporate news releases in a sophisticated and brazen scheme that blended the dark world of online hacking and old-fashioned insider trading.    Mr. Supranonok and Jaspen Capital, based in Ukraine, made around $25 million in illegal profits by buying and selling instruments called contracts-for-difference, or C.F.D.s, used to trade certain stocks. The C.F.D.s were executed based on not-yet-public releases that were stolen from two newswire services from 2010 to 2014, according to the S.E.C. complaint. Earlier this year, Jaspen Capital and Mr. Supranonok made additional profits by trading on information stolen from a third newswire, the S.E.C. said. The releases were obtained by hackers who had infiltrated the systems of all three newswire companies.   ''Today's settlement demonstrates that even those beyond our borders who trade on stolen nonpublic information and use complex instruments in an attempt to avoid detection will ultimately be caught,'' Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division, said in a statement.   Barry Bohrer, Mr. Supranonok's lawyer, could not be reached for comment.   Dozens of rogue traders in the United States used similar stolen information, which they obtained by sending overseas hackers shopping lists of corporate news releases they wanted to get a sneak peek at before the releases were made public, according to separate but parallel investigations by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and New Jersey. Hackers working mainly from Ukraine would send email instructions for how to get access to the stolen information.   Vitaly Korchevsky, another trader who was named in the S.E.C complaint, was among several men arrested in August. Mr. Korchevsky, a former hedge fund manager turned Baptist pastor living in a Philadelphia suburb, was accused of making $17 million in illegal profits. A federal judge in Brooklyn granted him bail on Aug. 26.   Another man, Igor Dubovoy, was granted bail on Monday by a judge in New Jersey but remains in detention until he can post $3 million bail and meet several other conditions.   In its original complaint in August, the S.E.C. charged 32 defendants. On Monday, the S.E.C. said it had amended the complaint to charge two additional defendants. Federal prosecutors from Brooklyn and New Jersey have also filed indictments against some of the men.    "
"Hackers Also Stole Fingerprints of 5.6 Million Workers, Personnel Agency Says","WASHINGTON --  Just a day before the arrival of President Xi Jinping here for a meeting with President Obama that will be focused heavily on limiting cyberespionage, the Office of Personnel Management said Wednesday that the hackers who stole security dossiers from the agency also got the fingerprints of 5.6 million federal employees. The attack on the agency, which is the main custodian of the government's most important personnel records, has been attributed to China by American intelligence agencies, but it is unclear exactly what group or organization engineered it. Before Wednesday, the agency had said that it lost only 1.1 million sets of fingerprints among the records of roughly 22 million individuals that were compromised.     ''Federal experts believe that, as of now, the ability to misuse fingerprint data is limited,'' the agency said in a written statement. But clearly the uses are growing as biometrics are used more frequently to assure identity, in secure government facilities and even on personal iPhones.   The working assumption of investigators is that China is building a huge database of information about American officials or contractors who may end up entering China or doing business with it. Fingerprints could become a significant part of that effort: While a Social Security number or a password can be changed, fingerprints cannot.    Customs and immigration officials frequently fingerprint incoming travelers; millions of fingerprints in a Chinese database would help track the true identities of Americans entering the country.    ''I am assuming there will be people we simply can't send to China,'' a senior intelligence official said this summer, before the most recent revelation. ''That's only part of the damage.''   The agency said that an ''interagency working group,'' with help from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, ''will review the potential ways adversaries could misuse fingerprint data now and in the future.''   One of the biggest concerns about the breach of personnel records has been that China, or any other states given access to the data, could use it to identify intelligence agents, defense personnel or government contractors. Other data on the forms that were obtained, about matters as varied as bankruptcies and personal and sexual relationships, could be used for blackmail.   Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been unsparing in their criticism of the personnel agency's handling of the data breach and its aftermath -- and its habit of periodically revising upward the amount of information that was lost. Government officials have not been able to explain publicly why it took more than a year to discover that information was leaving its systems at a tremendous rate.    Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement on Wednesday that ''the massive new number of employees' fingerprints that was breached is shocking.'' He continued, ''And it does little to instill confidence in O.P.M. that it took them so long to detect that the number was so much larger than originally thought.''   He called for ''lifetime identity protection coverage'' for the affected employees and contractors. But that assumes there was a financial motive to the theft; officials say it seems more likely that it was a national security motive.    In testimony to a House committee recently, the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, said it had seen no evidence that the data lifted from the O.P.M. over more than a year had been used for any financial purpose, like gaining access to bank accounts or credit cards.    During Mr. Xi's visit to Washington, he and Mr. Obama are expected to announce, at a minimum, that they are working on a set of rules for cyberspace that would amount to a first effort at a digital arms control agreement. But that would not cover traditional espionage, which both sides conduct against each other. So the theft of personnel files, which the administration has never publicly blamed on China, would not be covered.   In fact, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said over the summer that if the United States had the opportunity to steal that much data about an adversary, it would probably try to do it. And testifying to Congress alongside Admiral Rogers recently, he pushed back at members of Congress who called the breach at O.P.M. an ''attack.'' Instead, he suggested, it was ordinary espionage.    But despite those public statements, several officials have said in background briefings that the scale of the breach was so vast that it might require some kind of government response. Hackers did not just get the data on federal employees, but also on job applicants, contractors and many others who have been subjected to government background checks.    ''It was so big,'' one senior intelligence official said, ''that we have to ask the question of whether the scope of it changed the nature of the theft.''   Although Mr. Obama has hinted at sanctions against China, largely for intellectual property theft, the administration has decided to put off the decision until after Mr. Xi's visit.   Ahead of the meeting with Mr. Xi, administration officials have been coy about what form, and how extensive, any effort to come up with common rules for cyberspace may take. ''I don't want to suggest that we reached an arms control agreement here,'' Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said on Tuesday in a briefing to reporters about Mr. Xi's visit.   ''But I do want to suggest that ultimately the goal here is we start from a common understanding that you have agreed-upon principles which we believe must include that cybertheft does not go forward. And then as the two largest economies in the world, I think we can lead an effort to develop international norms that govern cyberactivity.''   But he emphasized that America's main concern was the theft of intellectual property that is used by an adversary for commercial purposes. The breach does not fit into that category, and Mr. Obama has not said exactly how he would respond to it.

Finding Common Ground With China,"Despite growing strains between their countries, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China made progress on two key issues during their meeting on Friday, offering some reassurance that they may be able to manage the challenges ahead.  Of greatest significance is Mr. Xi's commitment to start a national program in 2017 that will limit and put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Such a cap-and-trade system will require big changes by the government, but if carried out, it would mark a major step by the world's largest polluter to reduce industrial emissions. It would also deprive Republicans in Congress of an excuse to avoid taking steps to address climate change. Over the years they have opposed efforts to limit greenhouse gases in the United States on the grounds that China, the world's second-largest economy, has done little to limit its emissions.    Coupled with emissions reductions pledges announced jointly last year, China's commitment offers hope that the two countries will present a unified front at the climate change summit in Paris this December.   Mr. Obama also announced that he had reached a ''common understanding'' with Mr. Xi to combat ''cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.'' They endorsed a United Nations accord, adopted in July, that commits the signatories to not target one another's critical infrastructure -- power plants, cellphone networks and financial transactions -- in peacetime. They also pledged to have a more formal dialogue on fighting cybercrime, something Beijing has long resisted.   But Mr. Obama was appropriately skeptical about the Chinese commitments, saying there was a question about whether words would follow action and warning, ''We will be watching carefully.'' The Americans contend that China is responsible for the cybertheft of security data on roughly 22 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management. Mr. Obama should be prepared to to consider retaliatory action if there are further attacks.   It was disappointing that there was no progress toward resolving the tension on the South China Sea, where China has been converting reefs into islands big enough to handle military runways and ports -- a direct challenge to other Asian countries that also have territorial claims there. Mr. Xi said he wanted to resolve the disputes peacefully, but his dangerous tactics and attempts to bully neighboring countries has heightened concerns about a possible hostile confrontation in that region.   Projecting strength remains central to Mr. Xi and his government. But for now, domestic discontents like the recent market crash and slowing economic growth are problems enough, without their provoking new troubles abroad.

"After the Break-In, the Bill","On Sept. 1 last year, the website Rescator, known as the ''Amazon.com of the black market,'' alerted its customers that huge quantities of stolen debit and credit card data would go on sale the next day. ''Load your accounts and prepare for an avalanche of cash!'' the website urged.    The next day, two batches of cardholder data were reportedly sold, according to legal documents. The website claimed the cards were 100 percent valid and working. Demand was so high that the website temporarily crashed. Over the next few days, several more batches of card data were sold.   On Sept. 8, Home Depot issued a news release admitting its data systems had been breached.    By then, the damage had been done. Approximately 56 million sets of card data had been stolen, some of which were sold on the black market and remained valid for several days. At a small credit union in California, fraudulent charges of more than $100,000 were posted in just three minutes after the card information was sold on the black market. A bank reported $300,000 in suspicious charges in two hours to the security blog Krebs on Security, which connected Home Depot with the stolen cards before the retailer did.   ''With the Home Depot data breach, we weren't even told for days that it existed. That it had happened,'' said Diana Dykstra, the chief executive of the California and Nevada Credit Union Leagues. ''We didn't know that the cards had been sold on the black market. It hit credit unions and small banks really hard.''   A year later, the full tally of the Home Depot data breach remains unknown. Some estimate the fraudulent charges total well into the billions of dollars.   Over the last couple of years, retailing has been a rich hunting ground for online criminals. They hacked into numerous companies, including Neiman Marcus, Sally Beauty and the crafts store Michaels. But the orchestrated theft at Target in late 2013, followed a few months later by the Home Depot data breach, eclipsed all of the others. So far, there have been no arrests in the Target and Home Depot breaches.   As the size and scope of such attacks at retailers has grown, so have the losses, which have been largely shouldered by financial institutions. Now some small banks and others want Home Depot and those companies that suffer data breaches to pay.   One front of the battle is a federal lawsuit winding through the courts, filed by a number of small community banks and credit unions that contend Home Depot long ignored internal and external warnings from security experts that its systems were vulnerable to attack. A similar lawsuit against Target claims that its security protocols were ''so deficient that the breach continued for nearly three weeks while Target failed to even notice it.'' That lawsuit was given class-action status this month by a federal judge in Minnesota.   But even as the lawsuits move forward, retailers are scrambling to meet a deadline to install machines to read E.M.V. microchips -- the small metallic rectangles increasingly found on the front of credit and debit cards, named after Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the original backers of the standard. After Thursday, retailers that have not upgraded their systems to read the new chip-enabled cards will be liable for any charges from counterfeit cards.   ''Essentially, whoever has the lower level of security will be the one who will be responsible for the unauthorized transaction,'' said Doug Johnson, a senior vice president of payments and security policy at the American Bankers Association.   For now, that's likely to remain the banks. By some estimates, only 19 percent of credit and debit cards in circulation will be chip-enabled by the deadline. ''It cuts both ways,'' Mr. Johnson acknowledged. ''If we don't deploy the chip cards, we maintain the liability that we have currently.''   Retailers and banks are spending billions of dollars to upgrade to the new chip cards. While they hope the cards will slam the door on criminals obtaining financial data that can be used to create and sell counterfeit cards, they warn that other windows for fraud will remain wide open.   ''The expectation is that organized criminals are going to move from the physical world to the online world,'' said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, which tracks card industry data.   Credit card fraud losses totaled $8 billion last year, but many consumers may see it as a victimless crime. Certainly there is a high hassle factor around reporting suspicious transactions to the bank or waiting for a reissued card to be mailed, but consumers are generally not held responsible for the fraudulent charges that occur. (Furthermore, experts say while consumers were nervous after the Target and Home Depot data breaches, there is no evidence that they shifted their spending patterns to use cash rather than plastic.)   Instead, a majority of the fraud losses are absorbed by financial institutions, which have become increasingly concerned as the sweep of data breaches at retailers widens.   Historically, when a credit or debit card number was stolen and used to buy goods elsewhere, the banks or financial institutions digested the losses. Then, in cases where the retailer was found to be in breach of security standards, Visa and MasterCard would seek reimbursement for costs associated with the fraud and disburse that money back to the affected financial institutions through a preset formula.   In 2007, for instance, TJX Companies, the owner of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, settled with Visa and others for $40.9 million to cover costs associated with a large data breach.   But small community banks and credit unions say the disbursement of any money collected from retailers rarely, if ever, makes it to their doors. Most goes to large banks.   ''We've not received any payments at all for any fraudulent activity,'' said Marques Doppler, the chief executive of Profinium, a 140-year-old family-owned bank with four branches in Southern Minnesota and around $350 million in assets. Mr. Doppler declined to say how much Profinium, which is one of the plaintiffs in the Home Depot litigation, lost to fraudulent charges.   For small community banks like Profinium or nonprofit credit unions, a little fraud can hurt in a big way.   ''A $100,000 fraud loss to a large financial institution is nothing. But a lot of credit unions have annual net income that is less than $1 million. If you take a couple of big fraud hits, that's substantial for them,'' said Bill Hampel, chief policy officer and chief economist with the Credit Union National Association.   Moreover, it can cost small banks or credit unions much more to reissue cards involved in a data breach. The average cost to reissue cards affected by the Target breach, according to a survey of banks conducted by the A.B.A. last summer, ranged from $2.70 per card for large banks to $12.75 for banks with less than $1 billion in assets.   So a number of community banks and credit unions filed lawsuits against Target and Home Depot, seeking bigger payouts.   In the case of Home Depot, the lawsuit alleges that the retailer had ignored multiple warnings about its vulnerabilities since 2008. The suit says Home Depot failed to turn on a feature of the 2007 version of Symantec antivirus software specifically designed to spot malware that attacks point-of-sale terminals. Symantec's contractors grew so concerned about Home Depot's approach to security that three of them refused to continue to work for the company and Symantec threatened to cease doing business with Home Depot, according to the lawsuit.   When an employee in 2010 discovered a major security flaw that allowed unauthorized access to Home Depot's network through devices used by its in-store sales force, the employee was ignored for months. Then he was fired, the lawsuit alleges.   Starting around April 2014, hackers gained access to Home Depot's computer systems using the credentials of a third-party vendor. Targeting the self-checkout registers, the hackers installed malware that siphoned off the information from a payment card when it was swiped on a checkout terminal. The malware remained on Home Depot's terminals for five months, until around Sept. 7, 2014.   Home Depot has broadly denied the allegations. ''There's a lot of misinformation out there about this, much of it based on speculation, rumors and opinion by individuals who don't have the facts, and we'll address them in the proper forum,'' said Stephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot.   But the data breach has been costly for the retailer. In regulatory filings, Home Depot said expenses tied to the breach so far total $232 million, partly offset by $100 million in insurance proceeds.   Lawyers say a good insurance policy will cover expenses related to investigating the data breach, public relations, call-center services and credit monitoring services as well as costs arising from lawsuits.   The challenge for retailers is buying enough of it.   ''If you're a retailer, it's hard to buy more than $125 million in coverage in today's market,'' said Roberta D. Anderson, a co-founder of the Cyber Law and Cybersecurity practice group at the K&L Gates law firm. ''Obviously, the potential liability is so much more.''   Even as the lawsuit against Home Depot moves forward, the retailer and others are spending billions of dollars -- $100 million at Target alone -- to upgrade their registers to accept chip-enabled cards. Home Depot says all of its stores will be ready to read chip cards by the Thursday deadline. The retailing giant Walmart says its stores were chip-ready almost a year ago.    Everyone is hoping that the new chip cards will be much tougher for counterfeiters to copy. Among the new security features is a cryptogram, a security code that changes every time the card is used.   But retailers, who have a longstanding feud with Visa and MasterCard over fees, are not happy to be bearing the brunt of the costs to install the new chip readers at their stores (some estimate retailers will spend upward of $30 billion over the next few years) to solve what they see as the bank's problem. Moreover, they say they do not know why the financial industry in the United States is largely issuing chip-and-signature cards rather than the safer chip-and-PIN cards that have been widely adopted in Europe.   ''Signature is worthless as a form of authentication'' at the point of sale, Mike Cook, an assistant treasurer and senior vice president at Walmart, told attendees during an electronic transactions conference in San Francisco this spring. In the cases of the Target and Home Depot breaches, he said, ''not a single PIN debit card needed to be reissued in those breaches. The card number was worthless to the individual thief and fraudsters, because they didn't know the PIN.''   The card payment industry argues the new cards will offer better protection against counterfeiting, which they say accounts for the bulk of the fraudulent transactions.   ''They also don't want you to have to remember PINs,'' said Mr. Robertson of The Nilson Report. ''The reality of the U.S. market, which is distinct from everywhere else in the world, is that we have an average of 4.5 credit cards per person. That's a lot of PINs to remember.''    "
Are You Sure You Want the Job?,"Having watched all the debates and seen all these people running for president, I can't suppress the thought: Why would anyone want this job now? Do you people realize what's going on out there? Obama's hair hasn't gone early gray for nothing. I mean, Air Force One is great and all, but it now comes with Afghanistan, ISIS and the Republican Freedom Caucus -- not to mention a lot of people, places and things all coming unstuck at once. Consider the scariest news article this year. On Friday, The Washington Post reported that ''the Justice Department has charged a hacker in Malaysia with stealing the personal data of U.S. service members and passing it to the Islamic State terrorist group, which urged supporters online to attack them.'' The article explained that, in June, Ardit Ferizi, the leader of a group of ethnic Albanian hackers from Kosovo who call themselves Kosova Hackers Security, ''hacked into a server used by a U.S. online retail company'' and ''obtained data on about 100,000 people.''     Ferizi, it said, ''is accused of passing the data to Islamic State member Junaid Hussain, a British citizen who in August posted links on Twitter to the names, e-mail addresses, passwords, locations and phone numbers of 1,351 U.S. military and other government personnel. He included a warning that Islamic State 'soldiers ... will strike at your necks in your own lands!' '' F.B.I. agents tracked Ferizi ''to a computer with an Internet address in Malaysia,'' where he was arrested. Meanwhile, Hussain was killed by a U.S. drone in Syria.   Wow: An Albanian hacker in Malaysia collaborating with an ISIS jihadist on Twitter to intimidate U.S soldiers online -- before we killed the jihadist with a drone!   Welcome to the future of warfare: superpowers versus superempowered angry men -- and a tag-team of cybercriminals and cyberterrorists. They're all a byproduct of a profound technology-driven inflection point that will greet the next president and will make the current debates look laughably obsolete in four years.   I was born into the Cold War era. It was a dangerous time with two nuclear-armed superpowers each holding a gun to the other's head, and the doctrine of ''mutually assured destruction'' kept both in check. But we now know that the dictators that both America and Russia propped up in the Middle East and Africa suppressed volcanic sectarian conflicts.   The first decades of the post-Cold War era were also a time of relative stability. Dictators in Eastern Europe and Latin America gave way to democratically elected governments and free markets. Boris Yeltsin of Russia never challenged NATO expansion, and the Internet and global supply chains drove profitability up and the cost of labor and goods down. Interest rates were low, and although the income of men without college degrees declined, it was masked by rising home prices, subprime mortgages, easy credit, falling taxes and women joining the work force, so many household incomes continued to rise.   ''Up until the year 2000, over 95 percent of the next generation were better off than the previous generation,'' said Richard Dobbs, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute. Therefore, even though the rich were getting even richer than those down the income ladder ''it did not lead to political unrest because the middle was moving ahead, too'' and were sure to be richer than their parents.   But, in the last decade, we entered the post-post-Cold War era. The combination of technological, economic and climate pressures is literally blowing the lid off nation-states in the Middle East and Africa, unleashing sectarian conflicts that no dictator can suppress. Bad guys are getting superempowered and ''mutually assured destruction'' to ISIS is not a deterrent but an invitation to heaven. Robots are milking cows and IBM's Watson computer can beat you at ''Jeopardy!'' and your doctor at radiology, so every decent job requires more technical and social skills -- and continuous learning. In the West, a smaller number of young people, with billions in college tuition debts, will have to pay the Medicare and Social Security for the baby boomers now retiring, who will be living longer.   ''Suddenly,'' argues Dobbs, ''the number of people who don't believe they will be better off than their parents goes from zero to 25 percent or more.''   When you are advancing, you buy the system; you don't care who's a billionaire, because your life is improving. But when you stop advancing, added Dobbs, you can ''lose faith in the system -- whether that be globalization, free trade, offshoring, immigration, traditional Republicans or traditional Democrats. Because in one way or another they can be perceived as not working for you.''   And that is why Donald Trump is resonating in America, Marine Le Pen in France, the ISIS caliph in the Arab world, and Vladimir Putin in Russia. They all promise to bring back the certainties and prosperity of the Cold War or post-Cold War eras -- by sacking the traditional elites who got us here and by building walls against change and against the superempowered angry men. They are all false prophets, but the storm they promise to hold back is very real.    "
Microsoft Sheds Reputation as an Easy Mark for Hackers,"REDMOND, Wash. --  Microsoft was once the epitome of everything wrong with security in technology. Its products were so infested with vulnerabilities that the company's co-founder, Bill Gates, once ordered all of Microsoft engineers to stop writing new code for a month and focus on fixing the bugs in software they had already built. But in recent years, Microsoft has cleaned up its act, even impressing security specialists like Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer for F-Secure, a Finnish security company, who used to cringe at Microsoft's practices.    ''They've changed themselves from worst in class to the best in class,'' Mr. Hypponen said. ''The change is complete. They started taking security very seriously.''    Still, episodes of online hacking have become even more startling, including the theft of personal data from millions of Target customers and terabytes of private emails from Sony Pictures Entertainment (and both companies use some Microsoft products). While Microsoft has not been blamed for the attacks, critics have insisted that the tech giant do even more to make digital systems resistant to breaches and snooping.   Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella, says he is listening. On Tuesday, he delivered a speech to government technology workers in Washington about the importance of security in the technology business and how Microsoft has evolved to confront security threats.    Mr. Nadella, in a phone interview, said his aim was to lay out how Microsoft products make it harder for hackers to compromise PCs, and how the company has eliminated the corporate divisions that separated security managers from each other to improve how threat information is shared.   ''It's kind of like going to the gym every day,'' said Mr. Nadella, who himself runs about three miles a day. ''You can't say I'm serious about security without exercising the regimen of keeping security top of mind every second, every hour of the day.''   Talking about security was long taboo in the technology industry. But in recent years, it has become a marketing tool. Silicon Valley companies like Google and Facebook have started to advertise the work they do to secure their infrastructure and customers' personal data, particularly in the aftermath of disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified information.   Mr. Nadella's speech coincides with one of his top business priorities: cloud computing. Microsoft and others in the industry are aggressively promoting cloud services, which means persuading companies to store their corporate data outside their own walls. Analysts have warned that companies that do not take security seriously risk losing corporate customers, particularly foreign customers, to cloud-based services overseas.   Microsoft estimates that it now spends more than $1 billion a year on security-related initiatives, including acquisitions. It acquired three security start-ups in the last year alone, and the number of security employees at the company increased 20 percent during that time.   Soon after he became Microsoft's chief executive in February 2014, Mr. Nadella instituted a monthly meeting with security leaders from across the company. They meet to discuss industry trends and analyze threats.   He also altered how Microsoft watched the Internet for hacker attacks, an effort that had been splintered among different product groups and other divisions within the company. Microsoft now pays hackers more when they find and turn over a security hole.   This week, Microsoft's security managers are moving into the same physical space after being scattered around the company's campus here in this Seattle suburb. On a recent tour of the new facility that Microsoft calls its Cybersecurity Defense Operations Center, workers were busy outfitting walls with large television sets that will display data about malware and other threats.   ''To me, that speaks profoundly to the importance of connecting people'' across the company, said Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. ''They might still sit in different organizations, but they sit together, and they work together. We're connecting the information systems so that people see the complete picture and not just information silos.''   Plenty of bugs are still being discovered in Microsoft's code. But fears about the security of Microsoft's programs have gradually abated. In a couple of recent widespread attacks, hackers exploited weaknesses in Adobe and the Java programming platform, not Microsoft software.   Once an attempt on one customer is detected -- say, a phishing scheme, in which hackers try to steal passwords, credit card numbers and other private data through legitimate-looking emails -- Microsoft says it can quickly deploy a solution that prevents all other customers on its corporate email services from falling prey to the ruse. Microsoft carried out one such fix to its cloud customers early last year after the Syrian Electronic Army, a group of hackers who support President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, began a phishing attack on Microsoft's own employees.   Still, Microsoft has been criticized for not acting fast enough. Last year, a dust-up ensued after Microsoft took more than 90 days to fix several serious bugs in its Windows software that were discovered by researchers at Google. Google went ahead and publicized the bugs before Microsoft had issued a patch, in keeping with Google's 90-day policy, angering Microsoft executives.   Microsoft is also increasingly trying to limit government access to customer information. Microsoft is challenging an attempt by United States authorities to obtain the emails of a customer whose data was stored on a server in Dublin. The company argues that a victory by the government would make it much harder for American technology companies to object when authorities from China or other countries demand data relevant to legal proceedings in their own nations.   To allay privacy concerns among European customers, Microsoft recently announced that two new data centers in Germany would be managed by T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, putting customer information there out of reach of American law enforcement agencies.   Still, Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist of the American Civil Liberties Union, cautioned that Microsoft was not seeking to make customer data off limits to government, only to limit it to the local authorities.   ''Microsoft sees itself as a good corporate citizen,'' he said. ''They don't want to deliver products that thwart government.''   There is no doubt, though, that Microsoft has made thwarting hackers a priority. Microsoft's latest version of its operating system, Windows 10, has a feature called Windows Hello that allows people to log in to a PC with a scan of their finger, iris or face instead of using a password -- weak versions of which are a common cause of data breaches.   ''My goal inside the company is to get rid of passwords,'' said Bret Arsenault, Microsoft's chief information security officer.    "
Man Arrested in VTech Breach of Children's Data,"Police in England said they arrested a 21-year-old man on Tuesday in connection with last month's breach of VTech, a Hong Kong electronic toy maker, which exposed personal data for 12 million people, including 6.4 million minors.   Hackers also made off with profile photos and chat logs of millions of parents and their children. British police said they arrested the man, who has not been identified, in Bracknell, a town 32 miles outside of London, for breaking England's Computer Misuse Act, including ""unauthorized access"" to a computer and data, according to a statement released by Britain's South East Regional Organized Crime Unit. Last month, VTech said its online database store was compromised by hackers. Among the stolen data were names, email addresses, passwords, profile information, mailing addresses and download histories belonging to parents, as well as names, genders and birth dates of children. The breach was notable for the fact that children's personal information was compromised. Security experts say children are a frequent target for identity thieves because their clean credit histories can be used to apply for government benefits, open bank and credit card accounts and apply for loans. But the hacker believed to be behind the breach told Vice's Motherboard blog that he did not intend to sell or use the data, but instead to draw publicity to VTech's weak security practices. The hacker told Motherboard that he was able to breach two databases, containing personal data for millions of parents and children, using a simple hacking technique called a SQL injection, in which hackers enter commands that prompt a database to dump its contents. ""Profiting from dumps is not something I do. Especially not if children are involved!"" the hacker told Motherboard in a private chat. ""I just want issues made aware of and fixed,"" he said. The claims could not be independently verified. Nearly half of the compromised VTech accounts belong to customers in North America, which has prompted officials in Connecticut and Illinois  to investigate. "
Cyberthreat Posed by China and Iran Confounds White House,"WASHINGTON --  A question from a member of the Pentagon's new cyberwarfare unit the other day prompted President Obama to voice his frustration about America's seeming inability to deter a growing wave of computer attacks, and to vow to confront the increasingly aggressive adversaries who are perpetrating them. ''Offense is moving a lot faster than defense,'' Mr. Obama told troops on Friday at Fort Meade, Md., home of the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command. ''The Russians are good. The Chinese are good. The Iranians are good.'' The problem, he said, was that despite improvements in tracking down the sources of attacks, ''we can't necessarily trace it directly to that state,'' making it hard to strike back.    Then he issued a warning: ''There comes a point at which we consider this a core national security threat.'' If China and other nations cannot figure out the boundaries of what is acceptable, ''we can choose to make this an area of competition, which I guarantee you we'll win if we have to.''    If Mr. Obama sounded uncharacteristically combative on the topic, it is because finding a way to deter computer attacks is one of the most urgent and confounding problems he faces in his last 16 months in office. The problem is all the more pressing because it is where the high-tension diplomacy surrounding the state visit of President Xi Jinping of China next week merges with the challenge of containing Iran in the aftermath of the recently completed nuclear agreement with Tehran.   Mustering the leverage to deter attacks is exactly what Mr. Obama is struggling to accomplish in the days leading up to Mr. Xi's visit. For six weeks, American officials have warned that they are preparing sanctions against Chinese hackers, telling Chinese officials in private meetings that the combination of intellectual property theft and espionage on an unprecedented scale -- the theft of the 22 million security dossiers from the Office of Personnel Management, for example -- cannot go unanswered.   But an argument has broken out within the administration over whether to invoke those sanctions now and risk a blowup with Beijing before Mr. Xi's arrival, or use the threat of them to try to extract something from the Chinese.   The White House revealed late Saturday that a high-level Communist Party envoy sent by Mr. Xi, Meng Jianzhu, spent four days in Washington last week meeting with intelligence and law enforcement officials in an effort to create some ''rules of the road'' for Internet actions between the United States and China before they derail an already fraught relationship.   Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, described the talks with the Chinese as ''pretty blunt,'' and one of the officials who met with Mr. Meng, China's domestic security chief, was less diplomatic, calling the talks ''pretty ugly.''   The day Mr. Meng returned home, China's official state news media quoted him as saying that the Chinese government would crack down on criminal hackers, though the statement was vague about what would happen to those acting on behalf of the Chinese government.   In classified sessions, American intelligence agencies have told members of Congress that while computer attacks on the United States emanating from Iran decreased during the negotiations over the nuclear accord, they believe that an Iran stymied in developing a nuclear ability over the next 10 to 15 years is likely to pour more resources into cyberweapons. Such weapons have already been used against the Navy, American banks, a Las Vegas casino and Saudi Arabia's largest oil producer, without setting off significant retaliation.   The day before Mr. Obama spoke at Fort Meade, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said at a congressional hearing that the United States lacked ''both the substance and the mind-set of deterrence.'' But he went on to say that he was far less worried about a ''large Armageddon strike'' that would take out America's power systems than about the kind of smaller but persistent attacks that damaged Sony Pictures Entertainment.   With both Iran and China, Mr. Obama is struggling with variants of the same problem: How do you contain a rising power that has discovered the benefits of an anonymous, havoc-creating weapon that can also yield vast troves of secret data? And how do you convince them that actions for which ''they have paid no price,'' as the director of the N.S.A. and the Cyber Command, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, put it the other day, will no longer be cost-free?   ''We have a deterrence deficit,'' said David Rothkopf, the author of ''National Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear.''   ''The U.S. is very good at dealing with the gravest global challenges, like global thermonuclear war, and also very good at empty gestures and rhetoric,'' he said. ''The problem we have is with our middle game, and yet most of the challenges we face are, of course, in the middle.''   With Iran and China, cyberwarfare is only part of those middle-game challenges. Containing Iran's growing influence in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and throughout the region is central to the administration's post-accord challenge. And containing China's effort to reclaim islands in the South China Sea, a bet by Beijing that neither Washington nor Asian nations will stop it from developing a new base of operations and exclusive claims to air and sea territory, is the subtext of much of the tension with Mr. Xi's government.   But the escalating cyberconflict poses a particularly complex problem, because there is no equivalent of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty for computer networks. That is exactly what makes the use of cybertechniques and weapons so attractive to the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans -- and, to some extent, the United States.   So far, the administration's response has seemed inconsistent, and to many incoherent.   When North Korea was identified as the country that attacked Sony, Mr. Obama -- in possession of evidence gleaned from the N.S.A.'s yearslong penetration of North Korean networks -- went to the White House press room, declared that the leadership in Pyongyang was responsible, and said the United States would retaliate at the time and in the manner of its choosing.   The public retaliation was a series of modest financial sanctions that did little additional damage to the most sanctioned country on earth. If there was a lasting response to the attack, only North Korea knows about it.   And when Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army in China was exposed as the force behind the theft of intellectual property from American companies, the Justice Department announced the indictment of five of the army's officers. Justice officials hailed that as a breakthrough. Inside the intelligence community and the White House, however, it was regarded as purely symbolic, and the strike on the Office of Personnel Management continued after the indictments were announced.   ''The Chinese have discovered they can launch cyberattacks against us and that our officials seek to downplay them or offer up limp, ineffective responses, like indicting people behind them who will never ever see the inside of a U.S. court,'' Mr. Rothkopf said. ''This has added to the perception that we are weak, which in turn is an incentive to more opportunistic bad actors.''   Mr. Obama was determined to do more, his aides said. He issued an order in the spring, based on lessons learned in the Sony attack, enabling him to issue sanctions against individuals or organizations deemed responsible for computer attacks -- similar to his powers to deal with nuclear proliferators or terrorists. But they have never been used.   The administration made it clear that Chinese hackers would be in the first wave. And when Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, went to Beijing recently to prepare for the visit of Mr. Xi, computer warfare was a major source of contention. ''That's when they woke up and sent Meng,'' said one senior official who would discuss private diplomatic conversations only on the condition of anonymity.   No one is expecting a simple solution. In testimony last week, Mr. Clapper went out of his way to correct members of Congress who called the personnel office episode an ''attack,'' noting that it was espionage, something the United States does often to the Chinese. And the intelligence agencies do not want any agreements that would limit their own ability to use cyberweapons for covert purposes, as the United States did against Iran in an operation aimed at disabling parts of its nuclear program.   And now Iran is part of the worry. Admiral Rogers told a House panel that while cyberattacks directed at the United States abated during talks over the nuclear deal, the country was now ''fully committed'' to using them as part of a revamped military strategy. The Iranians, another senior intelligence official said, discussing private intelligence assessments on the condition of anonymity, ''will be looking intensely at how we handle the Chinese.''    "
Iran Hones Cyberattacks on U.S. After Nuclear Deal,"WASHINGTON --  Four months after a historic accord with Tehran to limit its atomic ambitions, American officials and private security groups say they see a surge in sophisticated computer espionage by Iran, culminating in a series of cyberattacks against State Department officials over the past month. The surge has led American officials to a stark conclusion: For Iran, cyberespionage -- with the power it gives the Iranians to jab at the United States and its neighbors without provoking a military response -- is becoming a tool to seek the kind of influence that some hard-liners in Iran may have hoped its nuclear program would eventually provide.     While American officials doubt cyber skills, or even the most advanced cyber weapons, will ever have that kind of power, Iran's cyber focus these days is notable.    Over the past month, Iranian hackers identified individual State Department officials who focus on Iran and the Middle East, and broke into their email and social media accounts, according to diplomatic and law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. The State Department became aware of the compromises only after Facebook told the victims that state-sponsored hackers had compromised their accounts.    ''It was very carefully designed and showed the degree to which they understood which of our staff was working on Iran issues now that the nuclear deal is done,'' said one senior American official who oversees much of that operation and who requested anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. ''It was subtle.''   Iran's cyberskills are not yet equal to those of Russia or China. But the attack against the State Department by using the social media accounts of young government employees to gain access to their friends across the administration -- a focus that had not been seen before -- showed an ingenuity beyond the Russian brute-force attack that infiltrated the State Department's unclassified email system a year ago.   In the aftermath of the nuclear accord, American intelligence officials have warned senior officials that they expect Iran to ramp up its use of cyberespionage.   The director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., has told Congress in closed sessions that he believes state-sponsored Iranian hackers are not attempting big attacks that could threaten their ability to reap the financial rewards of complying with the nuclear accord, according to two officials familiar with those briefings. But he said they were stepping up traditional cyberespionage, and getting better at it.   ''The Iranians have not been as destructive as they could be, but they are getting far more aggressive in cyberespionage, which they know is less likely to prompt a response from the United States,'' said James Lewis, who runs the cyberprogram at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''They seem very attuned to every stage of implementing the nuclear agreement.''   Congress is responding. In the defense bill lawmakers passed this month, United States Cyber Command, which runs the military's offensive and defensive Internet activities, is instructed to conduct computer war games next year. The games are intended to replicate the threats from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.   Iranian cyberattacks are hardly new. They arose after the American cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, an  operation that destroyed upward of a thousand Iranian centrifuges and drove home to the Iranian leadership the destructive power of computer weapons. The American attacks began toward the end of the George W. Bush administration.   Since then, American government officials and private security researchers say Iranian hackers have been behind a series of powerful attacks against American banks that took their websites offline, as well as a destructive attack at Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, that replaced data on employee machines with an image of a burning American flag.   American government officials also blame Iran for a similarly destructive attack at RasGas, the Qatari natural gas giant, and for an attack at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas, where a large number of computers were destroyed.   (The casino, while a seemingly odd target, is controlled by Sheldon Adelson, a major funder of Republican candidates, and the attack followed his suggestion that the United States detonate a nuclear weapon in the Iranian desert to force the country to give up its nuclear technology.)   But last year, private security researchers say, Iranians began using cyberattacks for espionage, rather than for destruction and disruption.   Beginning in May 2014, researchers found evidence that Iranian hackers were targeting Iranian dissidents, and later policy makers, senior military personnel and defense contractors in the United States, England and Israel, according to a report by iSight Partners, a computer intelligence firm in Dallas.   For the most part, researchers said, the attacks were basic ''spear phishing'' attempts, in which attackers tried to lure their victims into clicking on a malicious link, in this case by impersonating members of the news media. Iranian hackers were successful in more than a quarter of their attempts.   The number of such attacks reached a climax in May -- just ahead of the nuclear talks in Vienna in July -- reaching more than 1,500 attempts, according to researchers at Check Point, the Israeli cybersecurity company.   Some researchers witnessed an even more troubling trend: In the months leading up to the talks, Iran's hackers began probing critical infrastructure networks in what appeared to be reconnaissance for cyberattacks meant to cause physical damage, said John Hultquist, the director of cyberespionage analysis at iSight Partners.   And then something curious happened: In June and July, as American and Iranian negotiators gathered in Vienna to cut a deal on Iran's nuclear program, attacks against targets in the United States stopped. Not a single phishing attempt was logged by Check Point. And the critical infrastructure probes went silent as well, according to iSight Partners, and have not resumed.   Instead, iSight's researchers saw Iran's hackers switch focus. They began targeting victims in Israel as well as members of the Islamic State in July as the militant group began expanding its territory across Iraq.   And then, in August, just two weeks after the nuclear accord was reached, the trickle of cyberattacks against the group's usual targets resumed. Check Point's researchers were able to hack the attackers' target list, which included 1,600 individuals, from scholars, scientists, chief executives and ministry officials to education institutes, journalists and human rights activists across the globe.   The victims may have never learned of the compromises were it not for a decision by Facebook last month to use a new alert system to notify users when Facebook's security team believed state-sponsored hackers had hijacked their accounts. Just weeks into the new alert system, State Department officials began to see a troubling new message pop up on their Facebook accounts:   ''We believe your Facebook account and your other online accounts may be the target of attacks by state-sponsored actors,'' the message read.   Some details of the espionage on State Department employees were first  reported by The Wall Street Journal.   State Department officials say none of this will affect the coming turning points in the nuclear deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported last week that Iran is already beginning to dismantle some of its centrifuges -- at the same site the United States and Israel attacked with cyberweapons.

Hacked Files Listed Chinese With U.S. Ties,"WASHINGTON --  Investigators say that the Chinese hackers who attacked the databases of the Office of Personnel Management may have obtained the names of Chinese relatives, friends and frequent associates of American diplomats and other government officials, information that Beijing could use for blackmail or retaliation. Federal employees who handle national security information are required to list some or all of their foreign contacts, depending on the agency, to receive high-level clearances. Investigators say that the hackers obtained many of the lists, and they are trying to determine how many of those thousands of names were compromised.    In classified briefings to members of Congress in recent days, intelligence officials have described what appears to be a systematic Chinese effort to build databases that explain the inner workings of the United States government. The information includes friends and relatives, around the world, of diplomats, of White House officials and of officials from government agencies, like nuclear experts and trade negotiators.    ''They are pumping this through their databases just as the N.S.A. pumps telephone data through their databases,'' said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''It gives the Chinese the ability to exploit who is listed as a foreign contact. And if you are a Chinese person who didn't report your contacts or relationships with an American, you may have a problem.''   Officials have conceded in the briefings that most of the compromised data was not encrypted, though they have argued that the attacks were so sophisticated and well hidden that encryption might have done little good.   The first attack, which began at the end of 2013 and was disclosed in the middle of last year, was aimed at the databases used by investigators who conduct security reviews. The investigators worked for a contracting firm on behalf of the Office of Personnel Management, and the firm was fired in August.   The broader attack on the personnel office's main databases followed in December. That attack, announced last week, involved the records of more than four million current and former federal employees, most of whom have no security clearances.   White House and personnel office officials have provided few details about the latest breach. But the Department of Homeland Security has been telling outside experts and members of Congress that it regards the detection of the attack as a success, because it made use of new ''signatures'' of foreign hackers, based on characteristics of computer code, to find the attack.   In a statement, the personnel office said Wednesday that ''it was because of these new enhancements to our IT systems that O.P.M. was able to identify these intrusions.'' But the detection happened in April, five months after the attack began.   The list of relatives and ''close or continuous contacts'' is a standard part of the forms and interviews required of American officials every five years for top-secret and other high-level clearances, and government officials consider the lists to be especially delicate.   In 2010, when The New York Times was preparing to publish articles based on 250,000 secret State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks, the newspaper complied with a request by the department to redact the names of any Chinese citizens who were described in the cables as providing information to American Embassy officials. Officials cited fear of retaliation by the Chinese authorities.   Officials say they do not know how much of the compromised data was exposed to the Chinese hackers. While State Department employees, especially new ones, are required to list all their foreign friends, diplomats have so many foreign contacts that they are not expected to list them all.   But other government officials are frequently asked to do so, especially in interviews with investigators. The notes from those interviews, conducted by a spinoff of the personnel office called the United States Investigative Service, were obtained by hackers in the earlier episode last year.   Intelligence agencies use a different system, so the contacts of operatives like those in the C.I.A. were not in the databases.   But the standard form that anyone with a national security job fills out includes information about spouses, divorces and even distant foreign relatives, as well as the names of current or past foreign girlfriends and boyfriends, bankruptcies, debts and other financial information. And it appears that the hackers reached, and presumably downloaded, images of those forms.   ''I can't say whether this was more damaging than WikiLeaks; it's different in nature,'' said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, which was briefed by intelligence officials, the Department of Homeland Security and the personnel office on Tuesday. Mr. Schiff, who declined to speak about the specifics of the briefing, added, ''But it is certainly one of the most damaging losses I can think of.''   Investigators were surprised to find that the personnel office, which had already been so heavily criticized for lax security that its inspector general wanted parts of the system shut down, did not encrypt any of the most sensitive data.   The damage was not limited to information about China, though that presumably would have been of most interest to the hackers. They are likely to be particularly interested in the contacts of Energy Department officials who work on nuclear weapons or nuclear intelligence, Commerce Department or trade officials working on delicate issues like the negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and, of course, White House officials.   In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine on both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee, called for the United States to retaliate for these kinds of losses. ''Nation-states need to know that if they attack us this way, something bad is going to happen to their cyberinfrastructure,'' he said.   But Mr. King said he could not say if the attacks on the personnel office were state-sponsored, adding, ''I have to be careful; I can't confirm the identity of the entity behind the attack.'' The Obama administration has not formally named China, but there has been no effort to hide the attribution in the classified hearings.   The scope of the breach is remarkable, experts say, because the personnel office apparently learned little from earlier government data breaches like the WikiLeaks case and the surveillance revelations by Edward J. Snowden, both of which involved unencrypted data.   President Obama has said he regards the threat of cyberintrusions as a persistent challenge in a world in which both state and nonstate actors ''are sending everything they've got at trying to breach these systems.''   The problem ''is going to accelerate, and that means that we have to be as nimble, as aggressive and as well resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems,'' he said at a news conference this week.   The White House has stopped short of blaming Katherine Archuleta, the director of the personnel office, for the breach, emphasizing that securing government computer systems is a challenging task.

When Phone Encryption Blocks Justice,"Cyrus R. Vance Jr. is the Manhattan district attorney. François Molins is the Paris chief prosecutor. Adrian Leppard is the commissioner of the City of London Police. Javier Zaragoza is the chief prosecutor of the High Court of Spain. In June, a father of six was shot dead on a Monday afternoon in Evanston, Ill., a suburb 10 miles north of Chicago. The Evanston police believe that the victim, Ray C. Owens, had also been robbed. There were no witnesses to his killing, and no surveillance footage either. With a killer on the loose and few leads at their disposal, investigators in Cook County, which includes Evanston, were encouraged when they found two smartphones alongside the body of the deceased: an iPhone 6 running on Apple's iOS 8 operating system, and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge running on Google's Android operating system. Both devices were passcode protected.     An Illinois state judge issued a warrant ordering Apple and Google to unlock the phones and share with authorities any data therein that could potentially solve the murder. Apple and Google replied, in essence, that they could not -- because they did not know the user's passcode.   The homicide remains unsolved. The killer remains at large.   Until very recently, this situation would not have occurred.   Last September, Apple and Google, whose operating systems are used in 96 percent of smartphones worldwide, announced that they had re-engineered their software with ''full-disk'' encryption, and could no longer unlock their own products as a result.   According to Apple's website: ''On devices running iOS 8.0 ... Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user's passcode, which Apple does not possess.''   A Google spokeswoman said, ''Keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement.''   Now, on behalf of crime victims the world over, we are asking whether this encryption is truly worth the cost.   Between October and June, 74 iPhones running the iOS 8 operating system could not be accessed by investigators for the Manhattan district attorney's office -- despite judicial warrants to search the devices. The investigations that were disrupted include the attempted murder of three individuals, the repeated sexual abuse of a child, a continuing sex trafficking ring and numerous assaults and robberies.   Criminal defendants have caught on. Recently, a suspect in a Manhattan felony, speaking on a recorded jailhouse call, noted that ''Apple and Google came out with these softwares'' that the police cannot easily unlock.   Apple, Google and other proponents of full-disk encryption have offered several rationales for this new encryption technology. They have portrayed the new policy as a response to the concerns raised by Edward J. Snowden about data collection by the National Security Agency. They say full-disk encryption makes devices generally more secure from cybercrime. And they assert that, if the companies had master encryption keys, then repressive governments could exploit the keys.   These reasons should not be accepted at face value. The new Apple encryption would not have prevented the N.S.A.'s mass collection of phone-call data or the interception of telecommunications, as revealed by Mr. Snowden. There is no evidence that it would address institutional data breaches or the use of malware. And we are not talking about violating civil liberties -- we are talking about the ability to unlock phones pursuant to lawful, transparent judicial orders.   In the United States, Britain, France, Spain and other democratic societies, the legal system gives local law enforcement agencies access to places where criminals hide evidence, including their homes, car trunks, storage facilities, computers and digital networks.   Carved into the bedrock of each of these laws is a balance between the privacy rights of individuals and the public safety rights of their communities. For our investigators to conduct searches in any of our jurisdictions, a local judge or commissioner must decide whether good cause exists. None of our agencies engage in bulk data collection or other secretive practices. We engage in targeted requests for information, authorized after an impartial, judicial determination of good cause, in which both proportionality and necessity are tested.   It is this workable balance that proscribes the operations of local law enforcement in our cities, and guides our residents in developing their expectations of privacy. But in the absence of laws that keep pace with technology, we have enabled two Silicon Valley technology companies to upset that balance fundamentally.   The Evanston case is just one example. In France, smartphone data was vital to the swift investigation of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January, and the deadly attack on a gas facility at Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, near Lyon, in June. And on a daily basis, our agencies rely on evidence lawfully retrieved from smartphones to fight sex crimes, child abuse, cybercrime, robberies or homicides.   Full-disk encryption significantly limits our capacity to investigate these crimes and severely undermines our efficiency in the fight against terrorism. Why should we permit criminal activity to thrive in a medium unavailable to law enforcement? To investigate these cases without smartphone data is to proceed with one hand tied behind our backs.   The new encryption policies of Apple and Google have made it harder to protect people from crime. We support the privacy rights of individuals. But in the absence of cooperation from Apple and Google, regulators and lawmakers in our nations must now find an appropriate balance between the marginal benefits of full-disk encryption and the need for local law enforcement to solve and prosecute crimes. The safety of our communities depends on it.    "
Encrypted Messaging Apps Face New Scrutiny Over Possible Role in Attacks,"WASHINGTON --  American and French officials say there is still no definitive evidence to back up their presumption that the terrorists who massacred 129 people in Paris used new, difficult-to-crack encryption technologies to organize the plot. But in interviews, Obama administration officials say the Islamic State has used a range of encryption technologies over the past year and a half, many of which defy cracking by the National Security Agency. Other encryption technologies, the officials hint, are less secure than terrorist and criminal groups may believe, and clearly they want to keep those adversaries guessing which ones the N.S.A. has pierced.    Some of the most powerful technologies are free, easily available encryption apps with names like Signal, Wickr and Telegram, which encode mobile messages from cellphones. Islamic State militants used Telegram two weeks ago to claim responsibility for the crash of the Russian jet in the Sinai Peninsula that killed 224 people, and used it again last week, in Arabic, English and French, to broadcast responsibility for the Paris carnage. It is not yet clear whether they also used Telegram's secret-messaging service to encrypt their private conversations.    Nonetheless, such ''end-to-end'' encryption technology is now so widespread that the attack has revived vitriolic arguments between American intelligence officials and Silicon Valley. Only weeks ago, the matter appeared settled, at least temporarily, with a decision by President Obama that it would be fruitless for the government to try to compel the technology companies to provide the keys to protected conversations and data.    Apple has already made encryption technology a standard part of its iMessage service, and Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has been among the most vocal in defending a technology for which the keys to decode messages are held not by his company but by the users at each end of the conversation.   Any other approach, Mr. Cook has argued to Mr. Obama, would undercut Apple customers' confidence that the most precious data they keep in their phones is safe from garden-variety cybercriminals as well as sophisticated nation states that could gain access to keys via hacking, or lawfully through court order. Mr. Cook argues that investigators have ways to obtain crucial clues from the available ''metadata'' about who is talking to whom by phone, from information in the Internet cloud -- or, security experts have said, by hacking a target's device.   But the speed of the encryption wave has touched off alarm among law enforcement and intelligence officials, who say it significantly increases the chances that they will miss evidence of an impending attack. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain threatened late last year to ban such technologies, although he soon backed down. France is threatening to insist on access -- and if the French do, so will China, many fear, raising questions about whether the same technology used to crack terrorists' communications will be used to crack dissidents' as well.   ''I think this is going to open an entire new debate about security versus privacy,'' said Michael Morell, a former deputy director of the C.I.A., whose book this year, ''The Great War of Our Time,'' traced the efforts, and failures, in tracking terror plots.    ''We have, in a sense, had a public debate'' on encryption, he said over the weekend on CBS News's ''Face the Nation.'' ''That debate was defined by Edward Snowden,'' the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed much about the agency's efforts to break encryption. Now, he said, a new argument will be ''defined by what happened in Paris.''   It is also possible the Paris attackers conducted much of their planning face to face, particularly since several lived in the same Brussels neighborhood. But if there was a command center in Syria or elsewhere, some form of communications would have been required.   Just before the Paris attacks, Belgian officials said Islamic State terrorists had been hiding their communication using online gaming tools like Sony's PlayStation 4 to mask their chatter under that of millions of online video war game players who invoke the same language of violent, religious extremists.   Jan Jambon, Belgium's federal home affairs minister, told a public audience last week that ''PlayStation 4 is even more difficult to keep track of than WhatsApp,'' a popular messaging system owned by Facebook.   But if that was the case, it would undermine the argument that end-to-end encryption allowed the Paris terrorism plot to go undetected. While PlayStation and Xbox deploy encryption to protect customers' personal data like credit card information, it leaves their communications open to government interception in ways that WhatsApp and iMessage do not.   So far, Mr. Obama has been reluctant to insist on a back door into the systems. He rejected the argument of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, that the United States should require any company that provides encrypted software and hardware to engineer a way for the government, armed with a court order, to get access. That decision came after a year of study led by the White House counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, and the head of the White House cybersecurity office, Michael Daniel.   The White House ultimately adopted a view put forth by 14 of the world's top cryptographers and computer security experts who wrote, in a white paper, that weakening the encryption of American technology sold by companies like Apple, Google and Facebook would only render confidential data and critical infrastructure more vulnerable to criminals and national adversaries, and push terrorists to adopt encrypted services sold overseas. As a result, when companies like Apple and Facebook are issued court orders to help governments monitor their customers' messages, all they can do is turn over a stream of unintelligible code.   That has inflamed law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey and William J. Bratton, the New York City police commissioner, who told ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday that encrypting communications in this way had made it impossible for officials to collect warnings on terrorist attacks.   ''We, in many respects, have gone blind as a result of the commercialization and the selling of these devices that cannot be accessed either by the manufacturer or, more importantly, by us in law enforcement, even equipped with search warrants and judicial authority,'' Mr. Bratton said.   Security experts counter that such arguments ignore the fact that even end-to-end encrypted technology leaves a trail of metadata behind that can be used to parse who is talking to whom, when and where. ''Encryption is really good at making it difficult to hide the content of communications, but not good at hiding the presence of communications,'' said Matt Blaze, a computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania.   Mr. Blaze also noted that the authorities can still read communications if they hack into the target's device, or what security experts call ''the end point.''   ''All the encryption in the world doesn't help if the end point that holds the keys are compromised,'' Mr. Blaze said. ''So this idea that encryption make terrorists' communications go completely dark has a pretty big asterisk next to it.''   Even if Apple and others in the United States were compelled to weaken the encryption in their services, American authorities still would have had no judicial authority over Telegram, the Berlin-based messaging service, recently used by Islamic State terrorists to broadcast their communiqués.

F.B.I. Chief Says Gunman Used Encryption to Text Terrorist,"WASHINGTON --  The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said Wednesday that investigators could not read more than 100 text messages exchanged by one of the attackers in a shooting this year in Garland, Tex., because they were encrypted, adding fuel to law enforcement agencies' contention that they need a way to circumvent commercially available encryption technology. Mr. Comey, who two months ago appeared to have lost a battle inside the Obama administration over forcing companies like Apple and Google to give investigators a way to decode messages, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that one of the attackers ''exchanged 109 messages with an overseas terrorist'' the morning of the shooting.     ''We have no idea what he said because those messages were encrypted,'' Mr. Comey said. ''And to this day, I can't tell you what he said with that terrorist 109 times the morning of that attack. That is a big problem. We have to grapple with it.''   The testimony was the first time Mr. Comey, a longtime critic of the technologies that he contends are creating a ''going dark'' problem for law enforcement agencies, had cited a specific example of a terrorist using encrypted communications. He said he would not comment on whether similar technology was involved in the time before the Paris attacks or the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Calif.   In the Texas shootings, two men armed with rifles and wearing armor opened fire near an exhibit that was showing cartoon images of the Prophet Muhammad. Depictions of the prophet are considered offensive in most interpretations of Islam. The attackers were killed by the police, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility.   There is no indication that the F.B.I. saw that such messages were exchanged before the shootings began or recognized that one of the suspects was talking to a foreign terrorist group member -- something that might have been detected even if the authorities could not read the messages themselves.   The White House concluded recently that there was merit to the arguments of companies like Apple that it is extremely difficult to create a ''back door'' for police or intelligence agencies to read such conversations without also creating a breach that Russian, Chinese or other determined hackers could exploit.   But Mr. Comey argued in his testimony on Wednesday that the technology companies' defense of ''end-to-end encryption,'' in which only specific users of a phone or computer hold the keys, was rooted in business decisions.   ''It's a business model question,'' he said. ''Good people have made a decision to design products and sell products where court orders are ineffective. And I'm not impugning their motives. I understand they see it as a competitive issue or they think it's just the right thing to do.''   But he asked if that model could be changed, and ''if that can't be done voluntarily, what are the other alternatives?''   For Mr. Comey, whose 10-year term extends well beyond President Obama's, the recent attacks have provided renewed arguments to pressure technology companies.   Cyrus R. Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, and William J. Bratton, New York City's police commissioner, have faulted the encryption used by Apple, Facebook and Google for thwarting terrorism investigations.   But to many business executives and some technology experts, their accusations seemed premature, because there was little evidence that encryption had been used in the planning of any attacks.   ''It was fairly clear, months ago, that law enforcement was laying the public relations groundwork to blame encryption for whatever happened to go wrong,'' said Paul Kocher, a cryptographer and president of the Rambus Cryptography Research division, who has called for stronger encryption. ''But in a couple cases, they blamed encryption and got it wrong.''   In the case of the attacks in Paris last month, there is still no evidence that the attackers used encrypted messages to plot their attacks. In fact, a cellphone belonging to one of the attackers suggested that they had communicated using unencrypted text messages. There is also no evidence that the married couple who waged the attack in a San Bernardino office building last week communicated digitally about the attacks.   Yet it is clear that terrorists are looking for the strongest encryption they can find. In a technology tutorial produced by the Islamic State militant group that was circulated last January, the group offered its members a guide to encrypted messaging apps, pointing out which it believed were ''safest,'' ''safe,'' ''moderately safe'' and ''unsafe,'' according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorists' communications.   In the wake of the Paris attacks, Mr. Vance's office published a report asking why Apple could not roll back its latest encryption system, which puts the keys to unlock encrypted iPhone communications on the device itself so that Apple cannot unlock the communications for law enforcement even if presented with a court order.    In the past, Apple could unlock communications under such circumstances, but the current scheme forces law enforcement agents to go directly to their target to read their communications.   But even if Apple rolled back its technology -- which Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, has emphatically insisted will never happen -- it is unclear whether it would make it easier for American law enforcement to track terrorists.   Of the encrypted mobile apps recommended in the Islamic State tutorial, the top five ''safest'' encryption schemes recommended by the group were made by companies outside the United States -- in places like Switzerland, where a United States court order would not be enforceable.   ''We have far more to lose by having our information attacked than gained from weakening everyone's information security,'' Mr. Kocher said. He added that rolling back encryption in those products would only drive terrorists to use other products, or create their own.   ''You can't delete encryption software off the Internet or delete all the textbooks telling people how to write it,'' Mr. Kocher said.

Unshackled Hacker Dons a White Hat,"Michael Mann's thriller ''Blackhat,'' a story about the intersection of bodies and machines, is a spectacular work of unhinged moviemaking. By turns brutal and sentimental, lovely and lurid, as serious as the grave and blissfully preposterous, it combines a truckload of plot with many of the obsessions, tropes, sights and sounds that distinguish his other movies, from kinetic gun battles to cool beauties gazing into the distance in sunglasses. Here those beauties are a pair of improbable computer savants, played by Chris Hemsworth and Tang Wei, who race, jet and furiously bang on keyboards across the globe while chasing villainy, lines of code and millions in loot. The jampacked story, pegged to a shadow hacker stirring up global trouble, could have been gleaned from the latest news. The inspiration for the script, by Morgan Davis Foehl, was an attack on the Natanz uranium enrichment plant in Iran by malware deployed through USB flash drives. The movie opens with an explosion at a nuclear power plant in Hong Kong, where Chinese officials call in Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom), who in turn taps his sister, Lien (Ms. Tang), for help and then an old school friend, Nick Hathaway (Mr. Hemsworth).  Another, more benign hacker turned prisoner, Hathaway is first seen reading Jean Baudrillard's ''The System of Objects,'' a neo-Marxist critique of the commodification of everyday life. Also adorning Hathaway's shelves is ''Discipline and Punish,'' Michel Foucault's inquiry into modern penal systems and disciplinary technologies of power, including surveillance. The nods to these heavyweights happen in an eye blink, and they felt gratuitous and self-conscious the first time I saw ''Blackhat.'' (Jean-François Lyotard's ''The Postmodern Condition'' is also on the shelf, as is Jacques Derrida.) The movie's suppositions -- namely that the world is now a surveillance penitentiary -- emerge clearly enough that you don't need these intellectual signposts, even if name-dropping philosophers has long been par for the cinematic course for the likes of, say, Jean-Luc Godard. Yet such allusions are of a piece with Mr. Mann's singular hybrid approach, which exists at the crossroads of the classical Hollywood cinema and the European art film and is evident in his oscillation between action and introspection, transformation and stasis, exterior and interior realms. A maximalist, Mr. Mann crams a great deal into the movie's fleet two-hour running time, including the nuclear mishap, a commodities run-up, some cyber-slapstick with the National Security Agency and the specter of 9/11. Once Hathaway has been cut loose from federal lockup with an ankle monitor, he joins a stellar backup team tasked with catching the power-plant hacker that includes Viola Davis on lead. Her character, Carol Barrett, is an agent for the F.B.I. whose reddish wig, plumy lashes and cavalcade of weary sighs and devastating deadpan stares are among the movie's best special effects. Barrett serves as Hathaway's handler and coordinates the American team with the Chinese, while Ms. Davis's fine-grained performance deepens the movie's emotional texture. Mr. Hemsworth is a brooding Adonis best known for playing Thor in the big-screen cartoons who should be better known for playing a racecar driver in the undersung ''Rush.'' He has a pallor and hard-body physique that don't jibe with the usual mental snapshot of the puny, pasty criminal hacker, even if his bulk makes sense as a jailhouse defense. He isn't a persuasive typist (he was tutored on his keyboard fingerwork), but what he does have is a natural pensiveness bordering on melancholy that creates a nice frisson with his bulging muscles and heartthrob looks. You can see him diving into thought, which works for a role that requires his character to serve as our conduit for a lot of jargon. His strong physicality also works with the movie's sense of hacking and other tech work as labor. Like the safecracker played by James Caan in ''Thief,'' Mr. Mann's 1981 thriller, Hathaway is defined -- as a man and professional, but also as a friend, lover and target -- through his job. The characters in ''Blackhat'' spend a great deal of time staring at screens and making like Rachmaninoff with their keyboards, a familiar image for the increasing numbers of people who are plugged in for work, play or both, even as they're increasingly disconnected from the physical world. This disconnect and its dangers are something of a refrain in the movie and are invoked in Hathaway's prison-house philosophy (when not perusing Baudrillard, he connects mind and body by, um, doing ironman push-ups) and in the conceit of faceless terrorists who, hidden in a virtual world, wreak damage on human beings. All this face time with blinking screens is in the service of the story's turns, many of which involve following the digital trail left by the hacker who infiltrated the nuclear plant. That initially makes ''Blackhat'' a cat-and-mouse game, one that shifts into high-action gear with the introduction of the hacker's army of thugs, whose apparatus of choice is a machine gun and whose leader is a dead-eyed enforcer, Elias (an excellent Ritchie Coster). The chase takes Hathaway and company through computer networks, a pursuit that Mr. Mann at times represents by plunging deep into the physical networks, running straight into the guts of the machine, much as he did in ''Thief'' when he pushed his camera in for a peek inside a lock cylinder as it's being picked. That's pretty cool, as are the various Far Eastern locations that add palpable density to the movie's thin-looking, at times near-translucent visuals. The contrast between the richness of the action and the thinness of the (still beautiful) images is just one of many dualities that runs through the movie, as when Mr. Mann cuts from a fanlike image spreading across a screen to a huge flame shooting out from under a Hong Kong cook's wok. Time and again, he puts computer and other spaces into play visually, mapping a brave new world with images of kaleidoscopically pulsing screens and the jewel-like glittering of nighttime megacities. The practical locations, with real bodies moving through real spaces, underline the idea that something big is still at stake in the physical world. A few times, though, notably during a chaotic fight in a crowded Jakarta square that turns multitudes into a streaming network, the locations feel like an directorial extravagance and a mistake. Those bodies are finally too decorative and disposable, and the ease with which they fall undercuts the movie's moral seriousness. Mr. Mann fares better in more intimately scaled scenes, whether inside a restaurant with Hathaway and Lien or out on the street with some joltingly personal shootouts. Whether his characters are making love or war, Mr. Mann often captures them in tight close-ups that thrust their faces into the foreground of the shot. It's a visual choice that briefly isolates these men and women from a world that, like everyone else, they're desperate to comprehend. ''Blackhat'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme gun and blade violence.

I Have Been Silenced,"By means of a nasty cyberattack, my three Sudan-related websites became unusable to all who visited my Facebook page on February 21, 2014. I believe the Khartoum (Sudan) regime is responsible. Many Facebook visitors subsequently going to my Sudan sites immediately found innumerable and highly aggressive ""pop-up"" ads. Nothing could be accessed, by me or by my 1,200+ Facebook ""friends,"" mainly Sudanese from both Sudan and South Sudan. They had received as a ""message"" from me pornographic videography (purportedly including me) containing potent malware; the message was sent to both my daughters as well as other family members. Other visitors experienced various difficulties and anomalies in accessing their own Facebook page; other consequences may as yet be undiscovered (my computer has been behaving very peculiarly since then, and is now with technicians). I experienced another cyberattack several years ago; computer technicians traced the attack to Iran - Khartoum's self-proclaimed ""strategic ally - and found it extremely sophisticated and dangerous - and not just to my website but all websites hosted on their platform. Understandably, I was asked to take my website elsewhere, which I did at very considerable cost in monthly security expenses.  I now have three Sudan-related websites, all of which receive substantial traffic: sudanreeeves.org, my primary site carrying analyses of events in Sudan and South Sudan; SudanBombing.org, a site that carries an extensive recording of aerial attacks by Khartoum on civilians and humanitarians, going back to 1999 (there have been thousands of such bombing attacks in Darfur, South Sudan, and most recently South Kordofan and Blue Nile); and CompromisingWithEvil.org, the site archiving my recent very lengthy e-book, Compromising With Evil: An archival history of greater Sudan, 2007 - 2012. I have frequently been the target of slanderous comments by Khartoum's officials, both in their domestic press, in comments to international journalists, and through their embassy in Washington, D.C.  This I accept as the price for being a harsh critic of genocide, massive political repression, and the regime's support for international terrorism and radical Islam - the latter detailed in the two sets of leaked minutes I have recently published (from July 1, 2014 and from August 31, 2014).  With the publication of these leaked transcripts, however, I have apparently crossed the line. Given my analyses of the thinking and policies of the most senior military and officials in the regime - including President Omar al-Bashir - Khartoum was ready to exact revenge from afar. I cited al-Bashir extensively in an analysis of the July 1, 2014 minutes I had posted the day before the cyberattack via my Facebook page.  The meeting begins with remarks by Minister of Defense Abdel Rahim Mohamed Hussein - words that will shock only those unfamiliar with this regime:  We won't stop the war on Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Our National Dialogue initiative is just a maneuver to provide us with political cover for a continuation of the war against the rebellion. We have instructed the Air Force to bomb any place, whether it is a school, hospital, or a nongovernmental humanitarian organization operating in rebel-controlled areas without permission from the government. Such presence is offensive and should be destroyed. (Khartoum, July 1, 2014) Let's be clear about what an attack on my means of communicating my condemnation of such policies represents: an American citizen, writing in the United States under full protection of the Constitution, has been hacked by a genocidal regime and at least partially silenced. This is the same regime with which an Obama administration State Department official met just last week in Khartoum; this follows by only a few days the administration's partial lifting of longstanding economic sanctions against the regime. And yet Khartoum has brazenly attempted to impose censorship of the sort wielded in Sudan, even as its demands of the Obama administration are being negotiated. This will not stop me, once technical rehabilitation is achieved. But it is is intimidating, at least to some who receive regular email updates about my web postings: early this morning I received my first request to be removed from the email list-serve, and it will not be the last. Censorship and intimidation exercised from abroad, by a brutal, genocidal regime should be of deep concern to all Americans. I would hope the appropriate government officials take this event seriously. I may be among the most vulnerable, but I will not be the last such victim.

Chip Maker to Investigate Claims of Hacking by N.S.A. and British Spy Agencies,"LONDON -- Gemalto, a French-Dutch digital security company, said on Friday that it was investigating a possible hacking by United States and British intelligence agencies that may have given them access to worldwide mobile phone communications.  The investigation follows news reports on Thursday that the National Security Agency in the United States and the Government Communications Headquarters in Britain had hacked Gemalto's networks to steal SIM card encryption codes.    The claims -- reported on a website called The Intercept -- were based on documents from 2010 provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor.   The American and British intelligence agencies are said to have stolen the encryption key codes to so-called smart chips manufactured by Gemalto, which are used in cellphones, passports and bank cards around the world.   Gemalto is the world's biggest maker of SIM cards, the small chips in cellphones that hold an individual's personal security and identity information.   By gaining access to the chips, the British and American agencies are said to have been able to look up large amounts of mobile voice and data communications without the permission of governments or telecommunications providers like Verizon Wireless and AT&T.   ''We cannot at this early stage verify the findings of the publication and had no prior knowledge that these agencies were conducting this operation,'' Gemalto said in a statement on Friday.   It added, ''We take this publication very seriously and will devote all resources necessary to fully investigate.''   Shares in the company fell 7.5 percent on Friday in early afternoon trading in Amsterdam. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the length of the investigation into the possible hacking.   A GCHQ spokesman declined to comment on intelligence matters, while a representative from the N.S.A. was not immediately available to comment.   The latest claims follow a series of accusations based on documents provided by Mr. Snowden that American and British intelligence agencies routinely gained access to online communications.   Those affected included several high-profile figures, like Angela Merkel, the German chancellor; American intelligence agencies were suspected of monitoring her cellphone conversations.   ''The news that U.S. and U.K. spy agencies hacked the network of a Dutch company to steal encryption keys for billions of SIM cards is truly shocking,'' said Anne Jellema, chief executive of the World Wide Web Foundation, a nonprofit that campaigns for Internet freedom. ''This is yet another worrying sign that these agencies think they are above the law.''    "
"G.E. Navigates, Carefully, the Industrial Internet of Things","Bringing the digital magic of the Internet economy to the machines that run the world is the heady vision of the industrial Internet, or the industrial Internet of Things. Industrial gear like jet engines, power turbines and rail locomotives will sense and predict when they need a tuneup, before any breakdowns, and automatically adjust to changes in the weather and market demand. Factories, cities and even national economies will become more efficient, more productive and cleaner, the thinking goes. Enthusiasm is fueling a global spending spree, and all the major industrial and technology corporations are jumping in.  Still, the optimism is tempered by an increasing recognition of the security risk inherent in combining online and physical resources and cultures in industry. Unless the security challenges can be managed, experts agree, the march toward the industrial Internet will be slowed and the payoff will be much smaller. General Electric, the nation's largest industrial corporation, offers a prime example of the focus on security. No company has been a more forceful champion of the industrial Internet than G.E. in recent years. To pursue its digital strategy, the company has recruited a fast-growing corps of software engineers and data scientists. Last month, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, predicted that the company would be ""a top 10 software company"" by 2020. But G.E. has also been enlarging its security group. It has hired experts and last year bought Wurldtech, a start-up that specializes in industrial online security. ""We're seeing these digital and industrial worlds colliding,"" said William Ruh, G.E.'s chief digital officer. ""On security, the industrial world is a step behind, but has to catch up quickly."" Part of the catch-up challenge, according to Mr. Ruh and others, will be making an adaptive adjustment in the engineering culture of heavy industry. In computing, software security engineers are accustomed to open technical standards, the complexity of distributed systems, regular patches and updates to code, and a constantly shifting battleground in the fight against malicious software. Their work environment assumes a large measure of chaos. The mechanical engineers who manage factories and heavy equipment have traditionally had a different work setting and mind-set. They are experts in control theory, often operating in dirty, hazardous environments. Power plants, oil refineries, water treatment facilities, and air and rail transport systems are known as critical infrastructure because they operate around the clock and failures can have serious, even life-threatening, consequences. For years, the conventional wisdom was that the industrial control technology, while electronic, was separate from the outside world. The communications software was specialized and proprietary, designed for closed, industrial networks. They were assumed to be isolated, so-called air gap systems. Yet for more than a decade, the digital world had been quietly invading industrial factories and equipment more than people recognized. Often, it was through a device connected to a machine or a tweak made in a plant for greater efficiency. Similarly, industry security has been concerned with perimeter control - keeping bad people and malicious software outside the factory gates. But with sensors increasingly placed on all kinds of devices, inside and outside a facility, often involving partners and outside suppliers, all done to streamline operations, the old approach is being challenged. So today's reality, observed Paul Rogers, chief executive of Wurldtech and G.E.'s general manager for industrial cybersecurity, is that much of the world's heavy industry is ""already online and it is vulnerable."" Managing that risk is a growing business. The market for industrial digital security products and services is more than $2 billion a year and increasing 15 percent annually, said Sid Snitkin of ARC Advisory Group, a research firm. G.E.'s Wurldtech unit offers both services and products. Its Achilles service tests equipment to certify whether it can withstand attacks from about 100 kinds of malware used in industrial settings. It also sells a device, about half the size of a shoe box, that sits on an industrial controller and monitors data traffic coming in, looking for unusual patterns and, if any are detected, sending alerts. Wurldtech's corporate parent alone represents a huge market. G.E. says it monitors the data flowing from 10 million sensors on $1 trillion worth of equipment every day. The nature of security threats, experts say, ranges from the nuisance of hackers clogging industrial networks to sophisticated, targeted attacks that can shut down machinery and damage a plant. In its most recent report, a  Department of Homeland Security industrial security team said the largest categories of known attacks in the 245 reported incidents in 2014 were network probing and spear phishing - garden-variety computer intrusion techniques. The real fear, experts say, is an expert group carrying out a Stuxnet-style operation. (Stuxnet severely damaged an Iranian nuclear facility and set back its nuclear program. Though it has never been officially confirmed, Stuxnet was believed to have been an American-Israeli cyberweapon). That kind of attack, experts say, is the rare case combining access to equipment, a deep working knowledge of how it operates and camouflaging the sabotage until the damage is done. So far, there have not been assaults with disastrous effects. ""We haven't seen Armageddon threats yet,"" said Mr. Ruh of G.E. ""And everything that is being done in industrial cybersecurity by companies, university researchers and the government is intended to reduce that risk."" "
North Korean Leader Seeks Meeting With South's President,"TOKYO -- In a nationally televised New Year's speech, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said Thursday that he was open to holding a summit meeting with the South Korean president, proclaiming his willingness to make a ''big shift'' in the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  Mr. Kim was apparently responding to an overture this week by South Korea to resume high-level dialogue. He spent much of the annual 30-minute speech, his third since taking control of the isolated Communist country, calling for improved relations between the rival Koreas. In the speech, carried on state-run television, he also signaled that he was willing to meet directly with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea. ''Depending on the mood and circumstances to be created, we have no reason not to hold the highest-level talks,'' said Mr. Kim, who spoke before a red flag with the hammer, sickle and calligraphy brush symbol of the Workers' Party. It remained unclear whether his offer was truly an overture, or just another ploy in the constant maneuverings between the Koreas, which remain technically at war more than 60 years after combat on the peninsula ended. Tensions have risen recently amid suspicions that North Korean hackers may have been behind cyberattacks on a South Korean nuclear plant operator. The United States may also be engaged in a shadowy cyberconflict with the North, whose tenuous Internet connections have suffered major disruptions, just weeks after a devastating digital breach of Sony Pictures for which the F.B.I. has blamed the Kim government. The tensions over the cyberattacks have added to a continuing standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. In the speech, Mr. Kim said a summit meeting or other high-level talks would be possible if the South showed it was serious about easing tensions. ''If South Korean authorities sincerely want to improve relations between North and South Korea through talks, we can resume stalled high-level meetings,'' he said, according to Reuters. On Monday, South Korea offered to hold minister-level talks on issues like reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. The administration of Ms. Park has cited this year's 70th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula as a chance to thaw ties between the Koreas. "
Annalee Newitz on the Future: 'I Want People to Be Able to Have Cultural Debates Without Having War'," In Telling the Future, Op-Talk asks people from a variety of fields to speculate on what we have to look forward to - and what we should watch out for.  Annalee Newitz has done a lot of thinking about threats to humanity as we know it - she wrote a book on the subject, 2013's ""Scatter, Adapt, and Remember."" But today she's concerned not just with nuclear war and famine (although these subjects do worry her) but also with dangers that may come from our interactions online. Our next five years, she told Op-Talk, may include more events like the Sony hack or harassment of women in the video game industry, instances of ""culture wars spilling over into real life."" And although she offered some predictions for the near future, she also offered a caution: To truly prepare for what the future may hold, we may need to think much more than five years in advance. When it comes to climate change, for instance, we may need to ask ourselves, ""What do we need to do in the next 10 years to make sure that in 100 years people aren't starving and farms aren't flooded?""  ""We want to think in a human life span,"" she said, but ""we really need to be able to be thinking beyond that."" Ms. Newitz, who's also the editor in chief of the website io9 (motto: ""We come from the future""), talked to Op-Talk about the future of social media and online speech - as well as about alternative energy, the Occupy movement and 3-D printed bones.  What do you hope will be different in five years' time?  I think in five years it's reasonable to hope that we might start to have the beginnings of a better infrastructure for alternative energy. I put a strong emphasis on ""beginnings"" because of course the biggest problem with rolling out things like wind or solar or other kinds of alternative fuels really is putting together reasonable plans for transitioning to a new infrastructure. There's a lot of costs involved. Municipalities have to be involved, and in some cases countries have to be involved. And so in five years if we could see a lot of cities or states in the United States committing to putting money toward infrastructures that would support other kinds of fuel that are carbon neutral or even carbon negative, that would be a huge step forward. That's really the political piece that we need to have, because we've got the technology. We've got alternative fuels being cooked up in labs right now, and so now we just need commitment to changing the basic infrastructure of our cities.  What are you afraid will be different?  My biggest fear right now is some kind of massive war, whether that's a traditional kind of war with nuclear strikes or countries being embargoed and that causing famine. War is scary, but I think it's the things that come out of war that are even more scary. Famine is a big one that I really worry about a lot even if we don't go to war, and of course if you have famine, pandemics take hold. The famous Spanish flu that was our last enormous pandemic was largely traced back to troop movements during World War I. So I worry a lot about that, which is a pretty normal worry. But then with this whole recent outbreak of culture war over things like how North Korea should be represented in a Hollywood movie, or culture wars around whether women should be allowed to have opinions about video games, those kinds of debates that seem like they're just happening in this kind of fluffy world of culture and cyberspace or the Internet, they spill out into the real world, and they have real world effects, and people are killed, people are menaced, people are stalked. To me that shouldn't have been surprising but it was, and I think one of my big worries is that we're going to start to see more of those kinds of culture wars spilling over into real life, and spilling over into actual murders or more destruction of people's personal lives, and that that will just become commonplace, and the Internet will become a much more dangerous place in ways that it hasn't been before.  Are there ways to make that kind of spillover less likely?   That actually raises another set of worries for me, because how do you make the Internet safer? Part of it would mean taking away some of the things that we love about the Internet, which is the fact that it's very easy to communicate with people, it's very easy to broadcast opinions. And I think if we have to be worried about our personal safety if we write an editorial about sexism or if we write an editorial about a hostile political regime, I think it's just going to have a chilling effect on our speech. Part of safety will involve curtailing the kinds of things that we feel comfortable saying, and then some of it of course also would involve more surveillance, more physical security, people who make controversial claims not feeling like they can travel, for example, and so that's what I worry about. Of course there's many brilliant people working on questions around computer security, and how to make it possible to say things anonymously, but that also feels like a bit of a loss. I really strongly want people to be able to speak anonymously and to be safe, but I also want people to be able to say things and put their name on it and not feel like they're going to get harassed to the point where they're afraid to travel.  So do you feel like there's going to be a trade-off between that kind of chilling effect and safety?  I worry that it's a trade-off; I don't want it to be a trade-off. I want people to be able to have cultural debates without having war. There needs to not be that sense that voicing an opinion is so dangerous that the person who voices it needs to be killed.  What issue or event that we're talking about now will be completely forgotten in five years?  I think that one of the debates that probably will be forgotten is the debate around whether or not people should be part of social media. I feel like that debate is already dying down to a certain extent, but you still see screeds about, like, ""Social media made someone sad,"" and people actually talking about social media as a thing as opposed to just calling it media. And I think that in five years' time, people won't even necessarily think of social media as separate from media, and it won't even be like, ""Are you on Facebook?"" or ""Are you on Twiddle Twaddle?"" or whatever the latest thing is. It's not going to be like, ""Have you joined this thing?"" It'll just be like, ""Which thing are you part of? Are you on Wippy Woop, are you on Dibby Dab, are you on Old Folks Dancing Network?"" At a certain point it's just going to be part of our everyday lives, of course unless cyberwar destroys the Internet, in which case maybe the question will be, ""Which gated network are you part of?""  What issue or event will we still remember?  Part of it goes back to what I was saying about GamerGate and the Sony hacks: I think that these are just the beginning of organized, political attacks taking place online. I never would've predicted something like GamerGate. When I first heard about it I was like, ""That sounds like the kind of thing I would hear about in a science-fiction novel and say, that was the most terrible example of trying to predict a future political movement,"" because it just sounds silly, but of course now that it's happened it makes complete sense. And so I think we're going to see more of that, more of people organizing around or organizing through pop culture, and identifying with certain kinds of pop culture, but also with political beliefs as well, kind of mixing together. Also, I kind of feel like the Occupy movement is going to return as some kind of nostalgia thing in five or 10 years, because I feel like our culture hasn't quite processed what the Occupy movement meant, but a lot of the issues raised by it are going to become more extreme, with the separation between the wealthy and the poor becoming even greater, both physically and in terms of economics. I find myself thinking about it a lot, and saying, ""People are getting poorer, but the people who are getting poorer all have access to tools that would allow them to have a similar kind of organization."" And that kind of fits with what I was saying about GamerGate: These are these kind of flash-mob political movements where they erupt from the Internet into the real world, and have the components of Internet culture.  Among those whom you work with or whose work you're interested in do you think we'll be talking more about in five years?  I think one of the things we're going to be hearing more and more about is something that in science fiction we would call cyborg, but I think in reality is going to be called things like tissue engineering and mind-controlled prosthetic devices, and synthetic biology of various kinds. I think what we're going to be seeing more and more are people on the street who have artificial or semi-artificial parts in their bodies, and it's just going to become much more normal to do things like 3-D print a bone to put into somebody's body, or 3-D print tissue to rebuild an organ. There's people already who have bladders that have been grown whole-cloth through tissue engineering. I think that if we continue on the trajectory that we're on and we don't have global thermonuclear war, what we think of as a human body is really going to start to change a lot. That's something I'm really excited about, and I think it'll be really interesting beyond five years, like in 20 years or 50 years, to see how that changes how we look at our bodies, and how it changes things like objectification, and what we think of as human capabilities.

Merkel Sticks to Tough Line on Russia Sanctions,"BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Thursday that the crisis in Ukraine could be eased only if Russia made tangible progress on all 12 points of a four-month-old agreement and that sanctions imposed on Moscow for its actions in eastern Ukraine could be lifted only if that overall progress was made. Germany has taken the lead in diplomatic efforts to end the violence in eastern Ukraine, and Ms. Merkel is scheduled to attend what she pointedly called ''a possible meeting in Astana,'' in Kazakhstan, with the presidents of France, Russia and Ukraine.  She gave no date, however, and insisted that Russia must first make ''visible progress'' toward meeting its obligations in the agreement known as the Minsk accord. The accord has brought a shaky cease-fire, but no Russian withdrawal, to eastern Ukraine since it was signed Sept. 17. ''We have had road maps before, and they weren't adhered to,'' Ms. Merkel told reporters after meeting with the Ukrainian prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk. There have been mounting calls -- including from President François Hollande of France this week -- for Europe to lift or ease sanctions imposed on Moscow, both for its annexation of Crimea last March and its subsequent role in eastern Ukraine. Ms. Merkel said any action could come only if there was progress on all points of the Minsk accord, which lays down clear zones where Russia and Ukraine can operate under the eye of European monitors. ''You can't say, we will lift 10 percent of sanctions for the line of control, or 20 percent if some other point is met,'' the chancellor said. ''I think we need to see the entire Minsk agreement implemented before we can say that sanctions will be lifted.'' Mr. Yatsenyuk said earlier that the Minsk accord ''is not a menu; you can't cherry-pick'' which items to uphold while ignoring others. And, he told an audience at the German Council on Foreign Relations, a nongovernmental group, that ''sanctions are extremely important'' to keep the pressure on Russia. On Wednesday, as the Ukrainian prime minister headed to Germany, at least three official German websites went offline after an apparent effort by hackers who demanded that Berlin cease support for the government in Kiev. All of the government's sites were fully accessible on Thursday. Mr. Yatsenyuk blamed the Russian secret service for funding the hacker group, which calls itself CyberBerkut. The group claimed responsibility for taking down the websites of the lower house of Parliament and Ms. Merkel's official home page. A Foreign Ministry official said its page was also affected. ''I strongly recommend that the Russian secret services stop spending taxpayer money for cyberattacks on the Bundestag and Chancellor Merkel's office,'' Mr. Yatsenyuk told the German television broadcaster ZDF, referring to the lower house. The sites were inaccessible for several hours on Wednesday. According to Germany's Office for Security in Information Technology, or B.S.I., hackers regularly try to attack government websites, including daily attempts by what the office believes to be a foreign intelligence agency. The office was investigating the attack. Ms. Merkel gave the Ukrainian leader a warm welcome at her chancellery, and she reiterated that ''Germany will continue to do everything to support Ukraine.'' Mr. Yatsenyuk had outlined impressive overhauls, she said. The Ukrainian leader is seeking additional credit to deal with current bailout payments, even as his country struggles to come to grips with entrenched problems such as corruption, tax evasion and lagging government asset sales. Many creditors fear that Ukraine is not moving swiftly enough to enact needed economic changes. Germany agreed on Wednesday to guarantee credit worth 500 million euros, or nearly $593 million, for Ukraine, contingent on prior approval for the specific use of the funds, said Beate Braams, a spokeswoman for the Economy Ministry. The German government is seeking prior approval to ensure that the funds are not used for any military purpose. Mr. Yatsenyuk, in his appearance at the foreign policy society, encouraged Germans to do business in his country, lamenting that only 400 or so German firms were active in Ukraine, compared to a reported 8,000 in Romania. He and Andriy Kobolyev, head of Ukraine's state gas company, Naftogaz, also insisted that Ukraine is cleaning up its corrupt gas industry and encouraged more German and European involvement in that field. Before winter, Germany and the European Union helped Russia and Ukraine negotiate a difficult agreement on natural gas deliveries from Russia, both to Ukraine and in transit to other European countries. The agreement runs until March 31. "
"Captive, and Not Just to the Internet","There is something profoundly draining and suffocatingly incestuous about watching a film that's dedicated to watching a computer screen. It's as if directors hoped to lure audiences away from their hand-held and desktop devices by focusing on characters who are glued to their own. All they're likely to end up with, however, are movies that hardly ever move.  ''Dark Summer'' isn't entirely motionless, but you'll have to wait so long for Mike Le's story to get off its backside that you might give up before Daniel (Keir Gilchrist), a 17-year-old hacker under house arrest, becomes the victim of his online obsession. That would be Mona (Grace Phipps), a witchy-looking crush and the unwilling target of Daniel's cyberstalking -- hence the bracelet on his ankle and the crabby attentions of an unkempt parole officer (Peter Stormare, showing his younger colleagues what acting is supposed to look like). Despite Mr. Stormare's valiant efforts, ''Dark Summer'' (directed by Paul Solet) feels listlessly plotted and insipidly performed. Sustained only by a discordant soundtrack and two equally colorless friends, Daniel responds to disturbing dreams and poltergeist shenanigans with a single bug-eyed expression and twitchy demeanor. There is gore and there is death, but the flowering of the special effects is countered by the contraction and darkening of the images, until Daniel's house becomes a dungeon, and we all feel as trapped as he does.

Saudis Begin Public Caning to Punish a Blogger,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The authorities in Saudi Arabia on Friday began the public flogging of a blogger who was sentenced to 1,000 blows, 10 years in prison and a large fine for starting a website that featured content critical of the country's religious establishment, the rights group Amnesty International reported.  The floggings are to be administered with a cane over a period of months. The blogger, Raif Badawi, was arrested after starting a website called ''Free Saudi Liberals,'' and he was later convicted of charges that included cybercrime and parental disobedience. The case has drawn attention to the strict limits on freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia, a close Arab ally of the United States, and prompted unusually direct criticism from the American government. Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that the United States was concerned that Mr. Badawi would face ''the inhumane punishment of a thousand lashes in addition to serving a 10-year sentence in prison for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and religion.'' The United States government called on Saudi Arabia to cancel the flogging and ''review Badawi's case and sentence,'' Ms. Psaki said. Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy, has used its courts in the past to punish dissidents or those who question the country's strict interpretation of Islam. Often, these actions face no public rebuke from the United States, which considers Saudi Arabia an important ally in the fight against terrorism and other areas. Besides being the world's largest oil exporter, the kingdom is one of five Arab countries that have joined an American-led air campaign against the jihadists of the Islamic State. Mr. Badawi was arrested in 2012 and prosecuted in a criminal court for offenses that included cybercrime and disobeying his father, who has denounced his son in the news media. Prosecutors tried and failed to charge him with apostasy and then pressed for a resentencing because they considered his first sentence of seven years in prison and 600 blows too lenient. Last year, Mr. Badawi received his final sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of more than a quarter-million dollars and 1,000 blows with the cane. An unidentified witness cited by Amnesty said that Mr. Badawi was taken from a bus and flogged 50 times in a public square outside of a mosque in the port city of Jidda after Friday Prayer. About 15 minutes later, he was put back on the bus and taken away. Amnesty said it would not identify the witness because of security concerns. Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, said Mr. Badawi was clearly being punished for starting a liberal website and insulting the religious authorities. He said that floggers in Saudi Arabia are supposed to distribute the blows from the top of the back to the back of the legs without breaking the skin. It is not a bloody affair, but it is public and painful. "
"As Content Pours From Everywhere, New Network Shows Strive for Boldness","PASADENA, Calif. -- Jesus, a pregnant lesbian, an Asian-American family. A hip-hop empire, cybercrime fighters and the last man on earth. Those are among the cast of characters broadcasters now are depending on to rescue them from a season of troubling ratings declines. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox paraded out the stars and producers behind their lineup of coming shows last week during the industry's Television Critics Association winter presentations here. The broadcasters' offerings represent an attempt to not only solidify their footing but also break out from the flood of competition on cable and digital media.  ''Least-objectionable television is dead,'' said Paul Lee, president of ABC's Entertainment Group. ''We're at a world where passion rules, where social conversation is so important and where people can watch what they want to watch, where they want to watch it. So they're only going to watch the shows that they really love, that they're really passionate about.'' Indeed, viewers have never before had more options. While broadcasters continue to churn out a steady stream of programming, the amount of content on cable and digital outlets is exploding. This year, 113 cable networks are programming 32,828 hours of content in prime time, up from 44 networks and 12,537 hours of content in the 1999-2000 season, according to NBCUniversal research. Streaming outlets like Amazon, Netflix and Hulu also are adding to the deluge. ''This is the topic that keeps all of us up at night: How are we evolving to how the audience watches television?'' said Jennifer Salke, president of NBC Entertainment. For years, these midwinter presentations offered a chance for critics to take stock of networks' offerings in the middle of the TV season. Now they have taken on even more importance as broadcast, cable and digital networks all introduce new series throughout the year. The broadcasters attracted attention last week for the introduction of a number of limited-run series aiming to take on the bold cinematic programming that is luring big-screen stars to television. Acclaimed actors said that they were keen to take on such projects, citing the quality of writers and directors now flocking to television along with the fact that these series have set start and end dates, which makes it easier to juggle other film and television projects. One of the most talked about broadcast series was ABC's ''American Crime,'' created by John Ridley and starring Felicity Huffman and Timothy Hutton. The show examines the racial tensions ignited after a young couple is attacked in their Modesto, Calif., home. The series is scheduled to begin on March 5. Similarly, ''The Slap'' on NBC looks at the ripple effect that one event can have across a community. The dramatic mini-series, scheduled to start in February, stars Zachary Quinto, Uma Thurman, Peter Sarsgaard and Thandie Newton in a story about what happens to a Brooklyn community after a short-tempered man slaps a misbehaving child at a gathering. Walter F. Parkes, an executive producer for ''The Slap,'' called the series ''an opportunity to do a kind of event that usually we associate with cable.'' Other cablelike ''event series'' include Fox's ''Wayward Pines,'' a thriller from the movie director M. Night Shyamalan. The 10-episode series starting May 14 stars Matt Dillon as a Secret Service agent investigating the disappearance of two federal agents in an Idaho town. CBS is preparing for the March premiere of ''The Dovekeepers,'' produced by Roma Downey. The show is the first from a new CBS unit, called the limited series and event programming group, and is based on the Alice Hoffman novel of the same name about the Jewish resistance during the Roman siege of Masada in the first century A.D. Ms. Downey and her husband, Mark Burnett, are bringing another religious-themed program to broadcast television with NBC's ''A.D. The Bible Continues'' that will make its debut on Easter. Ms. Salke described the series as picking up where the couple's popular mini-series ''The Bible,'' on the History Channel, left off. Mr. Burnett described the series as ''Taking 'House of Cards' and dropping it into the first-century Jerusalem.'' Another major theme across the networks was diversity, with critics calling the roster of shows and actors the most diverse they had ever seen. Mr. Lee of ABC said that reflecting the makeup of the audience was as transformative as advancement of digital media. ''The changes in demographics in the U.S., ethnographics in the U.S. are every bit as important a revolution as the technological changes that we're all going through,'' he said. ''It's our job to reflect America.'' One highlight was ABC's ''Fresh Off the Boat,'' a comedy based on the memoir of the food personality Eddie Huang. The series, which follows a 12-year-old Eddie moving from Washington's Chinatown to suburban Orlando, is one of the first major Asian-American sitcoms since Margaret Cho's ''All-American Girl'' in 1994. NBC announced that it had closed a deal with Eva Longoria for a series called ''Telenovela,'' pitched as a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a Spanish-language soap opera. The CW toasted its success with ''Jane the Virgin,'' a melodramatic comedy based on a Venezuelan telenovela. Its star, Gina Rodriguez, won a Golden Globe earlier in the week for best actress in a comedy series. Fox pointed to the early ratings and critical success of its hip-hop drama ''Empire'' from its creators, Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, and starring Terrence Howard. Dana Walden, chairman and chief executive of the Fox Television Group, called the series ''the perfect show for Fox'' and announced that the network would pick up a second season. ''Shows with people of color can make money,'' said Taraji P. Henson, who stars in the series. ''When things make money, people become interested.'' Executives faced questions about their challenges in finding fresh comedy and reality hits. Nina Tassler, chairwoman of CBS Entertainment, echoed the sentiment of several executives when she said in an interview that the genres were ''in a cycle like everything in our business.'' "
"An Outage, Big but Brief, Hits Facebook and Instagram","HONG KONG - Facebook and Instagram were inaccessible for roughly an hour Tuesday, but after a brief mystery, Facebook said the cause was an internal malfunction rather than a cyberattack.  Facebook users began reporting problems accessing the social media site on Tuesday morning Hong Kong time. On Twitter, users posted images of an error message from Facebook which read: ""Sorry, something went wrong. We're working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can."" Both Facebook's mobile application and website were inaccessible. ""Earlier this evening many people had trouble accessing Facebook and Instagram,"" Facebook said from its California headquarters. ""This was not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems. We moved quickly to fix the problem, and both services are back to 100 percent for everyone."" In a post to developers using the Facebook platform, the company said ""Facebook and Instagram experienced a major outage tonight from 22:10 until 23:10 PST. Our engineers identified the cause of the outage and recovered the site quickly. You should now see decreasing error rates while our systems stabilize. We don't expect any other break in service.""

Investigator Admits Guilt in Hiring of a Hacker,"A private investigator who has done work for small New York City law firms that specialize in personal injury and medical malpractice litigation pleaded guilty on Friday in federal court in Manhattan to one charge of conspiracy in hiring a hacker to help with his investigation. The guilty plea, by Eric Saldarriaga, an investigator from Queens, stems from an inquiry by federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the so-called hacker-for-hire business. Mr. Saldarriaga entered his plea before Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Manhattan.     In the court proceeding and a five-page ''criminal information'' charge, the clients of Mr. Saldarriaga were not identified. The charge said Mr. Saldarriaga, 41, operated under the alias ''Emmanuela Gelpi'' in seeking out the services of hackers to help him gain ''unauthorized access'' to at least 60 email accounts.   Under the plea agreement, he could be sentenced to six months in prison. A sentencing date was set for June 26.   Mr. Saldarriaga had been cooperative with authorities for several months, people briefed on the matter said.   The investigation of Mr. Saldarriaga and his company, Iona Research and Security Services, could now turn attention onto some of his clients, assuming they were aware he was hiring hackers to break into email accounts. In a posting on an older Yahoo message board used by private investigators, Mr. Saldarriaga said his company did work for about 20 law firms.   In recent years, federal authorities across the United States have begun focusing on private investigation services that work with hackers-for-hire to illegally gain access to email and social media accounts to gather information for investigations. Authorities are concerned that some lawyers might be working with hackers, either directly or indirectly, to obtain information that could be helpful in representing a client or preparing for trial.   Last month, federal prosecutors in San Francisco, in an unrelated case, announced the indictment of two private investigators and two computer hackers on charges that they had illegally entered email and Skype accounts to gather information for matters they were working on for clients. Some of the illegally gathered information was intended to support a lawsuit, authorities said. In that case, there has been no indication that the private investigators were working on behalf of a particular law firm.   In February, The New York Times reported that prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, were close to securing a guilty plea from a private investigator who had hired others to do illegal computer hacking for him.    That private investigator has now been identified as Mr. Saldarriaga.   Mr. Saldarriaga began seeking the services of hackers-for-hire in 2009 and up until March 2014, the criminal complaint said. His case is loosely related to another inquiry that led to a New York City police officer pleading guilty in federal court in 2013 to charges that he had paid a company to hack into the email accounts of some colleagues.   In that case, Edwin Vargas, who was a detective at the time, was accused of paying $4,000 to an unidentified firm to hack into the email accounts of 43 people, including current and former New York police officers. Mr. Vargas, who was sentenced last year to four months in prison, wanted to determine whether any of his colleagues were dating a former girlfriend.   Peter Brill, who represented Mr. Vargas, is also the lawyer for Mr. Saldarriaga. He declined to comment on Friday after the court proceeding.   The criminal complaint said Mr. Saldarriaga had illegally gained access to the accounts of people to either gather information for his clients or for his own personal use.   The website for Mr. Saldarriaga's firm says it can perform tasks like Internet profiling, email tracing and computer monitoring. The website also said Iona Research specialized in criminal and insurance claims investigations.   Matthew L. Schwartz, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan and now a lawyer with the firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, said that the guilty plea from Mr. Saldarriaga was another indication of how commonplace hacking has become and that federal authorities' prosecution of cybercrime is not ''limited to terrorists'' and state-sponsored hackers.

Republicans Seize Moment to Criticize Clinton's Email Use,"One of the best-known photographs of Hillary Rodham Clinton taken in the past several years is that of her in 2011 jetting from Malta to Tripoli aboard an Air Force C-17, wearing dark sunglasses and typing on a BlackBerry. But according to Representative Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican leading a House investigation into her handling of the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012, his committee has not seen any of the emails she sent that day, or from the trip during which the picture was taken.     ''There are gaps of months and months and months,'' Mr. Gowdy said Sunday on the CBS program ''Face the Nation.'' ''It strains credibility to believe if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there is not a single document to turn over to Congress.''   The furor over Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state showed no signs of abating on Sunday, nearly a week after The New York Times's initial report.   Mr. Gowdy said that he was interested only in communications relating to Benghazi, but that Mrs. Clinton's evasiveness on the matter was wrong.   ''It's not up to Secretary Clinton to decide what's public record and what's not,'' he said.   Other leading Republicans sought to further press the issue of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Also on CBS, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he did not know if Mrs. Clinton's email violated the law, but said he was concerned about the security of her private account.   ''They would have been prime targets for cyberattacks,'' Mr. McConnell said.   Democrats remained on the defensive over the situation, given Mrs. Clinton's status as their presumed presidential nominee despite not having formally announced her intentions to run.   Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said Mrs. Clinton must ''step up'' and explain why she had used a private email address during her time as secretary of state, increasing the pressure on Mrs. Clinton to publicly address the matter.   ''I think that she needs to step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is,'' Ms. Feinstein said Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press, adding, ''From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her.''   Ms. Feinstein's comments were notably more pointed than earlier in the week when, in an interview in the Capitol, she said she did not think there was ''any ill intent'' on Mrs. Clinton's part and counseled patience.   Many senior Democrats appear anxious and said they hoped Mrs. Clinton would offer some clarity about why she had used her own email account to conduct government business.   Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, attempted to tone down the rhetoric, calling it a political attack that would soon blow over.   ''I think at the end of the day this will just be regarded as a slight hiccup, a small bump in the road six months from now,'' Mr. Schumer told CBS. ''The bottom line is she's a national figure, a potential presidential candidate. People are going to shoot at her.''   Mrs. Clinton has so far only said in a post on Twitter that she wants the public to see her emails. Over the weekend, the controversy spilled over into the world of comedy when ''Saturday Night Live'' featured the dust-up.   Impersonating Mrs. Clinton sitting on a couch, the comedian Kate McKinnon said the contents of her email were no big deal.    ''Those emails are clean as a whistle,'' she said. ''This is not how Hillary Clinton goes down.''    "
Slack Gets Hacked as Start-Up Technologies Become Targets,"Security breaches at start-up technologies are starting to become the new normal.  On Friday, Slack, the communications start-up, said it had been breached by hackers. That made it the second young company to step forward this week - following Twitch, the hugely popular video streaming service - and disclose it was hacked.  The breaches at the two companies were not as severe as recent attacks at major retailers like Home Depot, or at banks like JPMorgan Chase, but they underscore how young companies are just as much of a target. Breaches are becoming a kind of rite of passage for fledgling tech companies. If they gain enough momentum with users, chances are they will also become a target for hackers looking to steal, and monetize, the vast personal information they store on users, like email addresses and passwords. Such data can fetch as much or in some cases more on the black market than a credit card number. ""When a company reaches a certain size or notoriety, it's going to get hacked,"" said Tripp Jones, a general partner at venture capital firm August Capital. ""Unfortunately, until someone comes up with a better way, the battle has shifted to identification, containment and damage mitigation."" ""It's a big, big problem,"" Mr. Jones added. The breaches at Slack and Twitch followed attacks last year at Tinder, the popular dating app, and Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, which were both breached as they gained momentum with users.  Both Slack and Twitch have the user base - and the financial resources - to beef up their security. Once Slack had surpassed 200 million messages a month, it attracted $180 million in venture funding. Once Twitch surpassed 55 million users, Amazon scooped it up for nearly $1 billion. Both companies said they had put measures in place to keep hackers from easily exploiting their users' information. At Slack, the company said hackers were able to access a database containing usernames, email addresses, phone numbers, Skype IDs and passwords. The company noted that those passwords were encrypted using a process known as hashing and salting, which makes it much harder, though not impossible, for hackers to crack them. Last month, Slack had half a million daily users. Twitch also said it encrypted passwords, but warned that hackers might have been able to capture passwords in the clear as users were logging on. The breaches have prompted both companies to re-evaluate their security. Slack said Friday that it was adding a security measure called two-factor authentication, which requires a second, one-time password when users log in from an unrecognized device. Twitch had a different experience. After resetting users passwords, Twitch initially introduced longer password character requirements, but had to dial back its new 20-character password length requirement to 8 characters after users complained. ""All security folks know that passwords are a necessary evil,"" said Jonathan Sander, a strategy and research officer at STEALTHbits Technologies, a cybersecurity company. ""If you were looking for a poster child for why we need a better way, then Twitch will likely be your choice."" "
The Ghost in the Machine,"The month after my grandmother died, I received several emails from her. Not from her, of course, but from an old AOL email account of hers that had been taken over by spammers. My mother and other family members called to ask me - the granddaughter who studies computer security - to make the emails stop. We were all strangely unsettled by these messages from beyond the grave, by my grandmother's sudden appearance in our inboxes so soon after we'd lost her. More than just spam, this felt like a ghost in the machine. To my grandmother, born in 1927, everything about computers and the Internet had seemed slightly supernatural. A writer for more than 60 years, she understood that being a professional in this day and age - selling books and articles, of communicating with publishers and agents, of editing and revising - required using a computer. And so she did.  But she regarded machines with suspicion and mistrust. Above all, she felt a deep sense of despair that something cataclysmic and irreparable had happened whenever she couldn't find the Firefox icon (which she referred to as Foxfire), or open an email attachment. She would call me and say woefully: ""I've spent all day looking for the story I was writing and it's completely disappeared. I don't know what I did. I've broken the Internet."" How ironic that she should have an afterlife on that same Internet she was so sure she had broken. Nowadays, online ghosts and Internet afterlives are not just for those with big digital footprints and major social media lives but even for my grandmother, who considered it a major achievement to find the send button in her email. And if she thought the Internet was magic - good magic or malevolent magic - perhaps it's also oddly fitting that it should be some 21st-century version of beyond the veil, our gateway to the spirit world. Magical or not, my grandmother struggled mightily with the computer. It got harder as her eyesight deteriorated and she was both increasingly unable to navigate the screen and increasingly prone to frustration. Naïve digital native that I am, I periodically believed I could fix her problems with a well-placed technological intervention.  In 2010, I set up a blog for her (tagline: ""Five years older than the A train"") so she could continue writing for an audience even as it got harder for her to navigate the world of professional publishing. In the summer of 2012, I persuaded her to buy an enormous 27-inch iMac and set it up in her apartment, magnifying the cursor and the text and the icons so she wouldn't have to strain her eyes. I created an iChat account that would launch automatically and set it so that I could take control of her desktop remotely, using my own account, whenever something went wrong. On some level, I understood even then that there was no technology that could make up for going blind, nothing that would make that loss less acute or painful or resented - but I put everything I could think of into that computer, making it so big and simple and user-friendly that maybe, just maybe, while writing on its enormous screen, in type magnified by 400 percent, she would forget that she could no longer read a newspaper or easily navigate the city where she had lived almost her entire life. There were still lots of despairing phone calls, only now I could hang up the phone and connect directly to her computer from my own laptop, 200 miles away, talking to her and moving her mouse from afar, telling her, when she asked, bewildered, where my voice was coming from, ""I'm here, I'm in the computer."" And then, suddenly, she was the one in my computer - and not just because of the creepy emails that arrived so soon after her death. In the year since my grandmother died, I have inherited some items she loved - jewelry, clothing, books, refrigerator magnets in the shape of Popsicles - and also, inevitably, that computer, which now lives on my desk in Cambridge, with her usernames and passwords still scrawled in her shaky, oversize handwriting on scraps of paper taped to the screen, with the font and icons still magnified, and the blog post she was only 200 words into when she went to the hospital still saved on the desktop. I'm sometimes startled by how powerfully that computer evokes my grandmother for me. As a break from my own work, I often clean out her inbox or go through her documents - that most intimate of after-death invasions - and read her words: letters, blog posts, essays, short stories, a novel, bad puns, revision upon revision, endless accidentally created automatic backups and copies. I can almost hear her voice (as she so often heard mine) coming out of the screen, can almost see her painstakingly pecking at her oversize keyboard to correct the typos or finish the latest blog post, can almost appreciate what a mystical machine it must have seemed to her. These days, I use the computer mostly to work on my dissertation, which is about how we defend computers against attacks and about the complex interplay and interactions between the kinds of defenses we use (encryption, firewalls, passwords) and the types of defenders involved (organizations, policy makers, software developers). It focuses on the ways we often end up defending computer systems against the wrong things. We mean to protect against theft or fraud but ultimately only manage to protect against short passwords or open ports - which often turn out to be weak proxies for the real dangers. I discuss the misleading rhetoric in which we talk about attackers ""getting into"" computers, when in fact, attacks consist of a series of escalating access capabilities. There is no moment at which an attacker is suddenly ""in"" a compromised computer. I make this argument now on that very same machine from which I regularly announced to my grandmother, ""I'm in the computer,"" the same machine that I tried so unsuccessfully to layer with as many defenses as I could against her worsening eyesight and technological despair, the same machine that has slips of paper with her passwords written on them taped to the bottom of the screen because, poor security practice or no, I can't bring myself to throw them away. It is at once funny and strange and sad and fitting to write on my grandmother's computer. There's undeniable comedy in the idea that anything of hers should even touch a computer-science dissertation. And, of course, it's bittersweet, still, to look at her handwritten notes below the screen and her archives of years' worth of writing and realize all over again, I'm never going to get another call that she's broken the Internet, never going to find her Foxfire icon, never going to be inside her computer, never going to talk to her again.  But the right way to remember my grandmother is to write, so I go back to my dissertation, and I try to channel her dedication, her passion for writing, if not her belief that the machines were out to get her, into my thesis - she would not have understood a single word, I know, and yet her voice is on every page.

The Court and Online Threats,"If you post violent thoughts about someone on Facebook, does it matter what you intended to convey when you wrote the words? In a 8-1 decision issued on Monday morning, the Supreme Court said yes.    If the government wants to criminally prosecute someone for his or her words, the court ruled, it must do more than show that a reasonable person would have interpreted those words as threats.   ''Wrongdoing must be conscious to be criminal,'' Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. wrote for a seven-member majority. In the age of the Internet, when anyone can post anything for the world to see, it was an important affirmation of the need to protect speech, and to require the government to meet a stricter legal standard when trying to punish people for their words alone.    The case involved a man named Anthony Elonis, who wrote a series of violent Facebook posts to express his anger after his wife left him in 2010, taking their two children with her.   ''There's one way to love ya but a thousand ways to kill ya,'' he wrote in one post. ''I'm not gonna rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts.''   Mr. Elonis posted many other messages with violent imagery involving bombing a police station, slitting the throat of an F.B.I. agent who visited him to ask about the posts, and shooting up a classroom of local kindergarten students. Several mimicked rap lyrics, or included references to the First Amendment.   Mr. Elonis was convicted under a federal law that makes it a crime to send a message threatening harm to others. He said he never intended to threaten anyone, and appealed on the grounds that the judge instructed the jury not to consider his intent. He claimed that his posts were simply a part of his ''on-line persona'' and were ''therapeutic'' only.   He lost, and spent more than three and a half years in prison before being released in 2014.   In reversing the conviction, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that it mattered what Mr. Elonis was thinking as he wrote his posts. The decision rejected the rule used in 9 out of the country's 11 federal appeals courts, which applied the lenient ''reasonable person'' standard to the vaguely worded anti-threat law. But while that standard is appropriate for civil cases, the chief justice wrote, ''federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state.''   The court did not decide the First Amendment issues raised by Mr. Elonis. Nor did it establish what mental state must exist to convict someone under the law, prompting Justice Samuel Alito Jr., who agreed with the outcome, to warn that the ruling ''is certain to cause confusion and serious problems'' for lawyers and judges around the country.   But the majority opinion said that the court could reconsider other, stricter standards after lower courts had had a chance to apply them.   Of course, nothing in the ruling stops prosecutors from bringing charges when they believe they can make the case that messages were sent with the intent to threaten or with a reckless disregard for that probability. On the other hand, if the court had upheld the lower standard used in the Elonis case, it would make it easier to criminalize all sorts of violent speech that flies around the Internet every day, much of it not intended to threaten anyone.

Business Briefing; Hollywood Lobbying Group Keeps Dodd as Boss,"LOS ANGELES -- Despite a tenure marred by a major legislative setback and a slow response to the Sony computer attack, Christopher J. Dodd, the leader of Hollywood's top lobbying organization, was given a three-year contract extension on Friday.  Mr. Dodd, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut, will remain chairman and chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America until 2018, the group said.    In a statement issued on behalf of its member companies -- 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Walt Disney Studios, NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures Entertainment -- Mr. Dodd was called ''an impactful leader and a vigorous champion for the industry.''   The statement added, ''We are confident he will continue to effectively help steer our interest through a challenging media and policy landscape.''   Mr. Dodd, 71, was hired in 2011 to restore luster to the association. He has successfully worked since then to improve Hollywood's access to China, a fast-growing movie market but one where the government limits the number of Western films. Tax incentives for production have been another focus, along with combating online piracy.   In addition to lobbying efforts, the organization regulates movie advertising and runs the movie rating system.   Hollywood in some ways is still stinging from the 2012 failure of the Stop Online Piracy Act. The Motion Picture Association was badly beaten by a consortium of technology companies in its efforts to get the bill passed.   Mr. Dodd was also criticized for being missing in action -- at least publicly -- in the early part of the online attack on Sony Pictures late last year; the problem turned out to be a lack of consensus among member companies about offering support to Sony.   The Motion Picture Association did not disclose the terms of Mr. Dodd's new contract. Tax records show he has been paid about $3.3 million annually.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
Sweden's Notorious Distinction as a Haven for Online Pirates,"Internet piracy is a global problem, but few countries have become as associated with the practice as Sweden. Its reputation can mostly be attributed to The Pirate Bay, a notorious hub for illegal file-sharing of movies and other media that was started in Sweden in 2003 and ever since has been a target of the global entertainment industry. Its founders, once treated like rock stars in their native country, have been jailed, while the website itself is blocked by a growing list of countries, including, most recently, Russia. Despite all this, The Pirate Bay remains defiant, spawning mirror versions and recently rebranding with a logo featuring a hydra whose many heads -- each sporting a different domain extension -- are meant to symbolize how difficult it will be to kill.     Why is piracy such a problem in Sweden? According to a new report, 280 million films or television shows were illegally viewed (streamed or downloaded) there last year -- equivalent to a loss of $100 million in revenue, or about 25 percent of the value of the entire Swedish film and TV industry. The report, published by Sweden's Film and TV Industry Cooperation Committee (an advocacy group for the country's entertainment industry), included a survey that found that nearly a third of Swedes regularly watch pirated films or television shows. Among those aged 16 to 29, the number jumps to two-thirds. A large chunk of the Swedes who pirate media (42 percent) say they believe the practice is wrong but do it anyway.   Per Stromback, an author who studies digital trade for the committee, said that what sets Sweden apart from other countries isn't how much pirated content is consumed domestically -- this is marginal when compared with the tally in countries like China or the United States -- but the fact that Sweden has become one of the world's largest sources of such content.   ''We cause problems for other people,'' Mr. Stromback said. ''We're almost like a country that burns a lot of fossil fuels and is releasing a disproportionate amount of CO2, polluting the atmosphere.''   Mr. Stromback said that while a number of factors contributed to the rise of piracy in Sweden -- including a big investment in broadband Internet in the late 1990s that gave would-be pirates the bandwidth to do their worst -- it's still ironic that Sweden became a ''haven for pirates.''   ''Sweden is known for being law-abiding. We always score high on global rankings in terms of how much trust we place in institutions,'' he said. ''But there is also an anti-authoritarian streak in the Swedish mindset. Just look at moonshine. Alcohol sales are strictly regulated in Sweden, and as a result moonshine becomes a very big thing in the Swedish countryside.''   As dire as the piracy situation in Sweden is -- and Mr. Stromback calls it ''unsustainable'' at current levels -- another Swedish-made product might offer the blueprint for a solution. That is Spotify, whose exhaustive catalog and free or paid subscription models have contributed to a drop in music piracy. In an interview this year, Fredrik Ekander, the head of Sweden's Cosmos Music Group, explained why that might be.   ''There are a lot of steps you need to take to pirate a music file,'' he said. ''You have to find your torrent client, go to the pirate site, search for your file, download. At each point, most people will think: 'I'd rather not be doing this.' Spotify gave people that alternative.''     "
Patriots' Scandal? Computer Hacking Is More Serious,"Patriots' Scandal? Computer Hacking Is More Serious To the Sports Editor:    Re ''Baseball Team Is Said to Breach Rival's Database,'' June 17: If the St. Louis Cardinals did, in fact, hack into a proprietary computer system maintained by the Houston Astros, then the scandal is one of far greater import than the underinflation of footballs practiced by the New England Patriots. Anyone who has ever had a job that entails the generation of confidential information in the form of mental impressions and strategic thinking knows the importance of keeping such information away from the eyes of competitors.   DENNIS R. LAPP, Cincinnati    To the Sports Editor:   The compelling need to win has led to a binge of cheating not seen in my lifetime. We have athletes in all sports taking steroids, professional football teams deflating footballs, and now one team's hacking of an opponent's database to try and steal an advantage. If the allegations against the Cardinals are true, the F.B.I. and the commissioner of baseball should see to it that they are punished accordingly.   HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN, New York   The Worth of a Milestone Ball   To the Sports Editor:   Re ''Homer Balls and Megabucks,'' June 16: I had to laugh when I read Eddie Fastook, the Yankees' head of security, referring to fans catching significant home run balls as trying to use the situation to extort more out of it than an autograph and a photo-op. Today's ballplayers earn tens of millions of dollars -- salaries that might be thought of as extorting team owners for riches commoners never see in a lifetime.   One would think that milestone souvenirs might be worth more than a few shekels.   STEVEN SCALICI, Staten Island   To the Sports Editor:   Every Yankee wants his home run balls. But if you can survive a bare-knuckled melee against like-minded fans and wrest away that home run ball, your $12 base-price ball will soon bring you megabucks. And your ordeal toward gaining big money will be half over.   Half over because you will be accosted by Eddie Fastook. But don't talk to Eddie, who will offer you baubles -- pictures with A-Rod, a tour of the clubhouse, free tickets for a few games. Instead, give me a call as soon as you see him coming at you. Then hand your phone to Eddie and I will talk to him.   The legal rationale supporting a fan's right to possess the baseball hit into the stands, whether homer or foul, is acknowledged by the Yankees. Once it enters fan domain, the Yankees have surrendered any intent to claim ownership.   It's worth noting that Barry Bonds hit his 756th home run in August 2007. Two fans fought for and were recognized at trial to have legally recovered Bonds's homer. The ball went to auction and sold for nearly $450,000.   GEORGE ELFTER, Washington, D.C.

Suspect in an A.T.M. Scheme Is Extradited to the U.S.,"A man who prosecutors say orchestrated one of the biggest bank thefts in American history faced charges in the United States after fighting extradition from a German jail for a year and a half.  The suspect, Ercan Findikoglu, 33, is accused of stealing more than $55 million in a series of thefts that prosecutors said was stunning in its sophistication, involving hackers gaining access to bank computers and runners withdrawing millions in cash from A.T.M.s within hours.    For years, Mr. Findikoglu, who prosecutors say went by the online code names ''Segate'' and ''Predator,'' meticulously stayed off American soil to avoid Secret Service agents investigating the case. Even after being arrested in Germany in 2013, he fought extradition to the United States for 18 months. But on Tuesday, an airplane with Mr. Findikoglu touched down in New York for his day in court.   On Wednesday, Mr. Findikoglu pleaded not guilty to 18 charges, including computer intrusion, bank and wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The judge agreed with prosecutors that no bail should be granted to Mr. Findikoglu, a Turkish citizen, because he probably had enough cash to flee the country.   ''Cybercriminals, and especially hackers as this defendant is alleged to be, wreak havoc and steal millions of dollars by breaching our information systems and networks with clicks and keystrokes from the perceived anonymity of their computers at locations all over the globe,'' Kelly T. Currie, acting United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.   Mr. Findikoglu's lawyer, Christopher Madiou, declined to comment.   Others suspected of taking part in the A.T.M. thefts have already been arrested. The Justice Department's long effort to bring Mr. Findikoglu to trial highlights the Obama administration's desire to prosecute those accused of coordinating online attacks on American companies from abroad.   Prosecutors said the A.T.M. thefts spanned three years, from 2010 to 2013, and targeted multiple institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, MasterCard and the American Red Cross.   Prosecutors said that hackers including Mr. Findikoglu wormed their way into the computer systems of financial institutions that process prepaid debit cards. Next, they said, the hackers significantly raised the withdrawal limits normally set for the cards, which are often used to pay employees or aid disaster victims.   In the final step, resembling a movie version of a bank job, but without the masks, teams of thieves in at least 24 countries sped from A.T.M. to A.T.M. using the cards to draw out money. On the Saturday before Christmas in 2012 alone -- a day when A.T.M.s are flush with cash for holiday shoppers -- one team withdrew $400,000 from 140 locations in New York in less than three hours, the prosecutors said.

Hired Hacker Who Named Clients Now Fears Retaliation,"It's not uncommon for a criminal defendant in a white-collar case to cooperate with prosecutors in hopes of receiving a lenient sentence. But it is less common for a defendant to then seek to keep that cooperation secret out of fear of retaliation from those he named. Yet that appears to have been the case with Eric Saldarriaga, a private investigator in New York who was sentenced on June 26 to serve up to three months in federal prison for hacking into dozens of personal email accounts.     A year before he pleaded guilty, Mr. Saldarriaga tried, in vain, to cooperate with federal authorities in a bid to avoid prison time. In the end, prosecutors decided the information he provided was not enough to pursue charges against anyone else, according to court filings in the case that were unsealed on Tuesday.   What seemed to trouble Mr. Saldarriaga the most in the weeks since his guilty plea was that the full extent of his efforts to help authorities might become public and prompt at least one of his former clients to possibly retaliate against him.   ''I now fear for the safety of my family,'' Mr. Saldarriaga wrote in a previously redacted letter to Judge Richard J. Sullivan of the United States District Court in Manhattan just days before his sentencing.   Mr. Saldarriaga's efforts at cooperation began shortly after federal authorities first approached him in March 2014 and said they had evidence that he paid an overseas hacker-for-hire firm to illegally obtain passwords to email accounts for dozens of individuals. Mr. Saldarriaga agreed to help the authorities and recorded several phone calls with one person who had hired him to hack into several personal email accounts, the unsealed court filings show.   The unidentified person that Mr. Saldarriaga taped the phone calls with is described by federal authorities as being one of his main clients in the filing. The client is said to be someone who has done investigations on behalf of the Church of Scientology, said people briefed on the case but not authorized to speak publicly.   Nothing in the newly released filings publicly identifies the church as being associated with Mr. Saldarriaga. But the day before he was sentenced, federal prosecutors filed victim impact statements from two people who have been outspoken critics of Scientology and were told by federal authorities that their email accounts may have been illegally hacked by Mr. Saldarriaga.   Federal authorities, who had requested that Mr. Saldarriaga be sentenced to a term of six months in prison after his guilty plea, did not explain in the unsealed documents why they found the private investigator's evidence insufficient.   As his sentencing approached, Mr. Saldarriaga grew increasingly worried that if his attempted cooperation became public, his former client might come after him or his family. In his letter to the judge, he expressed concern about the coverage of his case in The New York Times and that information he had provided to authorities had been leaked to the press.   Federal prosecutors also took note. A few days before sentencing they sent a confidential letter to Judge Sullivan suggesting that Mr. Saldarriaga's personal safety might be in jeopardy. Daniel Noble, a prosecutor working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said authorities had no evidence of a specific threat but did not discount Mr. Saldarriaga's concerns. Citing the potential for retaliation, Mr. Noble and Mr. Saldarriaga's lawyer, Peter Brill, redacted most references to his efforts at cooperation from any court filings.   Judge Sullivan met privately with Mr. Noble, Mr. Saldarriaga and Mr. Brill in his chambers just before the public sentencing. Judge Sullivan wanted to discuss whether the threats were substantial enough to keep secret the details of Mr. Saldarriaga's cooperation.   During the 20-minute closed-door conference, Mr. Saldarriaga told Judge Sullivan that the person he had sought to gather evidence on ''has the means and motive and the opportunity financially to do anything, and to cause great distress to my family.'' He also expressed concern that another person he provided information to authorities about had ''ties in foreign governments.''   Judge Sullivan said he was sympathetic, but said there was a presumption that court proceedings and court filings should be public. The judge said a fear of retaliation is not enough to warrant keeping a person's efforts at cooperation out of the public record.   ''It's not enough to imagine,'' said Judge Sullivan, according to the transcript of the proceeding. ''People cooperate against insider trading defendants who have access to a lot of money, presumably, and yet there's no articulable basis to think that they are going to retaliate in any way.''   The proceeding ended with Judge Sullivan ordering the unsealing of the redacted filings as well as the transcript of the private meeting. The judge said, however, that the ''specific names'' of any clients that Mr. Saldarriaga had provided evidence against could remain private.    "
"Swept Off Her Feet, Then Bilked Out of Thousands","AT first, the constant attention seemed sweet and very special. Janet N. Cook, a church secretary in the Tidewater, Va., area, had been a widow for a decade when she joined an Internet dating site and was quickly overcome by a rush of emails, phone calls and plans for a face-to-face visit.    ''I'm not stupid, but I was totally naïve,'' said Ms. Cook, now 76, who was swept off her feet starting in July 2011 by attention from a man who called himself Kelvin Wells and described himself as a middle-aged German businessman looking for someone ''confident'' and ''outspoken'' to travel with him to places like Italy, his ''dream destination.''   But very soon he began describing various troubles, including being hospitalized in Ghana, where he had gone on business, and asking Ms. Cook to bail him out -- again and again. In all, she sent him nearly $300,000, as he apparently followed a well-honed script that online criminals use to bilk members of dating sites out of tens of millions of dollars a year.    Many of those targeted are women, especially women in their 50s and 60s, often retired and living alone, who say that the email and phone wooing forms a bond that may not be physical but that is intense and enveloping. How many people are snared by Internet romance fraud is unclear, but between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2014, nearly 6,000 people registered complaints of such confidence fraud with losses of $82.3 million, according to the federal Internet Crime Complaint Center.   Older people are ideal targets because they often have accumulated savings over a lifetime, own their homes and are susceptible to being deceived by someone intent on fraud. Most victims say they are embarrassed to admit what happened, and they fear that revealing it will bring derision from their family and friends, who will question their judgment and even their ability to handle their own financial affairs.   ''That would ruin my reputation in my community,'' said a woman from Pensacola, Fla., who spoke on condition of anonymity. She lost $292,000, she said, to a man she met online in late 2013, but she has kept it secret from her family and friends.   At first, Louise B. Brown, 68, a nurse in a pediatrician's office in Burlington, Vt., also hid the fact she had been defrauded online. She said she had tried several dating sites, including eHarmony.com, because, ''After my husband died, I had no spouse to talk to.''   Then in 2012, on Match.com, she met a man who called himself Thomas. He said he was a road contractor in Maine and was about to leave for a business venture in Malaysia.   ''At first it made sense, but then he started asking me for money to cover expenses like work permits,'' she said. ''Eventually, I sent $60,000.'' After she ran through her savings, her suitor urged her to accept illegally obtained money from his friends, then forward the money to him, she testified before Vermont lawmakers this year at a hearing on Internet dating fraud. It was not until her credit union alerted her that she learned that ''Thomas'' was a swindler.   As a result of investigations into more than two dozen complaints by victims in the state, Vermont's Legislature is poised to pass a law requiring online dating sites to notify members quickly when there is suspicious activity on their accounts or when another member has been barred on suspicion of financial fraud.   Victims typically lose $40,000 to $100,000, said Wendy Morgan, chief of the Public Protection Division of the Vermont Attorney General's Office. The highest reported loss in the state was $213,000.   Swindlers can gain access to the lovelorn by hacking into a dormant dating profile and altering such information as age, gender and occupation, according to Vermont investigators. After contacting a possible victim, the swindler tries to avoid detection on the dating site by insisting that communications shift to email, telephone or instant message.   Typically, the Internet swindler says he speaks English because he has lived in Europe or the United States and is working as a contractor or builder in Malaysia or another country where he encounters trouble with local authorities. The website romancescams.org lists red flags to look for to identify such predators, who urgently appeal to victims for money to cover financial setbacks like unexpected fines, money lost to robbery or unpaid wages.   That is how Betty L. Davies, 62, of Conyers, Ga., lost a huge sum to a man who called himself Donald Leo Moore and claimed to be a chemical engineer working on a pipe refinery in Malaysia. Three weeks into a relationship that began in 2013, he told Ms. Davies that he had been robbed by a man on a bicycle and asked her to send him money.   ''I debated for a long time, but I wanted to help him,'' she said. ''Then his project had a problem, and he needed $20,000, and then immigration officials in Singapore stopped him on his way to visit me for Christmas, and he needed $30,000.''   ''He even sent me his flight itinerary to Atlanta for Christmas. I had bought him a sweater, but Christmas came and went,'' she said. Later, he threatened her with not returning any of her money if she did not send more.   Her reaction to losing almost $300,000 to the swindler: ''I blame myself. I felt like jumping off a cliff.''   Law enforcement authorities say the swindlers follow a similar pattern.   ''They get the victim to trust them, then create a sense or urgency and prey on the trust they've created,'' said David Farquhar of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's financial crimes section. ''These are threads in all confidence schemes,'' said Mr. Farquhar, who is the section's chief of the intellectual property and cyberenabled crimes.   Victims who are looking for romance but find online criminals instead should alert authorities, he said.   ''It's imperative for someone who thinks they have been scammed to move quickly and notify the bank and law enforcement authorities,'' he said. Even so, he admitted, ''The chances are not great of seeing that money again.''   While some swindlers are local, others are part of international crime rings and are more difficult to track, although, Mr. Farquhar said, the F.B.I. has personnel in a number of countries, including Nigeria and Ghana, where Internet romance swindlers operate.   Despite warnings, the digital version of the romance con is now sufficiently widespread that AARP's Fraud Watch Network in June urged online dating sites to institute more safeguards to protect against such fraud. The safeguards it suggests include using computer algorithms to detect suspicious language patterns, searching for fake profiles, alerting members who have been in contact with someone using a fake profile and providing more education so members are aware of romance cons.   The AARP network recommends that from the beginning, dating site members use Google's ''search by image'' to see if the suitor's picture appears on other sites with different names. If an email from ''a potential suitor seems suspicious, cut and paste it into Google and see if the words pop up on any romance scam sites,'' the network advised.   Like others who have been tricked by financial swindlers, Ms. Cook was won over by her suitor's constant attention. So when he said he was hospitalized in Ghana, she sent him money for medical and hospital bills and for medicine. As the sums mounted, she assured her bank that she knew Mr. Wells. After she exhausted her savings, she said, she contacted Match.com, where she and Mr. Wells had posted their profiles.   Match.com declined to make a company official available to discuss possible frauds. But Eva Ross, of DKC, Match.com's public relations agency, said the site asks users to pledge ''never to send money or share financial information with other Match users'' and ''to report anyone who asks me for money or my financial information.''   She said users can alert the site about suspicious activity with a ''report a concern'' button. She noted, however, that con artists ''have the ability to hide or mask their I.P. addresses using various services and software available to hide their true location and bypass our security checks.''   The lure of romance swindlers can be hard to resist, said Ms. Brown, in Vermont. ''It makes me sound so stupid, but he would be calling me in the evening and at night. It felt so real. We had plans to go to the Bahamas and to Bermuda together.   ''When I found out it was a scam, I felt so betrayed. I kept it secret from my family for two years, but it's an awful thing to carry around. But later I sent him a message and said I forgave him.''   Make the most of your money.

Is There Such a Thing as 'Ethical Cheating'?,"When the news broke last week that hackers had breached Ashley Madison, the dating website that helps married people find out-of-wedlock romance, the Internet responded with a lot of snark and not much sympathy. We read Twitter so you don't have to, and the take-away is this: if you cheat and get caught, you are getting what you deserve; and, if you cheat and get caught because you entered your personal information into a cheaters' dating website whose marketing tagline is ''Life is short. Have an affair,'' you really are getting what you deserve.    But married daters looking for someone to defend their honor have at last found a spokesman: Brandon Wade, 45, the founder of the new website OpenMinded.com, which caters to individuals and couples looking for others with whom to engage in what Mr. Wade calls ''ethical cheating.'' This involves telling a spouse that you are going to be unfaithful, or including the spouse in new, outside-the-marriage relationships, he said.    ''Monogamy in the traditional sense is not working for the majority of us,'' said Mr. Wade, whose current wife is his third. ''It has not worked out for me. There is a growing movement of people who are able to be honest with their mate that the traditional model isn't working.''   OpenMinded.com started in May and, Mr. Wade said, now has 150,000 users, with more than half of the members identifying as couples who are in open relationships. The site's members are more likely to be men than women, 68 percent of members have earned a bachelor's degree, 40 percent are 18 to 35.   To get started on a journey toward polyamorous partnering, OpenMinded.com users fill out a form with questions that reflects, it must be said, a certain open-mindedness. The ''Orientation'' section asks users to define themselves by ''romantic orientation'' (''biromantic'' and ''sapiomantic'' are among the options) and other attributes, while the ''Life Choices'' section dives into issues like tolerance to marijuana-smoking (''420 friendly nonconsumer,'' ''recreational heavy consumer'').   Under the ''Looking to Meet'' heading, users designate the type of relationship they are seeking (''monogamish,'' ''poly dating,'' ''swinging'') and the identity of those they would like to meet (there are dozens of different options, including ''pangender,'' ''two-spirit,'' ''woman'' and ''intersex'').   Also provided are primers to help newbies, including an essay entitled, ''How to Cheat on Your Wife.'' It advises that men disclose their intent to their wives before they begin to date.   ''Expect a bit of defensiveness,'' the essay warns.   Mr. Wade said he was raised in Singapore with what he deemed a ''Tiger Mom type of upbringing.'' He studied electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then, he said, earned an M.B.A. at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. in 1995. He worked at Booz Allen and General Electric, he added. But corporate life wasn't a good match for him.   He decided to take an entrepreneurial route. In 2006, he introduced SeekingArrangement.com, which is, according to promotional material, ''the leading sugar daddy dating website.'' In 2011, he unveiled WhatsYourPrice.com, a site on which users can auction off dates.   ''Most of my dating websites have been created out of personal need,'' he said. ''OpenMinded is my next evolution in my relationships.''   Before marrying his current wife, he said, she and he discussed his progressive views about monogamy. ''I told my wife, 'If this relationship doesn't work out, I'm never going to get married again,' '' he said.    "
How Hackers Made $1 Million by Stealing One News Release,"A scheme, announced by federal authorities on Tuesday, to hack into three news wire services to steal copies of corporate news releases went on for years, and required a good deal of patience and persistence. For a while, it seemed to pay off. The information the hackers were getting about Clorox, Hewlett-Packard and other companies was so timely it generated as much as $100 million in illicit proceeds for them and the traders, according to securities regulators.     Law enforcement officials said the companies -- Business Wire, PR Newswire and Marketwired -- oftened detect the overseas hackers and kicked them out, but the hackers returned time and time again.   This, according to court filings, is how they did it with one company almost two years ago.   At 9:04 a.m. Eastern Time on Oct. 22, 2013, representatives from Panera Bread, the chain of fast-casual restaurants, uploaded a news release about the company's latest quarterly earnings to Marketwired's service.   In the release, Panera Bread announced that it was revising its earning guidance downward for the fourth quarter of 2013. It had turned a profit that was in line with what analysts on Wall Street had been expecting, but fewer people were coming to its restaurants and labor and food costs were rising. It was not an altogether rosy picture the company was going to paint when its release became public that day after stock market trading closed at 4 p.m.   Weeks earlier, Arkadiy Dubovoy, the owner of a APD Developers, a company based in Alpharetta, Ga., began to prepare.   APD designed and built residential communities and condominiums, but Mr. Dubovoy also controlled brokerage accounts at Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, Merrill Lynch and TD Ameritrade.   On Oct. 8, Mr. Dubovoy received an empty email from a relative who split his time between Georgia and Ukraine. Attached to the email was a so-called wish list -- a picture of a spreadsheet that contained the information about 18 publicly traded companies and the schedule for their earnings releases. Panera was on the list.   For years, Mr. Dubovoy and his colleagues and relatives, including Igor Dubovoy, his son, had established wish lists with men in Ukraine who knew how to gain access to the servers of companies like Marketwired. Ivan Turchynov was one of those men. He sometimes went by Vladimir Gopienko, or DSU.   For years, hackers had gained access to Marketwired by using a series of SQL, or Structured Query Language, injections -- instructions written in a specific programming language that is used to retrieve and manage information in computer databases. Over two months in 2012, Mr. Turchynov used SQL injections on Marketwired on at least 390 occasions.   Once inside the system, Mr. Turchynov and other hackers would retrieve uploaded releases and share them with traders before they were made public. On the day of Panera's earnings announcement, this is what happened for Mr. Dubovoy.   By 2 p.m., Mr. Dubovoy began shorting the company's shares. That is, he sold borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back at a lower price. A little over an hour later, another man who lived in Georgia, Leonid Momotok, started trading Panera shares. Shortly after that, Vitaly Korchevsky, a former hedge fund manager who lived in Pennsylvania, also began shorting the stock. Among the three men, more than 100,000 shares of Panera stock were put in play between 2 and 4 p.m.   At 4:05 p.m., Panera's earnings news release hit the wire. The stock price dived.   That afternoon, Mr. Dubovoy, Mr. Momotok and Mr. Korchevsky made just shy of $1 million.    "
Prosecutors Ask to Deny Bail to 5 Accused in Insider Trading Ring,"Federal prosecutors have asked the courts to refuse bail to all five men arrested in connection with a scheme that enabled securities traders to benefit from confidential corporate information in news releases stolen by hackers in Ukraine before the documents were made public. The government's lawyers contended in court papers that the men, all of whom were arrested in the United States but have strong ties to Ukraine, were likely to flee the country, especially since the five-year scheme generated at least $30 million in trading profits for them and the overseas hackers.     The request by the federal prosecutors to deny bail is somewhat unusual for a white-collar crime case. None of the defendants have been accused of engaging in violent behavior, and three of them are United States citizens.   But in one court filing, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said the men ''represent substantial flight risks'' because they ''have strong overseas ties, and the means to escape to non-extradition countries.''   The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Ukraine. International arrest warrants have been issued for four other men in the case, who are believed to be in Ukraine, according to court filings.   The authorities said the men in custody traded stock through their own brokerage accounts in various investment banks in the United States. They would sometimes submit ''shopping lists'' to the hackers with the names of the companies whose news releases they wanted to obtain illegally from news services like BusinessWire and PR Newswire. The lists named some of the biggest companies around the world.   One of the men Brooklyn prosecutors want to keep in custody is Vitaly Korchevsky, 50, who is being held at a federal prison in Philadelphia. According to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, Mr. Korchevsky was the single biggest earner in the novel scheme that married insider trading to computer hacking, making just over $17 million.   Mr. Korchevsky, who lives in Glen Mills, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia, is a former Morgan Stanley mutual fund manager and a hedge fund manager. Born in Ukraine, Mr. Korchevsky is a United States citizen and pastor of a church.   On Tuesday, a federal magistrate judge in Philadelphia, Linda K. Caracappa, ordered Mr. Korchevsky released on $100,000 bond. Soon after that ruling, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who had brought the indictment against Mr. Korchevsky, filed an appeal to block his release. And late Tuesday, Judge Brian M. Cogan, of federal court in Brooklyn, signed an order that stayed Judge Caracappa's ruling and ordered a hearing to be held on the matter in Brooklyn.   Steven Brill, the lawyer who is representing Mr. Korchevsky, said, ''The government position is unreasonable and unfair,'' adding that he was working on putting together a bail proposal for his client.   The Brooklyn prosecutors also are asking that Leonid Momotok, 47, and Aleksandr Garkusha, 47, two men living near Atlanta, be held without bail. Both are also United States citizens, but were born in Ukraine. The men are being held in a jail in Atlanta.   On Wednesday, Judge Raymond J. Dearie of federal court in Brooklyn issued an order keeping the three men charged by prosecutors there in custody pending a hearing before him.   Suzanne K. Hashimi, a lawyer for Mr. Momotok, said, ''I don't believe the government's claim that my client is a risk of flight is borne out by the evidence.'' A lawyer for Mr. Garkusha did not return a request for comment.   Two men charged by federal prosecutors in New Jersey are also being held in a jail near Atlanta. Those men, Arkadiy Dubovoy, 51, and Igor Dubovoy, 28, are father and son and are citizens of Ukraine, even though both have permanent resident status in the United States. The Dubovoys made more than $11 million from the scheme, according to an indictment. Lawyers for the men did not return requests for comment.   Over the next several days, detention hearings will be held to determine whether the men should be released on bail or remain in custody pending trials. Hearings will also be held to have the men's cases formally transferred to either federal court in Brooklyn or in Newark.    "
"Online and Telephone Fraud Surges in Mainland China and Hong Kong, Officials Say","Law enforcement officials in China and surrounding regions have reported a surge in online and telephone fraud by criminals who, with a powerful mix of technological and psychological savvy, pose as Chinese officials and cheat people of their life savings. People like Chen Yue. Ms. Chen's nightmare began in early August, when she answered a call on her mobile phone in Beijing. It was just before 9 a.m. and Ms. Chen, 29, a public relations executive originally from the central city of Wuhan, was about to leave for work. She had recently returned from a vacation in Europe, for which she had dug into her savings. She had just over 200,000 renminbi, or about $31,000, in her bank account.  From the moment she answered the call from a woman who said she was with the Wuhan police and whose number, displayed on Ms. Chen's phone, contained that region's area code, Ms. Chen entered a vortex of deception that only ended four hours and many calls later, after she had transferred all her money to the fraudsters. Everyone she interacted with, she said in a tearful interview at a Beijing cafe, was convincing in style and language. ""I was blind,"" Ms. Chen said.  ""I had been saving that money since middle school. I saved every red envelope that my father gave me at Lunar New Year,"" she said, referring to traditional gifts of money. ""I send my parents money every month, and was going to use half of my money to buy them a house,"" she continued. ""I don't dare tell them what has happened."" ""Now, my money is gone,"" she said. ""I had to borrow money from friends just to pay the rent this month and to survive. I don't think I'll ever be able to save that much up again, as Beijing has become so expensive."" The woman who called Ms. Chen said that the police in Guiyang, the capital of the southwest province of Guizhou, suspected Ms. Chen of being part of a money-laundering gang operating out of the city. Because Ms. Chen's hukou, or residence permit, was for Wuhan, the woman said, she was calling on behalf of the Guiyang police. Befuddled, Ms. Chen believed her. The woman and her associates seemed to know so much about her: Her full name. Her hukou details. Her phone number. Her date and place of birth. And they were intimidating, issuing instructions in a way that many Chinese, believing they are dealing with the police and reluctant to challenge their authority, might find difficult to resist: Turn on your computer. Don't call anyone. Don't answer the door. This is top secret. The police in mainland China and Hong Kong say this kind of fraud has risen sharply. In 2011, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security recorded about 100,000 cases of online or telephone fraud, but in 2014, that number jumped to about 400,000, according to Chinanews.com, a state-run news site. Losses in such cases on the Chinese mainland amounted to 10.7 billion renminbi in 2014, it reported. At the end of July, the police in Hong Kong reported that the area had ""a significant increase"" this year in the kind of ""pretend mainland official"" scam that netted Ms. Chen. The police recorded 200 such cases in the first six months of 2015, compared with four in the same period in 2014, Lo Mung-hung, the director of crime and security at the Hong Kong Police Force, said at a news conference. From July 1 to 28, Mr. Lo said, there were 729 reports of attempted fraud, with 263 cases of ""successful"" fraud causing losses of 85.4 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $11 million. He said the fraudsters spoke Mandarin or Cantonese, and were thought to be directed from outside Hong Kong. In the case of Ms. Chen, the callers told her to go to a website that they said belonged to China's top prosecutor. It was a forgery, though its address was similar to the real one. She followed a link on the site, as they ordered, and discovered what appeared to be a warrant for her arrest that included hard-to-get personal details. In what seems to be a common chain of events, the fraudsters told Ms. Chen that she could ""prove"" that the money in her bank account was not from illicit funds if she transferred the money to them for examination. She was in serious trouble, they said, and this was the only way she could clear her name. So she did as they said. Her account was empty. The criminals hung up. Ms. Chen began to collect her emotions - And to grow suspicious. She telephoned the Beijing police, who told her to go to a special fraud unit in the city's Dongcheng district. There, the police told her that she had certainly been the victim of a crime - and that there was no way to recover her money. ""They said that only once they get 'this many' cases"" - she held up a thumb and index finger about an inch apart - ""could they do anything about it."" There was little they could do anyway, the police said, as the criminals were thought to be overseas, operating from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Police investigators in the Philippines say the gangs are operating there, as well as in Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and even as far as Kenya - places largely out of the reach of Chinese law enforcement officers. The Beijing police declined to answer questions by telephone, requesting a fax instead. A week after they received questions, they had not answered them. Ms. Chen said the police had advised victims not to demand that a case be opened. In China, asking for the police to open a criminal investigation is noted in a person's ""dang'an,"" the personal file held by the authorities that accompanies an individual through life. ""The police told the girl next to me at the station, 'You don't want that in your file, do you?' "" Ms. Chen recounted. ""They said, 'It's so hard to find a job these days.' "" The implication was that the file would indicate a lack of intelligence, that one is easily duped or a troublemaker, and that no one would want to hire a person like that. In the Philippines, the national police, acting on tips from the Chinese Embassy in Manila or from Taiwanese officials, arrested 316 Chinese or Taiwanese for telephone fraud in 2013 and 2014, Jay D. Guillermo, the assistant chief at the country's Anti-Cybercrime Group, wrote in an email. All those arrested were deported, he said. But this year, despite the jump in reported crimes, cooperation has stopped, he said. ""As of now, we don't have a direct connection with the Chinese or Taiwanese police attachés,"" he wrote in the email, without elaborating. Ms. Chen wonders if this form of crime is possible because of leaks from inside China's Public Security system or another branch of government, like the hukou authorities. ""Only three groups of people have all those personal details,"" she said. ""The police, the hukou department and the bank."" This week, Ms. Chen asked the police again to take down the fake websites posted by the fraudsters that display her personal information. ""I called the officer handling my case yesterday,"" she said on Tuesday. ""He said he can't do anything about it, because it's registered overseas.""

Scott Walker Joins Growing Chorus in Attacking China,"With China's currency devaluation and stock market downturn rattling American markets, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin on Monday called on President Obama to cancel the visit of China's leader,  President Xi Jinping, to Washington next month.  Mr. Walker's call comes as Republican presidential candidates have been stepping up their criticism of China in recent days, with Donald J. Trump leading the charge. Mr. Walker, who has been struggling to regain ground lost to Mr. Trump in recent polls, said that Mr. Obama must ""focus on holding China accountable"" on a range of issues, from cyberattacks to the persecution of Christians to unfairly manipulating its economy in ways that damage the United States. ""Americans are struggling to cope with the fall in today's markets driven in part by China's slowing economy and the fact that they actively manipulate their economy. Rather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests. Given China's massive cyberattacks against America, its militarization of the South China Sea, continued state interference with its economy, and persistent persecution of Christians and human rights activists, President Obama needs to cancel the state visit. There's serious work to be done rather than pomp and circumstance."" The state visit to the United States will be Mr. Xi's first as China's leader.

Unwelcome in Malaysia,"Over the last decade, economic growth -- combined with a push to become a leader in education and information technology in Southeast Asia -- has made Malaysia a magnet for students and immigrants from Africa. It should be a success story of progress and cultural exchange, but recently tensions have escalated. In May, a 30-year-old Nigerian student was sentenced to death in Kuala Lumpur for trafficking 1.7 pounds of methamphetamine. It was the second capital sentence handed to a Nigerian citizen in Malaysia in two months, following the sentencing of another student, also for meth trafficking.     Sandwiched between these headline cases was a more minor crime story -- but still a revealing one. A 46-year-old Malaysian schoolteacher, who had ''met'' a man on Facebook and fallen in love, agreed to loan him the huge sum of $31,000. When she finally met him in person, the man, whom she'd thought was Caucasian, turned out to be Nigerian. He offered to repay the debt -- but the bank notes he gave her were counterfeit.   The publicity over such high-profile criminal cases involving Africans (mostly Nigerians) has helped inflame widespread prejudices in a country that until recent years had had little contact with Africans.   According to the most recent available figures, 79,352 African citizens entered the country in 2013; and in 2012, 25,467 student visas were issued to Africans. Many, like those on a student exchange plan at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, sponsored by Kano State in Nigeria, are drawn by Malaysia's fast-growing, well-equipped higher education institutes, which offer the chance of better employment both in Malaysia and back home.   For many African Muslim students, Malaysia also offers the chance to practice their faith in a modern, cosmopolitan environment. One young Nigerian couple I chatted with at the airport last year explained how their master's degrees in engineering from Malaysia had led to employment with a respected company in Lagos, and they now traveled frequently for work.   Given Malaysia's efforts to transform itself into an educational hub open to foreign labor and talent, these kinds of stories should be news, but they aren't. Instead, a narrative of cooperation between Malaysia and African countries has increasingly morphed in the popular imagination into nightmarish scenes involving African criminality.   Malaysia's modern infrastructure, efficient banking system and reliable Internet connectivity have, according to a Reuters report, made it an ''epicenter'' of online schemes -- with Nigerians in particular said to be using Malaysia as an operating base. American women have been a major target of these frauds, with the United States Embassy in Kuala Lumpur reporting in 2014 that Internet fraud made up 80 percent of inquiries to duty officers, with a dozen new cases every week.   The tricksters use persuasive stories -- posing, for example, as an American Christian stuck in a Muslim-majority country who needs cash to get home. American officials report more than 600 cases a year, with most victims losing, on average, sums ''in the tens of thousands''; two women each lost more than $250,000.   These con men, like many of the convicted drug mules and dealers, have often entered the country on student visas, which are easy to obtain and rarely attract follow-up checks. As a result, local prejudice is running high against Africans generally.   Malaysians rarely bother to make distinctions between Nigerians and Ghanaians, Kenyans and Tanzanians. The press, politicians and the public refer to them as ''Awang Hitam''; the rough translation ''black guy'' fails to convey the expression's pejorative edge.   Recently, an upscale condominium development in Petaling Jaya, a city near Kuala Lumpur, tried to ban Africans from renting apartments within the complex. After negative publicity, the developers backed down, but it is an index of how intense the loathing has become in some quarters.   The increasingly entrenched nature of anti-African sentiment was encapsulated in last year's widely read editorial in one of the country's most influential Malay-language dailies, Utusan Malaysia. Titled ''Malaysia Can Do Without 'Pak Hitam''' (a variation of ''Awang Hitam''), it summed up a prevailing view of Africans in Malaysia: that all the stories were the same, and all the stories were bad. It went on to list the social problems caused by Africans, from serious crimes like drug trafficking and online fraud to gathering in large groups and ''colonizing residential areas.''   It is in this last grievance that a clash of cultures becomes clear: Africans are accused of rowdiness, drunkenness and harassing local girls -- all of which represents the antithesis of the behavior expected in a conservative Asian country. Afraid to challenge these African immigrants because of their physical size, large numbers and ''coarse character'' -- according to the editorial -- Malaysians watched as their neighborhoods were overrun by ''Pak Hitam.''   Many Malaysians argue that the sheer number of offenses committed by Nigerians and other Africans justifies their jaundiced blanket view -- though actual figures are hard to come by. According to a Nigeria-based nonprofit organization, the Legal Defense and Assistance Project, there are 132 Nigerians serving sentences in prison in Malaysia, with several on death row -- but the project was able to gather data from only two of the country's seven maximum-security prisons.   Whether or not there is a crime wave caused by Africans, many Malaysians definitely have a perception that one is happening. And this is feeding deep-rooted prejudice. I once witnessed a  local woman on a train holding her nose when sitting next to a passenger of  African appearance.   With Malaysian companies like the industrial multinational Sime Darby starting to invest heavily in the growing economies of Africa, and Malaysian universities continuing their drive for fee-paying foreign students, the flow of people between Malaysia and Africa seems unlikely to abate. And neither, anytime soon, does the climate of xenophobia.    Tash Aw is the author of three novels, including, most recently, ''Five Star Billionaire.''     "
Judge Grants Steep Bail to Ex-Money Manager Accused in Trading Case,"A Pennsylvania man accused of being the biggest beneficiary of a brazen scheme that blended sophisticated computer hacking with old-school insider trading may be getting out of jail, more than two weeks after he and four other men were arrested by federal authorities. But Vitaly Korchevsky's freedom will not come cheap: A federal judge in Brooklyn ordered him to post $2 million in a bond secured to property and $200,000 in cash, and to be placed under home detention, with certain exceptions. Mr. Korchevsky was also required to hand over his passport, as were his wife and two children, who sat behind him during a nearly one-hour hearing on Wednesday.     Prosecutors argued that Mr. Korchevsky, 50, a United States citizen who was born in the former Soviet Union, was a rogue trader who posed a substantial flight risk. His lawyer, Steven Brill, countered that his client had lived for decades in the United States and was a trustworthy member of the community and a man of God.   In the end, Judge Raymond J. Dearie of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York decided that although he had reservations about releasing Mr. Korchevsky, he was unlikely to flee, given that his immediate family lived in the United States and that he had strong ties to his community, where he served as a senior pastor at the Slavic Evangelical Baptist Church outside Philadelphia.   Mr. Korchevsky's release with strict conditions set for his bail would be sufficient, ''given the faith that hundreds of people have put in him that he would be violating,'' Judge Dearie said.   At the end of the hearing, the judge again referred to Mr. Korchevsky's supporters, saying, ''If you don't play ball, you're going to disappoint an awful lot of people.''   Mr. Korchevsky, a former Morgan Stanley mutual fund manager and a hedge fund manager, was arrested this month at his home in Glen Mills, Pa. Prosecutors contend that he was connected to a sophisticated, multiyear insider trading scheme in which a large circle of traders and hackers reaped more than $100 million in illegal proceeds. He personally reaped $17 million in illegal profits from the scheme, according to prosecutors.   As Judge Dearie spoke, 80 people sat listening in the Brooklyn courtroom and in an overflow room nearby, most of them members of the community where Mr. Korchevsky is a pastor. One man showed up at the Brooklyn courthouse early in the morning with his suitcase, having just arrived from Spokane, Wash., Mr. Brill told the court.   Mr. Korchevsky turned and waved to the audience when he walked into the courtroom and again when he left. During the hearing, his wife, Svetlana, and their two children, 13 and 8, looked on quietly.   In an effort to highlight Mr. Korchevsky's ''exceptional ties'' to his community, Mr. Brill said the support for his client kept ''rolling in'' from places like Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.   The prosecutors had asked the court to continue to deny bail to Mr. Korchevsky and two other men, citing fears that they posed ''substantial flight risks'' because of their longstanding ties to Ukraine, a country with no extradition treaty with the United States. Mr. Korchevsky bought his home in Glen Mills in 2002 for $600,000, property records show.   Some confusion exists about Mr. Korchevsky's place of birth. Prosecutors, in court filings, have said he was born in Ukraine and has strong family ties there. After the hearing, Mr. Brill said his client lived in Kazakhstan for the first 12 years of his life and later in Ukraine before coming to the United States.   Federal prosecutors in New Jersey are similarly trying to keep at least one other man charged in the case, Arkadiy Dubovoy, in jail pending trial. Separately, Mr. Dubovoy, 51, who authorities said made more than $11 million from the scheme, appeared on Wednesday afternoon before a magistrate judge in Newark, and will remain in custody pending his bail hearing next Wednesday.   Mr. Dubovoy, who had been held in a county jail near Atlanta since his arrest, was flown by the United States Marshals Service to a county jail in New Jersey on Tuesday and will remain there until his bail hearing. Mr. Dubovoy's attorney, Michael J. Diamondstein, was not available for comment.   Prosecutors in court filings said Mr. Dubovoy is believed to own real property in the United States worth $22 million.   The detention status of two other defendants who were also arrested and are facing trial in Brooklyn, Leonid Momotok, 47, and Aleksandr Garkusha, 47, is pending. Judge Dearie has ordered a hearing on whether they should be released on bail as well. The men are being detained in Georgia and are waiting to be moved to New York, Nellin N. McIntosh, a government spokeswoman, said.   The request by the federal prosecutors to deny bail is somewhat unusual for a white-collar crime. None of the defendants have been accused of engaging in violent behavior, and three of them are United States citizens. But authorities contend that the unusual step is warranted, given the ability of all the men to flee the country.   There are indications that the defendants will eventually be granted bail, but that the terms will be steep. Mr. Dubovoy's son, Igor, 28, who was also arrested and charged, has yet to post the $3 million bond a federal judge set for his release.   When Judge Dearie questioned Mr. Korchevsky's religious fervor on Wednesday, Mr. Brill recounted a story Mr. Korchevsky told him about his experience while living in Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union, when the Communist regime would confiscate religious texts.   Mr. Korchevsky drove around with a car full of Bibles, Mr. Brill said, and he was once stopped by the Soviet secret police, the K.G.B., and beaten for possessing them.    "
Marco Rubio Urges a More Aggressive Approach Toward China,"Senator Marco Rubio of Florida issued a sharp critique of China's behavior on Friday, using a speech in South Carolina and an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal to fault Beijing on such issues as military expansionism, cybertheft, human rights abuses and ""economic misconduct."" Mr. Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, also accused President Obama of continuing ""to appease China's leaders"" despite their misbehavior, assertions that came as the president's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, was meeting with China's president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing to lay the groundwork for Mr. Xi's state visit to Washington next month.  ""President Obama has continued to appease China's leaders despite their mounting aggression,"" Mr. Rubio wrote in Journal piece. ""In addition to his insufficient responses to economic and national security concerns, he has ignored the Chinese government's mass roundups of human-rights advocates, oppression of religious minorities, detention of political dissidents, ever-tightening controls on the Internet and numerous other human-rights violations. He has hoped that being more friendly with China will make it more responsible. It hasn't worked."" While one of Mr. Rubio's campaign rivals, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, has called on Mr. Obama to cancel Mr. Xi's state visit, Mr. Rubio did not go that far, instead suggesting that the event be ""downgraded to a working visit from a state visit."" ""This is an opportunity to speak bluntly to this authoritarian ruler and achieve meaningful progress, not to treat him to a state dinner, Mr. Rubio said in the op-ed piece. Speaking in Nirth Charleston, S.C., Mr. Rubio pressed his case by highlighting China's territorial aggression, ""economic misconduct"" and human rights. He said that under Mr. Xi, ""China has intensified its campaign to push America out of Asia."" And that if he is elected president, ""instead of inviting China to military exercises, we will conduct joint freedom of navigation patrols with our partners in East and Southeast Asia to challenge any attempts to close off international waters or airspace."" In fact, the United States already conducts such military exercises with allies like Japan,South Korea and the Philippines, and has challenged Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea. Mr. Rubio also said that he would confront China's economic misconduct, but again highlighted an approach similar to the one taken by Mr. Obama by pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. ""As president, I would respond to China's economic misconduct not through aggressive retaliation, which would hurt us as much as them, but by reinforcing our insistence on free markets and free trade,"" he said in his remarks, according to a transcript of his speech. ""This means immediately moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements that strengthen strategic ties with our partners in Asia."" And as he has done in the past, Mr. Rubio pressed Beijing on the issue of human rights, promising action against Chinese officials believed to be tied to such abuses. ""When I am president, Beijing will not receive a free pass on human rights,"" the senator said. ""I will instruct all U.S. officials meeting with their Chinese counterparts to list political prisoners by name and press for their unconditional release. I will impose visa bans and asset freezes on Chinese officials who violate human rights. I will do all I can to empower Chinese citizens to breach what has been called the Great Firewall of China, and gain access to news and information online about their country and the world.""

Briton Who Recruited Online for ISIS Is Reported Killed,"LONDON --  A 21-year-old hacker from Birmingham, England, who tapped into American military networks and was a central figure in the Islamic State militant group's online recruitment campaign, has been killed in Syria by an American airstrike, according to three senior American officials. The hacker, Junaid Hussain, was a leading member of the CyberCaliphate, an Islamic State unit that broke into the United States Central Military Command's Twitter and YouTube accounts this year. He was considered to be the second-most prominent British member of the Islamic State, after Mohammed Emwazi, a fighter often referred to as ''Jihadi John'' because of his role in the videotaped killings of Western hostages.     The American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential intelligence reports, said Mr. Hussain had been killed Tuesday in an airstrike outside Raqqa, Syria.   Last week,  the White House announced that another prominent Islamic State figure -- Fadhil Ahmad al-Hayali, a deputy to the group's leader -- had been killed in an airstrike in northern Iraq.   The news of Mr. Hussain's death comes as the Obama administration is debating the effectiveness of the American-led military coalition's campaign against the Islamic State. The Defense Department's inspector general is looking into whether military officials have skewed intelligence assessments to present a more optimistic picture.   Mr. Hussain's unit has been credited with the Islamic State's adept manipulation of social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda, and his online activity was increasingly linked to plots carried out far from the battlefields in Syria and Iraq, experts said.   Mr. Hussain, who was believed to use the nom de guerre Abu Hussain al-Britani, offered encouragement on Twitter to the two gunmen who staged a shooting attack in Garland, Tex., in May, at a contest for caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. After the shooting, Mr. Hussain wrote: ''Allahu Akbar!!!!! 2 of our brothers just opened fire ... ''   He also used social media to threaten to raise the black Islamic State flag over ''10 Downing Street and the White House,'' referring to the official residence of the British prime minister.   In June, Mr. Hussain was linked to an Islamic State plot to attack an Armed Forces Day parade in South London using a bomb rigged in a pressure cooker, similar to the one used in the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013. The plot was thwarted after Mr. Hussain unwittingly revealed details to an undercover reporter from The Sun, a British tabloid, who was posing as a potential recruit.   Mr. Hussain was prosecuted for hacking in Britain in 2012, and was convicted on charges that he illegally gained access to former Prime Minister Tony Blair's address book the year before. He spent six months in prison. Afterward he was arrested again, on a charge of violent disorder, and while free on bail in 2013 he moved to Syria.   He was joined there by his wife, Sally Jones, 45, a former punk rock musician from southeastern England who met Mr. Hussain online.   Mr. Hussain took his hacking skills to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. He helped instigate online attacks, posted information about American military forces and officers, and acted as a cheerleader for other fighters in the group, said Raffaello Pantucci of the Royal United Services Institute in London, a research organization specializing in defense and security.   Mr. Hussain's activity ''was an irritant that had developed a worrying edge, as he was linked increasingly to plots being instigated from the battlefield,'' Mr. Pantucci said.   ''Undoubtedly his online skills will be missed by the group,'' he said, ''but it is unlikely to dramatically change the pattern of dangerous plots emanating from the group, or the phenomenon of some young Westerners being drawn to fight alongside the group.''   British and American officials met several months ago and decided that Mr. Hussain and other prominent Britons in the Islamic State group should be hunted down and either killed or captured, one of the senior United States officials said. The two countries collaborated in tracking Mr. Hussain and in gathering evidence to use in prosecuting him if he were to be taken alive.   Asked about the reports of Mr. Hussain's death, a spokeswoman for the British Home Office would say only that the British government was aware of them.   ''We have consistently warned people against going to fight for ISIL in Syria or Iraq,'' she said. ''ISIL has declared itself an enemy of the U.K., and those who have chosen to fight with ISIL and subscribe to their barbaric ideology will continue be subject to coalition action to stop them killing indiscriminately, committing barbaric acts and planning terrorist acts.''

Daily Report: Uber Adds Carpooling Service in China,"In Seattle, President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday addressed wary American business executiveswho are worried about market barriers, cybertheft and tough security measures imposed on foreign companies. But back in China, an American company is breaking down its own market barriers.  Uber, the San Francisco ride-hailing company, said it was starting a new carpooling service in Chengdu, China, on Wednesday morning. Called UberCommute, the service gives Chinese car owners who drive long distances the option of picking up passengers heading in the same direction. The driver and rider share the cost of the trip, which means the driver ends up saving money. Uber plans to eventually expand the service to other cities, but it seems to make sense to start in a major Chinese city where gridlock is common. It competes with a similar service from Didi Kuaidi, China's dominant ride-hailing start-up, which recently began offering a carpooling service aimed at commuters.  But for the rest of the tech industry in the United States, all eyes will be on Seattle on Wednesday. China's Internet czar, Lu Wei, is expected to hold an Internet forum attended by several top American technology companies, such as Apple, IBM and Uber. "
Daily Report: Fear and Loathing in the Tech Industry,"There are two emotional threads in tech news these days: The public's loathing of pretentious tech start-ups and the fear of hackers. Let's start with the loathing.  Leap Transit's tricked-out buses might have made sense ferrying high rollers around the Las Vegas Strip, but as a daily commuter bus in San Francisco they appear to have been a hapless overreach. What Leap, the defunct high-end transit service, intended to do made sense: Cater to customers frustrated by overcrowding on popular transit lines traveled by the city's Muni buses. But where Leap appears to have gone off the rails is an assumption that customers weren't just frustrated by local buses, they ached for something fancier, and were willing to pay $6, or about triple a public bus ride, to get it. The result: Swanky buses with organic snacks and drinks, plush seats, and - in keeping with fashion - distressed wood paneling. In short, décor that looked more like the lobby of Twitter than a bus. It didn't work. The company had brushes with regulators and slow customer adoption. What's more, this start-up lobby on wheels quickly came to represent the well-heeled tech industry's disconnect from the rest of San Francisco. Interestingly, privately owned mass transit is something of a San Francisco tradition, as thisstory in the local news website MissionLocalexplains. Even as late as the 1970s, jitneys, as they were called, were ferrying up to 7,000 people to and from downtown. But there was one big difference: While Leap was targeting the moneyed set, the jitneys of old were mostly a working-class affair. Passengers usually spent 10 cents a ride. By comparison, Muni's adult fare was 25 cents andjumped to 50 cents in 1980. At a recent auction, Leap's two buses fetched $11,100 and $12,100. The buyers were anonymous. But don't be shocked if they show up as moving art installations at next year's Burning Man event in Nevada. Now for the fear: If 2014 was the year of the hacker, an optimist would say 2015 is the year companies are going to the root of the problem: Programming mistakes. A number of big tech outfits like Google and Facebook as well as start-ups and industry groups have begun significant efforts to root out programming mistakes, bugs, and other errors made in the industry's endless pursuit of improved technology. Will they work? No doubt, there are still major weaknesses in critical infrastructure, and new technologies like the computerization of cars comes with risk. But in recognizing that hackers thrive on the imperfect work of people inside the industry, tech may finally be plugging the gaps that let the bad guys inside. "
Nothing Classified or Hip About C.I.A. Director's Email,"WASHINGTON --  For John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A., perhaps the worst part of the attack on his private email account was the revelation that until very recently, he used an AOL account. In a digital world dominated by Gmail, Mr. Brennan's selection of email providers perhaps did not convey the image of an intelligence director on the cutting edge of communications technology. But the good news for Mr. Brennan is that so far, no classified information appears to have been revealed.    The few documents that have surfaced include a spreadsheet of a guest list, including the names of some government employees and their Social Security numbers who appeared to be on an access list, for an event in a government building.    Nonetheless, the F.B.I. has opened an investigation into the claims of a hacker, who approached The New York Post with news of his success and the assertion that he was acting on behalf of Palestinians. He contended that he had also downloaded Mr. Brennan's disclosure forms for a security clearance, and had carried out a similar hacking of an email account belonging to Jeh Johnson, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency charged with day-to-day protection of the domestic Internet infrastructure.   But Mr. Johnson did not actively use the account, officials said, and it may have been given to him as part of a Comcast cable package.   Senior government officials said that the hacking was more embarrassing than damaging, and that it was far less serious than an incursion at the Office of Personnel Management, which says it lost security clearance dossiers for about 22 million Americans, including the fingerprints of 5.6 million.   That intrusion is widely believed to have been executed by Chinese hackers, probably working for the Beijing government. The director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., refuses to call it an attack because it involved espionage rather than the destruction of data.   By that standard, the theft from Mr. Brennan's personal account would also not constitute an ''attack.'' Instead, it was more like vandalism, executed by an occasionally foul-mouthed user of Twitter, where the hacker has posted taunts and occasional screen shots of documents. Most of the documents were old, dating to the days when Mr. Brennan, a former C.I.A. station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was President Obama's top counterterrorism official.   One of those documents suggests that the hacker last had access to Mr. Brennan's account on Oct. 12, at which point the account appears to have been closed.   The chances of finding the offender and any accomplices seem high. Two Twitter handles associated with the intrusions went dead over the past 24 hours. Twitter will probably receive an order to turn over the Internet protocol addresses from which the hacker was working. Unlike Russian and Chinese hackers, this cyberthief was clearly looking for publicity.   For the federal government, which has been urging people to practice good ''cyberhygiene,'' Mr. Brennan's troubles could have been a teachable moment. Many federal agencies urge citizens to change their passwords regularly and use ''two-factor authentication,'' which requires a code to be sent to a cellphone or another email address before an account can be used remotely.   But the C.I.A. decided otherwise. It did not deny the reports, but it shed no light on how the hacking had happened. ''We are aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities,'' a C.I.A. spokesman said.   Accounts in The New York Post and Wired magazine suggested that the hacker, who said he was protesting American policy and encouraging support for the Palestinians, did not appear to have broken any passwords or codes. Instead, he apparently impersonated a Verizon employee and fooled the company's technical support personnel, using some information about Mr. Brennan to get them to reveal his password and other account information.   That led the hacker to emails that Mr. Brennan had apparently forwarded from his White House account to his personal account.   Mr. Brennan can take heart from one fact: If the hacker got hold of his detailed security-clearance filing, which would date back to 2009, it is probably not the only copy around. The Chinese are believed to have one from the Office of Personnel Management.    "
University of Chicago Cancels Classes After Online Threat,"The University of Chicago canceled all classes and activities on its main campus Monday because of a specific anonymous threat of gun violence, the university said in a statement Sunday night.  Robert Zimmer, the university president, said that F.B.I. counterterrorism officials had contacted the university on Sunday to warn that ''an unknown individual'' had posted a message online that threatened an armed attack on the main campus quad at 10 a.m. Monday.    Mr. Zimmer said he decided to cancel classes ''based on the F.B.I.'s assessment of this threat and recent tragic events at other campuses across the country.'' He added that the decision had been made ''in consultation with federal and local law enforcement officials.''   Law enforcement officials said that investigators from the F.B.I. were attempting to identify the person who made the threat.   Students, nonmedical faculty and the university's nonessential staff members were urged to stay away from the main campus in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago on Monday. Students who live in university housing were told to remain in their dormitories.   The university canceled events at a number of other facilities on Monday, as well, including the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, the University of Chicago Charter School campuses and the university's libraries.

"China Says Hacking of U.S. Workers' Data Was Common Crime, Not State Act","HONG KONG --  China has acknowledged for the first time that the breach of the United States Office of Personnel Management's computer systems, which the Obama administration said exposed the personal information of more than 21.5 million people, was the work of Chinese hackers. But China insisted that the breach was the result of criminal activity, not a state-sponsored cyberattack. The assertion came in one paragraph midway through an article published Tuesday by Xinhua, the state-run news agency, about a meeting in Washington between top Chinese and American law enforcement officials, and it raised more questions than it answered.     The session was the first since President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China announced a set of vague rules of the road about what kind of hacking is impermissible. The two countries have promised to work toward a more comprehensive understanding.   The report did not say whether the Chinese authorities had identified anyone suspected of carrying out the immense breach of security, which was revealed this year.   The theft, which was extraordinarily sophisticated and continued for more than a year before it was detected, involved the security-clearance forms of millions of federal employees, veterans, contractors and others. The forms include information about health, finances and other personal matters for 19.7 million people who underwent government background checks in the past 15 years, as well as 1.8 million other people, including spouses and friends, according to the Obama administration. Five million of the stolen records included fingerprints.   ''Through investigation, the case turned out to be a criminal case, rather than a state-sponsored cyberattack as the U.S. side has previously suspected,'' Xinhua reported.   It said the issue was discussed in a meeting between Guo Shengkun, China's minister of public security, and United States officials, including Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, and Loretta E. Lynch, the attorney general.   American officials are likely to be dubious about the Chinese contention. The director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, told Congress in September that there was no evidence that the exposed Social Security numbers or other financial information had been used for fraud. Criminal hackers do not usually sit on the material they steal, because financial data can have a short life span.   Moreover, investigators have said that the sophistication and length of the attack had the hallmarks of a state-sponsored operation. So did the targets of the attack, because the security information could be used to build a database of federal employees, including many working in the White House, the State Department and the military.   For years, analysts and security researchers have said that some of the most sophisticated cyberattacks against targets in the United States are orchestrated outside the People's Liberation Army, by Chinese hackers under contract at universities and technology companies. Though their targets -- government agencies and Chinese activists -- point to an intelligence goal, the exact nature of the relationship between private hackers and the state is not clear.   In 2009, computer security experts traced several attacks on American companies back to a university, which receives funding from a high-level Chinese state science and technology program called the 863 Program. Several Jiaotong University researchers have also been tied to a Chinese hacking group that brought down a White House website in 2001.   In 2010, a different group of contracted hackers was blamed for a sophisticated attack on Google and dozens of other American technology companies. That year, Chinese hackers broke into the Gmail accounts of Chinese activists and stole intellectual property from Google. The group was never tied to a faction of the Chinese military, but rather to a private group of Chinese hackers, according to intelligence analysts who investigated the case but were not authorized to speak about the findings.   The same group was later blamed for a 2011 attack at RSA Security, an American company that makes security products for government agencies and military contractors. The group's hackers used the information they gleaned from RSA to break into the computer systems of Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contractor.   And in 2012, security researchers traced widespread attacks on companies in Asia and Tibetan activists to a former graduate student at Sichuan University who later took a job at Tencent, the Chinese Internet company.

Daily Report: The Internet Is Full of Mean People,"That the Internet is full of terrible things is not exactly a revelation, but a point worth noting. Terrorist recruiting, flame wars, trolls, hackers and depictions of deviant behavior. You want it? It's out there.So when presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton - in their respectively typical over-the-top and triangulated ways - suggested cutting off the Internet or at least parts of it, it did not seem like a completely irrational point.   Certainly, technologists scoffed. After all, the Internet was designed as a fail-safe computer network that can't just be shut down. But the average person, perhaps, thought there is lots of crummy stuff out there that we could do without. And that is entirely true. But in the interest of balance, given all this criticism the Internet has faced lately, let's list a few great (or at least harmless) things about the global network: Finding great radio stations in cities far away from where you live; cat videos (dog videos, too); not staying up late to see the one good Saturday Night Live skit; staying in touch with family and friends around the world; great recipes. None of that, of course, even touches on the change-the-world technologies in medicine, commerce, communications, artificial intelligence, education and any number of fields that wouldn't exist without the Internet. So, Internet, you've got an ugly streak for sure. But maybe you're getting a bum rap. "
World Briefing | Asia; Japan: Activist Hackers Claim Attack,"TOKYO -- The Japanese authorities said they were investigating whether the hacking group Anonymous was behind a computer attack that shut down Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's personal website on Thursday.  A person claiming to be part of the group of activist hackers claimed responsibility for disrupting access to the site, saying in a message posted on Twitter that the attack was carried out in retaliation for Japan's resumption of whale hunting in the Antarctic.    Hackers linked to Anonymous have targeted websites related to whale and dolphin hunting before. The group claimed responsibility last month for the shutdown of several government sites in Iceland, another nation that practices whaling.   Two Japanese whaling ships departed for the Antarctic last week, drawing condemnation from anti-whaling groups as well as governments that oppose the practice, including those of Australia, New Zealand and the United States.   Japan joined an international moratorium on commercial whaling three decades ago, but it continues to hunt whales under an exemption for scientific research. It reduced its program this year after a United Nations court ruled in 2014 that previous hunts had yielded little of scientific value, despite having killed close to 1,000 whales a year.   Japan's goal for this year's hunt is a little over 300 minke whales, but critics say that is still too many. The data that Japan says it is seeking -- on the whales' migratory patterns and reproductive habits, among other information -- could be obtained by nonlethal means, they argue.   Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe's primary spokesman, said the police were investigating the hacking. ''We have not determined for certain that it was an attack by Anonymous, but we have received reports that they claimed responsibility,'' he said at a daily news briefing.

U.S. Says Hacker Stole IDs and Scripts From Celebrities,"An email popped into the inbox of a famous radio host this month, sent by a young man from the Bahamas, with an offer he hoped would turn the head of even an industry veteran: scripts for the first six episodes of a coming season of a hit television drama, the last of which was currently being filmed. Prices were discussed. A video chat was arranged with an interested buyer. The man, Alonzo Knowles, 23, sent a few pages from the drama script and the script for an unreleased comedy film, but he promised a cache of even rarer entertainment industry loot, according to a federal criminal complaint.     Among the items he offered to sell were scripts for three comedy films, a hip-hop biopic and another television show; Social Security numbers for actors and professional athletes; and, according to the complaint, sex tapes of celebrities, including one Mr. Knowles later passed along that had been emailed from a television host and columnist to another radio host.   ''This is just a sample of things I can get,'' Mr. Knowles wrote when he sent a sex tape to the potential buyer, who was in fact an undercover investigator. ''I have more stuff along these lines and can get more if you're interested.''   On Tuesday, federal prosecutors charged Mr. Knowles with felony criminal copyright infringement and identity theft in a scheme that they say pried open the email accounts of a host of celebrities. In the process, the complaint charges, he gained access to a trove of highly guarded entertainment industry secrets sure to rattle the 130 celebrities whose email addresses and phone numbers he had, and many others.   The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said in a statement: ''This case has all of the elements of the kind of blockbuster script the defendant, Alonzo Knowles, is alleged to have stolen: hacks into celebrities' private emails, identity theft, and attempts to sell victims' information to the highest bidder. Unfortunately, these circumstances are all too real.''   The scheme was simple, but clever. The complaint describes the ease with which Mr. Knowles hacked into celebrities' email accounts, accumulating unreleased scripts, sexually explicit images and videos, and personal identification information.    Coming about a year after confidential information from Sony Pictures Entertainment was stolen and released online, the charges were sure to renew concerns about email security in the entertainment industry.   Mr. Knowles, who went by the name Jeff Moxey on email, acknowledged to an undercover investigator that it was difficult to hack someone directly when he is ''going after a high-profile celebrity,'' according to the complaint. So instead, he looked through photos for friends of the celebrity, and then hacked the friends' accounts in order to find the celebrity's personal information.   Then he sent celebrities a fake text message that made it seem as though their account had been hacked, and some wrote back with their password, the complaint said. If he had ''access to their computer,'' he told the undercover investigator, he simply sent them a virus and infiltrated their computer.   He found a trove of ''exclusive content'' that he claimed was ''really profitable'' and worth ''hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' the complaint said. He first offered it to the radio host over email, suggesting that the host turn the scripts of the television drama into a book and make $2 million off the sales.   Mr. Knowles obtained 30 unreleased tracks off a future album of ''a very popular A-list celebrity,'' he told the undercover investigator.    He also gained access to sexually explicit images and a video from the email inbox of another radio host, which had been sent to that person from a television host and columnist, the complaint said.   None of the victims were named in the complaint.   The scheme began to unravel when the radio host, to whom Mr. Knowles reached out as a potential buyer, contacted the executive producer of the drama series whose scripts Mr. Knowles had stolen, according to the complaint. Representatives of the network then reached out to Department of Homeland Security investigators, who had the radio host arrange a call between Mr. Knowles and the undercover agent.   On Monday, the complaint says, Mr. Knowles tried to sell the agent 15 scripts for $80,000, and also provided the Social Security numbers of three professional athletes and a movie actress.   He appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon and was ordered detained. His lawyer, Clay Kaminsky, declined to comment on the charges, each of which carries a maximum possible penalty of five years in prison.

Blackphone Announces New Privacy-Oriented Phone and Tablet,"BARCELONA, Spain - The phone maker Blackphone and the security communications company Silent Circle, whose partnership created the first privacy-oriented smartphone, announced two new devices at Mobile World Congress here on Monday, along with a suite of software and services designed to lock down both private and work communications.  The Blackphone 2 is scheduled to be released in July and will, like its predecessor, cost just over $600. The company said the phone would offer faster performance, longer battery life and will be easier for company I.T. managers to configure. A tablet called the Blackphone+ will be released in the fall at a yet-to-be specified price. The company strongly positioned both devices for the enterprise: phones and tablets designed to be used at work. Jon Callas, a Blackphone co-founder, showed off an intriguing new feature of the Blackphone's operating system called Spaces, which gives users the ability to cluster apps with different functions into groups separated from one another. For example, Mr. Callas said, a user could create one space solely for private communications, which could hold the phone's built-in apps for encrypted calling and texting. Another space could hold work apps or even just different versions of apps, like a Twitter app that's always logged in to the user's work account. A personal space could hold personal email, as well as apps that are logged in to personal accounts, games and more. Mr. Callas said it would be simple to create and delete these spaces as a person needs them, and said spaces let company I.T. managers configure phones where work apps are clearly segregated from personal data. ""Our theme is privacy, security and control,"" Mr. Callas said. Appealing to the enterprise is a common theme at Mobile World Congress. For example, Samsung was also touting its Knox security platform, which comes on its new Galaxy S 6 phones, as a way to separate work apps into a separate, secure container - although no doubt the Blackphone team would take issue with its definition of ""secure."" Blackphone executives said a software update would be released next week that would add Spaces and other new functionality to its existing phones. Blackphone and Silent Circle also announced new services, including an online store for finding privacy-oriented apps, and an encrypted calling plan that would people make secure calls to any user on any device. And it showed off a secure conference-call program, Silent Meeting, designed for use on tablets, that encrypts the voice data in a conference call and securely identifies who is participating. Phil Zimmermann, the renowned security expert and creator of the Pretty Good Privacy encryption standard for email, said the only way to ensure the best possible security on a device was to create the device itself. ""If a computer is compromised by malware, no matter how good your crypto is, keys can be exfiltrated by malware,"" he said. ""Now we're trying to address the question: How can you be sure your software is secure when the platform it's running on can be compromised? The only way to try to address that is to build your own platform, your own hardware, your own kernel - everything."" ""It's an arms race,"" said Mr. Zimmermann, acknowledging that no platform can be completely secure. ""We're happy to participate in that arms race."" "
Wrong Responses to Charlie Hebdo,"Leaders in Europe are justifiably trying to figure out what they should be doing to prevent terrorist attacks like the recent massacre at the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Regrettably, some politicians are proposing the kind of Internet censorship and surveillance that would do little to protect their citizens but do a lot to infringe on civil liberties. In Paris, a dozen interior ministers from European Union countries including France, Britain and Germany issued a statement earlier this week calling on Internet service providers to identify and take down online content ''that aims to incite hatred and terror.'' The ministers also want the European Union to start monitoring and storing information about the itineraries of air travelers. And in Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron suggested the country should ban Internet services that did not give the government the ability to monitor all encrypted chats and calls.  Even before the Charlie Hebdo attack, European leaders were proposing or enacting harsh measures. For example, the French Parliament passed a law in September that allows the authorities to temporarily seize the passports and identity cards of citizens who seem intent on joining foreign terrorist organizations. And this week, French officials said they had arrested 54 people for hate speech, including a controversial comedian. Appealing as these measures may sound in the aftermath of a tragedy, they are deeply flawed. Countries like France and Germany have long had stricter controls on speech than the United States. For example, their governments have in the past forced Internet firms like Yahoo and Twitter to take down Nazi propaganda. But those decisions are generally made by government officials or judges, not technology companies. Internet service providers do not have the staff or the skill to determine what content is likely to lead to terrorist attacks. That is why a blanket mandate to censor terrorism-related information could force these businesses to err on the side of caution and take down information that might be offensive but would not lead to an imminent attack. In fact, an Internet service provider might well have taken down satirical cartoons of the kind Charlie Hebdo published. Besides, even if Internet companies blocked videos and other propaganda produced by terrorist groups from their networks, that action would not necessarily prevent Europeans from finding that information. Terrorist sympathizers could access the banned content relatively easily by using virtual private networks or proxy servers that allow users in one country to pretend they are in a different country, like the United States, where free speech laws are much stronger. Some Europeans are already using such tools to access American services, like Netflix, that are not yet available in their countries. Mr. Cameron's proposal raises another set of problems. In a speech earlier this week, he said he wanted companies like WhatsApp and Snapchat to create back doors in their services that would allow intelligence services to monitor conversations between users. If the companies refused to comply, he said, they should not be allowed to operate in Britain. Such an approach might seem reasonable to some -- after all, the police can wiretap a landline phone, so why not a messaging service? But technology and privacy advocates say it is dangerous to require technology companies to build such surveillance mechanisms into communications services because hackers and criminals will inevitably find ways to use those back doors to steal information from individuals, corporations and governments. Mr. Cameron's proposal would make the Internet less secure without necessarily hampering terrorists. People who are determined to communicate with each other in secret can download encryption software from the Internet and send messages through systems like Tor that obscure their identities and locations. Of course, governments can and should take steps to identify threats and prevent terrorist attacks through targeted intelligence gathering. But there is good reason to believe that widespread censorship and intrusive surveillance will only undermine personal freedoms and could even make us less secure. "
Importing Images to iPhoto," Q. I recently scanned a bunch of old pictures and have them in a folder. How do I get them into iPhoto?    A. You can import a batch of pictures into the Mac's iPhoto library from a folder on the hard disk (or other locations) in several ways. For one, open iPhoto, go to the File menu and choose Import to Library. When the Import Photos box opens, navigate to the location of the folder, select it and click the Import button.   For a more direct approach, you can also add the scanned pictures to your image library by dragging the folder from the desktop (or wherever you have it) into the open iPhoto window. Dragging the folder and dropping it on the iPhoto icon on the Mac's Dock is another method for importing the pictures.    According to statements Apple made to several technology publications, iPhoto will be replaced this year with a new Photos for OS X program. The company has said that iPhoto users can update their image libraries to the new Photos program and preserve the existing albums, keywords and captions used to organize pictures in iPhoto.   Surfing Securely on a Smartphone   Q. I get nervous when using public Wi-Fi hot spots on my phone. What's involved with using a virtual private network on a mobile device?   A. Most major smartphone platforms, including Android, iOS and Windows Phone, support virtual private network connections that create an encrypted tunnel between your device and a private network when you are using a public hot spot or other open network. If you are doing work on your phone while traveling, your company may have its own V.P.N. that you can use on the road. If so, check with the technical support department to see if it can set you up.   If you do not have a corporate V.P.N., you can use one of the many commercial V.P.N. services available; check your app store for options. TunnelBear and HotSpot Shield are two popular services with Android and iOS apps, as is F-Secure's Freedome app.   You typically need to download the app, let it configure the proper V.P.N. settings on your phone and turn it on when you need it. Some services charge a monthly or annual fee for use, while some offer a free amount of data along with advertisements.   TIP OF THE WEEK Running out of battery juice is a nagging fear of many a smartphone user, but your gadget may have built-in tools to help you squeeze out some extra time. Google recently added a new Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0 Lollipop that claims to add an additional 90 minutes of life between charges by temporarily putting a stop to mail and message syncing, vibrating alerts and other power-draining activities.   To use it, open the Settings icon from the apps screen, select Battery and then tap the three-dot icon in the upper-right corner to get to Battery Saver in the menu; swiping down on the home screen to summon the Quick Settings box also gets you to the Battery preferences. In the settings, you can turn Battery Saver on or off manually, or have it automatically kick in when the battery is down to 5 or 15 percent of its power.   Several Android phones from HTC, Samsung and LG include a power-saving mode in their settings. Microsoft has a similar Battery Saver feature in the settings for its Windows Phone software. Apple does not have a dedicated power-saving mode for its iOS 8 software, but has a page of tips for getting more out of a charge. Most app stores also have programs for monitoring and maximizing battery use.

"Five Men, Two Fraud Schemes and a Possible Link to a Big Bank Hacking","Last Saturday, Anthony R. Murgio attended a college friend's wedding in Atlanta, seemingly without a care in the world. Yet the day before, unbeknown to Mr. Murgio, federal prosecutors in Manhattan had filed two criminal complaints, under seal, that accused him and another former college classmate, Yuri Lebedev, of running an illegal Bitcoin money exchange operation that enabled criminals operating online to convert the digital currency to cash.    Both men were arrested at their homes in Florida Tuesday morning. That same day, the authorities in Israel seized two other men, who were charged with running a multiyear stock manipulation scheme. A third man was indicted but not arrested because he was not at his home in Israel.   The two cases -- which on the surface appear unrelated -- are the first tantalizing clues to a long-running federal investigation into the huge hacking of JPMorgan Chase's vast network last summer. That breach compromised some personal contact information for 83 million customer accounts. Federal authorities have suspected for months that some of the people arrested this week had a role in helping to carry out the attack, but have yet to officially link any of them to it.    At least three of the people charged apparently knew one another for at least a decade, going back to when they were students at Florida State University. While their potential connection to the JPMorgan attack is unclear, two of those charged were identified last fall by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as having some link to the attack on the bank, people who were briefed on the matter said.   One of those people said tens of millions of customers' email addresses and phone numbers stolen from the bank may have been used as part of a subsequent stock manipulation scheme in which the accused would send spam emails promoting worthless stocks. The person said it was possible the actual hacking was done by others in Eastern Europe on the instructions of those overseeing the stock pump-and-dump scheme.   While many questions remain, what is clear is that federal authorities were forced to move much sooner than they had wanted, partly out of concern that the investigation was becoming too public and that some of those charged might try to move to countries with no formal extradition process to the United States.   On July 2, federal prosecutors sent a letter to Israeli authorities asking them to arrest three men charged with running a four-year stock manipulation scheme as soon as one of the men returned home to Tel Aviv from a trip outside the country. Prosecutors said they were concerned about news organizations making public some aspects of the investigation.   In the letter, the prosecutors said a United States judge had issued arrest warrants for the men on June 2, after a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted the three on 11 counts of securities fraud in a sealed indictment. The letter from the Justice Department's Office of International Affairs included photographs of the three men and brief physical descriptions.   On Tuesday, two of the men, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, were arrested at home in Israel when prosecutors in Manhattan asked a federal judge to have the indictment made public.   The third, Joshua Samuel Aaron, was not arrested because he remained abroad and did not return to Israel by the middle of the month as federal prosecutors had expected. The authorities suspect Mr. Aaron may be in Russia, judging by photographs posted several weeks ago by his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, on several social media accounts.   The letter asking Israel to assist with the arrests was made public during a court proceeding for Mr. Shalon, 31, and Mr. Orenstein, 41. An Israeli judge ordered both of them to remain in custody pending a hearing on Aug. 10. Mr. Aaron, 31, who was born in the United States and grew up in Maryland, lives in Tel Aviv.   In the letter to Israeli authorities, federal prosecutors said that in the past ''Shalon caused the massive quantity of spam emails to be transmitted through his and Aaron's control of numerous servers, domain names, email accounts and accounts with third-party email distribution companies under Shalon's control.''   Federal prosecutors said they would seek to extradite the Israeli defendants for trial in Manhattan.   In the United States, Mr. Lebedev, who lives in a town near Jacksonville, was released on Tuesday after posting a $25,000 bond. Mr. Murgio remained in custody late Thursday at the Pinellas County Jail in Clearwater, having failed to post a $100,000 bond.   Mark Barnett, a lawyer for Mr. Lebedev, declined to comment. Adam Schwartz, a lawyer for Mr. Murgio, did not return a call seeking comment.   Mr. Murgio, Mr. Aaron and Mr. Lebedev were all students at Florida State University.   In 2008, Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron formed a business in West Palm Beach, Fla., called Health Universe L.L.C. It closed about a year later. Mr. Lebedev, 37, who graduated from Florida State with degrees in computer science and mathematics in 2004 and 2008, lists himself as a software architect for company led by Mr. Murgio's brother.   Mr. Murgio, 31, who graduated with a degree in marketing in 2007, had run a number of failed restaurant businesses and other ventures. In 2012, then living in Tallahassee, Mr. Murgio filed for bankruptcy, claiming he had $545,000 in debts.    Mr. Aaron, who majored in real estate, left Florida State in 2005 without a degree, a university spokesman said. For a time he ran a small business called Josh Aaron L.L.C. out of his parents' home in Potomac, Md., before moving to Israel.   Federal prosecutors contend that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev went into the Bitcoin money exchange business in 2013, providing a platform for criminals who put malicious malware on computers and then demand a ransom payment in Bitcoin to unfreeze those computers.   The prosecutors said Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev sought to conceal their money transfer activities by taking effective control of a small credit union in New Jersey that mainly served low-income members.   They did not identify the credit union, but people briefed on the matter said it is Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union in Jackson, N.J. Charles E. Blue Sr., the credit union's chief executive, said, ''We cannot comment on ongoing investigations.''   It is not clear how Mr. Aaron became associated with Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein. Federal authorities contend that the men began orchestrating so-called pump-and-dump penny stock schemes in 2011.   In pump-and-dumps, promoters drive up the price of worthless stocks and pitch them to unsuspecting investors. The organizers then sell the shares before the price crashes.   In an odd twist, Mr. Aaron's elderly grandparents in Maryland were almost victims of fraud in 2012. Late that year, a person called up pretending to be a relative and demanding money. In this case, the caller claimed to be Mr. Aaron and said he was in jail in Greece and needed $3,500.   It's a familiar ruse that consumer advocates have called the ''grandparent scam.'' But Mr. Aaron's grandparents knew that the caller was not their grandson and that the story was a hoax. The couple reported it to consumer affairs officials in Montgomery County, Md. At the time, the attempted fraud drew some media coverage about the danger of such swindles.    "
The Fine Line Between Smart and Illegal,"Prosecuting fraud begins with identifying a lie that leads the victim to lose something of value. The criminal charges announced  last week against Navinder Singh Sarao for ''spoofing'' orders for futures contracts raises the question whether they are enough to constitute fraud, the key to the government's effort to extradite him from Britain. Mr. Sarao is accused of entering a large volume of orders to sell futures contracts tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to signal to other traders that there was selling pressure that would drive down the price. After the price dropped, he would buy the contracts and cancel his sell orders, profiting when the price rebounded. The government contends his actions contributed to the ''flash crash'' in May 2010, in which the Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 1,000 points in just a few minutes before quickly recovering.    This so-called spoofing is specifically outlawed by an amendment added to the Commodity Exchange Act in 2010, which describes it as ''bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution.'' Mr. Sarao is also charged with violating the wire fraud and commodities fraud statutes, both of which require proof that he engaged in a scheme to defraud any person in connection with a futures contract.    The typical market fraud involves making statements to victims that mislead them about the value of an investment or its likely future return or withholding information from them. Unlike most frauds, spoofing involves placing orders that lead other investors to think there is more buying or selling interest than actually exists. In other words, it skews the perception of investors who use order imbalance as an indication of where the price is headed.   Mr. Sarao is accused of placing large orders far enough removed from the actual market price that there was little risk of having them filled but close enough so that other traders would respond by bidding the price higher or lower. The lie, if you will, is convincing others that the orders are legitimate when there is little chance they will be filled.   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which filed civil charges, estimates that Mr. Sarao made about $40 million from spoofing since 2009. In an email sent in 2012, he boasted that ''I have made the majority of my net worth in I would say no more than 20 trading days, that's how I trade.''   The victims of Mr. Sarao's orders are not ordinary investors who read the stock tables or research corporate filings to identify undervalued companies. Instead, they are sophisticated traders who use algorithms that try to predict where the market is headed to buy and sell in the blink of an eye. In other words, it is often the high-frequency traders who have been heavily criticized over the last year that are most likely to be caught by spoofing. As DealBook noted, ''It has been difficult to find firm evidence as to whether such strategies are directly harming ordinary long-term investors.''   Regardless of whether its victims are sympathetic, a scheme to defraud high-frequency traders would still violate the law. But many of these investors are trying to use data about large orders and other corporate news to take advantage of price disparities that quickly pop up and then disappear once the market digests the information. So were they actually misled by the sell orders that Mr. Sarao entered? They could reasonably be expected to adjust their algorithms to recognize the type of orders he used and discount their likely effect on prices.   In addition, there is no requirement that those posting orders actually fill them. High-frequency traders often ''ping'' different markets by sending orders to gauge interest in a stock, and more than 90 percent are estimated to be canceled. That is not spoofing because there is a chance the order will be filled but illustrates the fine line between accepted practices and illegal conduct.   What is odd about the charges is that Mr. Sarao is accused of engaging in spoofing since 2009 and continued to do so until as recently as April 6, according to the C.F.T.C. The criminal complaint was filed under seal in February, yet he was allowed to keep trading despite the claimed harm caused to the market by his spoofing.   Proving the case against him will be complicated by the government's own analysis of the flash crash. A joint report issued in 2010 by the Securities and Exchange Commission and C.F.T.C. pinned much of the blame for the sudden drop in prices on sell orders issued by the mutual fund firm Waddell & Reed Financial, which the firm denies. Mr. Sarao continued to place sell orders since then, yet a similar precipitous drop in the market has not recurred, raising the question whether his activity was having the effect the government contends.   Mr. Sarao was arrested at his home in suburban London, and the Justice Department is seeking his extradition to face the charges filed in Chicago. But even that step may be difficult to achieve.   The extradition treaty between the United States and Britain requires ''dual criminality,'' which means that the offense must be a crime in both countries before a defendant can be extradited. Spoofing is not a crime in England, but fraud by misrepresentation -- including implied representations -- can be prosecuted. The Justice Department will have to prove that entering orders with no intention of having them filled reaches the level of dishonesty and was not just a sharp business practice.   An additional hurdle was added in April 2013 when Parliament enacted the Crime and Courts Act, which allows a British court to block extradition if it ''would not be in the interests of justice.'' It was adopted after the home secretary blocked the extradition of Gary McKinnon, a computer hacker wanted in the United States to face charges of intruding into Pentagon computer networks. Under the statute, if a ''substantial measure'' of the conduct took place in Britain, then the court must look at a variety of factors, including where most of the loss occurred and whether prosecutors there are investigating, before ordering extradition.   Neither of these is insurmountable but do present a challenge because Mr. Sarao can appeal an adverse decision that could cause considerable delays in being sent to the United States.   Prosecutors took nearly six years to put together the case against Mr. Sarao, and it will be a few more before we know whether his activities rose to the level of a fraud. The charges highlight the fragility of the markets and how participants push the edge of legality to gain any profitable advantage. The real lesson may be the need for regulators to confront the issue of how orders can be entered and canceled in the blink of an eye to create the appearance of trading interest, and whether the integrity of the markets can be maintained in the face of high-speed trading that seeks profits from even the slightest informational imbalance.    "
Conviction Offers Guide to Future 'Spoofing' Cases,"The recent conviction of Michael Coscia in the Federal District Court in Chicago in the first prosecution for ''spoofing'' provides more clarity to high-frequency trading firms about how they can operate. The message is to tread carefully when a strategy depends on using orders that will be quickly canceled because the government may claim they are an effort to manipulate the market by fooling others into trading. Spoofing was made illegal in the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits ''bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution.''    Mr. Coscia faces a prison term for using an algorithm to enter and cancel large orders for futures contracts in less than a second while placing smaller ones on the opposite side that would become profitable once other firms reacted to his orders that indicated an increase in buying or selling interest.    According to the Justice Department, he reaped over $1 million in profits through his firm, Panther Energy Trading, in just a few months using programs intended to fool traders.   Like most white-collar crime prosecutions, this one turned on the tricky issue of proving the defendant's intent. Prosecutors relied on the high volume of orders put out by Panther Energy that in most instances were canceled within 400 milliseconds, about the blink of an eye. To prove Mr. Coscia wanted to spoof the market into believing there was legitimate interest in trading, the government relied on evidence that the algorithm Mr. Coscia had used meant there was almost no prospect that the orders would be completed .   In an uncommon move, Mr. Coscia testified in his own defense, asserting that he ''absolutely wanted to fill every order.'' The jury found him guilty of six spoofing charges and six counts of commodities fraud, returning its verdict after only an hour of deliberations.   That may be something close to a record for deciding a complex white-collar prosecution, indicating that his testimony was far from persuasive.   The conviction shows that the volume of canceled orders, along with their size, is a key to proving spoofing. But orders are canceled all the time, with estimates that more than 90 percent are not filled. There are even orders that are intended to be canceled quickly, such as ''fill or kill'' orders that require the entire amount be traded or it is canceled immediately. So a high volume of cancellations alone might not be sufficient to establish a violation.   The government argued that Mr. Coscia was different from those using order types that were likely to result in cancellations because his algorithm sought to cancel every order to drive the market in the direction that would allow him to profit from his small orders while avoiding having the large ones filled. So it was not just the canceling orders alone, but coupling them with profitable trades driven by the cancellations as a way of demonstrating that there was never any intention that the orders be filled -- hence, spoofing rather than ordinary market activity.   Of course, the reason for trading is to make money, so proving a motive to profit would not be difficult in most cases. It is linking profitable trades to order cancellations that can establish spoofing. The proof of intent comes from the design of a program, not what was in the mind of the person at the moment the orders are entered and canceled. Indeed, the whole concept of high-frequency trading is to eliminate the human element by executing transactions in the blink of an eye.   The successful prosecution of Mr. Coscia shows the potential power of the spoofing provision to reshape how high-frequency trading firms operate, because canceling orders becomes the starting point for assessing whether a market strategy crosses the line into spoofing. The more successful an algorithmic program is, the greater the likelihood that regulators and prosecutors will be suspicious of how it operates if it entails a heavy volume of canceled orders.   Although Mr. Coscia's case involved as many as 14,000 orders canceled over five to six weeks, the spoofing statute says only that the trader must intend that the order not be completed, with no minimum number required to prove a violation.   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are cracking down on spoofing as a means to constrain some of the methods used by high-frequency trading firms that have raised questions about the fairness of the markets. Reuters reported that Timothy G. Massad, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. who spoke with reporters at a futures industry conference after Mr. Coscia's conviction, warned firms that ''if they're entering a lot of orders without the intention to consummate, then they should go talk to their lawyers.''   Andrew J. Ceresney, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in a speech last Monday that the agency was focusing on spoofing ''as well as other modern manipulation and abusive trading schemes.''   The conviction of Mr. Coscia is only the first step, as an appeal is likely to challenge the definition of spoofing. In a pretrial motion to dismiss the spoofing charges, he argued that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not distinguish between lawful cancellations of orders and those that constitute a violation. That claim was rejected, and pursuing a vagueness claim on appeal will be difficult because courts are loath to invalidate a statute, especially after a jury verdict.   A better line of attack on appeal may be to question the six convictions for violating the broad securities and commodities fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1348. That provision makes it a crime to ''execute or attempt to execute a scheme or artifice'' to defraud in connection with any commodity or futures contracts.   The government argued that entering the orders with the intention to cancel them misled other market participants, who inferred from the orders there was greater buying or selling interest than actually existed. Unlike spoofing, which focuses on the trader's intent to cancel, a fraud charge requires showing an intent to deceive a victim.   It is an interesting question whether an algorithm intended to mislead other computer programs into trading constitutes a fraud. In a typical case, there is a misstatement or failure to disclose information on which the victim relies. But Panther Energy entered legitimate orders, even if they were going to be quickly canceled, so the deception was in how competing algorithms interpreted the orders that resulted in their own trading.   Absent a falsehood or some other deception, it is arguable whether spoofing the market is itself a type of fraud, or just a particular form of manipulative conduct that is unfair but not a fraudulent scheme.   The prosecution of Mr. Coscia will give the federal courts an opportunity to shape how the law of spoofing develops because the statute gives little guidance in locating the line between permissible order cancellations and a violation. For now, high-frequency trading firms will have to be careful in how they operate to stay away from crossing over into a violation that can result in civil liability and, perhaps, even a criminal prosecution.

"Tech Firms Should Not Worry About Draft Antiterror Law, China Says","BEIJING -- Beijing reacted on Wednesday to President Obama's criticism of China's rules for technology companies by saying that a draft antiterrorism law would not affect the ''legitimate rights'' of network operators. The pushback against American insistence that China temper its rules is part of a deepening conflict between Beijing and Washington over a number of new regulations that the United States government and technology industry say go too far in broadly demanding access to user data, encryption methods and intellectual property.     Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for China's legislature, said that the antiterrorism bill was in accordance with the basic principles of administrative law and was justified in asking that technology companies make telecommunications and Internet ports accessible to the government for investigations.   ''It is also the general practice internationally, and it will not affect the legitimate rights of Internet operators,'' Ms. Fu said, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. She was addressing a news conference before a meeting of the Chinese legislature, the National People's Congress.   Ms. Fu said that the antiterrorism bill had been the subject of heated discussions among legislators, and that it had been refined to clarify that, with strict limitations, only government security agencies would be allowed to monitor data, and only for the purpose of investigating and forestalling terrorist activities.   Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Tuesday that China was doing what was necessary to guard against the risks of terrorism.   ''To issue the antiterrorism law is part of China's internal affairs,'' Ms. Hua said at the ministry's daily news conference in Beijing. ''We hope the U.S. will treat it in a correct, calm and objective way.''   On Monday, Mr. Obama told Reuters in an interview that if China wanted to do business with the United States, the rules would have to be changed.   Although the antiterrorism law is still in draft form, over the last few months China has passed new regulations for specific industries, like banking and finance, requiring information technology suppliers to turn over source code, to submit to invasive audits and to build so-called back doors into hardware and software.   Beijing's suggestion that its rules are fair may be of little comfort to technology companies. The United States alleges that Chinese government agencies have hacked American companies to gain commercial advantage through access to intellectual property and other trade secrets. Human rights advocatesalso say that China often uses the pretense of cracking down on terrorism to go after activists and others it sees as a threat to its power.   Contrary to Ms. Fu's statements, whether or not technology companies should turn over user data to government agencies conducting investigations has in recent years become a hotly contested issue.   Following the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, of American government snooping on electronic communications, technology companies have taken steps to encrypt their products and services more heavily. At times those moves have led to complaints from the United States government. A move last autumn by Apple to encrypt products in such a way that it would be impossible for the company to comply with warrants asking for customer information -- like photos, emails and call histories -- drew sharp complaints from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   The antiterrorism law in China could make it impossible for Apple and other companies to continue with their current encryption methods within that country.   Even as Mr. Obama complains about China's technology rules, in some ways the regulations show how Beijing and Washington have a similar outlook on electronic communications. Both would like to be able to collect data when they deem it necessary and strongly oppose encryption that foils such efforts.    "
Why Donald Trump's Call to 'Close Up' the Internet Is Science Fiction,"It is not clear what Donald Trump actually meant on Monday when he conjured up the idea of getting Bill Gates to help ""close up"" the Internet. Mr. Trump hasn't elaborated yet, and Mr. Gates, who stepped down as Microsoft's chairman last year, is spending most of his days at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. However, since he remains a technology adviser to the company's current chief executive, Satya Nadella, you could imagine Mr. Gates returning to Redmond, Wash., where Microsoft is based, and the two of them going down into the basement at Microsoft HQ and pulling the plug.  The problem is that the Internet's backbone doesn't run through Redmond, and it never did. There was a time, of course, in the 1990s when it seemed as if Microsoft ran the Internet, when the company got into antitrust trouble with the United States Justice Department. But that was business control - to an extent. It was never technical control. In 1993, John Gilmore, a freedom-of-speech activist and one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, was quoted as saying, ""The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."" He was referring to the basic design of a computer network that was intended to have no central control and no single point of failure. There is no one plug to pull or server to block. That decentralized structure has created headaches for anyone trying to control communications in cyberspace. Of course, Mr. Trump was probably not asking Mr. Gates to shut down the Internet, but looking for some way to deny it to the Islamic State and its allies as a propaganda and communications tool. Mr. Trump's suggestion touches upon a long-running debate regarding the Internet and censorship. Instead of Bill Gates, he might receive better advice from Li Keqiang, the prime minister of China, which has put a great deal of energy into ""closing up"" the Internet, including barring electronic distribution of The New York Times. Perhaps an anti-Islamic State wall - a bit like China's ""Great Firewall"" that controls Internet traffic in and out of the country - would be the perfect companion to Mr. Trump's proposal for a physical wall along the United States' southern border. Mr. Trump could benefit from reading ""Shockwave Rider,"" a 1975 science fiction novel written by John Brunner. Mr. Brunner's novel is best known for coining the term ""worm"" for a malicious computer program that could move under its own power from computer to computer via a network. Computer worms became widely known in the real world in 1988 when a young computer science graduate student, Robert Tappan Morris, let one loose and - because of a programming error - briefly created a monumental traffic jam that brought the Internet, then brand new, briefly to its knees. Mr. Brunner's novel imagines a totalitarian government that exercises its power through a computer network that gives it control over the population. In the novel, the protagonist, who is a member of a rebel group, lets the worm loose in the network, putting the government in a bind. The only way it can destroy the worm is to bring down the network and in the process undermine its power. If that were done to the real Internet, bringing down the network might displease Mr. Trump, who at last count had 5.15 million followers on Twitter. "
British Phone-Hacking Inquiry Ends,"LONDON --  British prosecutors said on Friday that they would take no further action in their phone-hacking investigation, ending a four-year inquiry that shook the country and shed light on the freewheeling tabloid news media, its sometimes unsavory methods and its proximity to the highest echelons of power. The Crown Prosecution Service said that there was insufficient evidence to bring corporate charges against News UK, Rupert Murdoch's newspaper holding company in Britain, and that 10 people under investigation at the rival Mirror Group Newspapers would not be charged.     The prosecution service said it had brought 12 prosecutions and secured nine convictions for serious offenses during the investigation in the past three years, actions that had addressed considerable public concern about phone hacking and the invasion of privacy.   ''After a thorough analysis, we have decided there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction and therefore no further action will be taken in any of these cases,'' Alison Saunders, director of public prosecutions, said in a statement. ''These decisions bring the C.P.S.'s involvement in current investigations into phone hacking to a close.''   The investigation convulsed the news establishment and the political elite, and prompted a reckoning within the close-knit world of the British news media: Journalists were found to have illegally listened to voice mail messages and bribed police officers, and were said to have hired private investigators for illegal surveillance and information gathering.   Piers Morgan, the former editor of The Daily Mirror, wrote on Twitter that he had been informed by prosecutors that no further action would be taken against him as part of the phone-hacking investigation.   ''As I've said since the investigation began four years ago, I've never hacked a phone and nor have I ever told anybody to hack a phone,'' Mr. Morgan, who hosted a talk show on CNN for four years, wrote on Twitter. ''Thanks to all my family and friends, and kind people on here, for all their support. It was greatly appreciated.''   In July 2011, Mr. Murdoch's newspaper holding company in Britain, then called News International, closed the tabloid News of the World after it emerged that a private investigator employed by the Sunday newspaper had intercepted voice mail messages left on the cellphone of a kidnapped teenager in 2002. The teenager, Milly Dowler, was later found dead.   News UK said in a statement that it welcomed the Crown Prosecution Service's decision, while acknowledging that transgressions had taken place.   ''Long ago, we apologized for the conduct that occurred, immediately took steps to pay compensation to those affected, and updated and instituted substantial reforms in our business to ensure our governance is second to none,'' the company said. ''Following a thorough and exhaustive investigation, and after many long trials, enquiries and proceedings, this matter has been concluded and the right decision has been taken.''   The investigation featured a varied cast of tabloid characters, including Rebekah Brooks, who rose from being a secretary in Mr. Murdoch's British newspaper empire to become the person running it.   Ms. Brooks, a former editor of both The News of the World and The Sun, was accused of encouraging -- or at least tolerating -- phone hacking and other crimes, alongside her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her former deputy, Andy Coulson -- who, it later emerged, was also her lover.   In June 2014, she was acquitted of all the charges against her, and she has now returned as chief executive of News UK. Mr. Brooks was acquitted of a charge of perverting the course of justice.   Mr. Coulson, who succeeded her as editor at the The News of the World and later became a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, was found guilty of a conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages. He was jailed for 18 months in July 2014 for his role in the hacking.   Mr. Morgan, for his part, made it clear he was elated that the investigation was over.   ''I'm now going to get spectacularly drunk,'' he wrote on Twitter. ''Happy Christmas.''

"In Foiling Gmail, China Foils Itself","Back at the turn of the century, when China began trying to crack down on the Internet, Bill Clinton said, ''Good luck. That's sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.''  He seems to have underestimated the ingenuity and commitment of Chinese censors, who in intervening years have put up the Great Firewall, some of the world's most sophisticated machinery and software for controlling or blocking what reaches millions of Chinese Internet users. Many foreign services, including Twitter and Facebook, are blocked altogether, and the list grows by the week. But the technical ability to nail Jell-O to the wall does not necessarily make it useful or desirable, as China demonstrated last Friday, when many users of Gmail in China found the service shut down. Most of Google's services have been disrupted since June, but until last week Gmail could still be accessed by its many Chinese users over protocols like SMTP or POP. These, too, went down. Chinese officials claimed to be flummoxed by the problem. But it looked for all the world like another attempt by China's Internet nannies to either patch a hole in the Great Firewall or to intimidate Google, the biggest thorn in their sides. Google is among the Western technology companies that have refused to bow to China's idea of ''Internet sovereignty,'' which includes sharing information on users with the government. The company moved its servers out of China in 2010, and all of its services -- including its search function -- were shut down in China in the crackdown on foreign Internet services in the months leading up to the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests. Though there is no solid evidence that China blocked Gmail, or indications of why it might have, the fact is that China faces a dilemma in dealing with Western information giants. The free flow of information and the potential for quick popular mobilization through social networks are anathema to the authoritarian state, and China has gone to great lengths to control what comes in. But as a rapidly developing economic powerhouse, China also needs the instant communications, quick research and management tools of the technology giants. Gmail is especially popular with Chinese doing business with Western companies, and many publicly complained about the interruption. The technology companies, for their part, salivate at the vast and rich Chinese market but bridle at the control and censorship China demands as the price for participating. Frustration with the interruption of Gmail service seemed to reach even into the Communist nomenklatura. Global Times, a tabloid associated with the state-owned People's Daily, carried a curious editorial saying that ''if the China side indeed blocked Gmail, the decision must have been prompted by newly emerged security reasons. If that is the case, Gmail users need to accept the reality of Gmail being suspended in China. But we hope it is not the case.'' Or, Global Times might have said, it may be possible to nail Gmail to the wall, but it's really not a good idea. "
Speeding Up Hardware Through an Accelerator and Marketplace,"The cool things now in hacker space are physical products, like personalized drone racing, centrifugal force-brewed coffee, and hyper-efficient air purifiers that use ultraviolet light. High-tech hardware is following the route that software took around the year 2000, with cheap resources and fast development leading to an explosion of products. While financing for many products has typically relied on crowdsourcing sites like Kickstarter, a more formal supporting infrastructure now appears to be developing.  ""The fabric of technology has changed,"" said Liam Casey, the founder and chief executive of PCH, which makes products for companies including Apple, and for 18 months has run an accelerator for hardware start-ups. Developments like 3D printing, open source operating systems, and easy manufacturing from China, he said, are creating ""a renaissance for hardware start-ups everywhere."" His accelerator, called Highway1, is counting on their success. In exchange for anywhere from 3 percent to 6 percent of the start-up, Highway1 gives young hardware start-ups $50,000, access to the company's engineering labs, a two-week visit to China, and a four-month course in managing a start-up's risk. Mr. Casey is not the only person who thinks something is going on. On Tuesday, Highway1 held its fourth demonstration of companies, attracting about 250 journalists, investors, and corporate representatives. A number of the students had polished pitches. Game of Drones, the drone racing company, offered both packaged training on how to fly and race a machine, and in-drone video cameras so the driver could feel aloft as she ran the obstacle course. The company has also built a community of people who watch the races, the way others watch people play video games online. Spinn, the coffee maker, said its machine can brew anything from drip coffee to espresso, depending on how fast the brewer spins. The company also hopes to create a kind of social network of baristas, whose methods can be downloaded at home for a Spinn machine to duplicate. Transformair, the air filter, said it tested its machine against 3.9 million e. coli bacteria, and killed every one. Other products included a disk that could fit behind a standard watch and connect to a smartphone to do most of the functions of a smartphone; a water monitoring and management system aimed initially at aquariums, but hopes to transform acquaculture, and a kind of home security camera that also used visual data analysis to capture the most heartwarming parts of your life. In some cases, the start-ups were looking for millions of dollars in investment, as the move from the new realities of prototyping to the still-difficult business of making a product at scale. Even that may change soon. Last year, PCH paid an estimated $15 million to buy Fab, a shopping website that was once valued at $1 billion (PCH would not comment on what it paid for Fab). In October, Mr. Casey expects to augment the sale items now on Fab with specially produced designer goods, while also offering an online store to his incubated investments. ""This is the future,"" he said. ""I want them to get more ambitious. I want someone to come to me with a plan for a phone. A car."" "

"A PBS Show, a Hacking at Sony, and a Loss of Face","In January 2014, Henry Louis Gates Jr. was over the moon. Mr. Gates, a Harvard professor and public intellectual, had just finished an interview with the actor and director Ben Affleck for the second season of his PBS show, ''Finding Your Roots.'' The show investigates the ancestries of celebrities like Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson and Jessica Alba, and Mr. Affleck was apparently a dream guest.     ''We filmed him Tuesday morning, and it was brilliant!'' Mr. Gates wrote in an email to his friend Michael Lynton, chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment, on Jan. 15 last year. ''In fact, he enjoyed it so much that he is getting Matt Damon to do it, too, so that we can start the series (if this works out) with the two of them as the first guests. But it went very, very well.''    Mr. Damon did not appear on the show's second season, and six months later, those good feelings were a distant memory. Mr. Affleck became frustrated that his interview on ''Finding Your Roots'' included a discussion about a slave-owning ancestor of his named Benjamin Cole. Mr. Gates worried that if they cut that detail, it would be perceived as censorship.   By the time WikiLeaks posted a trove of hacked Sony emails two months ago, Mr. Gates's correspondences were revealed, and his worst fears came true. Mr. Affleck had lobbied Mr. Gates to omit the part about the slave-owning ancestor. Mr. Gates had chosen not to include it. And one blatant omission had managed to hurt the reputations of a prominent academic, a Hollywood superstar and an esteemed public television broadcaster.    On Wednesday, PBS said that an investigation into the controversy showed that Mr. Affleck had exerted ''improper influence'' over the editorial process and that the producers of the show, Mr. Gates included, had erred by not informing the network of the actor's ''efforts to affect program content.'' PBS said it would postpone the third season of the show until a fact-checker was hired and an ''independent genealogist'' was added to the show's staff. PBS also will not show Mr. Affleck's episode anymore and removed it from its online archive.   In a statement released on Wednesday, Mr. Gates said he regretted not informing PBS about his conversations with Mr. Affleck. He did not apologize for omitting the detail in the broadcast. Mr. Gates said in April that other relatives of Mr. Affleck's were more interesting, such as an occult enthusiast and a relative from the Revolutionary War.   Mr. Gates still contends the omission was an editorial decision, his spokesman said on Thursday. That assertion is in stark contrast to opinions he expressed in emails to Mr. Lynton last July, in which he expressed exasperation over how Mr. Affleck ''asked us to edit something about one of his ancestors -- the fact that he owned slaves.'' He said that it was in ''violation of PBS rules'' and that ''once we open the door to censorship, we lose control of the brand.''   If it became known that he cut that part of the interview with Mr. Affleck, Mr. Gates wrote, it would embarrass Mr. Affleck and ''compromise our integrity.'' Mr. Affleck said in a Facebook post in April that he was embarrassed to learn about his relative and that he ''lobbied'' Mr. Gates, who also goes by Skip, about what should go into the show. He said it was Mr. Gates's decision alone.   ''To clarify, because I see this story being framed as 'censorship' on some sites, when I told Skip I was uneasy about the slave owner, he told me he had not included it in his preliminary cut because there wasn't much detail -- a name and no details, so he wasn't going with it to begin with,'' Mr. Affleck wrote on Facebook.   While PBS treated this as a violation of standards, Mr. Affleck was quick to point out in April that the program ''isn't a news program'' and that the celebrities voluntarily provide information about their family history.   Mr. Affleck declined to comment on Thursday. PBS also declined to comment further. The investigation that it conducted will remain private, a spokeswoman for PBS said.    The show has featured other celebrities who have had slave-owning ancestors, including Derek Jeter, Ken Burns and Anderson Cooper.    In a statement released Wednesday, PBS's chief programming executive and general manager, Beth Hoppe, said that ''improved editorial and production processes will ensure that all future projects will adhere to PBS' editorial guidelines.''

Clinton Emails Said to Contain Classified Data,"WASHINGTON --  Government investigators said Friday that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Hillary Rodham Clinton used while secretary of state, stating unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Mrs. Clinton has said for months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house so she would not have to carry both a personal phone and a work phone. Her campaign said Friday that any government secrets found on the server had been classified after the fact.     But the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation's intelligence agencies said the information they found was classified when it was sent and remains so now. Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and such information can be sent or stored only on computer networks with special safeguards.   ''This classified information never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,'' Steve A. Linick, the State Department inspector general, said in a statement signed by him and I. Charles McCullough III, the inspector general for the intelligence community.   The findings by the two inspectors general raise new questions about Mrs. Clinton's use of her personal email at the State Department, a practice that since March has been criticized by her Republican adversaries as well as advocates of open government, and has made some Democrats uneasy. Voters, however, do not appear swayed by the issue, according to polls.   In their joint statement, the inspectors general said the classified information had originated with the nation's intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. It is against the law for someone to receive a classified document or briefing and then summarize that information in an unclassified email.    The two investigators did not say whether Mrs. Clinton sent or received the emails. If she received them, it is not clear that she would have known that they contained government secrets, since they were not marked classified. The inspectors general did not address whether they believed Mrs. Clinton should have known such information was not appropriate for her personal email.    Regardless, the disclosure is an example of an unforeseen consequence of Mrs. Clinton's unusual computer setup. Security experts have questioned whether her practice made government secrets more vulnerable to security risks and hacking.   Exactly how much classified information Mrs. Clinton had on the server is unclear. Investigators said they searched a small sample of 40 emails and found four that contained government secrets. But Mr. McCullough said in a separate statement that although the State Department had granted limited access to its own inspector general, the department rejected Mr. McCullough's request for access to the 30,000 emails that Mrs. Clinton said were government-related and gave to the State Department.   Mrs. Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, is ''purported'' to also have copies of the 30,000 emails on a thumb drive, according to Mr. McCullough.   Campaigning in New York on Friday, Mrs. Clinton pledged to cooperate with inquiries into her emails, but also said she would stay focused on the issues at the heart of her presidential campaign.   ''We are all accountable to the American people to get the facts right, and I will do my part,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But I'm also going to stay focused on the issues, particularly the big issues, that really matter to American families.''   The discovery of the four emails prompted Mr. McCullough to refer the matter to F.B.I. counterintelligence agents, who investigate crimes related to the mishandling of classified information. On Thursday night and again Friday morning, the Justice Department referred to the matter as a ''criminal referral,'' but later Friday dropped the word ''criminal.'' The inspectors general said late Friday that it was a ''security referral'' intended to alert authorities that ''classified information may exist on at least one private server and thumb drive that are not in the government's possession.''   Irrespective of the terminology, the referral raises the possibility of a Justice Department investigation into Mrs. Clinton's emails as she campaigns for president. Polls show she is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by a wide margin.   Mishandling classified information is a crime. Justice Department officials said no decision had been made about whether to open a criminal investigation.   The refusal by the State Department to give Mr. McCullough access to the emails has reignited calls by Republicans for Mrs. Clinton to hand over the server that she used to house the personal email account.   ''If Secretary Clinton truly has nothing to hide, she can prove it by immediately turning over her server to the proper authorities and allowing them to examine the complete record,'' Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said on Friday. ''Her poor judgment has undermined our national security, and it is time for her to finally do the right thing.''   The Justice Department is typically reluctant to open politically charged investigations unless there is clear evidence of criminal wrongdoing. For example, authorities said last year that they would not open an investigation into dueling claims by the C.I.A. and the Senate Intelligence Committee in a dispute that also centered around access to classified information.    "
Clinton Emails Took Long Path to Controversy,"WASHINGTON -- Earlier this summer, the inspector general of the nation's intelligence agencies contacted the longtime lawyer for Hillary and Bill Clinton with a pointed question. Classified information had been found in a small sample of 30,000 messages from the former secretary of state's private email account. The inspector general, I. Charles McCullough III, wanted to know from the lawyer, David E. Kendall, where copies of the message collection might still be stored. Mr. Kendall's answer, like so much in the story of the Clinton emails, pointed in an unexpected direction. The official communications of the nation's 67th secretary of state, it turned out, were handled by a little Colorado I.T. company, Platte River Networks, previously best known for being honored in 2012 as Denver's ''small business of the year.''    Last week, F.B.I. agents showed up at Platte River's modest brick building, opposite a candy factory. Now that government secrets had been found in Mrs. Clinton's email, the agents wanted to know about the company's security measures.    Whether Americans believe Mrs. Clinton's decision to use only a private email account for her public business is a troubling scandal well worth an F.B.I. inquiry, a pragmatic move blown out of proportion by Republican enemies, or something in between, may depend more on their partisan leanings than the facts of the affair itself.   But the email account and its confusing reverberations have become a significant early chapter in the 2016 presidential race and a new stroke in the portrait of the Democrats' leading candidate.   Interviews with former State Department officials, law enforcement and intelligence officials, experts on classified information and members of Congress provide further insight into how the controversy developed and where it might lead.   Mrs. Clinton, who has said she now regrets her unorthodox decision to keep private control of her official messages, is not a target in the F.B.I.'s investigation, which is focused on assessing security breaches. Against the backdrop of other current government computer security lapses, notably the large-scale theft of files from the Office of Personnel Management, most specialists believe the occasional appearance of classified information in the Clinton account was probably of marginal consequence.   But exempting herself from the practices imposed on the 24,000 Foreign Service officers and Civil Service workers she oversaw has led to resentment from some former subordinates. And by holding onto the official emails until the State Department was prompted by Congress to ask for them, and then deciding for herself which to preserve, Mrs. Clinton may have provoked mistrust even as she asks American voters to send her to the Oval Office.   The Clinton campaign declined to comment for this article.   Republicans are eager to exploit the issue. House Speaker John A. Boehner has issued a stream of news releases on the emails and the questions he thinks they raise, while the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya, has expanded its inquiry to include the emails.   There are still unanswered questions: Who at the State Department advised Mrs. Clinton that she could send all her email communications from a private account? What specific criteria did her lawyers use to decide which emails would be deleted on the grounds that they were personal? And what exactly was the classified information that government inspectors say was improperly included in her emails? Outside the political maelstrom, some security experts believe the ultimate judgment of her conduct will come not in a court or from Congress but at the ballot box.   ''I think the whole set of circumstances has been scrambled by political considerations surrounding the presidential campaign,'' said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. He said the inadvertent ''spillage'' of classified information into an unclassified system is quite common.   ''If there's a penalty,'' he said, ''it may cost her some votes.''   Others say more than politics is at stake. ''I was stunned to see that she didn't use the State Department system for State Department business, as we were always told we had to do,'' said William Johnson, a former Air Force officer who served at the department from 1999 to 2011.   Mr. Johnson said his concerns were only compounded by the discovery of classified information in the emails. ''If I'd done that, I'd be out on bond right now,'' he said. He said he believed that someone should be punished -- if not Mrs. Clinton, then career employees whose job was to safeguard secrets and preserve public records.   ''It's not the end of the world; she didn't give away the crown jewels,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''But this is not how things are supposed to be done.''   The email controversy breaks into three clear phases: Mrs. Clinton's initial choices about how to set up her email; her decision to destroy messages she judged to be personal; and the discovery of classified information in an account where it is not allowed by law.   The Server   On the first day of Mrs. Clinton's confirmation hearing in January 2009, a longtime aide to her husband bought the Internet domain name clintonemail.com from a company called Network Solutions in Jacksonville, Fla. The aide, Justin Cooper, then shifted management of the account to an Atlanta company called Perfect Privacy.   Privacy was something Mrs. Clinton valued but had rarely enjoyed. As first lady in the 1990s, she had weathered multiple investigations of various alleged misdeeds and her husband's much-publicized infidelity. At a fund-raiser in 2000, she said she had decided to do without email.   ''As much as I've been investigated and all of that,'' she said, ''why would I ever want to do email?''   But changing times, and the practical needs of a secretary of state, evidently overcame that instinct. When she took office in 2009, with ever more people doing government business through email, the State Department allowed the use of home computers as long as they were secure; nine months later a new policy required that steps be taken to make sure emails were captured in the department's records. There appears to have been no prohibition on the exclusive use of a private server; it does not appear to be an option anyone had thought about.   A server was set up at Mrs. Clinton's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., evidently with backup provided in Denver at Platte River Networks. To the surprise of many colleagues, she never had a standard State.gov account.   The role of Platte River Networks and the F.B.I.'s investigation was first reported by The Washington Post.   Mrs. Clinton has said she decided in 2009 to handle all her email, official and personal, on one account to avoid carrying multiple electronic devices. Yet early this year she joked that she was ''two steps short of a hoarder. So I have an iPad, a mini iPad, an iPhone and a BlackBerry.''   So there may have been other reasons for using a private server. For an oft-attacked politician considering a presidential run, the server would give Mrs. Clinton some control over what would become public from her four years as the nation's top diplomat. ''I've been following it very carefully,'' said Shiva Ayyadurai, an email pioneer who has designed email systems for both government and large corporations. A private system, he noted, ''would make it possible to decide what would be disclosed and what would not.''   There is another factor that some former colleagues say puts Mrs. Clinton's decision in a more reasonable light: the archaic, dysfunctional computer systems at the State Department. Only a tiny fraction of emails sent on the State.gov system in recent years have been permanently archived. And former State Department employees describe the unclassified email system in 2009 as frustratingly inadequate.   Using State Department email outside the building involved ''incredibly unreliable software,'' said one former senior official. ''If you had to write a priority message that was more than a paragraph long, it could leave you streaming sweat and screaming at the screen. And that's when people would turn to their private accounts out of desperation.''   Another official described landing in foreign capitals late at night and having to go to the American Embassy and wake people up simply to check his unclassified email. He called the situation ''ludicrous,'' though he said the system slowly improved, especially as more people got government BlackBerry devices.   All of these former officials asked not to be named, fearing they might offend Mrs. Clinton or, worse, draw a subpoena from the House Benghazi committee. Several former Clinton aides have hired private counsel at personal expense. ''The basic feeling is, if you haven't been mentioned by the committee, you should keep your name out of it,'' said one official.   From the emails the State Department has begun releasing in stages, a pattern emerges. Mrs. Clinton rarely went in for long exchanges, preferring quick messages of a sentence or two at most, delivering pats on the back, sending queries or instructions to aides and occasionally delivering wisecracks.   To John D. Podesta, who served as her husband's chief of staff at the White House and is now the chairman of her campaign, she offered homespun advice: ''Please wear socks to bed to keep your feet warm.'' She quizzed her aide, Huma Abedin, about how to use a fax machine: ''I thought it was supposed to be off hook to work?''   Mrs. Clinton seemed to reserve sensitive subjects for face-to-face meetings. As her aides discussed a forthcoming New Yorker profile of Richard C. Holbrooke, the envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, she weighed in.   ''I know more about this if you wish to discuss,'' she wrote.   Curiously, she seemed to want to improve her email skills. She asked another aide, Cheryl Mills, to lend a book called ''Send: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better.''   The Deletion   As Mrs. Clinton and her staffers have repeatedly pointed out, most of her emails -- they say about 90 percent -- were automatically captured on State Department servers because she was writing to aides and colleagues who had State.gov addresses. Some were not captured, however, because a few top aides also used private addresses.   After meeting with two of her closest aides, Ms. Mills and Philippe Reines, State Department officials decided last year to ask for any emails in the custody of Mrs. Clinton -- and of her three predecessors as secretary of state, who said they had none. She turned over 30,490 emails last December, nearly two years after leaving office.   But it turned out that she had destroyed a slightly larger number of messages from her account -- 31,830 -- because she or her aides judged them to be personal in nature.   ''At the end, I chose not to keep my private, personal emails,'' she told reporters in March. ''Emails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements. Condolence notes to friends, as well as yoga routines, family vacations -- the other things you typically find in inboxes. No one wants their personal emails made public.''   That explanation might win public sympathy. But it did not take long for evidence to surface that the culling may have included some work-related emails as well.   In June, the State Department said that it had not been able to find in Mrs. Clinton's emails some 15 messages from Sidney Blumenthal, an old friend and aide, who had independently turned them over to the House Benghazi committee. The messages involved Libya -- Mr. Blumenthal was passing along analysis from a former C.I.A. officer -- and they appeared to involve policy.   The Clinton campaign has not explained the discrepancy. In sorting through more than 60,000 emails, it is easy to imagine slip-ups. But this small window on the deletion process, carried out privately by Mrs. Clinton's lawyers and aides, offered little assurance to skeptics that the work email collection was complete.   Classified   Shortly after Mrs. Clinton said in March that her private email account had contained no classified information, the Republican chairmen of the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees decided to test that claim. The senators -- Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee, -- asked the inspectors general for the State Department and Intelligence Community to investigate whether she and other State Department officials had kept classified information on personal email accounts.   Mr. McCullough, a former F.B.I agent and the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, took the lead in examining Mrs. Clinton's emails. In 900 pages of emails about Libya that the State Department had handed over to the Benghazi committee, his team found one email they judged to contain classified information -- but the State Department had already posted it on the web.   Mr. McCullough then looked at a sample of 40 more messages and found four that he concluded contained information that should have been marked ''secret.'' In last month's court-ordered State Department release of an additional 2,200 pages of emails, 64 passages from 37 messages were blacked out because they were judged too sensitive to be released. Officials said hundreds more messages from the full archive might contain classified information.   Because the classified passages are blacked out, it is impossible to gauge how much damage their disclosure might have caused. There is a broad consensus that the government classifies far too much innocuous material. ''If you're assistant secretary or above,'' said one former diplomat who held such a post, ''it's hard to burp without someone thinking it's classified.''   Moreover, ''spillage'' -- the technical term for classified information slipping into an unclassified system -- is so common that the government has a protocol to deal with it. A 2008 guide, ''National Instruction on Classified Information Spillage'' treats it as a regrettable but not-so-rare occurrence. It lays out how such errors should be assessed and reported, mentioning, well down in the to-do list, ''Determine whether the incident should be referred to the Department of Justice for investigation and/or criminal prosecution.''   In the case of Mrs. Clinton's email, the F.B.I. is conducting an investigation of just how the classified material was stored in Denver, as well as on a thumb drive kept by her lawyer, Mr. Kendall, and whether it might somehow have landed in the hands of adversaries. Officials say the bureau at this point has no target in mind and no evidence that a crime was committed.   But the investigation takes place in an administration that has taken an especially hard line on the handling of classified information.   Scott Gration, ambassador to Kenya, resigned after a 2012 inspector general's report accused him of flouting government rules, including the requirement that he use State Department email. ''He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business,'' the report said.   A New York firefighter and decorated combat veteran who served in the Marines in Afghanistan, Jason Brezler, is currently fighting dismissal from the Marine Corps for sending, via his personal account, an email attachment the government says was classified. His lawyer, Kevin Carroll, says he sent the message in response to an emergency request from a base in Afghanistan.   Mrs. Clinton and her aides have noted that the material the inspectors general call classified was not labeled as such in the emails. But in 2010, Thomas Drake, a former senior National Security Agency official, was indicted under the Espionage Act for keeping an agency email printout at home that was not marked as classified. (Mr. Drake pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.)   J. William Leonard, a former director of the government's Information Security Oversight Office, said that in Mrs. Clinton's case, criminal charges like those against Mr. Drake are highly unlikely. But as a former security official, he said, he was dismayed by her exclusive use of private email. The State Department has an obligation to monitor unclassified email for exactly this kind of classified spillage, he said, as well as to protect computer systems and provide emails to Congress or the public when required by law.   ''The agency can't fulfill those legal responsibilities if it doesn't have control over the server,'' Mr. Leonard said.   What Might Be Next   The man whose dogged Benghazi investigation brought to light the email issue, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, insists he is not running a partisan witch hunt to damage Mrs. Clinton's presidential run. A former prosecutor and chairman of the select committee, he said in an interview that what he called ''this arrangement she had with herself'' has raised important questions about preserving public records and protecting government secrets.   Mr. Gowdy expressed satisfaction that the email investigation is now ''in the hands of the premier law enforcement agency in the world,'' the F.B.I. The discovery of the email issue alone refutes claims that after multiple congressional inquiries into Benghazi, there was nothing more to find, he said.   The committee's top Democrat, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, said his concern has always been that the Benghazi inquiry -- which he said comes on top of ''seven or eight'' investigations already conducted -- would become a tool for Republicans who want to bash Mrs. Clinton. He said he believed that to a considerable degree, that is what has happened. ''We have basically an unlimited budget to go after Hillary Clinton,'' he said.   But Mr. Cummings noted that the former secretary of state has herself said it was a mistake to use only the private email, and said he agreed that it was ''inappropriate.''   ''I think it's very important that the public knows what's going on with regard to government,'' he said. ''I think the public should have access to that information, period.''

Partnership Boosts Users Over China's Great Firewall,"HONG KONG --  It is one of the best-guarded borders in the world, and one of the most time-consuming to cross. Yet in the past few months, a new agreement has let people speed over it billions of times. The border is the digital one that divides China from the rest of the world. It is laden with inefficiencies and a series of filters known as the Great Firewall, which slows Internet traffic to a crawl as it travels into and out of China.     Now, a partnership between an American start-up and a Chinese Internet behemoth has created a sort of fast lane to speed traffic across the border. In the process, the two companies are establishing a novel business model with implications for other American technology firms looking to do business in China's politically sensitive tech industry.    The partnership, signed in July 2014, is between CloudFlare, a security company based in San Francisco, and Baidu, China's equivalent of Google. Using a mixture of CloudFlare's web traffic technology and Baidu's network of data centers in China, the two created a service that enables websites to load more quickly across China's border. The service, called Yunjiasu, began operating in December. It has a unified network that makes foreign sites more easily accessible in China, and allows Chinese sites to run in destinations outside the country.   At the heart of the arrangement is an unusual structure known as a virtual joint venture. Under that arrangement, CloudFlare does not actually operate in China. Instead, CloudFlare cooperates primarily from afar as Baidu runs the business in China.   Baidu and CloudFlare's virtual joint venture relies on a principle generally considered anathema to foreign companies looking to do business with China: trust. CloudFlare transferred its intellectual property that is used to manage and speed up Internet traffic to Baidu and works closely with its engineers to run that technology on Baidu's network in China. The two share revenue from the service.   The virtual joint venture could prove to be a new model for American tech firms that are considering doing business in the delicate areas of China's tech industry. Companies including Uber, LinkedIn and Airbnb have recently sought to expand in China by using the political connections and sway of Chinese investors to clear a path to opening and running their own businesses there. Yet because of the Chinese government's preoccupation with how the Internet is run and controlled within its borders, that was not an option for CloudFlare and Baidu.   ''With the right Chinese companies, there's going to be more of these types of deals,'' like virtual joint ventures, said Carmen Chang, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm that has invested in CloudFlare. As China's largest Internet companies have grown, so have their international ambitions and exposure to international laws, ultimately relieving some tech companies in the United States of the paranoia many have when they contemplate going to China, she said.   For CloudFlare, a five-year-old company that manages Internet traffic for millions of websites and makes browsing quicker and more secure, the central question was whether to transfer its intellectual property and give up local control or to forgo the vast business opportunities in China.   Outside of the high-profile sites that Beijing sees as a threat and blocks -- like Facebook and Twitter -- are a huge number of businesses that suffer under China's network inefficiencies. Those are the customers the service is targeting. And since the fast-lane service began operating, CloudFlare and Baidu said they have registered 450,000 businesses that account for 57 billion page views per month.   Customers can try the service free, though CloudFlare and Baidu added supplemental security features and greater control over web traffic last month, both of which must be paid for.   Matthew Prince, CloudFlare's chief executive, said transferring the company's intellectual property to Baidu enabled a deeper trust and a partnership. He added that the intellectual property is not the most critical part of the company.   ''We had much less apprehension about sharing our code, because we don't think there's any line of code we write that's so clever that gives us a sustained advantage,'' Mr. Prince said. ''That comes from the network itself.''   Still, to be safe, Baidu and CloudFlare worked out a contract that gives each company control over crucial elements and would inflict penalties if either partner withdrew. For example, Baidu controls customer information within China, but CloudFlare owns the web address through which the entire operation works.   ''At some level, we designed the contract so we both have leverage,'' said Joshua Motta, CloudFlare's head of special projects. ''We're both pointing guns at one another, to some extent.''   To work out the arrangement, Baidu's president for new business, Ya-Qin Zhang, said the company was in contact with Chinese regulators from the beginning of its negotiations with CloudFlare.   ''We emphasized the fact that working with CloudFlare was really going to benefit the vast majority of Internet companies in China and allow us to provide better services to them -- that it creates value for both Chinese and American companies,'' he wrote in an email.   Not actually operating in China spares CloudFlare some of the difficulties faced by other recent American entrants into the country. For example, the professional social network LinkedIn agreed to censor sensitive content posted in China in order to expand its business there, which has stirred controversy with users. And Uber has been pushing to host the data it collects on Chinese drivers and customers locally to comply with Chinese laws.   For CloudFlare, the burden of dealing with local Chinese laws falls largely on Baidu, which has full control of data for the China service. CloudFlare stores its customer data on servers outside of China, offering encryption options that enable secure cross-border payments.   ''From a technical perspective, we could give up a lot of control without putting our customers at additional risk or doing anything that might make us uncomfortable about sharing information,'' Mr. Prince said.   CloudFlare, which has raised $72 million in venture capital and is valued at more than $1 billion, has long had its eye on the Chinese market. In 2013, it met with several Chinese web firms, including Baidu, about a partnership. Mr. Motta said that, with guidance from CloudFlare's Chinese engineers, the company decided Baidu and CloudFlare had more of a shared ethos.   The partnership faced bumps. Just weeks before Baidu and CloudFlare were about to sign the agreement in 2014, an online voting platform that was set up as an informal referendum on the political future of Hong Kong was hit by a huge cyberattack.   Using its global network of data centers and its ability to control Internet traffic, CloudFlare mitigated the so-called distributed denial-of-service attack. Though it remains unclear who was behind the attack, the obvious political motive led to concerns that the deal would be scuppered.   ''There was definitely a moment there where it wasn't entirely clear whether that situation would spook Baidu or spook the government, and we handled it, I think, in a very professional way,'' Mr. Motta said.   With the fast-lane service, the companies estimate that the network has processed requests from about 207 million users in China in the last month, or roughly one-third of China's total Internet-using population. They estimated that over a period of 24 hours on Wednesday, the service saved about 243 years in time that users in China would have otherwise spent waiting for pages to download.   Among those who have embraced the service is ChaseFuture, a start-up in Shanghai that advises university applicants in China on applying to international institutions. With a site that hosts large amounts of video, ChaseFuture had struggled to keep its service quick both inside and outside China.   ''With servers in China, download times in America were atrocious, but with them outside China, it creates the reverse issue with clients who trust us waiting 15 or 20 seconds for a page to load, if it does at all,'' said Greg Nance, ChaseFuture's chief executive and founder.   The Baidu-CloudFlare service has solved the problems, Mr. Nance said.   ''Someone was going to change the way the Internet works in China through this kind of structure, and they're well on the way to doing so,'' he said.    "
"Chinese Hackings Still Detected, Despite Pact","HONG KONG --  It was heralded as the first concrete step taken by the United States and China on the thorny issue of online espionage. With President Xi Jinping of China beside him at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden last month, President Obama said the two had come to an agreement that China and the United States would refrain from attacks aimed at pilfering company intellectual property or trade secrets for commercial advantage.    Less than a day after that announcement and after Mr. Xi had met in Seattle with the executives of leading American technology companies, a hacking group accused of having links to the Chinese government attacked one such company, looking for trade secrets.    In a blog post on Monday, the security services provider CrowdStrike, based in Irvine, Calif., said that it had tracked a number of attacks on American tech and pharmaceutical companies leading up to and after Mr. Xi's visit to the United States last month. (Mr. Xi has been logging airtime, making his first state visit to Britain this week.)   ''We detected and stopped the actors, so no exfiltration of customer data actually took place,'' according to the post, written by the CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer, Dmitri Alperovitch.   But more problematic, he wrote in the post, was that the attacks had continued in the three weeks since Washington and Beijing signed the security agreement.   The news of further hacking attempts is likely to put new pressure on the countries' agreement to limit attacks on private companies. A number of analysts had already expressed skepticism that the accord would lead to concrete changes in a Chinese policy they say has sought for years to plunder secrets from companies in the United States.   In announcing the agreement, Mr. Obama said the United States would be ''watching carefully'' to see if the accord led to progress, and he did not rule out economic sanctions against Chinese companies if the attacks continued.   Of those attacked, ''seven of the companies are firms in the technology or pharmaceuticals sectors, where the primary benefit of the intrusions seems clearly aligned to facilitate theft of intellectual property and trade secrets,'' Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the blog post.   ''The intrusion attempts are continuing to this day, with many of the China-affiliated actors persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures,'' he added.   According to the CrowdStrike blog post, several of the recent attacks were the responsibility of a group it calls Deep Panda, which the company said it had tracked for many years. Deep Panda often goes after strategic national security targets, but it has also hacked companies in an array of industries, including in agriculture, finance, chemicals and technology.   Mr. Alperovitch did not write that the continued hackings were evidence that the deal had failed, though he called for the Obama administration to explain what it expected the agreement to accomplish.   ''The fact that there is some time delay between agreement and execution is not entirely unexpected,'' Mr. Alperovitch wrote. ''But we need to know the parameters for success, and whether the parties to the agreement discussed a time frame for implementation, or, instead, expected it to be immediate.''   In one of the first major markers of Chinese action against the attacks, the country arrested a number of hackers who were said to have stolen secrets of United States companies before Mr. Xi's American visit, according to The Washington Post.   Even so, further attacks were likely to be viewed as a setback. Though China is home to a hard-to-control and diffuse network of state-affiliated hackers, it would probably be fairly simple for Beijing to control a central group like Deep Panda.    "
Former JPMorgan Executive Blythe Masters Joins Bitcoin-Related Start-Up,"A prominent former executive at JPMorgan Chase has left the world of commodity trading for the virtual world of digital transactions. Blythe Masters, who until last year was the head of JPMorgan's giant commodities unit, is joining Digital Asset Holdings, a Bitcoin-related start-up that is looking to use Bitcoin's underlying technology to streamline financial transactions.    The company, a relative newcomer to the Bitcoin industry, is not a trading platform or an exchange. Rather, it plans to provide software to customers that it says will improve the financial transaction process by making it faster, cheaper and more secure.    ''We're not seeking to disintermediate and destroy the current financial system,'' Ms. Masters said in an interview on Wednesday. ''We're seeking to make it stronger, better and safer.''   Like a number of Bitcoin-related start-ups that have cropped up recently, Digital Asset is not so much interested in Bitcoin as a currency, but in the technology that makes Bitcoin possible. Underlying Bitcoin is the block chain, a decentralized ledger that permanently stores information and is driven by cryptography. Digital Asset intends to allow customers to use the block chain for financial transactions to cut costs and reduce the settlement time.   Ms. Masters said she had talks with the Federal Reserve, New York State's Department of Financial Services and the Bank of England about Digital Asset to determine how regulated financial institutions like banks can use the start-up's technology. There have also been discussions about whether the start-up itself should be regulated, because it may not fit the criteria for regulation that has been proposed by the Department of Financial Services. That proposal, which is currently waiting for public comment, specifies that companies involved in trading and holding Bitcoins will be regulated. Digital Asset, however, essentially intends to provide a network that makes trading easier, Ms. Masters said.   Although Digital Asset is focusing more on the block chain, the news that Ms. Masters, a star at JPMorgan, had joined a Bitcoin-related start-up sent ripples through the virtual currency industry. After all, many Bitcoin supporters have been waiting for someone as well known in the financial world as Ms. Masters to show an interest in the virtual currency.   And if anyone could bring legitimacy to Bitcoin and its technology, it might be Ms. Masters, who joined JPMorgan as a college intern about 30 years ago and, at 28, became the youngest managing director the bank had ever had. Later, she helped pioneer credit default swaps, the financial instruments that eventually helped fuel the mortgage crisis. Before leaving the bank last year, she had held a number of prominent roles, including chief financial officer of the investment bank and head of the commodities unit. She announced her intention to leave the bank last April after her commodities operations stopped performing up to expectations.   Since its creation in 2009, by a programmer or group of programmers going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has become a technology and financial industry phenomenon. But most Bitcoin companies lack people with any previous financial experience.   What Ms. Masters said she hoped to bring to Digital Asset -- and the Bitcoin industry as a whole -- was the knowledge that came with her decades of experience in the traditional financial world.   ''You've got a lot of smart people and brilliant technologists and venture capital money flocking into this space with a vision that genuinely represents progress,'' she said. ''There's a need for people like me.''   She also said she was looking forward to solving problems in the financial markets.   ''The scale of the opportunity is gigantic,'' she said. ''It's also fun to be able to work at the cutting edge of deploying today's amazing modern technology into worlds where it hasn't been used yet.''    "
Decoding the Enigma of Bitcoin's Birth,"It is one of the great mysteries of the digital age. The hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin, has captivated even those who think the virtual currency is some sort of online Ponzi scheme. A legend has emerged from a jumble of facts: Someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto released the software for Bitcoin in early 2009 and communicated with the nascent currency's users via email -- but never by phone or in person. Then, in 2011, just as the technology began to attract wider attention, the emails stopped. Suddenly, Satoshi was gone, but the stories grew larger.    Over the last year, as I worked on a book about the history of Bitcoin, it was hard to avoid being drawn in by the almost mystical riddle of Satoshi Nakamoto's identity. Just as I began my research, Newsweek made a splash with a cover article in March 2014 claiming that Satoshi was an unemployed engineer in his 60s who lived in suburban Los Angeles. Within a day of publication, however, most people knowledgeable about Bitcoin had concluded that the magazine had the wrong man.    Many in the Bitcoin community told me that, in deference to the Bitcoin creator's clear desire for privacy, they didn't want to see the wizard unmasked. But even among those who said this, few could resist debating the clues the founder left behind. As I had these conversations with the programmers and entrepreneurs who are most deeply involved in Bitcoin, I encountered a quiet but widely held belief that much of the most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo.   Mr. Szabo is nearly as much of a mystery as Satoshi. But in the course of my reporting I kept turning up new hints that drew me further into the chase, and I even stumbled into a rare encounter with Mr. Szabo at a private gathering of top Bitcoin programmers and entrepreneurs.   At that event, Mr. Szabo denied that he was Satoshi, as he has consistently in electronic communications, including in an email on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that his history left little question that he was among a small group of people who, over decades, working sometimes cooperatively and sometimes in competition, laid the foundation for Bitcoin and created many parts that later went into the virtual currency. Mr. Szabo's most notable contribution was a Bitcoin predecessor known as bit gold that achieved many of the same goals using similar tools of advanced math and cryptography.   It may be impossible to prove Satoshi's identity until the person or people behind Bitcoin's curtain decide to come forward and prove ownership of Satoshi's old electronic accounts. At this point, the creator's identity is no longer important to Bitcoin's future. Since Satoshi stopped contributing to the project in 2011, most of the open-source code has been rewritten by a group of programmers whose identities are known.   But Mr. Szabo's story provides insight into often misunderstood elements of Bitcoin's creation. The software was not a bolt out of the blue, as is sometimes assumed, but was instead built on the ideas of multiple people over several decades.   This history is more than just a matter of curiosity. The software has come to be viewed in academic and financial circles as a significant computer science breakthrough that may reshape the way money looks and moves. Recently, banks like Goldman Sachs have taken the first steps toward embracing the technology.   Mr. Szabo himself has continued to be quietly involved in the work. In the beginning of 2014, Mr. Szabo joined Vaurum, a Bitcoin start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., that was operating in stealth mode and that aimed to build a better Bitcoin exchange. After his arrival, Mr. Szabo helped reorient the company to take advantage of the Bitcoin software's capability for so-called smart contracts, which enable self-executing financial transactions, according to people briefed on the company's operations who spoke on condition of anonymity.   After Mr. Szabo led the company in a new direction, it was renamed Mirror, and it recently raised $12.5 million from several prominent venture capitalists, these people said. The company declined to comment for this article.   Mr. Szabo's role at Vaurum has been kept a secret because of his desire for privacy, and he left in late 2014 after becoming nervous about public exposure, according to the people briefed on the company's operations. While he was still there, though, the array of arcane skills and knowledge at his command led several colleagues to conclude that Mr. Szabo was most likely involved in the creation of Bitcoin, even if he didn't do it all himself.   I met Mr. Szabo, a large bearded man, in March 2014 at a Bitcoin event at the Lake Tahoe vacation home of Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, Pantera Capital. Mr. Szabo worked for Vaurum at the time. Mr. Morehead and other hedge fund executives in attendance dressed in expensive loafers and slim-cut jeans; Mr. Szabo, his bald pate encircled by a ring of salt-and-pepper hair, wore beat-up black sneakers and an untucked striped shirt.   While he kept to himself, I managed to corner him in the kitchen during the cocktail hour. He was notably reserved and deflected questions about where he lived and had worked, but he bristled when I cited what was being said about him on the Internet -- including that he was a law professor at George Washington University -- and the notion that he had created Bitcoin.   ''Well, I will say this, in the hope of setting the record straight,'' he said acidly. ''I'm not Satoshi, and I'm not a college professor. In fact, I never was a college professor.''   The conversation grew less heated when I asked about the origin of the many complicated pieces of code and cryptography that went into the Bitcoin software, and about the small number of people who would have had the expertise to put them together. Mr. Szabo mentioned bit gold, saying it harnessed many of the same obscure concepts, like secure property titles and digital time stamps, that made Bitcoin possible.   ''There are a whole bunch of parallels,'' he told me. ''I mean, the reason people tag me is because you can go through secure property titles and bit gold -- there are so many parallels between that and Bitcoin that you can't find anywhere else.''   When I asked if he believed that Satoshi had been familiar with his work, Mr. Szabo said he understood why there was so much speculation about his own role: ''All I'm saying is, there are all these parallels, and it looks funny to me, and looks funny to a lot of other people.''   Dinner began, interrupting the conversation, and I never got another chance to talk to Mr. Szabo.   When I emailed him on Wednesday, he repeated his denial: ''As I've stated many times before, all this speculation is flattering, but wrong -- I am not Satoshi.''   Many concepts central to Bitcoin were developed in an online community known as the Cypherpunks, a loosely organized group of digital privacy activists. As part of their mission, they set out to create digital money that would be as anonymous as physical cash. Mr. Szabo was a member, and in 1993, he wrote a message to fellow Cypherpunks describing the diverse motivations of attendees at a group meeting that had just taken place. Some people, he wrote, ''are libertarians who want government out of our lives, others are liberals fighting the N.S.A., others find it great fun to ding people in power with cool hacks.''   Mr. Szabo had a libertarian mind-set. He was drawn to those ideas partly, he told me, because of his father, who fought the communists in Hungary in the 1950s before coming to the United States, where Mr. Szabo was born 51 years ago. Reared in Washington State, Mr. Szabo studied computer science at the University of Washington.   Several experiments in digital cash circulated on the Cypherpunk lists in the 1990s. Adam Back, a British researcher, created one called hashcash that later became a central component of Bitcoin. Another, called b money, was designed by an intensely private computer engineer named Wei Dai.   When these experiments failed to take off, many Cypherpunks lost interest. But not Mr. Szabo. He worked for six months as a consultant for a company called DigiCash, he has written on his blog. In 1998, he sent the outline for his own version of digital money, which he called bit gold, to a small group that was still pursuing the project, including Mr. Dai and Hal Finney, a programmer based in Santa Barbara, Calif., who tried to create a working version of bit gold.   The concept behind bit gold was very similar to Bitcoin: It included a digital token that was scarce, like gold, and could be sent electronically without needing to pass through a central authority like a bank.   This history points to the important role that Mr. Szabo and several others played in developing the building blocks that went into Bitcoin. When Satoshi Nakamoto's paper describing Bitcoin appeared in the fall of 2008, it cited Mr. Back's hashcash. The first people Satoshi emailed privately were Mr. Back and Mr. Dai, both men have said. And Mr. Finney, who recently died, helped Satoshi improve the Bitcoin software in the fall of 2008, before it was publicly released, according to emails shared with me by Mr. Finney and his family.   It is, though, Mr. Szabo's activity in 2008, as Bitcoin emerged into the world, that has generated much of the suspicion about his role in the project. That spring, before anyone had ever heard of Satoshi Nakamoto or Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo revived his bit gold idea on his personal blog, and in an online conversation about creating a live version of the virtual currency, he asked his readers: ''Anybody want to help me code one up?''   After Bitcoin appeared, Mr. Szabo reposted the item on his blog in a way that changed the date at the top and made it appear as though it was written after Bitcoin's release, archived versions of the website show.   Mr. Szabo's writing about bit gold from that time contains many striking parallels with Satoshi's description of Bitcoin, including similar phrasings and even common writing mannerisms. In 2014, researchers at Aston University, in England, compared the writing of several people who have been suspected to be Satoshi and found that none matched up nearly as well as Mr. Szabo's. The similarity was ''uncanny,'' said Jack Grieve, the lecturer who led the effort.   When I went back and read Mr. Szabo's online writings, it was obvious that in the year before Satoshi appeared on the scene and released Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo was again thinking seriously about digital money.   He wrote frequently, over several months, about the concepts involved in digital money, including those smart contracts, a concept so specialized that Mr. Szabo is often given credit for inventing the term. Smart contracts later showed up as an essential piece of the Bitcoin software.   Mr. Szabo's blog explained why he was examining these issues with such passion: The global financial crisis then underway suggested to him that the monetary system was broken and in need of replacement.   ''For those who love our once and future freedoms, now is the time to strike,'' Mr. Szabo wrote in an item on his blog in late 2007 endorsing the libertarian Ron Paul's bid for the presidency, in part because of Mr. Paul's views on the financial system.   For many Bitcoin watchers, just as notable as what Mr. Szabo wrote in that period was his silence once Bitcoin appeared in October 2008. After all, the virtual currency was an experiment in everything he had been writing about for years. Unlike Mr. Dai, Mr. Finney and Mr. Back, Mr. Szabo has not released any correspondence from Satoshi from this period or acknowledged communicating with him.   Mr. Szabo first made brief mention of Bitcoin on his blog in mid-2009, and in 2011, when the currency was still struggling to gain traction, he wrote about it again at greater length, noting the similarity between bit gold and Bitcoin. He acknowledged that few people would have had the expertise and the instinct to create either of them:   ''Myself, Wei Dai and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).''   That item, in May 2011, was one of the last posts Mr. Szabo made before he went on a lengthy hiatus to work, he said later, on a new concept he called temporal programming.   May 2011 was also the last time Satoshi communicated privately with other Bitcoin contributors. In an email that month to Martti Malmi, one of the earliest participants, Satoshi wrote, ''I've moved on to other things and probably won't be around in the future.''   Whoever it is, the real Satoshi Nakamoto has many good reasons for wanting to stay anonymous. Perhaps the most obvious is potential danger. Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine researcher, has concluded that Satoshi Nakamoto most likely collected nearly a million Bitcoins during the system's first year. Given that each Bitcoin is now worth about $240, the stash could be worth more than $200 million. That could make Satoshi a target.   With his modest clothes and unassuming manner, Mr. Szabo could be the kind of person who could have a fortune and not spend any of it -- or even throw away the keys to the bank. People who know him say he drives a car from the 1990s.   That modest outward appearance hasn't diminished the deference toward him among Bitcoin cognoscenti. Potential employees were drawn to Vaurum when they heard that Mr. Szabo worked there, people who interviewed at the company said. They wanted to work alongside the person they suspected could be Satoshi Nakamoto -- or who at least participated in Bitcoin's invention.

News Corp. Set to Rehire Acquitted Executive,"Rebekah Brooks, the former head of Rupert Murdoch's media holdings in Britain, acquitted last year on charges related to the phone hacking scandal, is likely to return to News Corporation to focus on new avenues for digital and social media, people familiar with the company's plans said.  Ms. Brooks will probably take an executive role in which she will seek ways to expand News Corporation's digital endeavors, particularly user-generated and social media. That will include working with Storyful, a company that monitors social media for newsworthy material, which was acquired in 2013.     She has not yet signed a contract, said two people familiar with internal plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal a confidential matter, and her precise role has not been formalized. It is likely that she will be based in Britain, though she will not work from the headquarters of News Corporation's British subsidiary, News UK.   A report in The Mail on Sunday said that she would seek new online acquisitions for Mr. Murdoch in New York. The Financial Times earlier reported that she would run Storyful.    Ms. Brooks was acquitted of phone hacking and three other charges last June. In the fall, she was seen in New York at News Corporation's headquarters and having brunch with Mr. Murdoch in Park Slope.   At the time, News Corporation responded to speculation about a new position by saying that she had been ''reconnecting with friends and meeting with businesses as she explores and considers her professional future.''   Since then Ms. Brooks has looked into a number of options for restarting a career that seemed to have been stalled by accusations of involvement in the interception the voice mail messages of public figures.    In Britain, she had been known for her meteoric rise from secretary to tabloid kingmaker as the editor of The News of the World and The Sun to media executive and confidante of the political elite, including Prime Minister David Cameron.    A representative of News Corporation declined to comment.     "
A Murdoch Lieutenant Is Back at Her Old Job,"Rupert Murdoch keeps his promises. On Wednesday, after months of careful machinations behind the scenes to find the right time and the right role, it was announced that Rebekah Brooks would return to her old job as chief executive of Mr. Murdoch's British media operation, now named News UK.     Four years ago, in the midst of the phone hacking scandal, as Mr. Murdoch faced a wave of revulsion from the British public over his newspapers' interceptions of private voice mail messages for scoops, he was asked to identify his chief priority in the crisis.   He pointed to Ms. Brooks, who had risen from secretary to editor of two of his tabloid newspapers to chief executive of his British media operations, and said, ''This one.''   At the time, Ms. Brooks was widely reviled within the company. Many there suggested that Mr. Murdoch had shuttered the tabloid at the center of the scandal, The News of the World, costing many people their jobs, in an effort to save her. She subsequently stepped down and was arrested and accused of phone hacking, among other crimes. She was later acquitted.   The statement announcing her return mentioned nothing of the phone-hacking scandal, though it did mention that she had been cleared during ''investigations of various U.K. newspaper groups.'' It said she was ''returning to a post that she held four years ago, and will have added responsibilities for the acquisition and development of digital properties.''   Ms. Brooks also declined to mention the circumstances of her return. ''I am delighted to return to News UK,'' she said in the statement announcing her return. ''It is a privilege to be back amongst the most talented journalists and executives in the business. I am confident that we can meet the many challenges of this digital age with a combination of cutting-edge technologies and world-class journalism.''   She will start on Monday.    "
The Tax Con Cometh," Q. I got mail claiming to be from the Internal Revenue Service and am pretty sure it's a fraud, but how can I tell? Does the I.R.S. even contact people by email?    A. You may get email regarding a continuing matter, but as stated on its website, the Internal Revenue Service ''doesn't initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media channels to request personal or financial information.''   The agency does not ask for PINs or passwords for your credit cards, bank account or other financial accounts, either.    If you get such a message, do not reply to it. Nor should you click on any links or attachments included with the text. The agency asks that you forward the message to phishing@irs.gov and delete the original from your mailbox.   Scams that take advantage of the tax system are year-round and can include attempts to contact you by telephone and text message as well. The agency has a list of alerts, podcasts and other information for taxpayers at irs.gov/uac/Tax-Scams-Consumer-Alerts.   Locking Up a Mac Folder   Q. Can a single folder in an Apple MacBook be secured with a password?   A. File-security programs like Espionage and Knox are out there for the Mac, but Apple includes at least one way within OS X to password-protect a folder: You can create an encrypted disk image that can be opened only with a password. To do so, start in Mac's Applications folder, which you can easily get to from the Go menu in the desktop Finder. Once in the Applications folder, open the Utilities folder and then open the Disk Utility program.   In Disk Utility, go in the File menu to New, and then select ''Disk Image from Folder.'' Next, select the folder you want to password-protect and click the Image button. In the next box, choose a format for your folder, like Compressed or Read/Write (if you want to edit the contents). Select an encryption level, either the recommended 128-bit AES Encryption or 256-bit AES Encryption (which is more secure but takes longer to encrypt). Click the Save button.   Because you have opted to encrypt the folder's contents, you will next be asked to provide a password. Enter and verify your password, and make sure to uncheck the box next to ''Remember password in my keychain.'' When you click the O.K. button, OS X creates an encrypted image of the folder. When you see the icon with the .dmg file extension, you can delete the original folder. (Making a backup to a secure external drive and safely tucking it away can bring peace of mind if you are nervous about deleting that original folder.)   To open the protected folder, double-click the disk-image icon and supply the password.   Apple has its official instructions for creating encrypted disk images at support.apple.com/en-us/HT201599, and information about the FileVault 2 utility for encrypting your entire drive is at support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790.

Protecting Your Mac From Malware and Viruses,"Q. I thought Macs were supposed to be protected from malware, but I've gotten those fake tech support pop-ups and ads in Safari. I have to force the browser to quit to get away from them. Could my Mac be infected?  A. Recent versions of Mac OS X include built-in malware protection like file quarantine and plug-in blocking, and the system has incorporated a number of other safety features. Still, these defenses may not be enough to keep the Mac clear of evolving threats. While Windows users have traditionally been the primary target of malicious software, times have changed. Mac users should not assume their machines are impervious to spyware, viruses and other intrusive code -- hacked web pages and malware programs written to specifically attack OS X are out there.    If you are seeing a lot of intrusive ads and fraudulent system alert messages when you browse the web, your Mac may have picked up a piece of unwanted software in your travels. Apple's site has a guide to dealing with pop-ups and adware that hamper its Safari browser.   Third-party security programs can also help protect your system, and the Mac App Store has a number of antivirus apps for OS X. If your main concern is adware and malware, free tools like Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac and Bitdefender Virus Scanner for Mac can catch a number of invasive programs.   Changing Case in Microsoft Word   Q. I occasionally hit the Caps Lock key by mistake and type away for minutes without noticing in Word 2010. Is there an easy way convert this all-caps section into standard upper- and lowercase characters without retyping?   A. Most versions of Microsoft Word for Windows and Mac OS X include a Change Case command that flips the selected text into one of several styles. You can convert a chunk of text typed in all uppercase letters to sentence case, which capitalizes the first word of a sentence and lowercases the rest. (You may have to go back to capitalize proper nouns, though.) The Change Case command can also switch a selected block of lowercase letters to uppercase or capitalize each word in a highlighted section.   To use the Change Case command in Word 2010 for Windows, select the text you want to convert. Then click the Change Case button on the Ribbon's Home tab; the button's icon looks like an uppercase and lowercase letter A side by side.   You can also get to the Change Case command with a Windows keyboard shortcut. When you have selected the text you want to convert, press the Shift and F3 keys to cycle through all the case options, and stop on the one you want.   The Change Case command works the same way in Word 2013 and Word 2016 for Windows, but may vary within earlier versions of Microsoft Word. In some versions of Word for Mac OS X, the Change Case command can be found under the Format menu; to use the keyboard shortcut, press Option-Command-C, which will cycle through the case styles.

Bitcoin Foundation Parts Ways With Its Global Policy Counsel,"Jim Harper, whose appointment as the Bitcoin Foundation's global policy counsel last March was viewed as a sign that the advocacy group was taking digital currency regulation seriously, has been dismissed from the foundation.  Mr. Harper's last day was Wednesday, though he received notice of the foundation's decision shortly after Thanksgiving. Mr. Harper's dismissal comes as the Bitcoin Foundation is shifting its focus, from policy advocacy to Bitcoin technology and infrastructure development.   ""We're changing direction a little bit here,"" said Patrick Murck, the foundation's executive director.  ""The policy aspect was more of a distraction and a drain on resources that we could handle at the moment,"" he added. ""Without having that work to be done, there really wasn't a huge role for Jim to do."" Before joining the Bitcoin Foundation, Mr. Harper served as director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group. He will remain at Cato as a senior fellow, a reduced role he took when he moved to the Bitcoin Foundation. For his part, Mr. Harper said he wasn't quite ready to cut all ties to the Bitcoin Foundation, despite a difference of opinion on the foundation's direction. In an interview, Mr. Harper said he was still running for a position on the foundation's board.  Mr. Harper is running for election alongside a number of other Bitcoin enthusiasts, including Cody Wilson, who has opposed Bitcoin regulation and told the Upstart Business Journal that he was running ""on a platform of the complete dissolution of the Bitcoin Foundation."" The board election will take place in mid-February. ""My experience at the foundation was that it wasn't an organization that had a lot of focus and direction,"" Mr. Harper said in an interview. ""Part of the reason I'm running for the board is because, whether I work there or not, I think the Bitcoin Foundation should have solid leadership and management from the top all the way down."" When Mr. Harper joined the Bitcoin Foundation last year, regulators across the globe were grappling with how to treat virtual currency. At the time, Bitcoin supporters were reeling from the collapse of Mt. Gox, one of the biggest online Bitcoin exchanges. Mt. Gox had filed for bankruptcy protection after announcing that nearly 750,000 of its customers' Bitcoins, worth close to $500 million, had gone missing. Only months earlier, the online bazaar Silk Road, which was seen as a marketplace for illegal drugs and other illicit goods, had been shut down by federal authorities. Now, however, Bitcoin appears in many ways to have shed its image as an outlaw currency.  Bitcoin supporters had been concerned with legitimizing the virtual currency to law enforcement, regulators and the public. But buoyed by clearer regulatory frameworks and the success of recent events - like the federal government's two Bitcoin auctions - some supporters are turning their attention to Bitcoin's core software development with the hopes of easing widespread adoption.   ""There's little doubt that we added tremendous value to the community by properly framing the conversation and building bridges for the Bitcoin community to engage directly with the regulators,"" the Bitcoin Foundation wrote in a blog post last month about its new focus. ""Others have followed and established policy organizations with clear and focused missions, a development that gives us the opportunity to focus on supporting Bitcoin Core and building the technical infrastructure needed to grow the Bitcoin network."" Still, Mr. Murck, who replaced Jon Matonis, one of the foundation's founding board members, as executive director in October, praised Mr. Harper's role in the foundation's early policy initiatives but reiterated that their views on the foundation's goals had diverged. ""I think Jim disagrees with the focus,"" Mr. Murck said. ""I would hope that at a personal level, it's still amicable."" "
"As Bitcoin's Price Slides, Signs of a Squeeze","The price of Bitcoin slid further on Tuesday, dipping to its lowest level since the spring of 2013.  The downward spiral, which began early last year, suggests that confidence in the virtual currency may be dwindling. Bitcoin's price dropped on Tuesday to about $224, from $267, according to CoinDesk, below where it was in April 2013 before Bitcoin gained widespread traction and started to soar in price. It reached its peak of about $1,200 that December. Since then, however, prices have slumped even as transactions have increased. With no signs of a rally in the offing, the industry is bracing for the effects of a prolonged decline in prices. In particular, Bitcoin mining companies, which are essential to the currency's underlying technology, are flashing warning signs.  ""Will people lose confidence? Absolutely,"" said Greg Schvey, a partner at TradeBlock, which provides data on virtual currency. Bitcoin had regained some of its losses on Tuesday afternoon to trade at about $235. For the most part, Bitcoin supporters are quick to dismiss the currency's yearlong slide, saying the price - and the volatility - is only one aspect of the virtual currency. Paying attention to price, they say, ignores the importance of Bitcoin's underlying technology, which is agnostic to its market value. Still, the industry is starting to feel the effects of the sustained decline. Some mining companies that invested heavily in resources when the price of Bitcoin was rising, are struggling to keep their operations open. ""It obviously makes the environment for Bitcoin businesses difficult,"" said Jonathan Levin, a digital currency consultant. Bitcoin miners are computers that run Bitcoin's open-source program and perform complex algorithms. If they find the solution before other miners, they are rewarded with a block of 25 Bitcoins - essentially ""unearthing"" new Bitcoins from the digital currency's decentralized network. Such mining operations, though potentially lucrative, are also very expensive, requiring huge amounts of equipment and electricity. Now, these miners, who had bet on a higher price of the virtual currency to pay for resources, are selling their Bitcoins to keep their electricity running and return money to their lenders. ""People have these very real fiat-based liabilities that they have to pony up for, and to do that, they're going to have to sell Bitcoins,"" Mr. Schvey of TradeBlock said. These sales could in turn be driving down the price further. One company, CEX.io, said on Monday that it had temporarily shut down its cloud mining operations, a move driven in part by decline in Bitcoin's price. ""Taking into consideration our users' interests, the recent Bitcoin price drop, as well as the upscaling of the mining difficulty, CEX.io Bitcoin exchange would like to announce a temporary suspension of cloud mining services provided by the platform at the time of the next difficulty increase,"" the company wrote in a blog post. And CoinTerra, a mining start-up based in Texas, is being sued in Utah by C7 Data Centers, a data center operator, accusing it of breach of contract over  $1.4 million in owed payments, according to a court filing. ""CoinTerra disputes the allegations in the complaint filed by C7 Data Centers in Utah State court,"" CoinTerra said in a statement. ""Moreover, CoinTerra has filed a counterclaim against C7 in federal court in the District of Utah. CoinTerra intends to vigorously prosecute its claims against C7 while defending the claims levied by C7."" CoinDesk reported last week that emails sent by CoinTerra to customers of its cloud mining business suggest that the company had defaulted on its debt obligations. Other Bitcoin start-ups, especially those dependent on price, may also be feeling the squeeze. And if the price continues to fall, investors may turn away from Bitcoin companies, Mr. Levin said. Even as the price of Bitcoin declines, sentiment still appears to be positive. According to Pantera's BitIndex, a measure of Bitcoin's medium-term prospects, is up 1 percent from last week. And in the last year, the number of transactions has increased significantly. ""At the end of the day, what will be determinative of Bitcoin being a success or failure is going to be whether people are using it,"" said Patrick Murck, the executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation. ""The day-to-day stuff with the price is kind of a side show."" "
Bitcoin Is a Victim of Disinflation,"Bitcoin is proving a big disappointment. The would-be currency is down 33 percent against the dollar so far in 2015, and 71 percent in the last year. There's almost certainly more bad news to come.  The electronic token has lots of enduring problems. As a store of value that is not subject to government intervention, it lacks the support of authorities and is always in danger of being banned. The market was illiquid to begin with and is becoming even more so, increasing the risk of abuse. Bitcoins generate no income, so they count as collectibles - more like an artwork than a few shares of Google. In these matters, beauty and value depend on the fickle eyes of the beholder and potential buyer. Anonymity and free transactions offer some allure. But the former leads to an association with illegal activity. The latter is an illusion, since someone has to pay for the computers used to process and store bitcoin information. Bitcoin ""miners"" provide the service in exchange for new Bitcoins. Right now, the biggest problem is psychology. In a more ebullient and inflationary world, the novelty and limited supply of Bitcoins might appeal. These days, disinflation and discontent are the dominant themes. Bitcoins touched $171.41 on Jan. 14 and on Jan. 16 traded at $216. At these levels, the economics of Bitcoin mining look terrible. Full cost of production is closer to $600 per token, based on a recent study by Australian researcher Hass McCook. If miners retreat, users may end up paying directly for the service. Defenders of Bitcoin have not given up hope. Their emphasis has shifted though, from the currency to the underlying blockchain processing software. That may be a good investment. It may even be revolutionary. But it will not bring up the price of Bitcoin. The currency is suffering an erosion of confidence from which it could be hard to recover.

Focus Is on Bitcoin Trader at Trial Over Black Market,"The man accused of operating the online black-market bazaar Silk Road was not the person government investigators had focused on early in their hunt, new court testimony shows. A federal agent said on Thursday in the trial of Ross W. Ulbricht in Manhattan that he became convinced in 2012 and 2013 that the person behind the Silk Road website was actually Mark Karpeles, the Tokyo-based owner and operator of the world's largest Bitcoin exchange. Bitcoin is the virtual currency that was used by tens of thousands of people to buy drugs anonymously on Silk Road, a site that existed only on a hidden part of the Internet. Mr. Karpeles's company handled more than 80 percent of the world's Bitcoin trading, and the agent acknowledged he believed that Mr. Karpeles saw Silk Road as a way to ''drive the price up.''  The revelation that Mr. Karpeles, who was not charged, had been a leading suspect in the Silk Road investigation was an unexpected turn in the trial of Mr. Ulbricht, 30, of San Francisco, who was arrested in October 2013 and accused of running the website. Mr. Ulbricht faces narcotics trafficking conspiracy and other charges. He has pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, had acknowledged in court that Silk Road was his client's idea, but said that Mr. Ulbricht had handed the enterprise off to others after several months and suggested that it was run by someone else under the screen name Dread Pirate Roberts. The testimony by the agent, Jared Der-Yeghiayan of the Department of Homeland Security, that Mr. Karpeles and an associate had become targets of the investigation was elicited under cross-examination by Mr. Dratel. ''Did you not say that you believed him to be the mastermind behind keeping the website secure and operating?'' Mr. Dratel asked, referring to Mr. Karpeles. ''He had the credentials to do so, yes,'' Mr. Der-Yeghiayan replied. ''But did you not say that?'' ''I would have said that, yes,'' the agent said. Mr. Der-Yeghiayan said that in August 2013, he took steps to prepare a search warrant for Mr. Karpeles's emails, saying there was probable cause to believe they contained evidence of narcotics trafficking and money laundering. Mr. Karpeles, asked for comment, denied in an email on Thursday that he was Dread Pirate Roberts. ''I am not the one sitting during the Silk Road trial, and I can only feel defense attorney Joshua Dratel trying everything he can to point the attention away from his client,'' he said. ''I have nothing to do with Silk Road,'' he added, ''and do not condone what has been happening there.'' The cross-examination appeared intended to raise doubt in jurors' minds about whether the right man was on trial. Mr. Dratel had told the jury that his client was ''lured back'' into Silk Road after the real Dread Pirate Roberts learned that he was under investigation and made Mr. Ulbricht the ''perfect fall guy.'' Mr. Karpeles had long been one of the most mysterious figures in the lucrative virtual currency industry that sprung up around Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by an anonymous creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The first exchange that allowed Bitcoins to be easily bought and sold was Mt. Gox, which Mr. Karpeles bought in early 2011, about the same time Silk Road came into existence. Despite facing several security breaches and other hurdles, Mr. Karpeles built Mt. Gox into the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, with tens of millions of dollars trading hands on some days. But in early 2014, Mr. Karpeles unexpectedly announced that his company had lost nearly all of the Bitcoins it held for customers, which were worth around $500 million at the time, and filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Der-Yeghiayan's team began tracking Mr. Karpeles in 2012. In May 2013, a separate investigation being run out of the Department of Homeland Security's Baltimore offices seized bank accounts that Mt. Gox had in the United States, holding almost $10 million.

"Coinbase, a Bitcoin Start-Up, Raises $75 Million in Vote of Confidence","Coinbase, one of the most popular Bitcoin wallet providers, announced on Tuesday that it had closed a $75 million financing round, the biggest yet for a virtual currency start-up. The announcement of the funding, led by DFJ Growth, could not have come at a better time for Bitcoin, whose price has plunged in recent months. Bitcoin proponents will probably seize upon Coinbase's latest funding round as a vote of confidence in the virtual currency and its underlying technology. ""If we thought there was a huge risk of Bitcoin going away, we obviously wouldn't have made this investment,"" said Barry Schuler, a managing director at DFJ Growth, who led the fund's investment in Coinbase.  Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase, sounded an equally optimistic tone. ""Investors still have a pretty high conviction on Bitcoin despite what the spot price of Bitcoin is doing,"" he said. ""This really is people putting their money where their mouth is in terms of betting on Bitcoin as a technology trend."" Coinbase, based in San Francisco, said it had completed its financing round by the middle of December, before the latest shock to Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin is now trading at about $210, from a peak of roughly $1,200 at the end of 2013. In total, Coinbase has collected over $105 million in venture capital. Andreessen Horowitz, which led a $25 million investment round in Coinbase in December 2013, also participated in Coinbase's most recent fund-raising, along with existing investors Union Square Ventures and Ribbit Capital. With its latest financing round, Coinbase has also received a nod from the established financial sector. New investors in Coinbase include the New York Stock Exchange, the financial services firm USAA and the Spanish bank BBVA. Vikram S. Pandit, a former chief executive of Citigroup, and Thomas H. Glocer, a former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, also invested in the round. Since its last round of financing in 2013, Coinbase has led the industry in helping merchants, including Dell and Overstock, integrate Bitcoin into their payment systems. It has also extended access to customers in 18 European countries. Still, Bitcoin is a long way from mainstream adoption. A prolonged price slump has invigorated skeptics, putting Bitcoin supporters on the defensive. And while many investors and virtual currency entrepreneurs have publicly shrugged off the effects - psychological and otherwise - of Bitcoin's downward spiral, there is nevertheless a sense of anxiety percolating through the industry. Bitcoin miners, for instance, are struggling to pay for the huge amount of electricity required to keep the Bitcoin network running. As Bitcoin's price has dropped, prominent Bitcoin enthusiasts have loudly voiced their support for the Bitcoin's technology, dismissing attention on the decline as unsophisticated and misplaced. In early January, for instance, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen shared his thoughts on Bitcoin in a series of tweets.  ""In the short run, Bitcoin is still highly useful as a transaction and trust network in many use cases even with high volatility,"" he wrote. ""The price of BTC has very little to do with the level of creativity of thinking that's going into new Bitcoin apps, or their usefulness."" For now, Coinbase's business model appears to rely heavily on people wanting to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin. The company said it was planning to expand to more countries - it hopes to extend access to 30 by the end of the year - and bring on more merchants. It also intends to improve its platform for developers and enhance its mobile technology. Coinbase now hosts 2.1 million consumer wallets, up from 600,000 at the end of 2013. The company said 38,000 merchants use its payments tools. But Coinbase's ties to Bitcoin as a currency, which so far have been its most accessible use case, is part of its appeal, Mr. Schuler of DFJ Growth said. ""You have to have a feel for how to engage consumers,"" he said. ""That's the real spark you see with these guys."" "
"Man Wrote of Creating Illicit Site, Jury Is Told","Long before the website Silk Road became an online black market for drugs and other illicit goods, it began its life of underground commerce with the sale of homegrown hallucinogenic mushrooms, prosecutors have said. The website's origins were highlighted on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, as prosecutors disclosed entries from a personal journal that they say were written by Ross W. Ulbricht, the man charged with creating Silk Road.    When Mr. Ulbricht, a 30-year-old California man, was arrested in October 2013, federal agents say they discovered the journal on his laptop computer.     ''I began working on a project that had been in my mind for over a year,'' Mr. Ulbricht wrote in one entry, prosecutors said. ''I was calling it Underground Brokers, but eventually settled on Silk Road. The idea was to create a website where people could buy anything anonymously, with no trail whatsoever that could lead back to them.''    It was on that website, on a hidden part of the Internet, prosecutors have charged, where thousands of vendors sold drugs and other illegal goods, using Bitcoins, a digital currency as anonymous as cash.   The government has said Mr. Ulbricht ran the site under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, a charge that Mr. Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, has denied. Mr. Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy and other counts.   The journal was cited by the government in late 2013 when it argued against bail for Mr. Ulbricht after he was arrested in a San Francisco library and brought to Manhattan to face charges. Last week, in an opening statement, a prosecutor said the journal had been found on Mr. Ulbricht's laptop, to which he was logged on as Dread Pirate Roberts at the time of his arrest.   ''That journal contains devastating confessions by the defendant,'' the prosecutor, Timothy T. Howard, told the jury.   Thomas Kiernan, a computer scientist with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified on Wednesday that Mr. Ulbricht's arrest had been carried out while he was using the laptop so agents could bypass encryption software to gain access to it.   The introduction of Mr. Ulbricht's writings seemed to be intended to link him to Silk Road's operations throughout its existence from 2011 to 2013.   ''I imagine that someday I may have a story written about my life and it would be good to have a detailed account of it,'' he wrote, according to an entry a prosecutor read aloud to the jury.   In other writings the government ascribes to Mr. Ulbricht, he said he hated working for others ''and trading my time for money with no investment in myself.''   As for the website idea: ''I had been studying the technology for a while, but needed a business model and strategy.''   He said he had decided to grow ''shrooms'' that he could sell cheaply on the site ''to get people interested.''   He described his optimism about his idea. ''In 2011, I am creating a year of prosperity and power beyond what I have ever experienced before,'' he wrote. ''Silk Road is going to become a phenomenon and at least one person will tell me about it, unknowing that I was its creator.''   At one point, Mr. Ulbricht described how he began the site: announcing it in Bitcoin discussion forums, taking his first order for mushrooms, and selling about 10 pounds in a couple of months.   As traffic grew, he wrote, ''I worked all day every day, still processing transactions by hand, dealing with scammers, answering messages, meeting new strange people through my site and getting to know them.''   When the website Gawker published an article about Silk Road, Mr. Ulbricht noted, there had been ''a huge spike in sign-ups.'' He also cited criticism by two United States senators, which put him ''into a bad state of mind,'' and made him feel ''extremely vulnerable and scared.''   Silk Road thrived, though, and as he made as much as $25,000 monthly, he decided to take the site ''to the next level,'' he wrote.   He described the hiring of employees -- prosecutors have said he never met them but knew and supervised them ''purely online'' -- one of whom had ''helped me see a larger vision,'' he wrote.   ''A brand that people can come to trust and rally behind,'' as he put it. ''Silk Road chat, Silk Road exchange, Silk Road credit union, Silk Road market, Silk Road everything!''    "
"Coinbase, a Bitcoin Exchange, Is Operating Without Licenses So Far","The most well-funded company in the Bitcoin industry appears to be operating without the proper licenses in the world's financial capital. Coinbase, a San Francisco-based company with funding from the New York Stock Exchange and other big investors, said earlier this week that it had opened as the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in several states, including New York.  But a spokesman for the top financial regulator in New York said that the company did not have the licenses necessary to operate as a Bitcoin exchange in the state. ""We are working with several companies, including Coinbase, on licensing and will continue to move forward expeditiously. That said, we have not yet issued any licenses to virtual currency firms,"" said Matthew Anderson, a spokesman for Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of the state's Department of Financial Services. The understanding in Mr Lawsky's office is that in order to operate as a Bitcoin exchange or broker a company would need a money transmission license and will, in the future, need a specialized BitLicense, which Mr. Lawsky's office is planning to unveil soon, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak about the office's views publicly. In a statement, a co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, said his company ""will continue to work"" with Mr. Lawsky's office ""on all Bitcoin matters involving consumers, merchants and the recently launched Coinbase Exchange. We also look forward to continuing to work together on the completion of New York's BitLicense."" Bitcoin, a digital currency with built-in scarcity, was started by an anonymous creator in 2009. Over the last two years, companies working with the currency have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investments - with none attracting more money than Coinbase. Last week, Coinbase announced that it had raised $75 million from several investors, including the New York Stock Exchange and the Spanish bank BBVA. There is no indication that Coinbase is facing any penalty for working with New York residents. But any tension between Coinbase and regulators could set back carefully orchestrated efforts in the industry to improve Bitcoin's reputation with the authorities after earlier thefts and scandals. In addition to Mr. Lawsky's office, California's top financial regulator issued a ""consumer alert"" on Tuesday about Coinbase after news reports suggested the company is licensed to serve residents of the state. ""California consumers should be aware Coinbase Exchange is not regulated or licensed by the state,"" the alert from the California Department of Business said. A number of other Bitcoin companies have said they were waiting for Mr. Lawsky to issue his BitLicense before trying to open an exchange in the United States. Last week, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss said they were planning to open a Bitcoin exchange in New York as soon as Mr. Lawsky signs off on it. Mr. Lawsky has been at the forefront of trying to impose regulations on the nascent Bitcoin industry, and industry participants expect that other state regulators will act after Mr. Lawsky. Coinbase's decision to move ahead of regulators is similar to the decisions made by some other California start-ups, which have started their businesses and then sought regulatory approval, occasionally causing tension with those regulators.

New Magazine Teaches Children Financial Lessons,"Jean Chatzky, the financial editor of NBC's ''Today'' show, has made a career sharing personal finance tips with adults. Now, she is trying to reach a much younger audience. Last month, Ms. Chatzky and Time for Kids, a division of Time Inc., introduced a magazine intended to teach financial literacy to fourth, fifth and sixth graders. The PwC Charitable Foundation, which was started by the giant financial consulting firm PwC, is backing the publication.    ''Kids are very interested in money,'' Ms. Chatzky said. ''What we're trying to get across to them is money is a tool that they need to know how to manage to succeed in life.''    The magazine, called Your $, will be distributed monthly during the school year to roughly two million students in schools nationwide. Each four-page issue will cover an aspect of finance, like budgeting, investing and taxes.   The January issue, for instance, used the story of Jeff Xie, who won $75,000 last year in the Jeopardy Teen Tournament, as a starting point for a discussion on managing money and saving for college. February's issue includes a feature on digital currency like Bitcoin. (''What do you call money you can't see, touch or deposit in a bank? It sounds like the start of a joke. But it's Bitcoin.'') The March issue will focus on identity theft.   A magazine like Your $ is part of a broader effort to educate children about money, said Nan J. Morrison, the chief executive of the Council for Economic Education.    In particular, big banks and consulting companies have become involved in financial literacy efforts, in part because teaching children about money is an easy way to buff their brands. Among others involved in financial literacy programs for children and teenagers are Capital One, H&R Block, T. Rowe Price and Wells Fargo.   ''There's a long list of corporations in the financial services industry who are in this space,'' Ms. Morrison said. ''People sensed a renewed need during the last financial crisis, and the barriers to entry are low.''   Your $ is more Highlights than Money magazine. Each issue has an ''Ask Jean'' section, where Ms. Chatzky, who has written nine books on personal finance, answers basic questions about money. Bright colors and pictures flood its pages.   ''Some of these topics might be considered dry, so the trick is to make it really visually appealing for kids,'' said Nellie Gonzalez, the editor of Time for Kids.   Underwriting the Time for Kids money magazine is part of PwC's Earn Your Future program, a five-year, $160 million commitment -- $60 million in cash and $100 million worth of volunteer work -- to teach children financial skills.   Mitch Roschelle, a partner at PwC and a trustee of the PwC Charitable Foundation, called the program, which started in 2012, a way for PwC employees to make an impact by sharing their financial knowledge. The magazine was an extension of the financial literacy curriculum PwC had developed for classrooms.    Some specialists question whether school is the best place to teach financial literacy, contending that economic values should be taught at home. But Ms. Chatzky, a mother of two, said the key was repetition.    ''You can talk about things in school, but it has to be brought home,'' she said. ''I think a dialogue about finances should be an ongoing dialogue throughout your life.''    "
Larry Summers Likes the Idea of Bitcoin,"As Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers took on complex economic policy. On Wednesday night, he took on Bitcoin. Speaking at the Museum of American Finance on Wall Street, Mr. Summers said Bitcoin, the virtual currency that has become a phenomenon in the technology and financial industries, could help reduce costs and inefficiencies in the global payments system. But so could other payment technologies.  ""We have seen so little innovation cumulatively directed at taking the frictional costs out of the system,"" Mr. Summers said. ""The notion that there's going to be a lot of innovation and experimentation around how those frictional costs can be taken out feels like a very important kind of idea."" Although not quite a ringing endorsement of Bitcoin itself, Mr. Summers - who is a special adviser to the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which has invested in Bitcoin-related  companies - did say that new payment technologies would eventually become more ubiquitous, like Internet at hotels or Wi-Fi on airplanes. ""There will be a moment when they will go from you are struck by their presence to you are struck by their absence,"" he added. But Bitcoin or any other payments technology, Mr. Summers said, will need to shed the ""hyperlibertarian aura,"" which is hindering widespread acceptance. Regulation, he added, would certainly help. ""If the day ever comes where Bitcoin counts for an appreciable fraction of commerce that takes place in the world economy, on that day it will be because that commerce is regulated and subject to safeguards and people believe that something other than a mathematical algorithm is ensuring that their money will not be stolen,"" he said. But by then, Mr. Summers had made a gaffe. Midway through his brief discussion of Bitcoin, Mr. Summers referred to the currency's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who holds almost mythical status among Bitcoin enthusiasts, as ""Mr. Nakatomi.""  There were gasps. But most of the audience nodded along, perhaps convinced that their ears had deceived them, or they simply didn't know the difference.  "
U.S. Announces Third Bitcoin Auction,"The United States Marshals Service announced on Wednesday that it would auction 50,000 Bitcoins, worth nearly $12 million, seized in connection with the online marketplace Silk Road.  The Bitcoin auction, to be held on March 5, comes more than two months after the service's second Bitcoin auction in December, when it also sold 50,000 Bitcoins.    The latest auction is for Bitcoins seized from the computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in Federal District Court in Manhattan this month on charges related to the operation and ownership of Silk Road. The website was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was online bazaar for illegal drugs and other illicit activities.  The timing of the latest auction comes as investors and even Bitcoin enthusiasts are questioning whether the virtual currency is a desirable investment. In the last year, Bitcoin's price has slid, from a high of around $1,150 at the end of 2013 to about $235 on Wednesday afternoon. At the time of the second auction, Bitcoin was trading at about $370. The service said 11 registered bidders took part in its December auction.   Bidders in the third Bitcoin auction will have a six-hour period on March 5, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., to submit sealed bids for the coins, which have been broken into several lots. The first series contains 10 blocks of 2,000 Bitcoins, while the second series contains 10 blocks of 3,000 Bitcoins. Bidders can participate in both series and can bid on multiple blocks.  Registration for interested parties to participate in the auction was scheduled to began on Tuesday at 9 a.m., but federal offices in Washington were closed for weather-related reasons, said Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service. The registration period, which began instead on Wednesday, will end at noon on March 2. The Marshals Service will notify eligible bidders on March 3, with the winner, or winners, notified on March 6. To be eligible to participate in the auction, bidders must prove their identities and show that they have a required amount in cash. They also have to certify that they are not affiliated with Silk Road or Mr. Ulbricht. Including 144,336 Bitcoins found on computer hardware belonging to Mr. Ulbricht, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins. After the auction next month, the Marshals Service will have sold about 130,000 Bitcoins. SecondMarket, an upstart exchange based in New York, nearly swept the government's Bitcoin auction in December, winning 48,000 of the 50,000 Bitcoins for sale. The venture capitalist Timothy C. Draper, who won all of the nearly 30,000 Bitcoins in the government's first auction in June, won the remaining 2,000 Bitcoins in the second. "
Bitcoin Auction,"The falling price of Bitcoin has not entirely quashed investor enthusiasm for the virtual currency. The United States Marshals Service said on Thursday that 14 registered bidders took part in an auction for 50,000 Bitcoins, worth about $14 million, that were seized in connection with the online bazaar Silk Road. The service said it received 34 total bids, slightly more than the 27 bids it received from 11 bidders at its second auction in December, which was also for 50,000 Bitcoins.     The winner or winners of the auction will be notified by 5 p.m. on Friday.   The latest auction was for Bitcoins seized from computer hardware belonging to Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in Federal District Court in Manhattan in February on charges related to the operation and ownership of Silk Road. The website was shut down in October 2013 after the authorities said it was an online bazaar for illegal drugs and other illicit activities.   The format of the third auction mimicked that of the previous auction in December. Bidders had six hours, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday, to submit sealed bids for the coins, which the Marshals Service had broken into several blocks. The first series contained 10 blocks of 2,000 Bitcoins, while the second contained 10 blocks of 3,000 Bitcoins. Bidders could participate in both series and bid on multiple blocks.   The auction generated little of the attention that accompanied the government's first auction in June, when it sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin was enjoying a speculative boom that had sent its price to about $1,150 at the end of 2013. Although the price of one Bitcoin had since fallen, to about $570 at the start of the first auction, investors were still willing to bet heavily on the currency. With the auction, the government also legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of its supporters, fueling a sense of optimism and driving even casual Bitcoin users to participate. Forty-five bidders took part in the first auction.   Since then, however, the price of Bitcoin has tumbled. At the start of the second auction in December, Bitcoin was trading at about $370, dissuading many investors from submitting bids. Participation in the auction fell drastically compared with the first auction, raising questions about investor appetite for Bitcoin.   Bitcoin is now trading at about $280, up from about $200 earlier this year.   But while the Bitcoin frenzy appears to have subsided, the fact that the latest auction had more bidders than the one in December should provide some hope to Bitcoin supporters. One bidder, SecondMarket, an upstart exchange that nearly swept the second Bitcoin auction, participated in the sale on Thursday on behalf of its trading division. The investment firm Pantera Capital said on its website that it would create a syndicate for the auction but declined to comment on Thursday on whether it had participated.   In total, the government has recovered 173,991 Bitcoins, meaning it still has a fairly significant amount of coins to sell. Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service, wrote in an email that the service anticipated selling the 44,341 remaining Bitcoins ''in the coming months'' but that ''no exact dates have been determined.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Inquiry of Illicit Website Spurred Agents' Own Illegal Acts, Officials Say","On the so-called dark web, drug dealing and other illicit sales have thrived in recent years, the authorities have said, through hidden websites like Silk Road and hard-to-trace digital currencies like Bitcoins. On Monday, the government charged that in the shadows of an undercover investigation of Silk Road, a notorious black-market site, two federal agents sought to enrich themselves by exploiting the very secrecy that made the site so difficult for law enforcement officials to penetrate.    The agents, Carl Mark Force IV, who worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration, and Shaun W. Bridges, who worked for the Secret Service, had resigned amid growing scrutiny, and on Monday they were charged with money laundering and wire fraud. Mr. Force was also charged with theft of government property and conflict of interest.    A criminal complaint unsealed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco outlined the allegations against the two former agents.    While investigating Silk Road, Mr. Force ''stole and converted to his own personal use a sizable amount of Bitcoins,'' the digital currency that was used by buyers and sellers on the website and which he obtained in his undercover capacity, the complaint said.   ''Rather than turning those Bitcoin over to the government, Force deposited them into his own personal accounts,'' it added.    Mr. Bridges, meanwhile, who was described as a computer forensics expert, diverted to a personal account more than $800,000 in digital currency that he gained control of during the Silk Road investigation, the authorities said.   The complaint described both former agents as members of a Baltimore-based task force that investigated Silk Road. The website had been the subject of investigations in several cities. A Manhattan-based investigation ultimately led to the filing of charges against the website's founder, Ross W. Ulbricht, who was convicted last month on numerous counts.   The Baltimore investigation resulted in an indictment of Mr. Ulbricht on conspiracy and other charges, but that case has remained pending and the evidence in support of it was kept out of the New York trial.   Mr. Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, said on Monday that shortly before the trial, the government disclosed ''only a portion of what is revealed in this complaint,'' and over the defense's objections, ''aggressively moved to preclude at trial any reference to Agent Force's activities.'' The judge granted the government's request.   ''It is clear from this complaint that fundamentally, the government's investigation of Mr. Ulbricht lacked any integrity and was wholly and fatally compromised from the inside,'' Mr. Dratel said.   The United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment. But court documents unsealed Monday show the office argued that Mr. Force played no role in the Manhattan-based investigation, which the office said had ''proceeded on a separate and independent track'' from the Baltimore one.   Moreover, the office argued, ''from the outset, the government has made clear that the investigation'' of Mr. Force ''concerns only possible corruption'' on the agent's part ''rather than anything suggestive of the defendant's innocence.''   Mr. Force had been employed as a D.E.A. special agent for about 15 years; he resigned in May 2014, shortly after the investigation into his activities began, the complaint says. Mr. Bridges had been a special agent of the Secret Service for about six years until he abruptly resigned on March 18, after learning he was a subject of the investigation, it says.   Mr. Force, 46, was arrested in Baltimore on Friday and remained in custody there on Monday pending a detention hearing on Thursday, a Justice Department spokesman said. Mr. Force's lawyer did not immediately return a call seeking comment.    Mr. Bridges, 32, of Laurel, Md., surrendered to the authorities in San Francisco and was released on bond by a magistrate judge there on Monday, his lawyer, Steven H. Levin, said. ''Mr. Bridges maintains his innocence and will fight these charges in the appropriate venue at the appropriate time,'' Mr. Levin added.   When charges were announced against Mr. Ulbricht in October 2013 and the website was shut down, the authorities called Silk Road ''the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet.''   Several thousand drug dealers and other vendors used the site from January 2011 through its closing to sell hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other illicit goods to more than 100,000 buyers, according to charges filed in Manhattan.   The site generated over $213 million in revenue during that period, and Mr. Ulbricht, operating under the pseudonym Dread Pirate Roberts, took millions of dollars in commissions, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged.   Much of Silk Road's allure to buyers and sellers was anonymity: The website operated on a hidden part of the Internet, out of the glare of law enforcement officials, and transactions were made in Bitcoins, which can be as hard to trace as cash.   Mr. Dratel, the defense lawyer, argued during the trial that his client was not Dread Pirate Roberts, the name of a character in the book and movie ''The Princess Bride.'' He conceded that Silk Road had been his client's idea, but that Mr. Ulbricht had turned the website over to others before being lured back as a ''fall guy'' to be arrested.   Mr. Ulbricht was convicted on Feb. 4 of multiple counts; four of the charges, including distributing narcotics on the Internet and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, carry potential life sentences. He is to be sentenced on May 15.   At the trial, the government also accused Mr. Ulbricht of commissioning the murders of five people whom he saw as threats to his enterprise. Although the prosecutors said they found no evidence that anyone was harmed, they cited the murders for hire as evidence that Mr. Ulbricht was willing to use violence to protect his lucrative operation.   The agencies that investigated the Baltimore-based agents included the Internal Revenue Service, the United States attorney's office in San Francisco, the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the inspectors general for the Justice Department and Homeland Security, according to the complaint.   It charged that the former agents ''abused their positions'' to defraud the government and others ''all for their own financial enrichment.''   Mr. Force, for example, created fictitious online personas that were not officially sanctioned by the investigation in order to communicate with Dread Pirate Roberts, the target of his investigation, the complaint says. Using one of those personas, Mr. Force sought to extort $250,000 from him in exchange for not providing the government with certain information.   Mr. Force, who used the undercover identity Nob in communicating with Dread Pirate Roberts, also created the fiction that he had sensitive law enforcement information that had been provided to him by a corrupt federal agent named Kevin who was part of the Silk Road investigation. In August 2013, for example, Dread Pirate Roberts paid Nob about $50,000 in Bitcoins for '' 'Kevin's' inside law enforcement information,'' the complaint says.    During the nearly two years Mr. Force was involved in the Silk Road investigation, the complaint said, he deposited about $776,000 -- ''an amount that represented solely his liquidation of Bitcoins'' -- into his bank accounts.    The complaint notes that in their communications, Mr. Force, writing as Nob, and Dread Pirate Roberts encrypted their messages on the agent's instruction. But it says that a review of Mr. Force's case file showed that it did not contain any of the keys or passwords needed to decrypt his messages, suggesting he was using encryption to conceal his own illegal activities.   ''Even if encrypting messages to D.P.R. would make Nob more credible,'' the complaint says, ''the communications should have been documented, in deciphered form, and memorialized in the case file.''    "
Goldman and IDG Put $50 Million to Work in a Bitcoin Company,"Goldman Sachs is becoming the first major bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin-focused company, giving a vote of confidence to the embattled virtual currency. The Wall Street bank announced late Wednesday that it had struck a partnership with a major Chinese investment firm, IDG Capital Partners, to lead a $50 million investment into Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments.     Since first grabbing widespread attention in 2013, Bitcoin has been dented by criminal activity tied to the virtual currency and by flurries of speculative buying and selling. The price of one Bitcoin on Wednesday hovered around $225, far below the high above $1,200 that it hit in late 2013.     Even as public interest has waned, however, major financial institutions have been quietly but seriously examining the opportunities offered by the technology, and particularly the new financial network that hosts the Bitcoin digital tokens and allows them to be sent around the world securely, cheaply and almost instantly.   A few other Bitcoin companies have recently announced small investments from European banks, and several bank executives have spoken of their interest recently. But Goldman is the first major bank to make such a prominent investment.   ''Having a franchise like Goldman Sachs as an investor, who has done due diligence, is a vote of confidence,'' said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and chief executive of Circle.    The investment is coming from Goldman's principal strategic investments group, which generally puts money into projects that could have some relevance for the bank's own business.     Goldman did not comment on the investment beyond a statement from the head of the principal strategic group, Thomas F. Jessop. The statement did not mention Bitcoin, but did say that the firm sees ''significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.''   Circle, which does not generate Bitcoin, had previously received investments from venture capital firms like General Catalyst Partners and Breyer Capital.     Unlike most big Bitcoin companies, which have focused on making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoins, Circle is hoping to use the virtual currency primarily as a way to cheaply and quickly move money both domestically and internationally.    Circle customers who want to buy and hold Bitcoin will be able to. But for those who do not want to deal with the volatile price of the virtual currency, Circle is preparing to make it possible for customers to keep balances in dollars in an insured bank account. For these customers, Bitcoin will be used only as a means of moving money, to avoid the fees charged by payment processors and money transmitters.     The network underlying Bitcoin is generally a cheaper alternative because it is powered by a decentralized network of computers rather than a single company, like Visa or PayPal, that can extract fees.     The founders of Circle are aiming to use Bitcoin to move into the burgeoning industry of peer-to-peer payments. The industry is currently led by companies like Venmo, a PayPal-owned application that allows friends to quickly send one another money rather than using a check or a bank transfer, which can take days to go through.     While Circle will, in the near future, offer much the same services as Venmo -- including free, instant money transfers -- the company hopes that Bitcoin will allow it to move money with same ease across international borders, something Venmo cannot do.     The international ambitions should eventually be helped by the participation of IDG Capital, a firm that has backed some of China's biggest start-ups.     Bitcoin gained popularity as a speculative investment in China in late 2013, but the government there shut down much of the excitement by barring payment processors and banks from dealing with Bitcoin companies. Mr. Allaire said that IDG should help Circle navigate the tricky regulatory landscape in China.     While Circle did not provide the size of Goldman's investment, Mr. Allaire said that Goldman and IDG had provided the majority of the $50 million.  Circle already had a tie to Goldman through M. Michele Burns, the former chief executive of Mercer who serves on the boards of both companies.     Goldman is one of several banks that have recently written research reports about Bitcoin's potential. A Goldman report in March listed Bitcoin among the four ''megatrends'' that are likely to transform payments, which it called a $1.2 trillion industry.     ''Although Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are still in the early stages of development, they could gain traction once clear use cases become more established,'' the report said.     In the United States, many Bitcoin start-ups have been hampered by the unwillingness of banks to open accounts for virtual currency companies. So far, Silicon Valley Bank has been almost the only American bank willing to deal with companies that hold Bitcoins for customers.     While Goldman will not be Circle's bank, and will not hold any Bitcoins itself, its investment in Circle should help solidify Bitcoin's reputation as a technology that serious financial firms can work with.     Many banks have been waiting for more clarity on how bank regulators view Bitcoin companies. New York state's top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, is completing a BitLicense for virtual currency companies that is expected to be out in late May.    Circle intends to apply for a BitLicense, and already holds ordinary money-transmitter licenses from many other states.     ''Up until now Bitcoin has really been driven by the speculative value phase,'' Mr. Allaire said. ''We've said it needs to move to the utility value phase.''     "
Bitcoin Comes Out of the Shadows and Into Wall Street's Sights,"At the end of a panel discussion at the Inside Bitcoins conference in New York this week -- billed as the largest such event in the world -- a supporter of the cryptocurrency pointed to one of the three lawyers discussing Bitcoin's struggle for mainstream acceptance. ''You all say you want Bitcoin to just work,'' he said. ''But the only way that will happen is if regulators are completely out of the way.''     There's a fat chance of that with all the attention lavished recently on Bitcoin, which on Wednesday reached a new peak of financial industry acclaim with Goldman Sachs' first investment in the technology via Bitcoin finance start-up Circle.   It's a sign of a pivotal change. Die-hards like the conference questioner will mourn the lost privacy and edginess of Bitcoin's geeky existence. The flip side is that mainstream financial industry acceptance is in sight.   The digital currency, which emerged six years ago from the computer of a programmer calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto, is entering a new age, one where its future will be guided mainly by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's premier investment bank, and a growing flock of lawyers.   This week's conference nicely illustrated Bitcoin's efforts to emerge from the shadows. For starters, the panel in question was entitled ''Beyond Mt. Gox and Silk Road,'' referring to the signature scandals that have largely defined the world of cryptocurrencies in the public's eye. The former was a Bitcoin exchange that went bust, mainly as a result of incompetence, losing some $450 million. The latter was a dark drug racket that foolishly relied on Bitcoin's apparent anonymity to cover up its users' identities.   Some panels looked at the mechanics behind Bitcoin, but the most widely attended sessions were about regulation. These had titles like ''Emerging Issues in Regulatory Compliance and Law Enforcement Efforts,'' ''Banking MSBs: A Compliance Officer's Perspective'' and ''How to Stop Bitcoin Theft.'' If there is to be a grand future for Bitcoin, it will not be as a reserve currency to replace the dollar or yen or as a subfusc network for anarchists, libertarians or mobsters. Rather, it will be as a tool for the financial services industry.   ''All of us are invested in the price of Bitcoin going up, and you can forget about the price going up and you can forget about mainstream adoption unless regulators get involved,'' said Ted Rogers, chief strategy officer at Xapo, a start-up that combines ''the convenience of an everyday Bitcoin wallet with the security of a deep cold storage vault.''   Mr. Rogers -- also a trained lawyer -- is betting his career on Bitcoin crossing into the mainstream, ''because net-net, a regulated Bitcoin that helps everybody is better than one that operates in the shadows.''   To wit, Goldman unveiled its first investment in a Bitcoin business, jointly leading a $50 million funding round for Circle along with the Chinese venture capital firm IDG Capital Partners. Rather than a passive investment, this is a bet made by the Wall Street firm's principal strategic investments group, a division that puts money to work in start-ups that could disrupt -- or in this case, make more efficient -- the way the bank does business.   Again, it's not Bitcoin as a borderless currency or a store of value that's intriguing to Goldman so much as its underlying technology. Every Bitcoin and all users are encrypted with a unique identity, and each transaction is recorded on a decentralized public ledger, known as a blockchain.   The Congressional Research Service put it this way in a white paper prepared for United States legislators: This ''solves the so-called double spending problem (i.e., spending money you do not own by use of forgery or counterfeiting) and the attendant need for a trusted third party (such as a bank or credit card company) to verify the integrity of electronic transactions.'' The application of blockchain technology could be spread across the sorts of activities that Goldman engages in, principally the trading, settling and clearing of securities.   First, however, Bitcoin has to become legit. That means ''working within the existing regulatory regime and its constraints,'' according to Constance Choi, another lawyer who advises digital currency companies and attended the Bitcoin conference. Indeed, 17 of the 26 pages produced by the Congressional Research Service are dedicated to legal and regulatory issues.   For Bitcoin pioneers and purists, all of this may be hard to swallow. Acquiescing to federal government watchdogs and hard-nosed bankers couldn't be further from the original idea.   Like it or not, though, that's where Bitcoin is headed -- and where its real mettle will be tested.   Rob Cox is editor of Reuters Breakingviews.

"ItBit Bitcoin Exchange Gets Banking License in New York, a First in U.S.","New York State's top financial regulator has granted the first license to a Bitcoin exchange, allowing it to open legally to customers across the country. The exchange, itBit, said Thursday morning that it was beginning to take on customers in the United States immediately after receiving a banking trust charter from New York State's Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Benjamin M. Lawsky, who has been trying for some time to bring new rules to the fledgling virtual currency industry.    In addition to the new license, itBit, which has offices in New York and Singapore, also announced on Thursday that it had won $25 million in new financing and had appointed three prominent board members: Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator; and Robert H. Herz, a Morgan Stanley director.    The trust company charter gives itBit a banklike status and appears to make it the winner in a race among Bitcoin exchanges to become the first to be fully regulated in the United States.   ''This is a big deal, not just for us, but for the entire Bitcoin industry,'' itBit's chief executive, Charles Cascarilla, said.   In the past, several unregulated Bitcoin exchanges have collapsed under questionable circumstances, tarnishing the public reputation of the virtual currency and losing coins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.   Earlier this week, an enforcement arm of the Treasury Department fined a virtual currency company, Ripple Labs, $700,000 and said it ''willfully violated'' the bank secrecy act and failed to report suspicious activity.   Mr. Lawsky has been working for more than a year to establish a regulatory procedure to deal with the unusual nature of virtual currencies and the unique security risks that they present. He has proposed a so-called BitLicense and has said he hopes to complete it later this month.   ItBit avoided the need for a BitLicense by instead applying for a trust company charter, which appears to come with even stricter regulations. It is the first trust company to be created in New York since the financial crisis.   ''The technology behind Bitcoin and other virtual currencies could ultimately hold real promise, and it is critical that we set up appropriate rules of the road to help safeguard customer funds,'' Mr. Lawsky said in a statement on Thursday. ''Indeed, we believe that regulation will ultimately be important to the long-term health and development of the virtual currency industry.''   Many Bitcoin companies have been held back by the difficulty of opening accounts with banks, which have been hesitant to deal with the risks of virtual currencies. As a trust company, itBit will be able to be the custodian of customer funds by itself.   The process of obtaining the charter has been arduous and expensive and occupied itBit for more than a year. It has already been operating for foreign customers from Singapore.   Because of the extensive requirements for opening an account with the company, itBit is planning to focus primarily on larger investors and financial institutions.   The company was founded by several people with Wall Street experience, including the chief executive, Mr. Cascarilla, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. The company's chief operating officer, Andrew Chang, came to itBit from Google.   Although the price of Bitcoin has stagnated over the last year, interest in its technology has been growing among large financial and technological companies. Last week, Goldman became the first bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin company when it helped lead a $50 million funding round for the Bitcoin payment company Circle.   Many banks are most interested in the financial network, called the blockchain, that allows the Bitcoin digital tokens to be transferred quickly and cheaply.   The focus at itBit will be on allowing customers to buy, sell and hold the digital tokens as an asset, like a sort of digital gold.   Since Bitcoin was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator named Satoshi Nakamoto, the largest exchanges have mostly been outside the United States.   Mt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, was the dominant exchange for years, but it declared bankruptcy last year and said that nearly $400 million worth of customer coins were either lost or stolen. A criminal investigation is continuing.   Mt. Gox was overtaken by Bitstamp, an exchange based in Slovenia. Earlier this year, though, Bitstamp was hacked and lost about $5 million in coins.   More recently, a company in San Francisco, Coinbase, said it was opening the first Bitcoin exchange to have all the necessary licenses in the United States. But soon after that announcement, Mr. Lawsky's office said that Coinbase did not have the licenses needed to operate in New York.   The Winklevoss brothers, famous from their legal battles with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, announced their intention this year to open the first regulated United States Bitcoin exchange, but that has not come to fruition yet.   Many early Bitcoin users, who were drawn to the virtual currency because of its independence from government, have opposed efforts to win regulatory approval for the technology. But itBit and other companies have said that approach is unlikely to work in bringing virtual currencies into the mainstream.   ''While some see Bitcoin as alluring for its potential to operate outside this system, we see it differently,'' Mr. Cascarilla said in a blog post Thursday morning. ''We believe Bitcoin and blockchain technology have immense potential within the system -- to help make it more efficient, to offer new solutions and to bring us all into the future.''    "
Rules Released for Bitcoin Businesses,"With just weeks to go before he steps down, Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's top financial regulator, on Wednesday released rules for running a Bitcoin business in the state. In a speech at the BITS Emerging Payments Forum in Washington, Mr. Lawsky announced the final set of rules that govern virtual-currency businesses, concluding a nearly two-year effort to regulate the growing Bitcoin industry.    Mr. Lawsky said that the final form of the so-called BitLicense would put in place crucial guidelines for protecting consumers and preventing money laundering.    ''We are excited about the potential digital currency holds for helping drive long-overdue changes in our ossified payments system,'' he said. ''We simply want to make sure that we put in place guardrails that protect consumers and root out illicit activity, without stifling beneficial innovation.''   The new rules are among the last initiatives Mr. Lawsky will put in place before he leaves government this month to start his own legal and consulting firm. In his four-year tenure, he has fashioned a name for himself as a tough overseer of the banking and insurance industries, cracking down on the likes of Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered.   Such has been his reputation that The Village Voice once depicted him on its cover with a cowboy hat and sheriff's badge, calling him ''Johnny Lawsky.''   His push to create rules governing virtual currencies may be among the most sweeping to date. New York is the first state to do so, seeking to create a replacement for money transmission guidelines that, Mr. Lawsky said, date to the Civil War.   Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have grown in popularity both in the global technology community and on Wall Street. The Nasdaq OMX Group and the New York Stock Exchange have announced initiatives tied to Bitcoin. And last month, Goldman Sachs invested in Circle, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments.   Among the requirements outlined in the new regulations are the presence of a compliance officer and the maintenance of capital reserves determined by the New York State Department of Financial Services.   Throughout the process, some Bitcoin advocates have questioned whether Mr. Lawsky was overstepping his boundaries and proposing regulations that could throttle the nascent technology. Critics on the Internet site Reddit satirized the regulator by depicting him atop the Iron Throne from the HBO series ''Game of Thrones'' with the caption ''Hail King Lawsky.''   In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Lawsky said that the main goal had been to provide useful guidelines for virtual currency businesses rather than stifle the emerging technology altogether. The BitLicense, he said, applies only to financial operations and not to software developers, individual users or retailers who accept Bitcoin payments.   ''Financial regulators and policy makers need to recognize that when it comes to digital currencies and other new payments technology, the genie is already out of the bottle,'' he said.   Mr. Lawsky added that regulators and proponents of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies needed to work together to make sure that new technologies continue to flourish while protecting consumers.   Still, some within the virtual currency industry took a dim view of the new rules. Coin Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, took issue with anti-money-laundering provisions of the final guidelines, which it contended were too vague.   ''It's a mixed bag, is the best that can be said about the BitLicense,'' Jerry Brito, Coin Center's executive director, said in a statement. ''Other states are already looking to the BitLicense as a model for their own frameworks. We are working with them to ensure they do not repeat the mistakes made here.''    "
"With an Eye on Fintech, Andreessen Horowitz Adds a New General Partner","The leaders of Andreessen Horowitz believe that experience is the best teacher. So the best venture capitalists are ones with first-hand experience founding companies, people who have ""been through the war,"" as Marc Andreessen puts it. The firm's newest general partner, Alex Rampell, certainly passes that test. Mr. Rampell, 34, has founded or co-founded seven start-ups, by Mr. Andreesen's count, including the shareware software Mr. Rampell wrote in 1996 as a high-school student, AlwaysOnline. It was a robo-dialing program that kept dialing AOL access phone numbers - in the days of dial-up service - and kept users online continuously. It sold tens of thousands of copies, eventually got banned by AOL, and largely paid Mr. Rampell's way through Harvard University.  Most recently, Mr. Rampell was co-founder and chief executive of TrialPay, an e-commerce payment and advertising service, which was acquired by Visa this year. At Andreessen Horowitz, he will be focusing on financial technology start-ups, and he and the firm see finance as a big opportunity today.  In an interview, Mr. Andreessen briskly scanned the history of finance as an industry pushed ahead by innovators - Dee Ward Hock of Visa (credit cards), John C. Bogle of Vanguard (index funds), and the ""PayPal crew"" (online payments). ""Ultimately, it's an entrepreneur-driven field,"" he said. Mr. Andreessen described the current system of consumer banking as one based on paper, older technology and vast holdings of street corner branches. ""All of financial services grew up before everyone in the world had smartphones,"" he said. ""If you were starting from scratch, would you do any of that - branches, ATM machines and paper records? The answer to that is ultimately no."" Mr. Rampell says he sees banking and insurance as ""ripe for disruption,"" made vulnerable by legacy technology, the post-financial crisis need to operate more conservatively and the corset of tighter regulation. Look at the job listings at banks and insurance companies, he said, and you invariably see openings for programmers skilled in COBOL, the business computer language that dates back to 1959. ""They're in maintenance mode in terms of technology, and they have to keep the regulators happy,"" Mr. Rampell said. Andreessen Horowitz already has several investments in financial technology ventures including 21, Affirm, Boku, Coinbase, Dwolla and TransferWise. Their businesses range from Bitcoin mining to alternative lending to online money transfers.  Fintech is attracting funding at a torrid pace, with $13.7 billion invested in the last year, 46 percent more than the previous year, according to CB Insights. Mr. Rampell sees further opportunities in new asset classes. One example, he said, might be selling an equity stake in homes. ""Why not sell a portion of your home?"" he asks.  Ample capital exists around the world, as in the deep coffers of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, with $870 billion in assets, thanks to North Sea oil and a small population. With the right financial vehicle, Mr. Rampell said, such a fund could invest to co-own houses in, say, pricey Palo Alto, Calif., making it easier for prospective home buyers to make down payments and reduce their mortgage burden. ""They could own 10 percent or 15 percent of your house, so you don't have to borrow as much,"" Mr. Rampell said. ""I think there's a lot of room for more of those kind of new asset classes."" "
Here Are the Companies That May Be the Next 50 Start-Up Unicorns,"It used to be a rare thing when start-ups were valued at $1 billion or more by their investors. Now it's become so common that there are at least 131 start-ups boasting such valuations and a term - ""unicorns"" - to refer to the companies.  So which start-ups are next to reach the unicorn level? CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups, recently ran a data screen for The New York Times to answer the question. The exact valuations of the companies are hard to pin down because the start-ups are private and are not required to disclose their finances, but CB Insights determined that they might be on a path toward a $1 billion value through an algorithm that analyzed factors including amount of financing raised, employee turnover and social media mentions.  Here are the results, arranged alphabetically:   17zuoye   What it does: Online education Where it's based: Beijing  3D Robotics   What it does: Drones Where it's based: Berkeley, Calif.

Wall Street Takes a Keen Interest in Bitcoin's Technology,"Most people still think of Bitcoin as the virtual currency used by drug dealers and shadowy hackers looking to evade the authorities. But the innovations that helped turn Bitcoin into the most popular virtual currency are now being viewed as a potentially enormous disruptive force for several industries, including accounting, music and law.     Nowhere, though, are more money and resources being spent on the technology than on Wall Street -- the very industry that Bitcoin was created to circumvent.   ''There is so much pull and interest on this right now,'' said Derek White, the chief digital officer at Barclays, the British global bank, which has a team of employees working on about 20 experiments that explore how the technology underlying Bitcoin might change finance. ''That comes from a recognition that, 'Wow, we can use this to change the fundamental model of how we operate to create our future.'''    For people like Mr. White, Bitcoin isn't just a digital token to use for online purchases. Instead, many of the top minds in finance have come to believe that the software that brought the virtual currency into existence also enables a fundamentally new way of transacting and maintaining records online -- allowing people and banks to directly exchange money and assets like stocks and bonds without having to rely on a long chain of expensive middlemen.   A few banks have gone public with their work, but most of the activity has been happening behind the scenes. At one private meeting, held in April at one of the Manhattan offices of Bank of America, executives from more than a dozen large banks gathered to confidentially discuss how the technology underlying Bitcoin could be used to change foreign currency trading, the largest financial market in the world, according to people who attended the meeting.   Central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have their own teams looking at the technology.   ''A year ago, it was more of an idea,'' said Max Neukirchen, the head of corporate strategy at JPMorgan Chase. ''Now, it is a real opportunity. You test it and realize that this can play a big role in our thinking about how our own infrastructure will evolve.''   This is a long way from the derision that many bankers -- including JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon -- expressed when Bitcoin burst into the public consciousness in 2013, when the price of a Bitcoin was bouncing around wildly in a speculative frenzy that was often compared to the Dutch tulip bulb mania.   At the time, some large companies like Dell and Overstock announced that they would start taking Bitcoins for online purchases, but few consumers showed much interest in using the digital money to pay their bills, and the furor around Bitcoin largely died down.   The institutions that are now becoming involved are generally not interested in selling goods for Bitcoins or owning the virtual currency. They are, instead, looking at the network and software that make it possible for Bitcoin to move around the world instantly, and almost free.   Until now, digital transactions have always gone through some sort of central authority that can move the money and update the records on both sides -- as PayPal and Visa do for many online purchases.   The Bitcoin network, on the other hand, is run by a decentralized network of users who jointly keep track of transactions and update the records in real time, with no single user or company in charge. The records of all transactions are kept on a public ledger -- essentially just a big, publicly available spreadsheet -- known as the blockchain that is visible to anyone and has, at least so far, proven impossible to tamper with.   Much of the work being done inside banks, and in other industries, is looking at whether the blockchain technology can be used independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which was the first thing to be recorded on the blockchain ledger.   The music publication Billboard recently wrote about how several start-ups are aiming to use a digital ledger like the blockchain to keep track of musical downloads and distribute the royalties to artists without relying on a central record keeper.   Vermont's state government commissioned a study in June to look at how a blockchain could be used as a legal method of record keeping under state law; it is one of several governments, many of them outside the United States, looking at the technology.   But the most intense work is being done by financial companies like the Nasdaq OMX Group, which has several programmers in Manhattan preparing software that the company plans to roll out this year.   The Nasdaq software will allow the trading of stocks in private companies, like tech start-ups, on a new kind of blockchain. This will replace the existing system in which private companies issue and trade shares using paper certificates -- a process that means that even basic trades can take weeks to complete.   Beyond the immediate trial, Nasdaq is experimenting with several other markets in which blockchain-like ledgers could be used to make trading faster and cheaper. The work is being overseen by Fredrik Voss, who recently shifted from his work in the company's commodity division to become its top blockchain executive.   ''We believe that blockchain technology holds great promise in allowing capital markets to operate more efficiently while simultaneously providing greater transparency and security, all of which are fundamental to the public interest,'' Nasdaq's chief executive, Robert Greifeld, said in a July call with investors.   Financial firms first began talking publicly about Bitcoin in late 2013. Back then, though, most of the attention was negative, focused on the speculative aspect of the virtual currency.   More recently, banks like Goldman Sachs, Santander and BBVA have made their first investments in outside start-ups working on Bitcoin technology, several of which were started by former employees at big banks.   But the banks have generally been less public about the work they have been doing internally with their own employees. At Citigroup, for instance, there are six different in-house experiments, building software that harnesses the blockchain technology, according to people briefed on the company's work. In one test, the bank has created its own virtual currency, Citicoin, that employees can experiment with.   Aside from Nasdaq's project, there is much debate about where the technology is likely to gain its first real world use. At Barclays, some of the 20 internal experiments -- most of them conducted at two Barclays offices in London dedicated to the technology -- are looking at ways to use the blockchain to speed up and lower the cost of consumer payments, to compete with credit cards and direct money transfers.   But bankers generally say that most of the work is aimed at changing the systems that big Wall Street traders and investors use to buy and sell sophisticated assets like syndicated loans and corporate bonds.   Because any innovation in this area would require the cooperation of multiple banks, the banks have had joint meetings to discuss how they could work together, often led by outside start-ups looking to provide the software.   One of the most advanced of those conversations has been coordinated by a start-up known as R3Cev that is led by a former Wall Street executive, David E. Rutter. R3Cev has put together models for how banks could trade foreign currencies on a communally maintained spreadsheet like the blockchain, according to people briefed on the project. It was R3Cev that convened the April meeting at Bank of America, which was attended by more than 75 people from 15 financial institutions, these people said.   This can seem like rather esoteric business, but these are the markets where huge amounts of money turn over each day, and these markets influence the profits of the largest financial institutions. For instance, more than $3 trillion changes hands each day on the foreign currency market.   For many bankers, the question is not if the technology is put to use but when. Mr. Neukirchen, at JPMorgan, is one of many bankers who expect that it will take a few years for the first significant use of blockchain technology to gain traction. Mr. White at Barclays expects it even sooner, in the next year.   The prospect of banks capitalizing on the technology can be disappointing to early Bitcoin adherents, many of whom were drawn to the technology because it provided a way to move and store money that did not rely on banks.   Many in the financial industry hope they can find a way to use the blockchain concept -- what is often referred to as a distributed ledger -- without using the blockchain associated with Bitcoin.   Although the bankers working on the idea disagree on how this will happen, they show surprisingly little disagreement on whether it will happen. One of Goldman's top Internet analysts, Heath Terry, said in a recent company podcast that ''the whole blockchain tech behind Bitcoin has massive implications for really any kind of asset -- and the ability to transfer ownership of digital goods.''   ''It's hard to see a world where that blockchain technology doesn't end up changing the way we think about asset ownership,'' he said.    "
The Benefits of Allowing Bitcoin to Flourish,"Michael Beckerman is the president and chief executive of the Internet Association, which represents America's leading Internet companies and their global community of users.  Technological innovations that make it easier and faster for people to interact directly have spurred some of the largest periods of economic growth in recent memory.    Consumers have benefited greatly from new products and services that have lowered costs and made lives better. Email drastically sped up and increased communications between people. Ride-sharing services connect drivers to riders faster and more cheaply. Massive open online courses, or MOOCs, quickly connect students with professors across the country. The common thread between all of these tools is that they connect peers directly, while also providing entrepreneurs with the tools to control and improve their lives.   Finance is not a place where innovation is always thought of as a good thing. In fact, after the financial crisis, the prevailing wisdom was that most financial innovations, like derivatives, were dangerous. In the last few years, however, Bitcoin has proved to be a financial platform that follows in the tradition of the Internet, empowering people to interact directly with each other, while providing a platform for entrepreneurs to innovate.    For example, in the same way that simple message text protocol, or S.M.T.P., allows messages to be sent and received globally for a fraction of the cost of a stamp, Bitcoin allows for -- among other things -- value transfer to occur in the same seamless manner. Think of it as digital cash or the ''email for money.''   The positive impact of Bitcoin is most clear for international money transfers. Right now, it costs nearly 8 percent of the total amount sent to transfer money around the world, largely because of a complex web of third-party approvers. With Bitcoin and its public ledger, the costly middlemen are unnecessary. But this obvious benefit is only the beginning.   Like the larger Internet on which it's built, Bitcoin is a global and open system. Anyone with a computer and Internet connection can plug into the network and participate. That is where its most promising potential lies.   As the Internet was allowed to flourish by limiting government's hand on the underlying protocol and its development, so too should Bitcoin.   For years, Bitcoin sat at the fringes of the technology landscape as developers and users worked to improve its functionality and further its reach. Bitcoin start-ups and the larger digital currency ecosystem have gone mainstream, receiving major venture capital investments from the New York Stock Exchange, Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs and others. Nasdaq is experimenting with trading assets on the blockchain, and Citibank is reportedly developing its own in-house digital currency.   Most recently, the N.Y.S.E. began a real-time price index that tracks the valuation of Bitcoin based on data provided by Coinbase, a leading Bitcoin platform at the forefront of the industry and the first regulated Bitcoin exchange in the United States. Coinbase was specifically chosen by the exchange because of its commitments to transparency, security and regulatory compliance in the Bitcoin market.   But like other areas, we have to strike the right balance between helpful rules that protect and sustain progress and those that will stifle innovation and economic growth. Indeed, platforms like Coinbase are already carrying out robust protections required by third parties like the N.Y.S.E., illustrating their commitment to consumer protection and security.   Calls to impose burdensome regulations on Bitcoin wallet platforms in an effort to stamp out illicit uses would do almost nothing to solve the root problem. The only real result of such regulation would be to make it more difficult for the Bitcoin wallets to serve all of the legal participants who simply wish to take advantage of the technology's ability to facilitate frictionless transactions between parties.   Such an outcome would be tragic, especially given that the industry is poised for explosive growth. With a few million regular users, and a vast amount of untapped potential, Bitcoin is well positioned to lead a cultural shift that results in more globalized markets and new business models.   It is essential that policy makers give careful consideration to a balanced approach when determining the most effective regulatory solutions for the platform. For example, government regulators should continue to focus on the connections between physical and digital currency and shun any attempts to force modification or regulation of the underlying protocol itself.   Meaningful, light-touch rules that create necessary safeguards for users are a welcome addition to the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem, but we must not inadvertently stifle the growth and innovation of the service we seek to regulate. When it comes to Bitcoin, we simply can't afford it.    "
Twin Exchange,"After a long buildup, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have won approval to open their Bitcoin exchange, Gemini, later this week. The twins, famous from their legal battles with Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, announced on Monday that they had received approval for their exchange from the New York State Department of Financial Services, the state's top financial regulator.     The agency, which has taken the lead in regulating the new virtual currency industry, had already approved another company, ItBit, to operate under a similar regulatory framework as a banklike trust company.   The Winklevoss twins have been working on their exchange for more than a year, with help from veterans of other large technology companies. Gemini will hold customer money in federally insured bank accounts. The exchange aims to make it easier for large institutional investors to buy and sell Bitcoin.   Wall Street banks have recently been expressing growing interest in harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin. But it is still unclear whether they and other large financial players will want to trade Bitcoin itself, as the Winklevoss twins are betting. Much of the interest from Wall Street is in the technology that allows direct digital transactions.   The price of Bitcoin has been largely stagnant for most of this year and sits around $240 for a Bitcoin. ItBit, the other exchange, has not experienced outsize trade volumes so far.   The Winklevoss twins have been actively working with Bitcoin since 2012. The first company they backed, BitInstant, did not survive. They quickly began working on a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund, which is expected to trade on the Nasdaq exchange. That fund is still waiting for regulatory approval.   The twins have been vocal about the importance of working with regulators, rather than challenging the authorities, as some Bitcoin advocates have wanted to do.   ''Bitcoin is an island right now, and Gemini is building a bridge to the financial mainland,'' Tyler Winklevoss, the chief executive of Gemini, said in a statement on Monday. ''Gemini is simple and easy-to-use for a first-time Bitcoin buyer while at the same time powerful enough and feature-complete for a professional trader.''   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Bitcoin Surges in Value, Emerging From a Lull in Interest","After a long period of quiet, the price of the virtual currency Bitcoin is surging again as signs of interest from China and Wall Street have helped kick off a new speculative frenzy. The price of a single Bitcoin has been steadily rising in recent weeks. On Wednesday, it spiked particularly sharply, rising above $500 on some exchanges, and bringing the value of a single coin up over 100 percent from a month ago. By the end of Wednesday, the price had fallen back closer to $400.    The recent rally has been the biggest since the online currency entered a sustained decline after the collapse of what was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, in early 2014. That incident -- and the use of Bitcoin for drug sales -- led many people to write off the virtual money as a passing fad.    Nonetheless, many banks and financial firms continued to study the technology behind the scenes and have recently been expressing their interest -- and announcing new investments -- in the technology underlying Bitcoin, which is being heralded as a new way to conduct a broad array of financial transactions.   There has also been a surge in demand for Bitcoin in China, where the new interest is being explained by a number of factors, including the drop in the stock market there, as well as the emergence of a new Ponzi scheme tied to Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has been rising faster on Chinese exchanges than elsewhere in the world.   Bobby Lee, the chief executive of one of China's biggest Bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, said that, as was the case in past price spikes, a critical mass of reports on Bitcoin was drawing a new wave of speculators, betting more on the future of the virtual currency than on its current use.   ''There are a few tipping points in a row, and you get a tidal wave,'' Mr. Lee said. ''It's classic bull market.''   Volatile price swings are nothing new for Bitcoin, which has been through several sharp ups and downs since it was released into the world in early 2009 by a shadowy creator going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. In late 2013, the price shot to a peak above $1,200 in intraday trading.   Past price rallies have generally been followed quickly by collapses, usually set off by some sign of weakness in the infrastructure of the Bitcoin industry.   All along there has been skepticism when investor interest in Bitcoin has raced ahead of the real-world use of the virtual currency. While Bitcoin has been described as a faster and cheaper way to send money online, ordinary people have been slow to use the virtual currency for everyday transactions and there are no major signs that is changing.   But the companies that currently handle most Bitcoin transactions seem to be far stronger than those that did in the past.   New York's top financial regulator has granted trust company charters to two Bitcoin exchanges over the last year and both are now in operation, along with a California exchange, Coinbase, which is the largest in the country. On Wednesday, Coinbase reported trading volume four times as high as its recent average.   So far, big banks have not traded Bitcoin on these exchanges or invested in the virtual currency directly. But financial firms of all sorts have shown significant interest in the decentralized way in which Bitcoin transactions are handled and the new type of ledger on which all Bitcoins and Bitcoin transactions are recorded, known as the blockchain.   Last week, Nasdaq introduced a new system, Linq, that will allow shares in start-ups to be recorded and traded on a ledger like the blockchain, which is expected to manage trades more quickly than existing systems. Over a dozen banks, including most of the global giants, have recently joined with a start-up, R3 CEV, to define standards for new decentralized ledgers.   Most financial firms insist that they want to use blockchains that are not tied to Bitcoin. But financial firms have also been making bets in Bitcoin-related companies like the Digital Currency Group, a trading and investment company that announced funding from MasterCard and CIBC last week.   Brendan M. O'Connor, chief executive of Genesis Global Trading, a division of the Digital Currency Group, said that after every big funding announcement, he saw a spike from big institutional investors.   ''That is nudging people to get off the sidelines and invest in the asset class,'' Mr. O'Connor said.   Investors have also been comforted by decisions like one last month by the European Union, which said that basic Bitcoin transactions would not be taxed, but would instead be treated like currency transactions.   But as was the case during the big Bitcoin run-up in late 2013, most of the trading activity now is taking place in China. Exchanges there have encouraged speculation in Bitcoin by offering free trading and leveraged accounts.   There has been discussion recently that some Chinese investors are seeking out Bitcoin as China's currency, the renminbi, has struggled and the government has made it harder to move money out of the country.   Mr. Lee of BTCC said he was not seeing much of those sorts of transactions. But he said he had seen signs that Chinese investors were using Bitcoin to move money into an international investment scheme, MMM Global, which claims to have been created by a man who did prison time in Russia after a previous Ponzi scheme collapsed.   Bitcoin also continues to be used for illegal purposes. After the Silk Road online drug bazaar was taken down, imitators quickly popped up to take its place.   Bitcoin has also become the currency of choice for online ransom payments because Bitcoin addresses can be created without providing any personal information. The Cyber Threat Alliance released a report last week estimating that hackers had collected $325 million from CryptoWall, a virus that can freeze a computer's files until an electronic ransom payment is made.   Exchange operators, though, say that the new users rushing in in recent weeks have been making a bet that Bitcoin will go mainstream and rise in value as it does.   ''The main tangible driver of the recent price surge is the accumulation of all the investments and positive media about blockchain,'' said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who has followed the market.    "
Bitcoin Basics,"Bitcoin is both a virtual currency and an online payment system -- one that some people believe will transform the global financial system. But the details of this new technology have remained a mystery to most. What is Bitcoin?    Bitcoin is both a type of digital token, or virtual currency, and the network on which those tokens can be stored and moved around.    Each unit of the virtual currency is nothing more than an entry on a digital ledger, just as most dollars and cents exist only as entries on a bank's digital ledger. The price of a Bitcoin is set on the open market, generally on exchanges where people offer to buy and sell Bitcoin, similar to the way that a stock's price is set.   Normal currencies are, of course, tracked by banks -- and their employees and computer systems. Bitcoins, in contrast, are kept on a ledger that is maintained and updated by any user of Bitcoin who wants to help. The constantly updated ledger is kept on the computers of all the users -- just as Wikipedia entries are written and kept current by the encyclopedia's users rather than by any central authority. The work maintaining Bitcoin's ledger is done according to rules that are established by the Bitcoin software.   It is the communally maintained ledger on which all Bitcoin accounts and transactions are recorded -- known as the blockchain -- that makes the currency so different from existing ones.   Because there is no central authority in Bitcoin -- just the network of users keeping the records -- there is no one to shut down accounts or demand personal information from Bitcoin users. Anyone can open an account and spend whatever Bitcoins they have as long as they have the password -- or secret key -- for their account.   Where do Bitcoins come from?   From the moment the Bitcoin network started operating in 2009, a new bundle of Bitcoins -- initially 50 -- was released every 10 minutes or so, essentially for free, to one of the computers helping to update and maintain the blockchain ledger.   Computers on the network take part in a sort of computational race to win these new coins, a process that came to be called Bitcoin mining. This giveaway provided an incentive for people to join and support the network with their computers. New coins will be released in this way until there are 21 million in the world (currently scheduled to happen sometime in 2140).   Once a user wins a new bundle of Bitcoins he or she can divide them up in any way -- up to eight decimal points -- and distribute them to anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Initially, people sent their Bitcoins to friends for free. Now, there are exchanges on which people offer to buy and sell Bitcoins and the price has swung wildly, reaching a high above $1,200 in intraday trading in late 2013.   How do you spend a Bitcoin?   Anyone with a Bitcoin address, which is similar to an email address, can send and receive Bitcoins from anyone else with a Bitcoin address. Creating a Bitcoin address is free. Each address comes with a private key, a sophisticated password, that provides access to the coins in the address.   There are thousands of merchants that now accept Bitcoin payments online. These companies will generally provide a Bitcoin address where money can be sent in order to complete a transaction. For the merchants, Bitcoin is preferable to credit-card payments because the merchant doesn't have to pay a fee to a credit-card company. For consumers with credit cards, there is less of a clear advantage to using Bitcoin.   Why was Bitcoin so attractive to drug dealers?   The online drug bazaar known as the Silk Road offered a place for vendors to sell illegal goods, like heroin and cocaine, for Bitcoin.   Because Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world almost instantly, essentially for free, and because the payments can be sent without either side knowing the identity of the other, the system is an obvious choice for criminal activity.   Law enforcement officials have had some luck in tracking down Bitcoin users by looking at the I.P. address associated with a particular Bitcoin address, or by tracking down users on the blockchain ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. But this has proved to be a slow and relatively unsuccessful investigative method.   The operator of the Silk Road was eventually apprehended, not because his Bitcoin transactions were traced, but because he accidentally left his personal email address on a public website. The Silk Road was quickly replaced by imitators that are still flourishing today, offering drugs for Bitcoins.   Is Bitcoin useful for things besides buying drugs?   The Silk Road helped demonstrate that Bitcoin could be used to send money quickly and cheaply around the world, without requiring a bank account.   Slowly, there is increasing interest in using the Bitcoin network as a payment system for legitimate purposes. One often-discussed use is as way for immigrants to send remittances more cheaply to family members overseas who don't have bank accounts or government identity cards. This has begun to catch on in places like Argentina, Indonesia and Africa.   Other developers have looked to use Bitcoin for very small online payments, of a few cents, which are generally not possible in the existing financial system because of the minimum payments required for credit-card transactions.   More recently, financial institutions have grown interested in the idea that the Bitcoin network -- and its ledger, the blockchain -- allows for direct online transactions of all sorts, even those that don't involve Bitcoins. Banks and financial firms are now looking at using the blockchain to allow for cheaper, faster stock and bond trades.    "
Last Digital Testament,"Andrew Magliochetti, 38, always feared dying without an estate plan. In his 20s, he prepared a will. But after consulting with his money manager, Mr. Magliochetti took an even more unusual step: He listed his digital assets, which include digitized family movies and social media accounts, as well as some assets that are more esoteric, like digital currencies and domain names. Mr. Magliochetti then stored his passwords, including those for Facebook and Twitter, on a password manager that his brother, who is his estate executor, could easily get access to. Family photos and movies were uploaded onto the file-hosting service Dropbox, which makes them easy to share, he said.     ''Being so organized takes a lot of time,'' said Mr. Magliochetti, a managing director at Maroon Capital Group in Chicago. ''But if someone can't access my assets, they can disappear.''   Unlike Mr. Magliochetti, many people are neglecting to include digital effects in their estate plans. Estate planning experts say that may be a big mistake. Valuable assets may go unnoticed, or money and time might be spent tracking them down.   Before the digital age, a family member could merely walk through a home and find physical objects or paper records, said James Lamm, an estate planning lawyer at Gray Plant Mooty in Minneapolis. Mail deliveries were checked for account statements or bills.   Today, many statements are delivered via email, and important financial records may be stored in the cloud or on computers, he added.   And some assets like digital currencies, video game characters and Internet domain names exist only in cyberspace. ''So they can be overlooked, since they aren't as tangible,'' said Tim Hewson, president of USLegalWills.com, adding that such assets ''can be worth tens of thousands of dollars.''   Then there are social media accounts. ''People are acquiring more digital assets like Facebook photos or email addresses almost without realizing it,'' said Evan Carroll, co-founder of the Digital Beyond website. ''You can't ignore them.''   But gaining access to social media accounts can be tricky. State laws governing digital assets vary, and online sites that are concerned about user privacy have wildly different terms and conditions that sometimes lock out executors.   ''We're in a bizarre no-man's land,'' said Elizabeth Sillin, a lawyer at Bulkley Richardson, which has offices in Massachusetts. ''Some online services will not grant access to a third party. So executors are getting in by using passwords,'' she said -- passwords that would have been provided by the deceased or the deceased's family members.   Experts recommend making a thorough inventory of all online accounts and their passwords but not to include them in your will. Wills should not be changed frequently while online account information often is. Specify how you want each account handled if you die, Mr. Lamm said. Terms and conditions for each site can also be included.   This inventory can then be stored in an encrypted file, safe or even with your attorney.   John Egan, whose mother died unexpectedly in August, said he was grateful that she organized her digital assets meticulously. A gadget lover, his mother had several devices including smartphones, laptops and a phablet. Estate documents listed dozens of digital assets like her email, Facebook page, photographs and the like. Passwords were left on a password device.   ''Anyone who has digital assets should lay them out like my mother did,'' said Mr. Egan, who is an editor at LawnStarter in Austin, Tex. ''Digital assets just add another layer to what I already have to do.''   Mr. Lamm also recommends updating a will, power of attorney and revocable trust with digital-property information. The executor should also be authorized to obtain access to devices and online accounts, and even reset passwords.   Keep photos on a computer or local storage device rather than an online site, Mr. Lamm recommends. That way, they are easier to retrieve. Putting them on two storage devices that are in separate places -- a home safe and a lawyer's office -- is even better.   ''You have to plan ahead,'' Mr. Lamm said. ''As more wealth moves into the cloud, good luck tracking this stuff.''   The executors of those who didn't make an inventory and list passwords may end up having to hire a computer forensics expert who can try to gain access to a smartphone or computer, he added, which can be challenging.   Email passwords are especially important to note, Ms. Sillin said. Email usually holds a digital paper trail of account transactions, such as online bank statements and digital payments.   Some assets can't be passed on to heirs. One of Ms. Sillin's clients tried to leave an iTunes library to a son, but it couldn't be done. Generally, digital music and e-book purchases are nontransferable because they're licensed to the user. ''You can only leave these assets if a user agreement permits it,'' Ms. Sillin said.   As Mr. Magliochetti observed: ''Make the process as easy as possible. As Internet adoption continues, planning will become more important.''    "
A Credit Union Dream Dies Under Regulatory Burdens,"Brewster Kahle didn't need to start a bank. He made a fortune building start-ups and then used his money to build the Internet Archive, a nonprofit trying to maintain a copy of everything published on the Internet.    In 2008, though, Mr. Kahle saw how hard it was for the employees at his firm to obtain loans, and more broadly, how the existing financial system had helped contribute to the financial crisis. He thought he could do things differently, and he aimed to prove it when he began applying to open a credit union in early 2011.   Since then, the credit union has faced a barrage of regulatory audits and limitations on its operations, first when it tried to work with low-income immigrants in New Jersey and especially after it looked at providing banking services to Bitcoin companies that were being rejected by other banks.   Now, Mr. Kahle is giving up on his dream of creating a new kind of bank, one for social good rather than profit. He hopes to give the credit union charter to a nonprofit organization in New Jersey that can make use of it -- or give it up.    Mr. Kahle's experience and internal documents offer a glimpse into how regulators approach a new technology like Bitcoin, which most banks have refused to touch, partly because of the hesitation of regulators. More broadly, the troubles faced by his Internet Archive Federal Credit Union point to how difficult it can be to try out anything new in the heavily regulated industry.   After an 18-month application process, regulators let the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union open in 2012, but with restrictions that did not allow it to offer basic banking products, such as debit cards and online banking.   Mr. Kahle said the credit union asked its regulators before it took on the first Bitcoin clients -- and quickly dropped those clients after the regulators turned sour on the idea -- but it has faced a steady stream of official exams since: 11 in 14 months. In August, the credit union, by its own count, spent 187 hours dealing with regulators and only 61 hours dealing with customers.   ''I think we could really use some new ideas in the banking world -- and the credit union offers a nice structure,'' Mr. Kahle said. ''But they just won't allow it.''   A spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency whose board is appointed by the president, said it would not comment on Mr. Kahle's specific complaints, but in a statement, the chairwoman of the agency, Debbie Matz, a Democrat, said that ''if a credit union thinks it's going to be cited for breaking the law, sometimes a C.E.O. will push back and blame the regulator. It's our job to protect depositors.''   The chief executive of Mr. Kahle's credit union, Jordan Modell, said that the N.C.U.A. had never given him any indication that the credit union would be cited for breaking the law.   Mr. Modell and Mr. Kahle said the red flags raised by the N.C.U.A. examiners had been over small discrepancies and record-keeping issues -- and often turned out to be factually wrong.   ''None of the compliance issues listed in the report were correct,'' the credit union wrote in an appeal sent to the N.C.U.A. in May, after the agency lowered the credit union's regulatory rating.   The credit union administration has faced criticism from the newest of its three board members, J. Mark McWatters, a Republican, who has said that the agency has been too focused on protecting its insurance fund for credit unions from any losses and has consequently prevented credit unions from growing and serving customers.   At a conference for credit union executives this year, Mr. McWatters told the audience that it deserved a ''rethinking of the relentless barrage of rules and regulations visited upon your organizations by N.C.U.A. and other regulators.''   Credit unions are like banks that are owned by their customers, rather than shareholders seeking profit. In the United States, most credit unions are overseen by the N.C.U.A., which plays a role similar to the one the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation does for traditional banks. Although credit unions were viewed as a potential alternative to banks after the financial crisis, the number of credit unions in the United States has been shrinking each year since the crisis. There are around 6,300 credit unions, down from 7,000 in 2012 and 8,400 in 2007.   Mr. Kahle, who has an inventor's shock of gray, frizzy hair, went to work on the credit union in early 2011 with Mr. Modell, an old friend who had experience in banking. An eager and easily excitable man, Mr. Modell was set to handle the day-to-day operations while Mr. Kahle put up $1 million of his own money to serve as a capital cushion to protect the credit union from any losses.   Mr. Modell said that during the 18-month application process, he and Mr. Kahle made 4,756 changes to their application and made it through only because of Mr. Kahle's wealth.   ''I could afford to say yes at every turn -- every time they made some weird demand,'' Mr. Kahle said.   When they did get their charter from the N.C.U.A. in August 2012 -- the first new credit union chartered that year -- the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union was limited by the regulators to loans of $5,000 or less, and it could generally serve only people in a small area around New Brunswick, N.J., where the credit union was located.   The credit union aimed to provide financial services to poor immigrants, and its opening was attended by the Mexican consul general in New York. But Mr. Modell said that with the restrictions placed on it, the credit union would only have been able to give out what amounted, in practice, to predatory payday loans, which he did not want to do.   Mr. Modell said he accepted the restrictions because he was assured that they would be lifted within a few months. When that did not happen, Mr. Modell and Mr. Kahle began looking at opening basic accounts for companies using the Bitcoin currency, given Mr. Kahle's own experience with technological innovation.   When the N.C.U.A. expressed displeasure with the decision Mr. Modell said, the credit union dropped the two Bitcoin companies it had taken on.   The credit union's other ideas for expansion were also shot down. In 2014, the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union tried to team up with an organization for migrant workers, the Farmworker Support Committee, to offer bank accounts and cheaper money transfers, but the idea was eventually rejected by an N.C.U.A. examiner.   The N.C.U.A. sent its examiners on an increasingly frequent basis and requested more and more monthly reports from Mr. Modell -- often asking about the credit union's past interest in Bitcoin customers. By mid-2014, the credit union had made less than $50,000 in loans and Mr. Kahle suggested to Mr. Modell that it was time to give up.   Mr. Modell resisted and offered to stop taking a salary. But he, too, became increasingly frustrated, particularly after the N.C.U.A. cited the credit union for refinancing a small loan that was past due.   ''That was actually a sound and safe business decision and the reason credit unions were created in the first place,'' Mr. Modell wrote in a letter to the N.C.U.A. ''The member was out of work and in contact with us.''   Mr. Modell has since tried to keep the credit union alive but recently consented to Mr. Kahle's desire to give up on the project.   ''The original vision of this thing -- of helping nonprofit workers, or helping the poor -- they will not allow it,'' Mr. Kahle said.    "
"Poor, but Making a Living From New Bank Notes","CONAKRY, Guinea --  The euro is slipping, the American dollar is holding steady and the world's new digital currency, Bitcoin, is trying to find its foothold. But on a recent sunny afternoon along a main thoroughfare in this busy capital city, the market for stiff new Guinean francs was hopping. ''Hello, Madame!'' a group of men cried out as they stood along a busy roadway with large stacks of shrink-wrapped Guinean francs tucked under their armpits and stuffed into their back pockets.    Guineans like their francs crisp and clean for handing out on special occasions, and that has created demand for new paper money that a cadre of young men, who would otherwise probably be jobless, are eager to serve. Ibrahim Kamera, 29, and his friends make a living selling brand new bills.    Standing near a pedestrian bridge across from one of this city's sprawling markets, they try to reel in customers who want to trade in their old francs, wrinkled, sweaty and dirty, for new ones that have become status symbols to give as gifts at weddings and other celebrations.   In much of West Africa, where credit card machines and A.T.M. s are sparse, cash is king.    But here in Conakry, freshly printed Guinean francs rule. And that has created opportunities in a nation where unemployment is a serious problem, especially for young people -- some government estimates say that as many as 60 percent of youth in the nation are jobless.   The employment situation has worsened as Guinea has struggled to rid itself of Ebola and its economy has plummeted.   The lucky young men find jobs driving taxis or pushing wheelbarrows at construction sites. Others adopt more unsavory professions, on evidence at the local pickpockets' market, where the day's catch of mobile phones, leather wallets and stolen items is on display.   And then there are these men, most in their 20s but some as young as 15, gathered under the bridge.   ''Our life is in this,'' said Ishmael Isho Kamera, 23, one of the money-changers and no relation to Ibrahim Kamera, as he patted his stacks of brand new francs. ''We don't have anything else to do.''   Across the globe, the legal market for money is huge. Numismatists collect old coins and trade them for hundreds or thousands of times their original face value. The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded for a profit, is estimated to be a $5.3 trillion-a-day operation.   And in some parts of the world, the illegal market for money also is thriving.   ''In many countries there's a black market for currencies that is very lucrative for some people,'' said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company in New York.   Here in Conakry, Ibrahim Kamera, who like his friends wears a soccer jersey and flip-flops, considers it a good day if he earns 200,000 francs a day, the equivalent of about $26. Typically, a day may bring in half that much. That is still considerably more than the average daily income in Guinea, which in 2014 was less than a dollar and a half.   Americans fixated over new state-themed quarters when they were released into circulation in the United States. Guineans are keen on the new 20,000 franc bill, with its indigo and green tones and backside portrait of the nation's new Chinese-financed hydroelectric dam in Kaleta, about 60 miles north of the capital, and several electric transmission towers.   The dam increased energy generation to a nation plagued by blackouts and has been one of President Alpha Condé's crowning achievements. The denomination was issued in July, curiously timed to Mr. Condé's campaign for re-election in the fall.   The money-changers under the bridge have learned to be good businessmen. Years ago, they found an original investor, a friend who gave them some starting capital. Now, they earn about 50,000 francs in profits -- about $6.50 -- on every 1,000,000 francs they sell.   Potential customers are easy to pick out, especially the women, who usually are on their way to a wedding, carrying umbrellas and large bags for toting the paper money.   Most clients buy large stacks of bills; they have to if they want their cash gifts to be meaningful. In Guinea, where inflation has taken a toll in past years, a typical lunch of fish, rice and plantains at a restaurant costs about 114,000 francs. One loyal customer buys 15 million francs at a time.   The young men have also honed their sales skills. Mr. Kamera gives discounts to repeat customers. Sometimes he sings to clients, to entertain them so maybe they will buy just a little more money than intended. When Mr. Kamera learns that a customer shares his last name, a common one in parts of West Africa, he makes a scene, pretending to be related for the sake of improving customer relations.   Mr. Kamera and his crew compete with one another, jostling to be first to get to an approaching customer. But it is just part of the job, and all is generally forgiven in a matter of minutes. The men possess a charm and cheerful spirit that belies the danger of their trade and the seeming hopelessness of their lot in life.   Mr. Kamera and his friends are refugees who fled violence in Sierra Leone in the late 2000s. They take turns delivering part of their proceeds to their families, who are scraping by in an abandoned refugee camp in Boreah in the north of Guinea, some 15 hours away by car.   The police occasionally swarm the area by the pedestrian bridge, beating the men, confiscating their stacks of money and jailing them, sometimes for days. After all, their work is illegal.   ''This job,'' said Desmond Conte, 27, in slow, deliberate words, ''is not safe.''   When it comes to sales of new francs, the competition is real. A group of young Guinean-born men plies the same trade on the other side of the bridge no more than 30 feet from the turf Mr. Kamera and his friends have staked out. The groups mostly ignore each other, except for exchanging dirty looks.   For both groups of men, business has been slow because fears of violence around the October presidential election made people wary of scheduling weddings and other events in the city.    One day shortly after the election, it was probably the presence of two American journalists that kept customers away from Mr. Kamera and his friends.   Business was better for the competition on the other side of the bridge, where a woman in a red and gold head scarf and yellow gown dug into her large bag as she approached to conduct business. The woman was buying new francs to hand out to children as gifts, she said before scurrying away without offering her name.   Mr. Kamera and his friends often think about another way of life. Most said they wanted one day to become soccer superstars. If that did not pan out, some said they would like to own a business. Others wanted to become soldiers.   ''Our future belongs to God,'' Mr. Kamera said, ''but for now there are no new opportunities.''   Mr. Kamera was forced to end his education when he was 12 years old to flee Sierra Leone. He would like to finish school then try for his dream job.   ''I want to be an American Marine,'' he said.    "
A Bitcoin Mystery and a Police Raid,"SYDNEY, Australia --  The Australian authorities on Wednesday raided the home of a computer expert and entrepreneur in suburban Sydney, just hours after two news outlets identified the man as a likely creator of the digital currency Bitcoin.  The Australian Federal Police said the raid on the residence of the man, Craig Steven Wright, was for a tax investigation, and a spokesman said it had no connection to the Bitcoin reports. The Australian Taxation Office, which asked the police to carry out the raid, declined to comment on ''any individual's or entity's tax affairs.''    The raid, in the leafy suburb of Gordon on Sydney's upper north shore, came hours after reports in Wired magazine and Gizmodo drew strong links between Mr. Wright and Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the virtual currency that has grown to billions of dollars in total value.   The identity of Mr. Nakamoto has been a mystery since the currency's computer code was released in 2009, with several false leads having been aired and debunked. The growing value of Bitcoin, which is managed by computers that run its peer-to-peer software, has driven the search for its creator or creators.   Wired, which was first to identify Mr. Wright as a possible inventor of the currency, cited old blog posts as well as leaked documents and emails. The magazine acknowledged that the trail of clues could be a hoax, but it added: ''If Wright is seeking to fake his Nakamoto connection, his hoax would be practically as ambitious as Bitcoin itself.''   The Gizmodo report said that Mr. Wright and Dave Kleiman, an American who died in 2013, ''were involved in the development of the digital currency.''   Both outlets cited what was described as a transcript of a 2014 meeting among Mr. Wright, lawyers and tax officials, in which he is quoted as saying, ''I did my best to try and hide the fact that I've been running Bitcoin since 2009.''   ''By the end of this, I think half the world is going to bloody know,'' he added, according to the transcript.   Efforts to reach Mr. Wright on Wednesday were unsuccessful.   A Newsweek investigation in 2014 incorrectly identified the Bitcoin creator as Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a physicist living with his mother in Southern California. He denied the report, saying he had only learned of Bitcoin weeks earlier after a reporter contacted his son.

Farhad and Mike's Week in Tech: Tempering Walmart's Digital Ambitions,"Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Mike: Aloha, Farhad! Another day in paradise. And I mean that literally. It's mid-December and 65 degrees in New York. I'm actually wearing aloha shirts to work.    Farhad: There's a huge storm here in San Francisco. It was hailing last night. Oh, my god, I can't believe we've sunk to talking about the weather. This might be the most boring newsletter yet.   Mike: I can segue to weather tech. Dark Sky is a great weather app.    O.K., on with the show. The weeks leading up into the holidays have been surprisingly eventful.   Yahoo was going to spin off its multibillion-dollar stake in Alibaba, then decided it would probably make more economic sense to just spin itself off. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo's chief executive, announced the enormous shift in company strategy on Wednesday morning, then proceeded to go into labor and deliver identical twins.   In news unrelated to struggling companies or childbirth, Atlassian, an enterprise collaboration software company, had a successful initial public offering this week -- a sentence that made me fall asleep just typing it.   Farhad: You are really going out of your way to bore our readers this week. I commend you.   Mike: It's also worth noting that Airbnb keeps claiming that it is trying to be more transparent with its data on how people use its service, saying it wants to work with cities and regulators. Apparently, Airbnb's definition of transparency is the obfuscation of its data to make it fit its more pleasant, populist narrative. Color me wholly unsurprised.   Oh, I should mention that Gizmodo and Wired seem to have found another culprit who could be the pseudonymous inventor, or inventors, of Bitcoin known as Satoshi Nakamoto. To me, the biggest surprise here is that people still care about Bitcoin.   Farhad: Yes, the effort to unmask the creator of Bitcoin gave me flashbacks to 2013. But now that the articles in Wired and Gizmodo already seem to be falling apart, I'm a bit more interested. By which I mean, I am not totally asleep.   Mike: I do want to talk a bit about digital currency. This week, Walmart announced that it was also jumping into the fray of digital wallets and would offer its customers a way to pay for stuff at its stores using Walmart's own app. It's called Walmart Pay -- a wildly creative title -- and is basically an extension of Walmart's already successful mobile app.   It is based on QR-code technology, which is pretty similar to bar code scanning in retail stores. When customers get to the Walmart checkout line, they open the app and present a digital code to the cashier. That code is connected with a payment method -- a credit card or Walmart gift card, for example -- and is used to pay for their stuff.   Now, I have a lot of thoughts on the complications of this, but I would like to let you go first, mostly so I can knock down all of your terrible arguments.   Farhad: I've got to say, I don't really get this move. Sure, I understand why Walmart wants to be in the payments game. It has been leading the fight against credit card companies over ''swipe fees'' -- the fraction of each purchase that Walmart pays Visa and MasterCard when customers use credit cards. The app helps in that fight. By linking directly to your bank account, Walmart could bypass credit card processors when you shop there.   But that is only if a lot of people use it. And does anybody think that will happen? I am very skeptical. I'm one of the most tech-obsessed nerds around, but I barely ever use Apple Pay when I'm out shopping. Sure, it may be a bit faster to pull out my phone than my credit card, but the difference is so slight that I don't really see the point. And Walmart's QR-code idea sounds like a bigger headache still. Why would anyone use that over a plain old credit card?   Mike: So you're scratching at a problem that Apple and Google are still trying to solve. That is to say, some people think it's a solution in search of a problem. We have spent decades swiping cards with little problem, so it will take decades more to change that behavior.   Do I think a QR code will be the way to change it? No way. It's clunky. You have to persuade people to take out their phones, open the app, scan it and so on. Apple can barely convince people to wave their smartphone over a payment terminal. And for about five years now, Google has not convinced anyone to do anything.   A slightly wonky aside: Walmart was leading the charge on MCX, another QR-code-based payments app created by merchants who wanted to bypass credit card networks and increase their profit margin. Walmart effectively ditching MCX, and all of its other large merchant partners, to work on its own code-based system is basically calling the whole thing a huge embarrassing failure. And to be fair to Walmart, it definitely was.   Here's the bull case: Walmart has some 22 million people using its app already. I think that's even more than Starbucks's app, which is hugely successful. So if you can funnel all of those people who already use the Walmart app to search for coupons and buy things via their phones into opening that app at the register, bully for them!   Still, that's a big if. And, as I have said before, QR codes are so lame. But who knows? I certainly won't count them out quite yet.   Farhad: Do you know what would be truly useful? Imagine if the app didn't just help you pay at checkout, but also let you scan all your goods as you took them off the shelf -- allowing you to complete your purchase from anywhere in the store, and bypass the checkout lines entirely. Sure, there are some security issues with this idea, but there are ways around them. I know because one of Walmart's tech executives showed me a pilot-test of this idea in a Silicon Valley store a few years ago. But it doesn't sound as if we are anywhere close to seeing it in any stores.   Mike: That is actually a rad idea. Sort of Apple-ish.   Farhad: In the meantime, long live QR codes. Have fun in the sun, Mike!   Mike: Gracias! May your days be less cloudy and more bright.    "
No Comment? Not in Their Playbook,"It used to be that money managers and entrepreneurs charged with a crime or civil securities fraud would keep their mouths shut and routinely refer any questions to their lawyers. But in the age of social media, those days are gone. For some media-savvy defendants there is a new script: They jump on Twitter to tell the world they are innocent, even though lawyers think doing so is a terrible -- and legally risky -- idea.    Two days after the pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli was arraigned on federal securities fraud charges, which accused him of defrauding investors in his former hedge funds and looting a drug company he once ran, he proclaimed his innocence in a Twitter post after pleading not guilty in court.   ''I am confident I will prevail,'' Mr. Shkreli, 32, wrote to Twitter followers on Saturday. On Tuesday, he wrote, ''I'm not a criminal,'' in response to a comment on Twitter.     Mr. Shkreli, best known for raising the price of a decades-old drug by 5,000 percent and later paying $2 million to buy the only known copy of an album by the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, has tried to present a carefree attitude online since his arrest on Thursday.    He has also posted streaming videos of himself on YouTube sitting at his computer -- combing his hair, playing chess and strumming a guitar -- and responding to comments from his supporters as if the possibility of going to prison were just a bump in the road.   Last spring, Lynn Tilton, a private equity executive, embarked on a similar public relations strategy after federal securities regulators filed a civil lawsuit that charged her with defrauding investors in distressed-debt securities managed by her firm, Patriarch Partners.    Ms. Tilton, 56, posted a video online defending herself and denying the charges and later used Twitter to attack the Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to bring her case before an administrative law judge, as opposed to filing the matter in federal court.    And in a twist on the strategy, Charlie Shrem, an early proponent of the digital currency Bitcoin and chief of the money exchange service BitInstant, gave a speech via Skype to a Bitcoin conference while under house arrest before he pleaded guilty in 2014 to aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. Mr. Shrem, 26, has continued to post on Twitter, with the assistance of some friends, from federal prison.   His Twitter profile describes him as ''Bitcoin pioneer & first felon.'' In April, shortly after beginning to serve his two-year sentence, Mr. Shrem posted, ''I'm in prison for a victimless crime'' and invited people to write to him.   It is a kind of do-it-yourself defense strategy for those naturally disposed to a certain amount of vanity and self-absorption, experts say. And it is gaining favor even though defense lawyers have counseled against it and warned that the strategy could backfire because some things defendants say can be used against them at trial or sentencing.    Dealing with outspoken clients has become increasingly normal, lawyers say, especially as many of these clients have cultivated online personas that extend beyond their day jobs.   Gregory Morvillo, a lawyer who specializes in representing white-collar defendants, says having a client who posts on Twitter is a ''recipe for disaster.''   ''I am generally averse to my clients going out and speaking publicly, but the reality is there has been a seismic shift in how we communicate,'' said Mr. Morvillo, who represented Anthony Chiasson, a hedge fund manager whose conviction on insider trading charges was overturned by an appellate court.   Joshua B. Newman, a New York entrepreneur charged in a criminal complaint by federal prosecutors with defrauding investors in a number of CrossFit training ventures, has referred on Twitter to having seen ''better days'' and quoted Abraham Lincoln saying, ''Folks with no vices have very few virtues.'' The case is still pending.   Recently, Mr. Newman, 36, started a new online fitness training venture that makes no mention of the fraud charges against him but talks about the favorable media coverage he has received over the years.   Priya Chaudhry, Mr. Newman's lawyer, said in a statement, ''We encourage our clients to right their ships quickly and permanently, so they can return to good, productive lives.''   This new era of defiance on social media has led to the unusual situation in which the person charged with wrongdoing is the one doing the talking, while the lawyer is often the one to say no comment. That has been the case with Mr. Shkreli's lawyers at the big law firm Arnold & Porter, which has repeatedly declined to comment on the charges against Mr. Shkreli.   Marc A. Agnifilo, the lawyer who represented Mr. Shrem, said that for clients who take to social media to defend themselves it ''can feel good at the time,'' but it has the potential to undermine plea negotiations that might be taking place.   ''We are in the age of oversharing,'' Mr. Agnifilo said.   Mr. Agnifilo and Mr. Morvillo both said they could imagine a situation in which they might be forced to let go of a client who did not heed advice and said too much about a case on Twitter or other social media forums.   Legal experts say they are less concerned about a person facing civil fraud charges, like Ms. Tilton, speaking out on Twitter since there is no risk of jail time.   Denise Shull, a former trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and a coach to Wall Street money managers, said there was an element of narcissism behind the social media defense.   ''If you've already displayed attention-seeking behavior, the chances are you're going to continue along that path if you can,'' Ms. Shull said.    In the case of Ms. Tilton, being in the public eye is not new. She has cultivated an image that plays on her role as a powerful executive in the male-dominated private equity industry. ''It's only men I strip and flip,'' she said in the pilot for a reality television show about her life called ''The Diva of Distressed.''    Ms. Tilton has contested allegations by the S.E.C. that she breached her fiduciary duty to clients by failing to properly value the assets of distressed companies in some portfolios, allowing her to collect as much as $200 million in management fees. Ms. Tilton released a video called ''Fight Like a Girl'' soon after the S.E.C. brought its complaint.   She filed a countersuit against the S.E.C., and the agency's case has been stayed by a federal appeals court while it considers the legality of regulators' decision to proceed with the matter before an administrative law judge.   In a statement, Ms. Tilton said social media gave her the best forum to speak directly to the public. ''Social media has provided me the medium to best reflect my ideas, my business and me in my own words and images,'' Ms. Tilton said.   Other defendants, such as Mark Cuban, the billionaire businessman, reality TV show star and owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, have frequently used social media to jab at the S.E.C. He has gone after the regulator on Twitter several times since a Dallas jury cleared him of federal insider trading charges in October 2013.   As for Mr. Shkreli, the streaming videos appear to be one way for him to keep his relevance and the degree of fame he has found since defending the decision by Turing Pharmaceuticals, which he ran, to raise the price of a critical drug to $750 a pill from about $13. Turing fired Mr. Shkreli after his arrest, giving him more time to produce the videos from his Midtown Manhattan apartment.   ''A small bit of it is, 'I'm going to try to win this P.R. battle,' '' Ms. Shull said of Mr. Shkreli's tactics. ''But to go on and on? That would suggest that he is petrified.''   In one video, Mr. Shkreli spends time removing some of the critical and profane comments viewers posted online about him. He also takes time out to answer a question about why he is making the videos, saying, ''I am doing this to mostly relax.''    "
Cash Call for a New Technology,"The newest venture from Blythe Masters, until recently a star banker at JPMorgan Chase, appeared to be an overnight success story in the making. Her start-up, Digital Asset Holdings, is working in one of the hottest areas of growth on Wall Street today: the blockchain technology that underlies the virtual currency Bitcoin. And Ms. Masters has already received a promise from JPMorgan, her former employer, to be the lead investor on the new project, pitching in around $7.5 million.    But Ms. Masters's company has been struggling for months to close the deal with other investors. Most recently, large banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have balked at putting money into Digital Asset Holdings after learning that JPMorgan was being given better terms than other investors, according to several people briefed on the deal.   The banks and financial firms looking into investing, the people said, have also expressed doubts about the actual software solutions Ms. Masters's start-up is working on, much of which has been put together through purchases of smaller start-ups.    ''The deal would need to improve materially for us to get involved,'' said one executive at a financial firm, who has been looking at putting money into Ms. Masters's company, speaking on the condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing. ''It's not supercompelling.''   Digital Asset Holdings' head of business development, Beth Shah, said assertions that the company was facing challenges in raising funds were inaccurate but she declined to provide further details. All of the potential investors declined to comment.   The challenges that Ms. Masters is facing reflect in part the increasingly difficult environment facing start-ups of all sorts as investors have begun to worry that the tech industry has been overhyped and overvalued, pushing down values for companies both public and private.   She is also contending with the difficulty of building a viable business around the virtual currency Bitcoin and the various technological concepts it has introduced to the financial industry, most of all the blockchain.   The blockchain is the database on which all transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Unlike normal databases, the blockchain is maintained by everyone using the database in a decentralized fashion. That has led many in the financial industry to hail it as a faster -- and more reliable -- alternative to existing transaction systems.   Digital Asset Holdings is proposing to build something similar to the blockchain database, in order to provide a cheaper and faster way to trade other sorts of financial assets, such as loans and foreign currencies.   The problem for Ms. Masters is that several other start-ups are trying to do something similar, and there is no guarantee that any of the start-ups will ultimately succeed. Many industry experts think that it could take years to get to the point where the blockchain technology can be used effectively by banks -- if it works at all.   The New York-based start-up ItBit, which is building its own blockchain-like technology, had been out trying to raise $100 million based on the assumption that the company was worth $250 million. More recently, it has scaled that back and is now hoping to get $50 million from investors, with a valuation of $135 million.   Ms. Masters hopes to raise from $35 million to $45 million, valuing the company at $100 million.   Digital Asset Holdings is a relative newcomer to the area. It grew out of a Bitcoin trading operation created by the Chicago trading firm DRW, which operated through a little-known subsidiary of DRW known as Cumberland Mining & Materials.   The founder of DRW, Don Wilson, helped recruit Ms. Masters, 46, to Digital Asset Holdings this year. Ms. Masters, Oxford-born and Cambridge-educated, had worked at JPMorgan for nearly three decades.   She became one of the bank's better-known employees after helping to develop the credit default swap in the 1990s. But Ms. Masters left JPMorgan in 2014 after a unit in the commodities business she headed was accused of manipulating electricity prices. Ms. Masters was not accused of wrongdoing, and the bank has said that her departure was not tied to the regulatory problems.   Soon after Ms. Masters joined Digital Asset Holdings, known as D.A., this past spring, the company began working with the investment bank Sandler O'Neill to raise money. Within the company, there was an expectation that the fund-raising would be finished by the fall, according to people briefed on the situation.   At the same time, though, D.A. was trying to figure out its product. Initially, it was looking at creating financial services tied to Bitcoin itself, including a sliver of a Bitcoin that would maintain the value of a dollar. On the wall of the offices there was a screen showing the price of the virtual currency, according to people who were at the offices.   But not long after Ms. Masters arrived, the Bitcoin chart came down and Digital Asset Holdings began to talk about developing databases similar to the one that Bitcoin had introduced, but not connected to Bitcoin itself.   Ms. Masters secured most of the company's top programming talent by buying smaller start-ups already working in that area, firms with names like Hyperledger, Blockstack and Bits of Proof.   In recent months, the software that Ms. Masters has shown to potential investors allows for the issuance and trading of so-called syndicated loans -- large loans broken into pieces and sold to different investors. It can take weeks for trades in this market to go through, a time span that D.A. is trying to shorten.   Investors who have looked at the software, though, say they are not convinced that Ms. Masters's technology will fix the problems in the loan market, which are attributed as much to human cooperation as to bad software.   There are also indications that Digital Asset Holdings has not had an easy time integrating all the outside technology start-ups it bought. For example, two of the three employees who worked at Blockstack, which the company acquired in October, have already negotiated to leave D.A., people briefed on the situation said.   ''All employees who were offered permanent positions at the time of the acquisitions of Bits of Proof, Hyperledger and Blockstack are still with the company,'' said Ms. Shah.   One of Ms. Masters's competitors, known as R3, has approached the problem from a different angle and is trying to determine how the banks want to use the blockchain before building specific software. With that strategy, R3 has signed on over 40 banks as partners in recent months, including all of the big banks that Ms. Masters is trying to persuade to invest in her company.   None of this has scared off JPMorgan, which has agreed to lead the Series A investment round in Digital Asset Holdings, people briefed on the negotiations said. To reward JPMorgan, the people said, D.A. plans to grant it warrants to buy a bigger share of the start-up in the future at the same price it is getting now. JPMorgan is said to have committed to helping Ms. Masters's company improve and secure adoption of its technology.   Some of the other banks looking into investing in D.A. raised concerns about the JPMorgan deal in a meeting this month at the Sandler O'Neill offices that included Citi, Goldman and Bank of America representatives. Smaller financial companies, like Nasdaq and Markit, have also remained on the fence, the people briefed on the negotiations said.    "
Privacy and Cost Clash With New Technologies for Security at Airports,"BOSTON --  At a mock airport in an underground laboratory here at Northeastern University, students pretending to be passengers head through a security exit in the right direction, while a young man enters going the wrong way. On a nearby computer screen, a newly developed video surveillance software program flags the wayward person and sounds an alarm. In a lab across the street, researchers are developing a new way to detect explosives using radar.     Just down the hall, a professor and a team of students are working on a scanning system that they hope will speed up security lines. The system uses machines installed in walls or other places to scan passengers as they walk past instead of having them walk individually into a conventional scanning machine.   ''The goal is to have a system that provides better scanning of individuals going through security, while at the same time making it more convenient,'' said Jose Martinez Lorenzo, a professor of mechanical and industrial engineering, who is directing the project.   But the ambitious research in the name of passenger safety and easing air travel delays is colliding with pressure to protect privacy and to reduce federal spending.   ''As we adopt new technologies to meet the constantly changing needs of our aviation infrastructure in a budget-constrained environment, these technologies must be proven to be effective, protect civil liberties, and properly balance security with passenger privacy,'' said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and ranking member on the Committee on Homeland Security.   Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said that advances in technology could actually help solve the budget issues.   ''These things are expensive, but it's cheaper than paying a person to stand there,'' he said. ''You don't have to pay health care benefits to a robot. There's nothing necessarily wrong with it as long as there are controls in place so things are not abused and they don't turn over the surveillance totally to a software program.''   The video surveillance software was developed by Octavia Camps and Mario Sznaier, both engineering professors, to detect passengers going the wrong way through exits, and it has been tested since April 2014 at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. The software is used at one exit, which handles 50,000 people a week, and has a 99 percent detection rate with only five false alarms a week, according to local officials.   The Northeastern researchers are developing additional uses for the video surveillance systems, including detection of suspicious packages left unattended and software that would recognize ''coordinated activities'' among individuals.   Airport officials say passengers entering restricted areas through exits pose a major security threat and can cost airports and airlines millions of dollars.   Last year in Detroit, for example, flights were canceled and a terminal was shut until a passenger who had gone the wrong way through an exit lane had been located. Irate passengers bombarded social media and airport phone lines.   ''While it's not a common occurrence, when it happens it can cause severe disruptions to air travel,'' said William Young, a former Transportation Security Administration official who worked in Cleveland during the testing. ''It's a major security challenge for the T.S.A.'' Mr. Young approached researchers at Northeastern about developing the software.   Officials like Mr. Young say T.S.A. and airport security personnel usually catch most offenders but only after closing sections of the airport and diverting staff members to conduct the search.   ''So this could potentially help us better utilize the manpower we have and avoid having to cancel flights and close terminals if we have a better way of finding people who breach security,'' Mr. Young said.   Most airports use video to track suspicious behavior. But while video feeds can help spot intruders, the sheer volume of information, and a troubling number of false alarms, can overwhelm security officers.   Another part of the advanced video analytics technology developed by Ms. Camps and Mr. Sznaier, which is known as the Video Analytic Surveillance Transition Project, or V.A.S.T., will solve the problem of false alarms by not only detecting a person trying to enter the secure area through an exit, but also by remembering that person's identity using details such as their size and shape as well as the texture and color of their clothing. This allows security personnel to track them throughout the airport without having to shut down a terminal or the entire airport.   But not everyone embraces the new method of surveillance. Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty project of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said numerous questions remain about the potential widespread use of video analytics tools.   ''There are so many issues raised by the use of these technologies,'' she said. ''Will the cameras have face-recognition capabilities, able to track your every move and tap into your Social Security number and other personal information?''   Ms. Crockford acknowledged that the software could be a valuable tool for airport security, but her fear, she said, is that the software could expand to track people in public areas outside airports.   ''What starts in the airport doesn't stay there,'' she said.   At Northeastern, researchers say that they use a small amount of video data and that no personal information is gathered.   ''In this project we use video feeds from cameras that are already installed at the airport and used by T.S.A. to monitor airport security in public areas,'' Dr. Camps said. ''No names or identities are associated at any time with the processed video.''   Researchers are also using the video analytics technology to conduct research for a project with Boston's Logan International Airport to help it examine its security lines. The airport hopes to use the information to determine the length of the lines and speed of people moving through them to better deploy its security personnel.   The video surveillance, scanning and bomb detection technologies are funded by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Science and Technology. Northeastern University is part of a consortium of universities and private companies that receive about $3.5 million a year for the research and development of the technologies.   Homeland Security officials say it could be years before the technologies being developed here are fully deployed and even then they would not totally remove the human element from surveillance.   ''But in an era of tight budgets these tools can help us use our resources better,'' Mr. Young said.    "
Foiling Deception to Keep Free Markets Fair,"ROBERT J. SHILLER is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale. Perhaps the most widely admired of all the economic theories taught in our universities is the notion that an unregulated competitive economy is optimal for everyone. In this optimal economy, each person is said to be a free actor who makes decisions purely in his or her own self-interest. Economists on both the right and left commonly say that these fundamental ideas tie our values of freedom and individuality to the success of our economies.    The problem is that these ideas are flawed. Along with George A. Akerlof, university professor at Georgetown and a fellow Nobel laureate in economic science, I have used behavioral economics to plumb the soundness of these notions.   In our book, ''Phishing for Phools: The Economics of Manipulation and Deception'' (Princeton, 2015), we question the all-commanding relevance of the free-market theory to our actual lives and economies. While we confirm the importance of free markets, we have found that market regulation has been crucial, and believe that will continue to be true in the future.    Don't get us wrong: George and I are certainly free-market advocates. In fact, I have argued for years that we need more such markets, like futures markets for single-family home prices or occupational incomes, or markets that would enable us to trade claims on gross domestic product. I've written about these things in this column.   But, at the same time, we both believe that standard economic theory is typically overenthusiastic about unregulated free markets. It usually ignores the fact that, given normal human weaknesses, an unregulated competitive economy will inevitably spawn an immense amount of manipulation and deception.   We use the word ''phishing'' as a metaphor for a range of seemingly harmless modern market manipulations -- like putting candy bars and gossip magazines at the checkout counter, where bored or tired adults and the parents of whining children will be tempted to spend a few extra dollars. And we coined the word ''phool'' to describe someone who does not understand how much thought and effort have gone into manipulating him or her.   These activities are widespread not because people in business generally have evil motives, but because of the existence of market forces -- a phishing equilibrium enforced by competition. It works this way: When you realize that your competitor has used sophisticated and effective marketing tricks, then you will fall behind if you don't follow suit.   Some businesses try to resist this trend on their own. Stores experimented decades ago with eliminating candy from checkout lines, for example, hoping to impress customers with their morality, but these efforts have largely failed. When profit margins are tight, those businesses that do not phish may simply be driven from existence.   Many economists see evidence of manipulation and deception in the marketplace, but most do not view the phenomena as a fundamental and ubiquitous problem with unregulated free markets. Deception and manipulation are inadequately discussed in textbooks on theory. As a result, market regulation is excessively maligned.   We see things differently: The success of the United States economy -- and of those similar to it -- can be attributed both to the relative freedom of its markets and to the fact that common-sense regulation has been imposed on them. Fortunately, many countries' civil societies have injected a sense of morality into market activities.   The Thatcher-Reagan revolution a third of a century ago was a turning point away from market regulation, with mixed results. But the academic world's formalization of free markets into mathematical economics supported that revolution with limited reservations.   Students in economic theory are now taught with few caveats that a competitive free-market economy will be ''Pareto-optimal,'' in homage to the economist Vilfredo Pareto. If you haven't studied economic theory, a little explanation is in order.   A Pareto-optimal economy is achieved when it is impossible to make any one person better off without making at least someone worse off. That theory holds that each person makes economic decisions that result in the best possible outcome for that particular person. In economic jargon, each person individually maximizes a ''utility function'' that represents his or her own welfare. This theory is taught in many textbooks as the ''first fundamental theorem of welfare economics,'' and is presented with mathematical elegance. Protests against this theory, which were once common, have largely disappeared.   It's worth noting, though, that the first protest came from Pareto himself. He did not intend to use his insights in the manner in which they are commonly employed today. Pareto observed that his concept of optimality neglected some important moral dimensions: People in free markets do not really manage to maximize what the philosopher Jeremy Bentham would call their utility. They don't always succeed in maximizing their true welfare, but something else, something much more limited.   In 1918, Irving Fisher, the Yale economist, argued that what people maximize in their actions is something that could better be described as ''wantability'' rather than utility, for they are subject to temptation and mistakes in the vast array of purchases they make, leading profit-maximizing marketers to take advantage of them on a systematic basis.   In the first half of the 20th century, such critiques were of general interest. But they are little discussed today.   Current economic theory does recognize that if there is an ''externality'' -- say, a business polluting the air in the course of producing the goods it sells -- the outcome won't be optimal, and most economists would agree that in such cases we need government intervention.   But the problem of market-incentivized professional manipulation and deception is fundamental, not an externality. In short, the superiority of untrammeled free markets -- the fundamental theorem of welfare economics -- has taken on the aura of a law from the heavens. Yet technology has advanced so that temptations are being manipulated ever more effectively.   In fact, the real success of economies that embody free markets has much to do with the heroic efforts of campaigners for better values, both among private organizations and advocates of government regulation. For example, before 1900 most of the patent medicines that were sold to the public were fraudulent.   Most of these frauds have since been eliminated, not by market forces, but by the activities of private citizens who took action not selfishly but for the public good. Examples include Harvey Washington Wiley (1844-1930) and Alice Lakey (1857-1935), whose campaigns led to the foundation of the Food and Drug Administration in 1906, and Stuart Chase (1888-1985) and Frederick J. Schlink (1891-1995), whose advocacy in the 1920s led to the establishment of Consumer Reports in 1936.   Unfortunately, such giants have not become truly famous and have been largely forgotten. Contemporary heroes tend more often to be entertainers or businesspeople who are little more than masters of manipulation. Maybe the reason is that the heroes' criticism ignites doubt about many of our own day-to-day activities.   We have lapsed into a mode of thought that glorifies free markets and belittles economic heroism. We need those markets, but we need real heroes too.    "
State Returns Suspended by TurboTax,"TurboTax, the country's most popular do-it-yourself tax preparation software, said on Friday that it had temporarily stopped processing state tax returns because of an increase in fraudulent filings. State agencies have reported a rise in filings with stolen personal information, said Intuit, the company behind TurboTax.  Most victims found out that a fraudulent tax return was submitted in their name when they received a rejection notice after filing their returns, said Julie Miller, an Intuit spokeswoman.    There have been no issues with federal returns to date because the Internal Revenue Service has adopted stronger fraud detection policies, Ms. Miller said.   Intuit said it resumed filing of state returns at about 6 p.m. Eastern time Friday with increased fraud protections, a day after it halted them.   Intuit is working with a security company, Palantir, to investigate the problem. So far, there has been no security breach of its systems, Intuit said. Instead, company officials say they think personal information was stolen elsewhere and used to file returns on TurboTax.   Ms. Miller linked the problem to recent security breaches at large companies. This week, Anthem, a major health insurer, said hackers had gained access to the Social Security numbers, names, addresses and personal information of about 80 million people. Earlier security breaches have occurred at JPMorgan Chase and retailers that include Home Depot and Target.   ''You have a pretty rich pool of data out there in the world,'' Ms. Miller said.   Intuit said state tax returns already filed when the halt began on Thursday would be transmitted as soon as possible. TurboTax processed 30 million tax returns last year, Ms. Miller said.   A rival, H&R Block, which also sells tax preparation software, did not respond to a request for comment. Liberty Tax said it was letting TurboTax customers file state returns free at its more than 4,000 locations around the country.    Shares of Intuit, based in Mountain View, Calif., fell $3.88, or 4.2 percent, to close at $87.83.     "
Bill Would Limit Use of Student Data,"Is the digital revolution in the classroom giving the education technology industry carte blanche to exploit student data? That was the question some teacher and parents groups have posed in their public responses to the news last week that Pearson, the education publisher, had been covertly monitoring social media sites to identify students who might have disclosed questions from its assessment tests.    In an effort to ease parent and teacher concerns, two congressmen are planning to introduce a bill on Monday that would place limits on how education technology companies can use information about kindergarten through 12th-grade students.    Called the Student Digital Privacy and Parental Rights Act, the bill would prohibit companies that operate school services -- like online homework portals, digital grade books for teachers or student email programs -- from knowingly using or disclosing students' personal information to tailor advertisements to them. It would also bar them from collecting or using student data to create marketing profiles.   In phone interviews, Representative Jared S. Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican, the bill's sponsors, said they hoped to increase trust in education technology companies.   ''This is a first step in providing a framework that can address the concerns of parents and educators and, at the same time, allow the promise of education technology to transform our schools,'' Mr. Polis said.   But the bill is likely to be opposed by education privacy advocates who seek stronger consent mechanisms for students and parents -- as well as by industry groups that favor self-regulation.   ''All this bill does is add additional legal hurdles for innovating educational services,'' an executive at a technology trade group wrote to associates on Friday in a private email that was forwarded to a reporter with the stipulation that the writer of the email not be named.   As school districts across the country turn to powerful new digital education tools, efforts to increase teacher and parent buy-in have been multiplying. Industry executives say that so-called adaptive learning products seem particularly promising. These are apps and sites that can collect and analyze a wealth of student information with the idea of tailoring lessons on the spot to the abilities of each child.   ''The world of big data has hit the classroom,'' Mr. Messer said. ''We want to preserve the positive benefits the technology can bring to student outcomes.''   Some parents have started warning, however, that school districts lack the resources to monitor how technology vendors use and secure their children's records. These parents say they're troubled by the risk of everything from data breaches and identity theft to the possibility of companies sharing sensitive details like students' grades, disciplinary actions or health data with college or job recruiters.    Although there is a federal education privacy law that requires schools to maintain control over students' educational records, critics say it has not kept pace with the practices of educational technology companies.   ''As a parent, I'm concerned that there are vast amounts of academic, physical and behavioral information being acquired on children that could have negative implications for our children's future,'' said Anna Shah-Bomba, a mother of an elementary school student and a college student in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.   Last year, for instance, ConnectEDU -- a career planning site with listings on the academic, personal and career details of millions of students -- sought to sell its databases as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.   After federal regulators intervened, the acquiring companies notified the site's account holders that they could choose to have their information deleted.    Partly in response to such incidents, President Obama in January announced a proposal for a new student digital privacy law.   ''We're saying that data collected on students in the classroom should only be used for educational purposes,'' Mr. Obama said in a speech at the time.   The Messer-Polis bill incorporates that principle. In addition to prohibiting school services from personalizing ads to students, the bill obliges vendors to delete students' records should a school request it. It also requires vendors to allow schools or parents to see and correct student files.   But some privacy experts said the draft bill had major loopholes that would allow school services to use student information in ways students and parents might not expect or find acceptable.   For example, it allows school services to make unilateral changes to their contracts and privacy policies. It permits them to disclose student information for purposes like preparing for ''employment opportunities.'' And it would not prohibit sites like ConnectEDU from selling student records as part of a merger or acquisition.   The bill is also unlikely to prohibit companies like Pearson from monitoring the social media posts of students if those activities are performed on behalf of state educational agencies.   ''Although this bill has some promising features,'' said Khaliah Barnes, director of the student privacy project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a research center in Washington, ''it ultimately fails to uphold President Obama's promise that the data collected in an educational context can be used only for educational purposes.''

World Briefing | Asia; China: University Defends Professors,"BEIJING -- A Chinese university has denied that three of its professors who are among six Chinese scientists charged in the United States with economic espionage and theft of trade secrets stole technology, the Chinese state news media reported this week.  The indictments, announced by the United States Justice Department on Tuesday, allege that the scientists took cellphone chip technology from two American companies where they worked and formed a joint venture company with Tianjin University that produced and sold the chips to the Chinese military and to commercial customers.    Tianjin University defended its three professors, claiming that their work ''adheres to international standards for scientific research and is within the parameters of academic ethics,'' according to a report on Thursday by China's state-run news agency, Xinhua.   The university also expressed ''indignation and firm denial'' at being accused of benefiting inappropriately from the economic espionage, which was said to have been committed by Zhang Hao, who was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport last Saturday, and the other academics, who are believed to be in China. The charges ''seriously harm'' academic exchanges between the two countries, university authorities said.   Mr. Zhang, 36, is a staff member at the university's School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering. In 2011, he was a founder of a company in Tianjin, ROFS Microsystem, which an official website said was located in a part of the city that serves as a technology base for the university.   In light of the charges, the university promised to provide humanitarian and legal assistance to Mr. Zhang and his family members in the United States.   The vociferous denial by the university comes at a time when the Chinese state news media has begun a widespread propaganda campaign to cast doubt on the American allegations while warning the public to be wary of hostile foreign forces.   Even as the state news media disparaged the United States for being paranoid about China's rise, a report on Thursday from the official China News Service announced that three Chinese people had been caught spying for ''foreign agents.'' The people, who were only identified by their last names, provided photographs of military installations and sent information such as military newspapers, classified documents and satellite maps to overseas personnel, state security officials said.   The report did not identify which country or countries were suspected of being involved. Nor did it explain why news of the cases, which included a Chinese man imprisoned in June 2014, was only announced this week.   This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.             "
"Identity Chaos, Courtesy of Your Federal Government","Twitter: @ronlieber The year 2015 may set a new standard for shoulder-shrugging after identity thefts and data breaches that ought to provoke outrage. Captains of industry and the Secret Service have long since admitted to our elected representatives that they are outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered and outplanned.    But instead of the guardians of our personal data making an all-out stand, we find that the very entities that are supposed to protect us are themselves vulnerable and sloppy. This month, we learned that Experian, one of a handful of companies that guard the credit file motherlode on all of us, allowed hackers access to the personal information of 15 million aspiring T-Mobile customers. Experian was sorry, sincerely. Ho-hum.   The Internal Revenue Service, allowed criminals to gain access to the tax returns of at least 300,000 people, part of a yearslong pattern where it cannot seem to stop hackers from filing false returns and claiming tax refunds in the names of other people. Billions of dollars in taxpayer money have flown out the door, despite the fact that the I.R.S. has had thousands of people working on the problem. It can take six months to straighten out the problem once you've detected it, if you ever do. We have come to expect this sort of thing.    But recently, I encountered the most bizarre case of identity madness that I have ever heard of, involving a 66-year-old psychologist named Victoria Schindler. It began with months of accusations and stonewalling from or on behalf of federal agencies. That led her to stop seeing new Medicare patients at her practice in Cary, N.C. She even considered retiring altogether.   The story begins with our absurd system of student loans, in which we tell teenagers to take them out if they want an education and then unleash rabid debt collectors when large numbers of them fail to repay the debt.   In late April, Ms. Schindler got a note in the mail from an entity she'd never heard of, called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. It informed her that the Federal Department of Education had taken $689.28 from money that she was supposed to receive for caring for patients who have Medicare coverage.   The letter told her that she'd previously received notice of this debt, which wasn't true. Nor did she owe a cent to the Department of Education, since she'd repaid her student loans a quarter-century ago.   So Ms. Schindler assumed the letter was a fraud. She was wrong. Someone, somewhere in the layers of federal bureaucracy had confused her for somebody else, who did indeed owe about $15,000.   Debt collectors working for the Department of Education were eventually able to confirm that her own debts had a zero balance. But then, over the phone, she said, they accused her of taking out debt for a child. When she explained that she had no children, they accused her of borrowing for somebody else's child. ''I swear, that's what they said to me,'' she recalled in one of a series of conversations we had over the months that she, and eventually I, tried to get to the bottom of all of this.   She reluctantly agreed to send all sorts of identifying information (much more than anyone needs to submit to apply for a student loan in the first place, by the way) to the department. ''Somebody could have had quite a party with that, oh boy,'' she said. The department promptly lost it, though she had confirmed via registered mail that it had arrived safely.   Eventually, one of the debt collectors took pity on her and informed her of the existence of an ombudsman's office at the Department of Education. ''She told me that she wasn't supposed to tell me about that,'' Ms. Schindler said.   The next move soon became clear: It was the Department of Treasury that had the sole power to stop taking Ms. Schindler's Medicare money. But it would not do so without a letter from the Department of Education confirming that this was all a big misunderstanding. And Ms. Schindler was unable to get the Department of Education to hand over that note.   At that point, I started making some calls and Ms. Schindler soon heard from apologetic Treasury employees who explained what happened. She did not believe it at first, and neither did I, but this whole incident seems to have happened because she is a woman.   The Department of Education sent the original student loan debtor's Social Security number to the Treasury Department to begin the garnishment process. Garnishment can happen when, at the behest of another entity of the federal government, the Treasury Department takes, say, your income tax refunds or Social Security checks. But when Treasury ran the debtor's Social Security number through its systems, what came back was the federal Employer Identification Number for Ms. Schindler's psychology practice. Those two numbers were identical, which the federal government freely allows and is a story for another day.   Then came the additional twist: The student loan debtor was also named Victoria, though Ms. Schindler never communicated with her. At that point, someone at the Treasury Department simply assumed that the two Victorias were the same person. ''That's what we do with women,'' Ms. Schindler said that Treasury employees, who had clearly faced this situation before, told her. ''They don't do it to men, because men don't change their names a lot.''   Short of having a sex change, there seem to be few ways for other people to avoid getting caught up in casual indifference like this. I asked the Treasury Department if it might consider double-checking to make sure that women with different last names are not, in fact, different women. It turns out that this research is always supposed to happen, but it did not in this case. On Friday, officials promised to review procedures to make sure that this kind of thing doesn't happen again. According to the Department of Education, it may happen only a few times each year.   More than once, people at both the Department of Education and Treasury told Ms. Schindler that the quickest way to put an end to her troubles was to get her congressman or senator involved. She did not do this, but if you ever have similar problems, my column about how to get such constituent services should be helpful.   If you're looking for armor that can protect you from the fallout of breaches like the one at Experian, a security freeze can help. A freeze, which you initiate at the big three credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax and TransUnion -- should keep hackers and purchasers of stolen data from opening new credit accounts in your name.   Experian tells us to worry not about the vulnerability of its primary database, the one that has all of the information about nearly every one of us. ''Our credit database is on an entirely different network that is protected with a robust firewall and is also physically separated from other servers,'' said Susan Henson, a spokeswoman. As far as Experian knows, there has never been a breach on that main consumer credit database. I hope it never happens and fully expect that it will someday.   A security freeze won't directly protect you from basic I.R.S. tax refund fraud. One thing that may help is filing your taxes quickly. That way, you're putting in for your refund before any criminal does, since many of them submit false returns early each tax season.   As for Ms. Schindler, who estimates that she has lost at least 40 hours of her life to her quagmire, she stopped billing Medicare as soon as she figured out what was happening. After all, if she did submit bills then the Treasury Department would inevitably seize the money again.   One patient stopped seeing her, since she knew that Ms. Schindler wasn't getting paid and did not think it was right to continue getting treatment. Ms. Schindler strongly considered closing down her practice, literally ceasing her service to the federal old-age health care program because some other arm of the federal government was making it impossible for her to collect her modest fees.   But by last month, we thought we had worked everything out. The check for the money that the Treasury Department had garnished was reportedly in the mail.   Then, there was this news: Thanks to an error at the Department of Education, the Treasury Department had sent her money to the wrong address.   And wouldn't you know it? It ended up in the hands of the other Victoria, the one who had defaulted on her own student loan and caused all of these dominoes to fall over on Ms. Schindler in the first place.   On the second try -- but really something more like the 25th, after all of those months -- Ms. Schindler finally got her check once the Department of Education canceled the first one.    "
5 Indicted in Leak of Vatican Documents,"ROME --  Vatican prosecutors on Saturday formally indicted five people in connection with the theft of confidential documents used to write two tell-all books describing purported mismanagement in the Roman Catholic Church's bureaucracy. The five defendants were charged with ''illegally procuring and successively revealing information and documents concerning the fundamental interests of the Holy See and the state,'' the Vatican said in a statement issued Saturday.    Msgr. Lucio Ángel Vallejo Balda, and Francesca Chaouqui, a laywoman, were  part of a commission set up by Pope Francis to examine the Vatican's financial holdings and affairs. They were  also charged with criminal conspiracy, as was Monsignor  Vallejo Balda's assistant, Nicola Maio.    The authors of the two books -- Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi -- are accused of ''demanding and exercising pressures, above all on Vallejo Balda, to obtain confidential documents and information, that in part they used to draft two books,'' according to the statement.  The books, Mr. Nuzzi's ''Merchants in the Temple'' and Mr. Fittipaldi's ''Avarice,'' were published this month.   Disclosing confidential documents has been considered a crime in the Vatican since July 2013, after a similar episode involving the personal butler of Pope Benedict XVI, Paolo Gabriele, who transferred a cache of Vatican letters to Mr. Nuzzi. Mr. Gabriele was imprisoned, tried and in October 2012 sentenced to 18 months in prison, only to be pardoned by Benedict two months later. Mr. Nuzzi used the papers to write the 2012 best-seller ''Sua Santità,'' or ''His Holiness,'' which detailed infighting and power struggles at the Vatican.   Those revelations are considered to have had an impact on Benedict's decision to resign.   If that scandal, which the media called ''VatiLeaks,'' caught the Vatican unprepared, in the case of the fresh disclosures, officials acted quickly. Monsignor Vallejo Balda and Ms. Chaouqui were arrested a few days before the books were published. He remains detained, and she was released after cooperating with investigators.   The trial is to begin on Tuesday, and the defendants could face up to eight years in prison if convicted.   Both Mr. Fittipaldi and Mr. Nuzzi say that they have not committed any crimes, but have only done what any investigative journalist would do: uncover and expose corruption and mismanagement in places of power.   They also point out that the documents they divulged were hardly closely held state secrets, the ''fundamental interests of the Holy See,'' as the Vatican contends in the indictment.   Reached by telephone on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Fittipaldi said he was ''incredulous'' that the Vatican was putting him on trial. ''I didn't reveal anything that put the life of the pope at risk,'' he said. ''Instead, the documents recount the financial scandals of the curia, crazy investments, greed. It seems strange that they would investigate the teller of those misdeeds rather than those who carried them out.''    Putting journalists on trial is a chilling message from the Vatican, the writers said. ''They want to show that they are a state with laws that have to be respected even if we don't like them,'' even if they are undemocratic, Mr. Fittipaldi said. ''They want to make an example of this. It's going to be more difficult for scandals of this type to emerge in the future,'' because those who might want to expose corruption and mismanagement will be more wary.   Mr. Nuzzi remained defiant. ''I am proud to have published information that was not supposed to get out, as any journalist would have done,'' he said.  ''I didn't reveal state secrets'' involving internal military or security or intelligence issues, ''but instances of dishonesty and abuse, and I will continue to do so.''   Questions of conflicting laws are likely to arise if the court convicts the two journalists and then asks for their extradition from Italy to begin serving their sentences, Mr. Fittipaldi said. Italy has laws protecting freedom of the press, even if the Vatican does not. Both men said they were not certain that they would attend the hearings.   Mr. Nuzzi also complained that with the trial date three days away, he would not have enough time to prepare his defense. ''I haven't had access to the charges or investigative acts, I haven't spoken to my Vatican court-appointed lawyer, and I am still not sure what I'm being accused of,'' he said. In light of the pope's increasing appeals to the faithful to be more merciful in the holy year that begins on Dec. 8, ''this trial would appear like a contradiction,'' he said.

India Retracts a Proposal to Regulate Social Media,"NEW DELHI --  Responding to a chorus of criticism, Indian officials on Tuesday hastily withdrew a draft policy on encryption that would have required users of social media and messaging applications to save plain-text versions of their messages for 90 days so that they could be shared with the police. The proposal, which many condemned as both draconian and impractical, came as an embarrassment days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi travels to Silicon Valley to try to attract investment and promote India as an emerging market for digital technology.     Mr. Modi is an avid user of social media and has mobilized large networks of online activists during his party's campaigns.   The government issued a statement Tuesday saying the draft proposing that users save messages for three months had been withdrawn, as officials hurried to distance themselves from the idea. ''I wish to make it clear that it is just a draft and not the view of the government,'' said Ravi Shankar Prasad, the minister of communications and information technology.   Internet policy activists discovered the draft on a government website late last week and began to lampoon it online as ''absurd.'' One offered the example of an iPhone, which automatically encrypts messages.   ''They can't intentionally want people to copy and paste every message a person gets on their iPhone onto another device,'' said Pranesh Prakash, a policy director at the Center for Internet and Society in Bangalore.   The draft, which was put forward by a committee of unidentified experts in the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, also overlooked the fact that most Indians use cellphones with very little storage space, said Nikhil Pahwa, the editor of MediaNama.com, which covers digital media in India.   ''It is incomprehensible how they would have expected users to keep their messages in plain-text format,'' he said. ''And I don't think that anyone can argue that keeping data in a plain-text format makes it secure.''   Mr. Pahwa said the proposal resembled one that requires telecom operators to keep records of text messages for 90 days.   An official in the Communications Ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media, said the expert committee had been convened to formulate a policy on the ''phenomenal rise'' in encrypted communication over the Internet.   He said the committee had intended to require social media platforms and messaging apps, like WhatsApp and Viber, to save plain-text versions of messages and did not intend to impose that burden on individual users.   ''It was interpreted by the netizens as 'you and I,' '' the official said. He added that that interpretation was misleading.   But that version of the requirement would also be ''outrageous,'' Mr. Prakash said. For example, WhatsApp uses ''end-to-end'' encryption and does not save communications between users or have access to plain text, he said.   Mr. Prakash said that as officials revised the proposal, the government should reach out to ''experts in cryptography and human rights.''   ''This is a very crucial combination of three rights -- the right to security, the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy,'' he said.   On television, spokesmen for Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party found themselves debating their counterparts from the opposition Indian National Congress Party, one of whom remarked that ''tomorrow they will start demanding that you videograph what has been going on in your bedroom for the past 90 days.''   The Bharatiya Janata Party's national spokeswoman, Shaina Nana Chudasama, better known here as Shaina NC, responded with some exasperation.    ''I don't know why we have to have this hue and cry,'' she said. ''Our prime minister believes in absolute freedom on social media.''     "
Antiterrorism Law Expands China's Surveillance Power,"BEIJING -- China's legislature approved an antiterrorism law on Sunday after months of international controversy, including criticism from human rights groups, business lobbies and President Obama. Critics had said that the draft version of the law used a recklessly broad definition of terrorism, gave the government new censorship powers and authorized state access to sensitive commercial data.    The government argued that the measures were needed to prevent terrorist attacks. Opponents countered that the new powers could be abused to monitor peaceful citizens and steal technological secrets.    In the end, the approved law published by state media dropped demands in the draft version that would have required Internet companies and other technology suppliers to hand over encryption codes and other sensitive data for official vetting before they went into use.   But the law still requires that companies hand over technical information and help with decryption when the police or state security agents demand it for investigating or preventing terrorist cases.   Telecommunication and Internet service providers ''shall provide technical interfaces, decryption and other technical support and assistance to public security and state security agencies when they are following the law to avert and investigate terrorist activities,'' says the law.   ''Not only in China, but also in many places internationally, growing numbers of terrorists are using the Internet to promote and incite terrorism, and are using the Internet to organize, plan and carry out terrorist acts,'' an official, Li Shouwei, said at a news conference in Beijing.   The approval by the legislature, which is controlled by the Communist Party, came as Beijing has become increasingly jittery about antigovernment violence, especially in the ethnically divided region of Xinjiang in western China, where members of the Uighur minority have been at growing odds with the authorities.   Chinese leaders have ordered security forces to be on alert against a possible terrorist attack of the kind that devastated Paris in November.   Over the weekend, the shopping neighborhood of Sanlitun in Beijing was under reinforced guard by People's Armed Police troops after several foreign embassies, including that of the United States, warned that there were heightened security risks there around Christmas.   In addition, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday that it would expel a French journalist, Ursula Gauthier, for a report that suggested the Chinese government's unyielding policies were stoking violence by Uighurs in Xinjiang.   Uighurs are a Turkic ethnic minority, largely Sunni Muslim, who have become ever more discontented with controls on their religion and culture and with an influx into Xinjiang of ethnic Han migrants. The government says that violent acts by disaffected Uighurs have been inspired and instigated by international extremist groups, but critics say the conflict arises from homegrown disaffection.   In March of last year, Uighur assailants used knives to slash to death 29 people at a train station in Kunming, a city in southwest China. Last month, the government in Xinjiang said Chinese security forces had killed 28 people who were accused of orchestrating an attack on a coal mine that killed 16 people.   Human rights groups have warned that the law will give even more intrusive powers to the Chinese government, which already has broad, virtually unchecked authority to monitor and detain citizens and to demand information from companies and Internet services.   ''While the Chinese authorities do have a legitimate duty in safeguarding their citizens from violent attacks, passing this law will have some negative repercussions for human rights,'' said William Nee, a researcher on China for Amnesty International who is based in Hong Kong, via email.   ''Essentially, this law could give the authorities even more tools in censoring unwelcome information and crafting their own narrative in how the 'war on terror' is being waged,'' Mr. Nee said.   International companies that use encrypted technology in China had been worried by provisions in the draft law that would have required them to hand over code and other information so that the authorities could monitor users. The law could affect multinational companies like Cisco, IBM and Apple, all of which have big stakes in China.   ''These companies have been dealing with this increased, let's call it oversight, for the last two or three years,'' said Scott D. Livingston, a lawyer who works for Simone IP Services, a consulting firm in Hong Kong, and who has followed the discussions over the law. With the antiterrorism law, Mr. Livingston said, ''from the government's perspective, you have a stronger basis to request this access.''   In January, foreign business groups wrote to President Xi Jinping to voice collective unease about China's Internet policies, including the draft legislation, which could have required handing over sensitive data and commercial secrets.   In an interview with Reuters in early March, Mr. Obama criticized the proposed legislation and similar initiatives by the Chinese government, and warned that technology companies would not go along with the intrusive demands laid out in the draft law.   A few days before the antiterrorism law passed, Hong Lei, a spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular news briefing that criticism from the Obama administration was unfounded.   Mr. Li, the criminal law expert with the National People's Congress, insisted that the new law was no reason for multinationals to be alarmed. ''These rules will not affect the ordinary business activities of the firms concerned,'' he said.    "
Freeing a PC From Malware,"Freeing a PC From Malware Q. How do I find out if my PC has a bot, and if so, how do I fix it? A. If your PC is showing symptoms of having a ''bot'' (a software robot controlled by another person or application), you should scan it with a reputable security program and remove any malware found. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and Panda Free Antivirus are among the free options around if you do not have a more full-featured paid program in mind. Malicious software can hijack a computer's processing power and Internet connection. It does so to send spam, perform remote attacks or do other invasive chores -- and it can tax a system's resources.  Your PC may be infected if you notice certain behavior; for instance, that your operating system and Internet-connection speed are slower than usual. Pop-up advertisements littering the screen, frequent system crashes, unexplained error messages or the inability to update software are other clues. Some Internet providers, like Comcast, may also alert you if your computer hosts a bot. Microsoft has a Safety Scanner page and other free malware-fighting tools for Windows at www.microsoft.com/security.

As solid-state drives are very stable and have no moving parts, is it necessary to do backups? If so, how frequently would you recommend doing so? I have no particularly important material except for family photos on the hard drive. A. Solid-state drives -- which use a type of memory similar to that found in portable flash drives -- lack the motorized magnetic platters and other moving parts used by mechanical hard drives, but they are not impervious to failure. Sudden power losses and other electronic problems can kill a solid-state drive, and data recovery can be difficult. Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, even reported a dead solid-state drive a few years ago. If you want peace of mind about your family photos and other files in your computer, you should back up the solid-state drive just as you would a mechanical hard drive -- and as regularly. Although you need to provide a backup drive, your operating system is likely to include backup software to use with it. Windows 8.1 includes a File History program for backing up personal folders and Mac OS X comes with Apple's Time Machine software, a basic backup program. Plenty of third-party backup programs are also available, as well as online backup services that store data on remote servers. TIP OF THE WEEK Twitter's built-in search feature lets you use hashtags, names and other keywords to seek out public tweets from other Twitter users around the Internet. The search tool (available at the top of your Twitter account's webpage or under the magnifying glass icon in the mobile apps) comes in handy when you are following a particular topic or a continuing news story. You can even filter your search results according to people, photos, news and other criteria by clicking the options on the left side of the webpage, or tapping the tiny slider icon in the app's search-title bar. If there are certain topics you want to check regularly, you can also save your searches and rerun them with a click or a tap. To create and save a search, log into your Twitter account, enter your keywords and click the Save button in the top-right corner of your results page. The next time you click or tap the Search icon, your saved searches (up to 25 of them) appear in a list. Just select the search you want to run again to reel in the latest tweets on that topic. "
Fighting Back Against Malware,"Q. My husband recently asked me to download a boat manual onto my Dell laptop. Not only did the manual not load, but all of a sudden I am getting too many pop-ups that make working from my laptop all but impossible. And there's now a search tool bar atop the screen and instead of Mozilla, the default page is Yahoo search. Is there a solution? A. The flurry of pop-up ads, the unfamiliar search toolbar and the changed home page on your computer are all symptoms of infection by malicious software -- or at least aggressive adware. When trying to download the boat manual, you may have unknowingly agreed to install the new browser toolbar and make other changes to your PC, or your computer may have simply been hijacked by a rogue website.     At any rate, an anti-malware program can probably clean up your PC by removing the unwanted toolbar and other annoyances -- just install and run the software, then have it delete any malware it finds on your computer. Microsoft has a security scanner and general guidelines for keeping a computer protected from invasive programs at  www.microsoft.com/security . The company also has a free malicious software removal tool that can be downloaded at  bit.ly/19RSCsO .   If you want to look around for other solutions, many other companies also make antivirus and anti-malware programs that may suit your preferences better. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, AVG Free and Avast are just some of the options available, with both free and paid versions of their security products. Mozilla also has its own page of tips for removing malware from the Firefox browser at  http://mzl.la/1xKrH3p .   Backups Everywhere on iOS Devices   Q. I've been backing up my iPhone to iCloud and I just got a new iPad. Instead of downloading all the same apps to the iPad, can I just put the content of the backed-up iPhone on the tablet?   A. According to Apple, you can put data backed up from one iOS gadget onto another. All the hardware in the mix, though, needs to be running the same version of the iOS software. On iPhones running the older iOS 7 system, photos in the Camera Roll are not restored to other devices from the iCloud backup.   You may also find that not every program on your iPhone shows up on the iPad if you choose to put a backup of the phone's contents on your tablet. While apps that are universal and compatible with both devices should be installed on the iPad, that will not be the case for apps with versions written specifically for the iPhone.   TIP OF THE WEEK If the long winter has you dreaming of a place without weekly snowstorms, the recently revamped Google Flights service might help you find an affordable -- yet warmer -- place to spend a week. Like Kayak, Expedia, Orbitz and other travel sites, Google Flights lets you plug in a destination and search for flights across multiple airlines at once. In addition to showing the range of fares to a particular destination, Google Flights also suggests ''best flights''; these match your search with a combination of both price and expediency (like a nonstop connection).   If you are looking for a low-cost fare and have flexible travel dates, the calendar feature in Google Flights displays the lowest fare for your destination each day of the month; you can also use the filters for nearby airports, number of stops and other factors to see how the prices change on the calendar. If you are not sure where you want to go, Google Flights lists popular destinations and has a world map that displays the lowest fares to cities around the world from your current location.
